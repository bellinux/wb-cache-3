Even though many animals are {{now living in}} these changed environments, the effect {{light pollution}} has on animal behavior is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of light pollution on nocturnal vigilance in <b>peahens</b> (Pavo cristatus). Captive <b>peahens</b> were exposed to either artificial lighting or natural lighting at night. We employed a novel method to record their vigilance behavior by attaching accelerometers to their heads and continuously monitoring their large head movements. We found that light pollution significantly increases nocturnal vigilance in <b>peahens.</b> Furthermore, the birds faced a trade-off between vigilance and sleep at night: <b>peahens</b> that were more vigilant spent less time sleeping. Given the choice, <b>peahens</b> preferred to roost away from high levels of artificial lighting but showed no preference for roosting without artificial lighting or {{with low levels of}} artificial lighting. Our study demonstrates that light pollution can have a substantial impact on animal behavior that can potentially result in fitness consequences...|$|R

500|$|In 1975, Amotz Zahavi {{proposed}} a verbal model for how signal costs could constrain cheating and stabilize an [...] "honest" [...] correlation between observed signals and unobservable qualities, {{based on an}} analogy to sports handicapping systems. He called this idea the handicap principle. The purpose of a sports handicapping system is to reduce disparities in performance, making the contest more competitive. In a handicap race, intrinsically faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles. [...] Similarly, in amateur golf, better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores. This creates correlations between the handicap and unhandicapped performance, and if the handicaps work as they are supposed to, between the handicap and handicapped performance. If you knew nothing about two race horses or two amateur golfers except their handicaps, you could infer which {{is most likely to}} win: the horse with the bigger weight handicap, and the golfer with the smaller stroke handicap. By analogy, if peacock 'tails' (large tail covert feathers) act as a handicapping system, and a <b>peahen</b> knew nothing about two peacocks but the sizes of their tails, she could [...] "infer" [...] that the peacock with the bigger tail has greater unobservable intrinsic quality. Display costs can include extrinsic social costs, in the form of testing and punishment by rivals, as well as intrinsic production costs. Another example given in textbooks is the extinct Irish elk, Megaloceros giganteus. The male Irish elk's enormous antlers could perhaps have evolved as displays of ability to overcome handicap, though biologists point out that if the handicap is inherited, its genes ought to be selected against.|$|E

The vigilance levels of <b>peahens</b> were unaffected by exposure to noise pollution within trials. Furthermore, the <b>peahens</b> exhibited no preference for roosting farther or closer to noise pollution.

2500|$|There {{are several}} colour {{mutations}} of Indian peafowl. These very rarely {{occur in the}} wild, but selective breeding has made them common in captivity. The black-shouldered or Japanned mutation was initially considered as a subspecies P. c. nigripennis (or even a species), [...] and was a topic of some interest during Darwin's time.

Young birds with the nigripennis mutation are creamy white with fulvous tipped wings.

The long train feathers (and tarsal spurs) of the male develop only after the second year of life. Fully developed trains are found in birds older than four years. In northern India, these begin to develop each February and are moulted at the end of August. The moult of the flight feathers may be spread out across the year.|$|E

50|$|Although an {{intricate}} display catches a peahen's attention, the redundant signal hypothesis {{also plays a}} crucial role in keeping this attention on the peacock's display. The redundant signal hypothesis explains that whilst each signal that a male projects is about the same quality, the addition of multiple signals enhances the reliability of that mate. This idea also suggests that the success of multiple signalling is not only due to the repetitiveness of the signal, but also of multiple receivers of the signal. In the peacock species, males congregate a communal display during breeding season and the <b>peahens</b> observe. Peacocks first defend their territory through intra-sexual behaviour, defending their areas from intruders. They fight for areas within the congregation to display a strong front for the <b>peahens.</b> Central positions are usually taken by older, dominant males, which influences mating success. Certain morphological and behavioural traits come in to play during inter and intra-sexual selection, which include train length for territory acquisition and visual and vocal displays involved in mate choice by <b>peahens.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Prominent in many cultures, {{the peacock}} {{has been used}} in {{numerous}} iconic representations, including being designated the national bird of India in 1963. The peacock, known as mayura in Sanskrit, has enjoyed a fabled place in India since and is frequently depicted in temple art, mythology, poetry, folk music and traditions. A Sankrit derivation of mayura is from the root mi for kill and said to mean [...] "killer of snakes". Many Hindu deities are associated with the bird, Krishna is often depicted with a feather in his headband, while worshippers of Shiva associate the bird as the steed of the God of war, Kartikeya (also known as Skanda or Murugan). A story in the Uttara Ramayana describes the head of the Devas, Indra, who unable to defeat Ravana, sheltered under the wing of peacock and later blessed it with a [...] "thousand eyes" [...] and fearlessness from serpents. Another story has Indra who after being cursed with a thousand ulcers was transformed into a peacock with a thousand eyes. In Buddhist philosophy, the peacock represents wisdom. Peacock feathers are used in many rituals and ornamentation. Peacock motifs are widespread in Indian temple architecture, old coinage, textiles and continue to be used in many modern items of art and utility. A folk belief found in many parts of India is that the peacock does not copulate with the <b>peahen</b> but that she is impregnated by other means. The stories vary and include the idea that the peacock looks at its ugly feet and cries whereupon the tears are fed on by the <b>peahen</b> causing it to be orally impregnated while other variants incorporate sperm transfer from beak to beak. Similar ideas have also been ascribed to Indian crow species. In Greek mythology the origin of the peacocks plumage is explained in the tale of Hera and Argus. The main figure of the Yazidi religion Yezidism, Melek Taus, is most commonly depicted as a peacock. Peacock motifs are widely used even today such as in the logos of the US NBC and the PTV television networks and the Sri Lankan Airlines.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{striking}} parallels between cooperative behavior and exaggerated sexual ornaments displayed by some animals, particularly certain birds, such as, amongst others, the peacock. Both are costly in fitness terms, {{and both are}} generally conspicuous to {{other members of the}} population or species. This led Amotz Zahavi to suggest that both might be fitness signals rendered evolutionarily stable by his handicap principle. If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, the signal has to be evolutionarily costly. Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality. Zahavi borrowed the term [...] "handicap principle" [...] from sports handicapping systems. These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse handicap race, provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in amateur golf, better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a <b>peahen,</b> for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by his increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is his health. A cooperative act is, by definition, similarly costly (e.g. helping raise the young at the nest of an unrelated pair of birds versus producing and raising one's own offspring). It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case, cooperation is evolutionarily stabilized by sexual selection.|$|E

60|$|In {{these two}} cases the great {{length of the}} tail-feathers must be in some degree {{inconvenient}} to the female; and as in both species the tail-feathers of the female are somewhat shorter {{than those of the}} male, it might be argued that their full development had been prevented through natural selection. Judging from these cases, if with the <b>peahen,</b> the development of the tail had been checked only when it became inconveniently or dangerously long, she would have acquired a much longer tail than she actually possesses; for her tail is not nearly so long, relatively to the size of her body, as that of many female pheasants, nor longer than that of the female turkey. It must also be borne in mind, that in accordance with this view as soon as the tail of the <b>peahen</b> became dangerously long, and its development was consequently checked, she would have continually reacted on her male progeny, and thus have prevented the peacock from acquiring his present magnificent train. We may therefore infer that the length of the tail in the peacock and its shortness in the <b>peahen</b> are the result of the requisite variations in the male having been from the first transmitted to the male offspring alone.|$|E

60|$|Many {{analogous}} cases {{could be}} advanced; for instance the plumes on the head, which are generally {{longer in the}} male than in the female, sometimes of equal length in both sexes, and occasionally absent in the female,—these several cases sometimes occurring in {{the same group of}} birds. It would be difficult to account for a difference of this kind between the sexes on the principle of the female having been benefited by possessing a slightly shorter crest than the male, and its consequent diminution or complete suppression through natural selection. But I will take a more favourable case, namely, the length of the tail. The long train of the peacock would have been not only inconvenient but dangerous to the <b>peahen</b> during the period of incubation and whilst accompanying her young. Hence there is not the least à priori improbability in the development of her tail having been checked through natural selection. But the females of various pheasants, which apparently are exposed on their open nests to as much danger as the <b>peahen,</b> have tails of considerable length. The females as well as the males of the Menura superba have long tails, and they build a domed nest, which is a great anomaly in so large a bird. Naturalists have wondered how the female Menura could manage her tail during incubation; but it is now known[204] that she “enters the nest head first, and then turns round with her tail sometimes over her back, but more often bent round by her side. Thus in time the tail becomes quite askew, and is a tolerable guide to the length of time the bird has been sitting.” Both sexes of an Australian kingfisher (Tanysiptera sylvia) have the middle tail-feathers greatly lengthened; and as the female makes her nest in a hole, these feathers become, as I am informed by Mr. R. B. Sharpe, much crumpled during nidification.|$|E

60|$|Now if {{we might}} {{assume that the}} males in the present class have lost some of that ardour which is usual to their sex, so {{that they no longer}} search eagerly for the females; or, if we might assume that the females have become much more {{numerous}} than the males—and in the case of one Indian Turnix the females are said to be “much more commonly met with than the males”[254]—then it is not improbable that the females would have been led to court the males, instead of being courted by them. This indeed is the case to a certain extent, with some birds, as we have seen with the <b>peahen,</b> wild turkey, and certain kinds of grouse. Taking as our guide the habits of most male birds, the greater size and strength and the extraordinary pugnacity of the females of the Turnix and Emu, must mean that they endeavour to drive away rival females, in order to gain possession of the male; and on this view, all the facts become clear; for the males would probably be most charmed or excited by the females which were the most attractive to them by their brighter colours, other ornaments, or vocal powers. Sexual selection would then soon do its work, steadily adding to the attractions of the females; the males and the young being left not at all, or but little modified.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{when two}} men are put into competition, or {{a man with a}} woman, who possess every mental quality in the same perfection, with the {{exception}} that the one has higher energy, perseverance, and courage, this one will generally become more eminent, whatever the object may be, and will gain the victory.[400] He may be said to possess genius—for genius has been declared by a great authority to be patience; and patience, in this sense, means unflinching, undaunted perseverance. But this view of genius is perhaps deficient; for without the higher powers of the imagination and reason, no eminent success in many subjects can be gained. But these latter as well as the former faculties will have been developed in man, partly through sexual selection,—that is, through the contest of rival males, and partly through natural selection,—that is, from success in the general struggle for life; and as in both cases the struggle will have been during maturity, the characters thus gained will have been transmitted more fully to the male than to the female offspring. Thus man has ultimately become superior to woman. It is, indeed, fortunate that the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes has commonly prevailed throughout the whole class of mammals; otherwise it is probable that man would have become as superior in mental endowment to woman, as the peacock is in ornamental plumage to the <b>peahen.</b>|$|E
