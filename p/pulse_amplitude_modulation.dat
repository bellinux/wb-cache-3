40|$|International audienceHigher order {{quadrature}} <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (HOQAM) {{is one of}} the key technologies used {{in advanced}} mobile communication systems to achieve high data rates. However, in such systems, performance evaluation can be very complicated and time consuming due to the increase of constellation size. As a solution, a QAM scheme is seen as a combination of two <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> (PAM). Nevertheless, the system remains complex especially with very high constellation sizes. Therefore, Monte-Carlo simulation method is impractical to obtain the expected system performance. In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical performance evaluation methodology for a PAM modulation. Our approach is based on the probability density estimation using kernel technique in joint application with crossvalidation (CV) criterion. We derive both semi-analytical symbol error probability (SEP) and semi-analytical bit error probability (BEP) for several modulation schemes. Simulation results show that, in terms of SEP and BEP metrics, our technique is accurate compared with theoretical error probabilities...|$|R

Although data rates around 100 kbps are enough for crucial data transmission, {{it may be useful}} to reach a few megabits per second for other applications like networking. Such data rates can be reached by using appropriate modulations and clock rates. In this paper, three forms of <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> (PAM) are compared in a vehicular context: on-off keying (OOK), PAM- 4 and generalized space-shift keying (GSSK). A prototype based on off-the-shelf light-emitting diodes (LED) headlamps is used for static tests in straight line configuration, with an inter-vehicle distance up to 30 m, and curves of minimum radius 100 m and inter-vehicle distance of 10 m. These tests show that OOK and GSSK are the most interesting modulations for highway platooning applications. OOK provides indeed a good mobility while remaining simple to implement. A 1 Mbps link of BER below 10 − 6 is thus demonstrated. In GSSK, the data rate reaches 2 Mbps for an equivalent BER. These performances are obtained by using, in particular, two spatially distinct receivers, which limits strongly the complexity of GSSK decoding...|$|R
