40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>bundling</b> is an {{increasingly}} important marketing strategy within many industries, and consumer influence on companies’ ranges of <b>product</b> <b>bundles</b> is, thus, becoming an important issue. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>product</b> <b>bundling</b> strategies consumers are exposed to by some selected companies in the Swedish automobile, travel and banking industries. Bundling strategies were considered in relation to business orientation as well as the consumer’s potential to influence the <b>product</b> <b>bundles</b> offered by these companies. Fourteen qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with senior representatives from the three sectors. Interview respondents were selected in cooperation with their respective companies. Results underwent interpretative analysis, and the findings indicated that business orientation is linked to <b>product</b> <b>bundling</b> techniques and to the type of customer influence on <b>product</b> <b>bundling.</b> Consumers were exposed to mixed and complementary bundling strategies, and customers of companies that apply a market orientation were found to have greater opportunities to influence <b>product</b> <b>bundles</b> directly, whereas companies that apply a production-oriented approach were less able to respond to their customers’ wishes.

40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>bundling</b> is a {{marketing}} strategy that concerns offering several products for sale as one combined product. Current technology mainly {{focuses on the}} creation of static bundles, which involves pre-computing <b>product</b> <b>bundles</b> and associated discounts. However, due to the inherent dynamism and constant change of current and potential customer information, as is particularly the case in enterprise networks, static <b>product</b> <b>bundles</b> prove to be inefficient. In this paper an approach for dynamic generation of personalized <b>product</b> <b>bundles</b> using agents is proposed. Our approach involves creating bundles based on substitution and complementarity associations between product items, and subsequently ranking the produced bundles according to individual preferences and history of each customer.

Ad-hoc marketing practices such as <b>product</b> <b>bundling,</b> may provide the environment under which brand managers may lose control over their product’s brand image. This may lead to brand confusion, which may affect the consumers’ ability to recall information from memory. The conceptual model argued in this paper explores three implications for brand image: (1) whether associative memory nodes are transferred from a consumer’s perception of <b>product</b> <b>bundling</b> to the brand image of the product contained in the bundle; (2) how modifiers may influence the transfer of associations; and (3) whether unique associations emerge because consumers view <b>product</b> <b>bundles</b> as utility and some product classes as pleasure.
