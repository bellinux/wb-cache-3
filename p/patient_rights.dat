Libraries, universities, open access supporters, consumer health advocacy groups, and <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> organizations have applauded PubMed Central, and hope to see similar public access repositories developed by other federal funding agencies so to freely share any research publications that were the result of taxpayer support.|$|E
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> in healthcare, special {{attention has been given}} to the concept of <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in Iran. Iranian <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter has been compiled with a novel and comprehensive approach. This charter aims to elucidate rights of recipients of health services as well as observing ethical standards in medicine. This paper presents the Iranian <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter. Based on a study done from 2007 to 2009, the charter has been finalized through an extensive consultation involving all stakeholders, patients, physicians, nurses, lawyers, patient associations and health policy makers. The developed charter was adopted by the Ministry of Health in December 2009. Iranian <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter has been formulated in the framework of 5 chapters and 37 articles including vision and an explanatory note. The five chapters concern right to receiving appropriate services, right to access desired and enough information, right to choose and decide freely about receiving healthcare, right to privacy and confidentiality, and finally right to access an efficient system of dealing with complaints which have been explained in 14, 9, 7, 4 and 3 articles, respectively.   The paper concludes that, adopting the <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter is a valuable measure to meet patient's rights; however, a serious challenge is how to implement and acculturate observing <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> in practice in our healthcare system in Iran...|$|R

Methods Awareness and practice of the new <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> law in Lithuanian health care institutions was explored through a survey of 255 medical staff and 451 patients in the four Kaunas city medical units in 2002.

500|$|One {{week before}} the January special election, a {{controversy}} arose over a Coakley approved television ad. [...] The ad referenced the conscientious objector amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients' rights. [...] This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care (the morning-after pill) to rape victims if they objected due to a religious belief. After the amendment failed, Brown did vote for the main bill which, along with other <b>patient</b> <b>rights,</b> requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care. Coakley's ad featured a male voice that said, [...] "Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims," [...] over the ad's graphic which had the words, [...] "Deny care to rape victims." [...] Brown's daughter Ayla called the Coakley ad [...] "completely inaccurate and misleading", and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim.

40|$|Background and Objectives: <b>Patient’s</b> <b>rights</b> {{are one of}} the pivots {{to define}} the {{standard}} clinical care programs. <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter has been compiled and applied for defending human rights, protecting honor and dignity of patient, and ensuring that patients receive treatment without discrimination especially in case of medical emergencies. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the contents of <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter with those of the Holy Quran and Ahadith. Methods: To conduct this library, descriptive study, first, the principles of the Charter were drawn and then the Quran and relevant literature indexed in different databases were reviewed. Then, the points in question were written down, classified, and compared to those of the Charter. Results: In general, the principles of the Charter represented in nine terms which were consistent with several verses of the Quran and Ahadith. These terms consisted of human dignity, justice and avoidance of injustice, beneficence, knowledge value, moral virtue, privacy and confidentiality, ownership, authority, and life-saving and life-sustaining. Conclusion: All of the concepts of <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter can generally conform to the verses of Holy Quran and Ahadith. Since religious beliefs can play effective role in performance of health care professionals regarding <b>patient's</b> <b>rights,</b> it is recommended to apply the Quranic proofs of the <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter, which are in line with the Charter, for better performance.  ...|$|R

2500|$|Wearing or {{displaying}} a pink ribbon {{has been criticized}} by the opponents of this practice {{as a kind of}} slacktivism, because it has no practical positive effect.

[...] Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and pink consumption distracts society from the lack of progress on preventing and curing breast cancer. [...] It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and objectifying women and their breasts. [...] Breast Cancer Action launched the [...] "Think Before You Pink" [...] campaign, and said that businesses have co-opted the pink campaign to promote products that cause breast cancer, such as alcoholic beverages.|$|E

2500|$|Patient advocacy, as a hospital-based practice, {{grew out}} of this <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> movement: [...] patient advocates (often called patient representatives) were needed to protect and enhance the rights of {{patients}} {{at a time when}} hospital stays were long and acute conditions—heart disease, stroke and cancer—contributed to the boom in hospital growth. Health care reformers at the time critiqued this growth by quoting Roemer's Law: a built hospital bed is a bed likely to be filled. [...] And more radical health analysts coined the term [...] "health empires" [...] to refer to the increasing power of these large teaching institutions that linked hospital care with medical education, putting one {{in the service of the}} other, arguably losing the patient-centered focus in the process. [...] It was not surprising, then, that patient advocacy, like patient care, focused on the hospital stay, while health advocacy took a more critical perspective of a health care system in which power was concentrated on the top in large medical teaching centers and a dominance of the medical profession.|$|E
