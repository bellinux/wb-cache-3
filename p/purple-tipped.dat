40|$|General Description: A {{perennial}} {{growing in}} dense tufts with woolly stems that reach up to 1 to 3 in. (1 to 8 cm) in height. Coarse, stiff hairs cover the scale-like bract that sits atop the stem. The persistent leaves are basal, mostly three-clefted, and covered above with coarse stiff hairs. The flower heads are solitary with a base composed of 15 to 25 purplish or <b>purple-tipped</b> bracts. The bracts taper {{towards the end}} and are densely covered with long, white hair. The 15 to 30 ray florets per inflorescence can range in color from white to blue to purplish-blue. The achenes can be hairy or glabrous and contain 15 to 20 bristles in the pappus. Identification Tips: In the past, this species was placed with Erigeron compositus var. discoideus or E. lanatus. However, recent studies by Douglas and Packer (1988) have found that E. salishii is differentiated by persistent, three-lobed leaves that are of similar shape and size. The species is also distinguishable by its densely clustered habit. Phenology: Identifiable in July. Range: E. salishii is known from central Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and Okanogan and Chelan counties of the North Cascades range in Washington. Habitat: In Washington, the species occurs primarily on dry scree slopes and sedge meadows in the alpine zone and ridgetops with granite, rock, and loess soils at an elevation of 6600 to 9000 ft (2012 to 2743 m). Ecology: Distribution for the species tends to be scattered in small, protected pockets. The habit in which the plant is found tends to be slightly less steep than surrounding areas with unstable soils. State Status Comments: The two known populations occur in the Wenatchee National Forest and the Okanogan National Forest. The species is also critically imperiled in British Columbia. Inventory Needs: Little inventory has been done for the species. Known distribution of Erigeron salishi...|$|E
