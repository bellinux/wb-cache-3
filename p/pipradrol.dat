40|$|Trace amine-associated {{receptor}} 1 (TAAR 1) {{has been}} implicated in the behavioral effects of amphetamine-type stimulant drugs in rodents. TAAR 1 has also been suggested as a target for novel medications to treat psychostimulant addiction. We previously reported that binding affinities at TAAR 1 can differ between structural analogs of psychostimulants, and species differences have been observed. In this study, we complement our previous findings with additional substances and the determination of functional activation potencies. In summary, we present here pharmacological in vitro profiles of 101 psychoactive substances at human, rat, and mouse TAAR 1. p-Tyramine, β-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine were included as endogenous comparator compounds. Functional cAMP measurements and radioligand displacement assays were conducted with human embryonic kidney 293 cells that expressed human, rat, or mouse TAAR 1. Most amphetamines, phenethylamine, and aminoindanes exhibited potentially physiologically relevant rat and mouse TAAR 1 activation (EC 50 10 µM) binding properties at TAAR 1. <b>Pipradrols,</b> including methylphenidate, exhibited no affinity for TAAR 1. We found considerable species differences in activity at TAAR 1 among the highly active ligands, with a rank order of rat > mouse > human. This characterization provides information about the pharmacological profile of psychoactive substances. The species differences emphasize the relevance of clinical studies to translationally complement rodent studies {{on the role of}} TAAR 1 activity for psychoactive substances...|$|R
40|$|Novel psychoactive {{substances}} are newly used {{designer drugs}} ("internet drugs", "research chemicals", "legal highs") potentially posing similar health risks to classic illicit substances. Chemically, many novel psychoactive substances {{can be classified}} as phenethylamines, amphetamines, synthetic cathinones, piperazines, pipradrols/piperidines, aminoindanes benzofurans, and tryptamines. Pharmacologically, these substances interact with various monoaminergic targets. Typically, stimulants inhibit the transport of dopamine and noradrenaline (<b>pipradrols,</b> pyrovalerone cathinones) or induce the release of these monoamines (amphetamines and methamphetamine-like cathinones), entactogens predominantly enhance serotonin release (phenylpiperazines, aminoindanes, para-substituted amphetamines, and MDMA-like cathinones) similar to MDMA (ecstasy), and hallucinogens (tryptamines, hallucinogenic phenethylamines) are direct agonists at serotonergic 5 -HT 2 A receptors. Synthetic cannabinoids are another group of novel substances which all act as agonists at the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor similar to THC but are chemically diverse. In particular, the relative serotonergic vs dopaminergic activity (determined by the dopamine/serotonin transporter inhibition ratio in vitro) can be helpful to predict the desired psychotropic but also the toxic effects of novel substances {{as well as their}} potential for addiction. Although the use of novel psychoactive substances mostly produces minor or moderate poisonings, serious complications occur. Serotonergic drugs (entactogens and hallucinogens) are associated with acute serotonin syndrome, hyperthermia, seizures, and hyponatremia. Dopaminergic drugs are highly addictive and acute toxicity includes prolonged stimulation, insomnia, agitation, and psychosis. Agitation, anxiety, paranoia, hypertension, and rarely myocardial infarction and renal failure are seen with synthetic cannabinoids. Treatment is supportive...|$|R

50|$|Desoxypipradrol's {{structural}} {{similarity to}} <b>pipradrol</b> {{makes it possible}} {{that it would be}} considered a controlled substance analogue in several countries such as Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pipradrol</b> was {{developed}} in the 1940s, and found use initially for treating obesity. It was subsequently used for the treatment of a variety of other conditions such as narcolepsy, ADHD, and most particularly for counteracting the symptoms of senile dementia, this being the only application for which it is still used medically. <b>Pipradrol</b> proved useful for these applications as its relatively mild stimulant effects gave it a good safety profile compared to stronger stimulants. It was also studied as an adjutant treatment for depression and schizophrenia although it was never widely used for these purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pipradrol</b> {{was made}} illegal in many {{countries}} in the late 1970s, {{at the same time}} as many other drugs which had a history of abuse. The relatively mild stimulant effects of <b>pipradrol</b> meant that it was scheduled under the less restrictive classes in most countries (i.e. Class C in United Kingdom and New Zealand) but was still considered of sufficient abuse potential to be made an illegal drug. It is now an obscure compound that is virtually unknown as an illicit drug of abuse, but is still used for some scientific research, often as a comparison drug for testing other stimulants against.|$|E
50|$|Desoxypipradrol {{is closely}} related on a {{structural}} level to the compounds methylphenidate and <b>pipradrol,</b> all three of which share a similar pharmacological action. Of these three piperidines, desoxypipradrol has the longest elimination half-life, {{as it is a}} highly lipophilic molecule lacking polar functional groups that are typically targeted by metabolic enzymes, giving it an extremely long duration of action when compared to most psychostimulants. Methylphenidate, on the other hand, is a short-acting compound, as it possesses a methyl-ester moiety that is easily cleaved, forming a highly polar acid group, while <b>pipradrol</b> is intermediate in duration, possessing a hydroxyl group which can be conjugated (e.g. with glucuronide) to increase its hydrophilicity and facilitate excretion, but no easily metabolized groups.|$|E
50|$|Dosage {{is between}} 0.5 and 4 milligrams per day, {{typically}} {{taken as a}} single dose in the morning as the long duration of effects of <b>pipradrol</b> (up to 12 hours) means insomnia {{can be a problem}} especially if it is used at higher doses or taken too late in the day.|$|E

50|$|Azacyclonol (trade names Ataractan, Calmeran, Frenoton, Frenquel, Psychosan), {{also known}} as γ-pipradrol, is a drug which is an ataractive; an agent which diminishes {{hallucinations}} in psychotic individuals. It has also been called a tranquilizer and antipsychotic, though these definitions are not accurate as it does not actually possess such properties. Despite being a positional isomer of <b>pipradrol,</b> {{it is not a}} psychostimulant, and instead has mild depressant effects.|$|E
50|$|Desoxypipradrol was {{developed}} by the pharmaceutical company CIBA (now called Novartis) in the 1950s, and researched for applications such as the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD; however, it was dropped from development after the related drug methylphenidate {{was developed}} by the same company. Methylphenidate was felt to be the superior drug for treating ADHD due to its shorter duration of action and more predictable pharmacokinetics, and while desoxypipradrol was researched for other applications (such as facilitation of rapid recovery from anaesthesia), its development was not continued. The hydroxylated derivative <b>pipradrol</b> was, however, introduced as a clinical drug indicated for depression, narcolepsy and cognitive enhancement in organic dementia.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, <b>pipradrol,</b> prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|In the cat, the pressor {{actions of}} {{noradrenaline}} and of adrenaline were generally reduced {{and that of}} tyramine was increased during infusions either of noradrenaline or of adrenaline. The increase in the response to tyramine after an infusion of noradrenaline was prevented by cocaine, methyl phenidate and <b>pipradrol.</b> <b>Pipradrol,</b> unlike its isomer azacyclonol, increased the responses to catechol amines but reduced that to tyramine. Cocaine did not prevent {{the increase in the}} noradrenaline content of cat kidney and uterus after an infusion of noradrenaline. In the pithed rat, cocaine increased the pressor response to noradrenaline but antagonized that to tyramine. Treatment of the rat with reserpine prevented the effect of cocaine on the response to tyramine but did not modify the potentiation of the response to noradrenaline. Prolonged treatment with cocaine did not lower the tissue noradrenaline levels and did not prevent the noradrenaline depletion by reserpine. It is suggested that interactions between cocaine, tyramine and noradrenaline occur at the point where noradrenaline enters its tissue store...|$|E
40|$|Aminoindanes, piperazines, and <b>pipradrol</b> {{derivatives}} are novel psychoactive substances {{found in}} "Ecstasy" tablets as replacements for 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or substances sold as "ivory wave. " The pharmacology of these MDMA- and methylphenidate-like substances is poorly known. We characterized the pharmacology of the aminoindanes 5, 6 -methylenedioxy- 2 -aminoindane (MDAI), 5 -iodoaminoindane (5 -IAI), and 2 -aminoindane (2 -AI), the piperazines meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), and 1 -benzylpiperazine (BZP), and the <b>pipradrol</b> derivatives desoxypipradrol (2 -diphenylmethylpiperidine [2 -DPMP]), diphenylprolinol (diphenyl- 2 -pyrrolidinemethanol [D 2 PM]), and methylphenidate. We investigated norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) uptake inhibition using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells that express the respective human monoamine transporters (NET, DAT, and SERT). We also evaluated the drug-induced efflux of NE, DA, and 5 -HT from monoamine-preloaded cells and the binding affinity to monoamine transporters and receptors, including trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR 1). 5 -IAI and MDAI preferentially inhibited the SERT and NET and released 5 -HT. 2 -AI interacted with the NET. BZP blocked the NET and released DA. m-CPP and TFMPP interacted with the SERT and serotonergic receptors. The <b>pipradrol</b> derivatives were potent and selective catecholamine transporter blockers without substrate releasing properties. BZP, D 2 PM, and 2 -DPMP lacked serotonergic activity and TAAR 1 binding, {{in contrast to}} the aminoindanes and phenylpiperazines. In summary, all of the substances were monoamine transporter inhibitors, but marked differences were found in their DAT vs. SERT inhibition profiles, release properties, and receptor interactions. The pharmacological profiles of D 2 PM and 2 -DPMP likely predict a high abuse liability...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} acute and chronic {{chlorpromazine}} treatment on psychomotor stimulant self-administration {{behavior in the}} Rhesus monkey were determined. Chlorpromazine treatment significantly increased the frequency of self-administration of cocaine, <b>pipradrol,</b> phenmetrazine, d -amphetamine and methylphenidate. The basis of this effect was thought to either be due to an antagonism of the reinforcing effect of these compounds or an antagonism of those actions of the psychomotor stimulants which may function in limiting their self-administration...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for resolving coeluted substances in doping control analysis was examined. PCA was applied on two GC/MS data sets. Firstly, on a urine sample spiked {{with a mixture}} of four control substances (methylphenidate, pethidine, caffeine and <b>pipradrol)</b> and secondly, on a real urine sample containing an etilefrine derivative and an artifact (BHT antioxidant), which were coeluted in the same GC peak. In both the cases clear full spectra of various component substances were extracted from the mixture spectra. The time of GC/MS analysis was significantly reduced. PCA was used in both the cases as an exploratory method of data analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between drug dosage per injection and response rate, and drug dosage per injection and total daily drug intake were ascertained in Rhesus monkeys which self-administered cocaine, <b>pipradrol,</b> methylphenidate and phenmetrazine intravenously. The study demonstrated the monkeys would self-administer {{all of these}} compounds {{over a wide range}} of dosages. Furthermore, the magnitude of reinforcement, i. e., dosage per injection, and the rate of responding in self-administering these compounds were inversely related. However, total daily drug intake was independent of the dosage per injection over a wide range of dosages. The results indicate that either the subjects can compensate for large changes in unit dosage so that daily drug intake remains stable or that a direct effect of these compounds functions in limiting their self-administration...|$|E
40|$|Using {{measures}} of locomotor activity and stereotypy, dose-response curves to several psychomotor stimulant drugs were obtained on rats reared in deprived or normal environments. At both 0. 5 and 1. 5 mg/kg d-amphetamine, the deprived rats exhibited more intense stereotyped behavior {{than the control}} rats. At 5. 0 mg/kg, both groups showed maximum response. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between the two groups in locomotor response. A similar pattern of results was found for <b>pipradrol,</b> cocaine, and apomorphine. The findings show that different social and environmental experience can modify the response to dopaminergic stimulating agents. The results also suggest that stereotyped behavior should not be considered on the same continuum as locomotor activity. These two behaviors may be mediated by different mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} some centrally-active {{and other drugs}} on the {{transmission}} of single nerve impulses through the isolated superior cervical ganglion preparation of the rabbit has been studied by recording both preganglionic and postganglionic action potentials. Block of conduction in the axon could be distinguished from block of the synaptic mechanism. The drugs {{did not appear to}} exert any one characteristic form of blocking action. A continuous spectrum of drug action linked an agent such as meprobamate which acted predominantly on the synapse to benactyzine which acted mainly by blocking axonal conduction. The drugs have been divided into three groups. Group I: hexamethonium, meprobamate, paraldehyde, amylobarbitone, methylpentynol and azacyclonal; these acted relatively selectively at the ganglion. Group II: N 714 C (the cis-isomer of chlorprothixene), prochlorperazine, methylpentynol carbamate, <b>pipradrol,</b> promethazine, perphenazine and procaine; the action of these drugs on the ganglion could be accounted for entirely in terms of their axonal depressant action. Group III: chlorprothixene, promazine, N 720 (dihydrochlorprothixene), chlorpromazine, hydroxyzine and benactyzine; these drugs also blocked axonal conduction but in addition they appeared to exert a “facilitating” action at the ganglionic synapse. The actions of adrenaline, adrenochrome, iproniazid, ergotoxine, mescaline and lysergic acid diethylamide on transmission were also studied. The implications of the modifications of ganglionic transmission produced by these drugs is discussed...|$|E
