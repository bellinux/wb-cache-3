40|$|Abstract. Recently invented {{method of}} the Reverse-Vort x Stabilization (RVS) of plasma is {{compared}} with the traditional Forward-Vortex Stabilization (FVS) of plasma. FLUENT programming package was used for numerical simulations of electrodeless <b>plasma</b> <b>torches</b> – Radio-Frequency (RF) with Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and Micro-Wave (MW). Experimental calorimetric investigations and numerical simulations were carried out to compare energetic characteristics of MW and RF inductive <b>plasma</b> <b>torches</b> with RVS and FVS. Results of investigations show that RVS is very promising for different plasma technology applications. A discrepancy between experimental and calculated resu ts is small enough {{to conclude that the}} energy losses might be reliably predicted on the design stage of electrodeless <b>plasma</b> <b>torches</b> with the both types of vortex stabilization...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Plasma</b> arc <b>torches</b> {{are being}} applied today as unique heating tools in {{industrial}} processes. The many benefits of using <b>plasma</b> <b>torches</b> are being demonstrated in different production plants and prototype equipment around the world. And the successful demonstration of this versatile, low-mass, controlled high-enthalpy, selective-atmosphere, heat source is generating new applications. Industry today is benefiting from plasma heating and {{will in the}} future derive more benefits from this proven heating technology. There are {{many different types of}} <b>plasma</b> arc <b>torches</b> available. Single torch power ratings range from 20 kilowatts to 60 megawatts. The plasma heaters at the low and high ends of the power range are employed in the universities and in the national research laboratories for basic scientific studies. The industrial sector, with its emphasis on longevity and economy, has adapted only the plasma heaters in the range from 20 k ~ to 8 mW. The operating life of plasma systems is very important in industry for economic reasons. Industrial processes that use <b>plasma</b> <b>torches</b> must be capable of many hours or weeks of continuous or cumulative operating life, unlike the several minutes of operating life demanded of the 60 -mW plasma heater that is used for re-entry heating simulation at NASA's Ames Research Center in California.
