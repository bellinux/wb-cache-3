25|$|There {{were two}} main {{experimental}} {{models of the}} Thompson. The <b>Persuader</b> was a belt-fed version developed in 1917/18. It was partially built, but never completely finished. The Annihilator, serial no. 1 to 10, was similar in appearance to the later models, but without rear sight and butt stock mounts. The first were fed from a 20-round box magazine, later, the 50- and 100-round drum magazines were developed.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} area of social {{influence}} research is compliance. Compliance refers to {{any change in}} behavior that {{is due to a}} request or suggestion from another person. The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance method in which the <b>persuader</b> requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related trick is the bait and switch.|$|E
25|$|In De l'Art de <b>persuader</b> ("On the Art of Persuasion"), Pascal looked {{deeper into}} geometry's axiomatic method, {{specifically}} {{the question of}} how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{cancellation}} of Century, Miller changed genres with {{the first of four}} appearances on Science Fiction Theater. In [...] "The Strange Dr. Lorenz" [...] (1955), she played the wife of a physician, whose debilitating condition is cured by a miraculous royal jelly. But the jelly has an unexpected side-effect. In [...] "Operation Flypaper" [...] (1956) she and Vincent Price are scientists trying to catch a thief who can suspend time. During this period, Miller would make three Western films in succession: Thunder over Arizona (1956), Domino Kid (1957) and The <b>Persuader</b> (1957), a religious Western starring William Talman. Miller rejoined Jim Davis for the last time in an episode of M Squad — [...] "The Case of the Double Face" [...] (May 23, 1958), starring Lee Marvin. Miller is married to a mild-mannered, bespectacled Davis, who is accused by the Chicago police of being a jewel thief.

[...] The scientists activate three of their Four Horsemen of Apokolips, which target Black Adam. Suspicious of Black Adam, Amanda Waller destroys Osiris' reputation by maneuvering him into killing the <b>Persuader</b> and leaking footage of the incident to the media. Osiris retires from the public eye as a result, and acid rain ravages Kahndaq. Osiris, convinced {{that he is the}} cause of Kahndaq's new miseries, asks Captain Marvel to remove his powers, but he is confronted by Isis and Black Adam and returns to Kahndaq.

The Legionnaires included were the founding members Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad (portrayed by Ryan Kennedy, Alexz Johnson and Calum Worthy, respectively). The episode aired on January 15, 2009, and featured the three Legionnaires, starting with a brief battle with the <b>Persuader</b> (portrayed by Fraser Aitcheson), and then assisting Clark Kent in his fight against Brainiac.

2500|$|Technological {{progress}} and intellectual breakthroughs in scientific theory appear in Atlas Shrugged, leading some observers to classify {{it in the}} genre of science fiction. Writer Jeff Riggenbach notes: [...] "Galt's motor {{is one of the}} three inventions that propel the action of Atlas Shrugged", the other two being Rearden Metal and the government's sonic weapon, Project X. Other fictional technologies are [...] "refractor rays" [...] (to disguise Galt's Gulch), a sophisticated electrical torture device (the Ferris <b>Persuader),</b> voice-activated door locks (at the Gulch's power station), palm-activated door locks (in Galt's New York laboratory), Galt's means of quietly turning the entire contents of his laboratory into a fine powder when a lock is breached, and a means of taking over all radio stations worldwide. Riggenbach adds, [...] "Rand's overall message with regard to science seems clear: the role of science in human life and human society is to provide the knowledge on the basis of which technological advancement and the related improvements in the quality of human life can be realized. But science can fulfill this role only in a society in which human beings are left free to conduct their business as they see fit." [...] Science fiction historian John J. Pierce describes it as a [...] "romantic suspense novel" [...] that is [...] "at least a borderline case" [...] of science fiction.|$|E
