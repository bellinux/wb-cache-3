Plasma sprayable alumina powders with γ- and α-forms have been prepared by chemical precipitation route by varying the calcination temperatures of the powders and without the spray drying step. The powders are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffractometry, particle size analysis and flowability. The alumina powders are <b>plasma</b> <b>sprayed</b> at three different critical <b>plasma</b> <b>spray</b> parameters (CPSP; 675, 825 and 937. 5 W/nLpm). In the present work, the influence of CPSP values on the crystallographic forms of alumina, microstructure, microhardness, surface roughness and wear behavior of the coatings is investigated. <b>Plasma</b> <b>sprayed</b> alumina coating with a CPSP of 825 shows higher wear and corrosion resistance compared to other coatings.

30|$|The {{properties}} of depositions depend on spray methods [1, 2]. In recent years, the <b>plasma</b> <b>spray</b> technique {{is used for}} deposition of different coatings [3, 4]. The performance of a <b>plasma</b> <b>spray</b> system depends {{on the design of}} torch, type and rate of plasma gas, plasma power and suchlike. The structural modification of the plasma torch can increase the power of plasma, which leads to more hardness of the coatings [5]. By adding helium or hydrogen gas to plasma gas, the power of plasma increases resulting in increase of coating hardness [6]. The bond between the splats inside the depositions and layer structure of coatings is the factor which defines the features of coatings achieved by the <b>plasma</b> <b>spray</b> method [7]. The temperature of particles {{plays an important role in}} the hardness of depositions [8]. Roughness and temperature of substrates can improve solidification of copper droplets and modify the {{properties of}} depositions obtained by the <b>plasma</b> <b>spray</b> technique [9, 10]. The large diameter of the nozzle can improve cohesion between the lamellae in the coatings, because the dwelling time of particles in plasma torch increases [11]. The depositions of nickel-based alloy formed by <b>plasma</b> <b>spray</b> under low power may have certain features comparable to depositions formed by conventional <b>plasma</b> <b>spray</b> [12].|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of this work was to present the changes between the <b>plasma</b> <b>sprayed</b> and high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) wear Cr 3 C 2 resistant coats. The differences in microstructure and microhardness of coatings were investigated. The characterization of fully melted, un- melted and partly melted areas was performed. Design/methodology/approach: The investigated coats contained very differentiate areas, especially <b>plasma</b> <b>sprayed</b> layers. Systematic investigations of microstructure by using optical, electron scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy selected fully melted, un- melted or partly melted areas and their characteristic features were performed.
