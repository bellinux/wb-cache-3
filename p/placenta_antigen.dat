40|$|The human MAGE 3 gene is {{expressed}} in {{a significant proportion of}} tumors of various histological types, but is silent in normal adult tissues other than testis and <b>placenta.</b> <b>Antigens</b> encoded by MAGE 3 may therefore be useful targets for specific antitumor immunization. Two antigenic peptides encoded by the MAGE 3 gene have been reported previously. One is presented to cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) by HLA-A 1, the other by HLA-A 2 molecules. Here we show that MAGE 3 also codes for a peptide that is presented to CTL by HLA-B 44. MAGE 3 peptides containing the HLA-B 44 peptide binding motif were synthesized. Peptide MEVDPIGHLY, which showed the strongest binding to HLA-B 44, was used to stimulate blood T lymphocytes from normal HLA-B 44 donors. CTL clones were obtained that recognized not only HLA-B 44 cells sensitized with the peptide, but also HLA-B 44 tumor cell lines expressing MAGE 3. The proportion of metastatic melanomas expressing the MAGE 3 /HLA-B 44 antigen should amount to approximately 17 % in the Caucasian population, since 24 % of individuals carry the HLA-B 44 allele and 76 % of these tumors express MAGE 3...|$|R

When appropriately absorbed with virus-free cells, the antisera were not cytotoxic for lymphocytes of adult males but lysed lymphocytes of neonates in about half of the 30 cord blood samples tested and were also cytotoxic for one third of 26 trophoblast suspensions prepared from healthy placentae.

40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to determine}} the risk of infectious process development in placenta of women with undifferenti-ated forms of dysplasia of connective tissue (UFDCT) by agents - herpes viruses (VHG - virus of herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus). Persistent infection of VHG was revealed in 133 women in the 1 st trimester of pregnancy. All the patients had phe-notypic manifestations of UFDCT; in the 3 d trimester of pregnancy immunogram of the second level, histological study of <b>placenta,</b> identification of <b>antigens</b> of VHG family, serological study of placental blood and isolation of DNA of VHG were carried out. All newborns were clinically and laboratory tested on VHG infection. As pregnant women with UFDCT had high risk of VHG infection development in placenta, they suffered from placental insufficiency. It resulted in unfavourable perinatal outcomes. VHG infection development was caused by disturbances of cellular immunity.

40|$|Objective: To study re-association {{pattern of}} human placental eluate {{immunoglobulins}} with acid treated isologous and third party trophoblast derived placental microvesicles. Design: Laboratory based experimentation. Setting: Biological Sciences Department and Discipline for Reproductive Medicine University of Newcastle, Australia and the Department of Biochemistry, University of Nairobi, Kenya. Results: Placental eluate immunoglobulins re-associated with isologous and third party acidified microvesicles in three distinct patterns. I: eluate immunoglobulins re-associated more strongly with isologous and third party acid treated placental microvesicles, II: eluate immunoglobulins re-associated strongly with isologous but weakly with third party acid treated placental microvesicles, III: eluate immunoglobulins {{did not show}} preferential re-association with isologous and third party acid treated placental microvesicles. Conclusion: Two types of antigenic epitopes I and II may be expressed on the human <b>placentae.</b> Type I <b>antigens</b> may be present on all human placentae while type II epitopes may be paternally derived hence unique to each pregnancy. Also, immunoglobulins produced to placental microvesicle antigens may be directed to some but not all antigenic epitopes expressed on the human placental trophoblast...|$|R
40|$|Interest in the {{possibility}} that the <b>placenta</b> contains organ-specific <b>antigens</b> was stimulated {{at the beginning of the}} century by the suggestion that some toxemias of pregnancy might result from maternal sensitization against placental antigens, leading secondarily to renal damage (1). The general principle that an antiserum raised in one species against placental homogenates from a different species will interrupt pregnancy in individuals of the species that provided the antigen has been well established since Dobrowolski's (2) work with guinea pigs and rabbits (see reference 3). Contaminating erythrocytes have been exonerated as the effective antigens and the strong nephrotoxic activity of many anti-placental sera established (4 - 6). However, it seems fairly well documented that potent nephrotoxic anti-kidney sera are not necessarily placentotoxic (7, 8). The nature and distribution of the antigens apparently shared in common by the placenta and kidney have been subjected to repeated investigations mainly of an in vitro nature (6, 8 - 13). These have strongly implicated trophoblast as the principal source of the shared antigens, but failed to produce unequivocal evidence of the existenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{acceptance}} of the fetal allograft {{in the face of}} a completely competent maternal immune system remains a perplexing and critical problem in transplantation immunology. Varieties of potential mechanisms by which the fetus could avoid rejection have been proposed by Medawar (1) and by Billingham (2), and these proposals set the stage for much of the work in this field. The mechanisms proposed to prevent immune destruction of the fetus by the mother have postulated roles for blocking antibodies, immunosuppressive antibody-antigen complexes, nonimmunoglobulin immunosuppressive molecules, suppressor cells, and selective maternal immunoincompetence (reviewed in references 3 - 8). Many of these arguments turn on the question of what type of transplantation antigens encoded by the MHC are present in the <b>placenta.</b> Class I <b>antigens</b> have been demonstrated in the placenta of the mouse (9 - 13), human (14 - 21), and rat (22 - 24) using alloantisera and mAbs.

40|$|Immunoglobulins, {{mostly of}} the IgG class, were {{detected}} in eluates of the placenta of 75 % of 50 healthy {{women in their}} first or second pregnancy, 92 % of 30 women with more than two pregnancies, and 87 % of 23 pre-eclamptic patients. The immunoglobulins were assayed for complement-dependent cytotoxicity on human and monkey cell-lines, {{as well as on}} the same cells chronically infected with either Mason-Pfizer Virus (M-P V) or Baboon Endogenous Virus (BeV). The frequency of cytotoxic reactions was very low, except with immunoglobulins from the pre-eclamptic placentae, where one third of the samples lysed virus-infected cells with occasional killing of virus-free cells. All placental immunoglobulins which were not cytotoxic were then assayed for blocking activity by testing whether they could compete with the action of anticellular sera on virus-free cells, or with the toxic effect of antiviral sera on virus producing cells. 64 % of the immunoglobulins from normal placentae competed with antiviral antibodies while only 17 % blocked the action of anticellular sera. The frequency of blocking immunoglobulins was no greater in eluates from pre-eclamptic placentae. The data indicate that the <b>placenta</b> possesses retrovirus <b>antigen</b> sites which bind blocking antibodies in normal pregnancy and complement-dependent cytotoxic antibodies in pre-eclampsia. © 1981.

40|$|Rats, rabbits, or dogs {{injected}} with specific antibodies to kidney tissue develop acute glomerulonephritis (1 - 3). In rats the nephritis often progresses to a chronic stage and causes death months later from renal insufficiency. Antibody produced in rabbits by the injection of rat placenta also is highly nephrotoxie to the rat (4). This antiplacenta serum not only initiates typical progressive nephritis, but also induces abortion in the pregnant animal. Preliminary experiments in dogs demonstrated that specific antiplacenta serum was nephrotoxic to this animal species (5). The experiments recorded here show {{the results of}} injecting rabbit antidog-placenta serum into both pregnant and non-pregnant dogs. The course of the resulting nephritis is compared with that following the injection of rabbit antidog-kidney serum. The large size of the animal permitted frequent bleedings for carrying out various blood tests and the gestation period of 63 days allowed considerable time for observation of nephritis during pregnancy. The findings support the conclusion that rabbit antidog-placenta serum injected in dogs produces an acute nephritis which usually progresses to a chronic state comparable to that which follows the injection of antikidney serum.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Placental malaria {{is caused}} by {{sequestration}} of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) in the <b>placenta.</b> Parasite <b>antigen</b> VAR 2 CSA, expressed {{on the surface of}} IE, enables binding of IE to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta, which leads to inflammation and increased risks of poor pregnancy outcomes. Antibodies (Ab) to VAR 2 CSA, found at higher levels in multigravid women, are associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. However, the precise link between Ab to VAR 2 CSA and its direct protective effect of IE clearance, i. e., absence of placental malaria at delivery, has not been established. The relative importance of antibodies to individual Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains and the full-length VAR 2 CSA (FV 2) in parasite clearance is also unknown. In this study, we tested whether higher levels of Ab to FV 2, to individual domains/variants, and a larger overall antibody repertoire throughout pregnancy correlated with absence of placental malaria in pregnant women living in high or low malaria transmission settings. We further examined if higher levels of high avidity FV 2 Ab, inhibitory antibodies and opsonizing antibodies were associated with parasite clearance. Our data showed that in the high transmission setting, women without placental malaria produced significantly higher levels of Ab to FV 2 (p= 0. 0047), DBL 3 (p= 0. 014; 0. 023), DBL 4 (p= 0. 037; 0. 025), DBL 5 (p= 0. 037; 0. 048) and DBL 6 (p= 0. 03) early on than women with placental malaria. The same group of women also produced larger proportions of high avidity antibodies (p= 0. 0009) and had larger antibody repertoires to domains (p= 0. 003) and variants (p= 0. 021) than women with placental malaria. While no difference was found in the levels of antibody mediating inhibition of binding at 5 and 8 month of pregnancy (MoP), women without placental malaria had higher levels of opsonizing antibodies (p= 0. 027) at 8 MoP than women with placental malaria. No association was found between antibody levels and absence of placental malaria in women living in the low transmission setting. These data provide the first evidence that antibodies to VAR 2 CSA are important in parasite clearance from the placenta. Also, antibodies involved in opsonic phagocytosis may be a useful functional correlate of protection. Lastly, frequent malaria infections are required for the development of protective antibodies...|$|R

Techniques used were transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to investigate the tissue expression of the cytokines interlukin 1 (IL- 1) α, IL- 1 β, its specific membrane receptor, IL- 1 receptor type I (IL- 1 R tI) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). In addition the uteroplacental complex has been profiled as to the diversity of its glycosylation, which was found to be as complex as that found in both reptilian and mammalian placenta. Immunostaining of the uteroplacental complex for IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL-R tI revealed by binding leucocytes of both the mother and fetus. Yolk sac endoderm was also positive for all the epitopes studied while ectoderm was positive only for IL- 1 α. Immunoreactivity in the uterine endometrium was obtained for IL- 1 α and its receptor while the egg envelope was always negative. Placenta and SST were positive for MIF and IL- 1 receptor. The present findings on the expression of the interleukin system and MIF in the uteroplacental complex and SST suggest that these cytokines are involved in evolutionarily conserved immunological mechanisms that anticipate the presence of paternal and fetal antigens in maternal tissues...|$|R
