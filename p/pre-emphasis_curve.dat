Over its years of trading, Orban has {{released}} many well known audio processing products, including the Orban Optimod 8000, {{which was the}} first audio processor ever made to include FM processing and a stereo generator under one package - an innovative idea at the time, as no other processor took in to account the 75 uS <b>pre-emphasis</b> <b>curve</b> employed by FM, which lead to low average modulation and a lot of peaks.|$|E
40|$|Pre-emphasis {{schedules}} {{are given}} for 11 constant-bandwidth FM subcarriers modulating an S band transmitter at three receiver {{signal to noise}} ratios (i. e., 9, 15, and 25 dB). The criterion for establishing these <b>pre-emphasis</b> <b>curves</b> is the achievement, at various receiver intermediate frequency signal to noise ratios, of equal receiver output signal to noise ratios for all channels. It is realized that these curves {{may not be the}} optimum <b>pre-emphasis</b> <b>curves</b> based on overall efficiency or maximum utilization of the allotted spectrum, but they are near-optimum for data with channels which require equal output signal to noise ratios, such as spectral densities. The empirically derived results are compared with a simplified, analytically derived schedule and the primary differences are explained. The S band pre-emphasis schedule differs from the lower frequency VHF case. Since most proportional bandwidth and constant bandwidth systems use ground based recorders and some use flight recorders (as the Saturn systems did on VHF proportional bandwidth telemetry), the effects of these recorders are discussed and a modified pre-emphasis schedule is presented showing {{the results of this study}} phase...|$|R
