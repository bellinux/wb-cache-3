5|$|Nevertheless, raisin exports {{were the}} most {{important}} export of the islands during the Venetian rule. By the early 18th century Zante, Cephalonia, and part of Ithaca had become a major centre of the currant trade. Because of the fierce competition in the raisin trade between Venice and the United Kingdom, Venice <b>prohibited</b> <b>the</b> free export of raisins from the islands. Another measure was the , a heavy export tax for foreign ships.|$|E

5|$|The {{film crew}} {{recorded}} the students on campus, at home, {{with their friends}} and families, at medical appointments, and at transgender-related events.

Cheadle asked the dean of students to reconsider, but his appeal was denied. Smith College has received considerable media attention about questions regarding transgender students.|$|E
5|$|The final {{gradient}} from Camden Town to Euston {{involved a}} crossing over the Regent's Canal {{that required a}} gradient of over 1 in 68. Because steam trains at the time could not climb such an ascent, they were cable-hauled on the down line towards Camden until 1844, after which they used a pilot engine. The L's Act of Parliament <b>prohibited</b> <b>the</b> use of locomotives in the Euston area, following concerns of local residents about noise and smoke from locomotives toiling up the incline.|$|E

5|$|About 1270, he {{returned}} to England to teach at Oxford, and was elected provincial minister of the Franciscans in England in 1275. He did not long remain in that post, being summoned to Rome as lector sacri palatii, or theological lecturer at the papal palace. It is likely that he composed his Expositio super Regulam Fratrum Minorum, a work that included information on preaching, a subject that Peckham felt was of great importance. In 1279 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Pope Nicholas III who had <b>prohibited</b> <b>the</b> election of Robert Burnell, Edward I's preferred candidate. He was provided (appointed by the pope to the see) on 25 January 1279 and consecrated on 19 February 1279.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules <b>prohibited</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed {{a reduction in the}} total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has <b>prohibited</b> <b>the</b> taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E
