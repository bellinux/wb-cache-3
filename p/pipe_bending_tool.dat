In {{the manufacturing process}} of <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> {{it is difficult to}} avoid thickening on the inner radius of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> and thinning on the outer radius of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend.</b> The cross section of the bend also becomes non circular due to bending process; this tends to cause ovality in <b>pipe</b> <b>bends.</b> The acceptability of <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> is based on the induced level of shape imperfections considered. Ovality is the shape imperfection considered for the analysis which varies from 0 to 8 %. This study is an attempt to analyze the ovality effect of inlet pigtail bend, INCOLOY 800 ASTM B 407 material which is used in hydrogen reformer application. The finite element method is used to model and analyze a stand-alone, long-radius <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> with 42. 2 mm nominal diameter and a 250 mm bend radius with specified length. A parametric study was performed in which the bend factor is taken as 1. 90 to 2. 07. Internal pressure is incremented for each model, until it reaches 27 x 108 N/mm 2. During this process, the bend undergoes plastic instability due to pressure and thermal effect. The results are presented in the form of total deflection and stresses for the incremented internal pressure and the same is computed for various percentage of ovality. The computed results are compared and the effects of total deflection and stresses of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> are noted. Keywords:- Creep, Ovality. I...|$|R

In general, the elbow is made by welding a straight <b>pipe</b> and <b>bend</b> part. So, periodic welding inspection is required due to the potential defects in weld zone. Recently, the application of induction heating <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> is increasing in order to reduce this problem. <b>Pipe</b> <b>bend</b> made by induction heating band is not necessary welding process because it is made by <b>bending</b> a straight <b>pipe</b> but the intrados thickness and the extrados thickness are different.

However, guided wave behavior is complex and there are many factors to consider such as the numerous possible vibrational modes and multiple reflections.

40|$|The {{production}} and transportation of hydrocarbon fluids in multiphase pipelines could be severely hindered by particulate solids deposit such as produced sand particles which accompany hydrocarbon production. Knowledge {{of the flow}} characteristics of solid particles in fluids transported in pipelines is important in order to accurately predict solid particles deposition in pipelines. This research thesis presents {{the development of a}} three-dimensional (3 D) Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) modelling technique for the prediction of liquid-solids multiphase flow in pipes, with special emphasis on the flow in V-inclined <b>pipe</b> <b>bends.</b> The Euler-Euler (two-fluid) multiphase modelling methodology has been adopted and the multiphase model equations and closure models describing the liquid-solids flow have been implemented and calculated using the finite volume method in a CFD code software. The liquid phase turbulence has been modelled using a two-equation k−ε turbulence model which contains additional terms to account for the effects of the solid-particles phase on the multiphase turbulence structure. The developed CFD numerical framework has been verified for the relevant forces and all the possible interaction mechanisms of the liquid-solids multiphase flow by investigating four different numerical frameworks, {{in order to determine the}} optimum numerical framework that captures the underlying physics and covers the interaction mechanisms that lead to sand deposition and the range of sand transport flow regimes in pipes. The flow of liquid-sand in pipe has been studied extensively and the numerical results of sand concentration distribution across pipe and other flow properties are in good agreement with published experimental data on validation. The numerical framework has been employed to investigate the multiphase flow in V-inclined <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> of ± 4 o− 6 o, seemingly small inclined bend angles. The predicted results which include the sand segregation, deposition velocity and flow turbulence modulation in the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> show that the seemingly small <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> have significant effect on the flow differently from that of horizontal <b>pipes.</b> The <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> causes abrupt local change in the multiphase flow characteristic and formation of stationary sand deposit in the pipe at a relatively high flow velocity. The threshold velocity to keep sand entrained in liquid in <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> is significantly higher than that required for flow horizontal pipes. A critical implication of this is that the correlations for predicting sand deposition in pipelines must account for the effect of <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> on flow characteristics in order to provide accurate predictions of the critical sand transport velocity (MTV) in subsea petroleum flowlines, which V-inclined <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> are inevitable due to seabed topology.

The analyses performed in this work demonstrate that the cyclic moment has a more significant impact upon the structural integrity of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> than the constant pressure. Full cyclic incremental analyses are used to verify the structural responses either side of each boundary and confirm correct responses. In addition, the shakedown boundary produced by the LMM is compared to another shakedown boundary of an identical <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> computed by the simplified technique and it is shown that the LMM calculates results more accurately. Parametric studies involving a change of geometry of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bends</b> and loading type are carried out.

40|$|At present, the {{exploitation}} of geothermal resources develops in a fair competition {{with other types of}} energy resources. This leads to actuality of questions which associated with the more efficient use of existing wells, because cost of their drilling is a significant share of geothermal projects. In domestic practice of development of geothermal resources the steam-water wells have greatest energy potential. One way to improve the performance of these wells is a providing of smooth change of direction of motion of steam-water mixture from the vertical, in the well, to the horizontal, in steam gathering system. Typical wellhead piping of domestic steam-water wells involves the removal of the mixture through a cross bar at a right angle. Cross bar can generate considerable pressure loss that increases the operating pressure {{at the mouth of the}} well and reduces flow rate. It seems reasonable to substitute the typical cross bar by smooth <b>pipe</b> <b>bend.</b> This reduces wellhead resistance coefficient by more than on 2. Increase of curvature radius of <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> reduces the pressure loss to a local resistance but increases the friction pressure loss.

This study focuses on <b>pipe</b> induction <b>bends,</b> which is a vital element in any ultra deep water subsea system. Bends are mainly used in the tie-in spools to connect pipeline end structures to manifolds or to well head trees.
