Our {{starting}} point is a hybrid-system model specified in a domain-specific language called Acumen. Our <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> is implemented in Matlab and covers three stages of model-based testing, namely, test-case generation, test-case execution, and confor-mance analysis.

50|$|Semi-tubular rivets (also {{known as}} tubular rivets) {{are similar to}} solid rivets, except they have a partial hole (opposite the head) at the tip. The purpose of this hole {{is to reduce the}} amount of force needed for {{application}} by rolling the tubular portion outward. The force needed to apply a semitubular rivet is about 1/4 of the amount needed to apply a solid rivet. Tubular rivets are sometimes preferred for pivot points (a joint where movement is desired) since the swelling of the rivet is only at the tail. The type of equipment used to apply semi-tubular rivets range from <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> to fully automated systems. Typical installation tools (from lowest to highest price) are hand set, manual squeezer, pneumatic squeezer, kick press, impact riveter, and finally PLC-controlled robotics. The most common machine is the impact riveter and the most common use of semitubular rivets is in lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, HVAC duct work, mechanical products, and electronics. They are offered from 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) in diameter (other sizes are considered highly special) and can be up to 8 inches (203 mm) long. A wide variety of materials and platings are available, most common base metals are steel, brass, copper, stainless, aluminum and most common platings are zinc, nickel, brass, tin. Tubular rivets are normally waxed to facilitate proper assembly. An installed tubular rivet has a head on one side, with a rolled over and exposed shallow blind hole on the other.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional meshes {{modeling}} nonlinear {{problems such}} as sheet metal forming, metal forging, heat transfer during welding, the propagation of microwaves through gases, and automobile crashes require highly refined meshes in local areas to accurately represent areas of high curvature, stress, and strain. These locally refined areas develop late in the simulation and/or move {{during the course of}} the simulation, thus making it difficult to predict their exact location. This thesis is a systematic study of new tools scientists can use with redistribution algorithms to enhance the solution results and reduce the time to build, solve, and analyze nonlinear finite element problems. Participatory design techniques including Contextual Inquiry and Design were used to study and analyze the process of solving such problems. This study and analysis led to the in-depth understanding of the types of interactions performed by FEM scientists. Based on this understanding, a <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> was designed to support these interactions. Scientists participated in evaluating the design as well as the implementation of the <b>prototype</b> <b>tool.</b> The study, analysis, <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> design, and the results of the evaluation of the <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> are described in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePrototyping {{is one of}} {{the core}} {{activities}} of User-Centered Design (UCD) processes and an integral component of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Nonetheless, for many years, prototyping was synonym of paper-based mock-ups and only more recently we can say that dedicated tools for supporting prototyping activities really reach the market. In this paper we propose to analyze the evolution of <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> proposed by the academic community to support research activities and <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> that are aimed and improve the development process of commercial user interfaces. Thus, this paper presents a review of past and current graphical user interface <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools,</b> in order to set up {{the state of the art}} in this field, observing fundamental milestones of features over time. For that, we have screened publications presented since 1988 in some of the main HCI conferences and 113 commercial tools available on the web. The results enable a brief comparison of characteristics present in both academic and commercial tools, how they have evolved and what are the gaps that can provide insights for future research and development...|$|E
40|$|By {{investigating}} the existing <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> and emerging technological paradigms, this thesis contributes a new flow-based visual programming software called Glue which makes prototyping physical interactions and connected experiences easier for designers without a strong technical background. With overwhelming {{new technologies and}} interconnected disciplines, more designers learn technical know-how and build technical prototypes to better explore and evaluate concepts. However, most existing <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> are still engineering-oriented and their ways of introducing programming and electronics can be intimidating for non-specialists. The aim of this thesis project has been to rethink <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> and {{to bridge the gap}} between design tools and the new physical and digital hybrid design context. As a result, Glue is proposed and developed to offer an alternative way to create a program by manipulating logics graphically. With visible flows and real-time feedback, designers can learn, understand and create program intuitively. The smartphone integration allows beginners to set up flexible architectures and mimic connected experience easily. Glue also provides powerful ways to explore invisible behaviours across time and possibilities...|$|E

40|$|System {{prototyping}} {{is essential}} {{in the development of}} automated manufacturing systems (AMSs), and the value of prototyping depends largely on the effectiveness of the <b>prototyping</b> <b>tool</b> to represent a system design and also the prototyping results. This paper presents a windows-based <b>prototyping</b> <b>tool</b> that adopts a frame-based representation approach to build a prototype from an object-oriented system design specification. The tool provides a platform capable of executing the prototype under different constraints and operating conditions, and of presenting the prototyping results to facilitate the study of the behaviour of the AMS. Properties, such as the total cycle time, resource utilization, potential conflicts, errors in design, and abnormal behaviours, can be readily derived. The tool's effectiveness is illustrated by prototyping a flexible manufacturing system, and examining the results obtained. Indeed, the <b>prototyping</b> <b>tool</b> proposed in this paper is shown to provide a convenient means for the design of AMSs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{design and}} {{construction}} costs in a consistent, reliable, and accurate way is critical for an organization since the information generated is the basis for: projecting program funds, prioritizing projects by financial analysis, determining required funds, and providing a baseline for project control. This thesis focused on cost estimating methods, database, and <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> development for {{design and construction}} of rural and small urban transit facilities that are usually small, numerous, and geographically dispersed. To address these issues, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) funded a research team to provide guidance to state transit agencies in assisting their sub-recipients with preparing accurate design and construction cost estimates. This thesis was written according to {{the scope of the}} funded research project. The main objectives of this study were to determine the distinct characteristics of rural and small urban transit facilities and to develop a cost database and a <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> to assist agencies with preparing conceptual estimates. Conducting a literature review and telephone interviews with experts in the transit facility industry improved the understanding of the estimating practices used in the rural and small urban transit facility industry. Unique characteristics and risk factors of those facilities were identified. A cost estimating database was constructed based on the historical cost data collected through online surveys. A cost estimating <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> was developed based on the findings obtained from the literature review, telephone interviews, and analysis of the cost estimating database. Review of the <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> was then performed to ensure the tool?s self-explanation, functionality, and user-friendliness.

40|$|Abstract According to the {{human-centered design}} process, {{prototyping}} {{is an essential}} element of user experience (UX) design. This literature review aims to provide an overview of user experience prototyping and answer the following questions based on previous literature: How does UX design benefit from prototyping? What kinds of prototypes and <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> exist? In which phases of the UX design process is prototyping most valuable? This literature review reveals that prototyping increases the understanding of user needs and context, allows designers to explore and evaluate design ideas and communicate design decisions. Low-fidelity prototypes provide insight early in the design process when possible designs are explored and initial usability evaluations are conducted. High-fidelity and e. g. multi-fidelity prototypes can include more sophisticated interactive features and act as living specification for developers and other stakeholders. Low-fidelity <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools</b> are widely available and easy to use, while higher fidelity tools are often viewed as time consuming and more difficult to use...|$|E
