5|$|Potassium reacts violently with halogens and detonates in the {{presence}} of bromine. It also reacts explosively with sulfuric acid. During combustion, potassium forms <b>peroxides</b> and superoxides. These <b>peroxides</b> may react violently with organic compounds such as oils. Both <b>peroxides</b> and superoxides may react explosively with metallic potassium.|$|E
5|$|Due to incompatibilities, it is {{recommended}} to keep acetic acid away from chromic acid, ethylene glycol, nitric acid, perchloric acid, permanganates, <b>peroxides</b> and hydroxyls.|$|E

50|$|Magnesium <b>peroxide</b> (MgO2) is an odorless fine powder <b>peroxide</b> with a {{white to}} off-white color. It is similar to calcium <b>peroxide</b> because {{magnesium}} <b>peroxide</b> also releases oxygen by breaking down at a controlled rate with water. Commercially, magnesium <b>peroxide</b> often exists as a compound of magnesium <b>peroxide</b> and magnesium hydroxide.|$|R
50|$|Hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> - urea {{is a solid}} {{composed}} of equal amounts of hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> and urea. This compound is a white crystalline solid, which dissolves in water to give free hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> Often called carbamide <b>peroxide</b> in the dental applications, it {{is used as a}} source of hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> for bleaching, disinfection, and oxidation. Hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> - urea contains solid and water-free hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> which offers a higher stability and better controllability than liquid hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> when used as oxidizing agent.|$|R

[...] Similarly, molybdate reacts in alkaline media with <b>peroxide</b> to form red peroxomolybdate [...] The reaction of hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> with aqueous titanium(IV) gives a brightly colored peroxy complex that is a useful test for titanium as well as hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> Many transition metal dioxygen complexes are best described as adducts of <b>peroxide.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state of oxygen is −2 {{in almost all}} known compounds of oxygen. The {{oxidation state}} −1 is found in a few compounds such as <b>peroxides.</b> Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −1/2 (superoxides), −1/3 (ozonides), 0 (elemental, hypofluorous acid), +1/2 (dioxygenyl), +1 (dioxygen difluoride), and +2 (oxygen difluoride).|$|E
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive <b>peroxides</b> can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium reacts violently {{with water}} and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms <b>peroxides</b> on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E
50|$|Bleaching {{solutions}} generally contain hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> or carbamide <b>peroxide,</b> which bleaches {{the tooth}} enamel {{to change its}} color. Off-the-shelf products typically rely on a carbamide <b>peroxide</b> solution varying in concentration from 10% to 44%. Bleaching solutions may be applied directly to the teeth, embedded in a plastic strip that {{is placed on the}} teeth or use a gel held in place by a mouthguard. Carbamide <b>peroxide</b> reacts with water to form hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> Carbamide <b>peroxide</b> has {{about a third of the}} strength of hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> This means that a 15% solution of carbamide <b>peroxide</b> is the rough equivalent of a 5% solution of hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> The <b>peroxide</b> oxidizing agent penetrates the porosities in the rod-like crystal structure of enamel and breaks down stain deposits in the dentin.|$|R

40|$|Crude Natto Hay Bacillus extract of {{catalase}} without hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> {{showed a}} 22 % decrease with hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> With hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> plus potassium cyanide, a 48 % decrease occurred with hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> {{in regard to}} the ability to take up mercury from air saturated with mercury vapour. Purified extract without hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> showed a 63 % decrease with hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> compared to hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> plus potassium cyanide which showed a 76 % decrease with hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> alone. Hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> plus sodium azide showed a 97 % decrease with hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> alone. The results were similar to human and mouse normal and acatalasemic erythrocytes or mouse lung and liver homogenates. Natto Hay Bacillus extract of catalase took up mercury from air saturated with mercury vapour. This indicates that the catalase-hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> system plays a role in mercury uptake presumably by oxidation...|$|R
5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione peroxidase isozymes in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid <b>peroxides.</b> These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Uric acid has {{the highest}} {{concentration}} of any blood antioxidant and provides {{over half of the}} total antioxidant capacity of human serum. Uric acid's antioxidant activities are also complex, given that it does not react with some oxidants, such as superoxide, but does act against peroxynitrite, <b>peroxides,</b> and hypochlorous acid. Concerns over elevated UA's contribution to gout must be considered as one of many risk factors. By itself, UA-related risk of gout at high levels (415–530 μmol/L) is only 0.5% per year with an increase to 4.5% per year at UA supersaturation levels (535+ μmol/L). Many of these aforementioned studies determined UA's antioxidant actions within normal physiological levels, and some found antioxidant activity at levels as high as 285 μmol/L.|$|E
5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and <b>peroxides</b> and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The coordination chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The coordination chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E
5000|$|... zinc {{hydroxide}} is reacted {{with a mixture}} of hydrochloric acid and hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> and percipitated with sodium hydroxide also containing hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> to ensure a higher yield of zinc <b>peroxide.</b> unlike in the preparation of copper <b>peroxide</b> the zinc ion does not cause the <b>peroxide</b> to decompose.|$|R
50|$|Chromium(VI) <b>peroxide</b> (CrO5) or {{chromium}} oxide <b>peroxide</b> is an unstable compound {{formed by the}} addition of acidified hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> solutions to solutions of metal chromates or dichromates, such as sodium chromate or potassium dichromate. The generally yellow chromates or orange dichromates turn to dark blue as chromium(VI) <b>peroxide</b> is formed. Chromate or dichromate reacts with hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> and an acid to give chromium <b>peroxide</b> and water.|$|R
40|$|Bleaching with 10 % {{carbamide}} <b>peroxide</b> using a mouthguard {{was suggested}} by Heymann and Haywood in 1989. [5] The concentration of hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> in 10 % carbamide <b>peroxide</b> is 10 times {{less than that}} in 35 % hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> resulting in low levels of hypersensitivity and lower surface morphology changes. In this technique, patients use a 10 % carbamide <b>peroxide</b> gel for 3 – 8 h daily, whereas in the hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> technique, 35 % hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> {{is applied to the}} buccal surfaces of the teeth for short periods of time.

5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with <b>peroxides</b> to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
25|$|When {{stored in}} the {{presence}} of air or oxygen, ethers tend to form explosive <b>peroxides,</b> such as diethyl ether peroxide. The reaction is accelerated by light, metal catalysts, and aldehydes. In addition to avoiding storage conditions likely to form <b>peroxides,</b> it is recommended, when an ether is used as a solvent, not to distill it to dryness, as any <b>peroxides</b> that may have formed, being less volatile than the original ether, will become concentrated in the last few drops of liquid.To check presence of peroxide in old samples of ethers may be detected by shaking them with freshly prepared solution of a FeSO4 followed by addition of kcn appearance of blood red colour indicates presence of <b>peroxides.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ethers like {{diethyl ether}} and {{tetrahydrofuran}} (THF) can form highly explosive organic <b>peroxides</b> upon exposure to oxygen and light.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the catalytic activation of hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> on titanium silicalites is presented. Calculations for several <b>peroxide</b> adsorption structures show that the interaction is weak. Formation of cyclic complexes between deprotonated <b>peroxide</b> and solvent molecules or with a silanol group is highly endothermic (more than 90 kJ/mol). The energy barrier of activation for ethene epoxidation with nondissociatively adsorbed <b>peroxide</b> is 83 kJ/mol with hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> over titanium silicalite. This energy {{is lower than the}} energy for <b>peroxide</b> deprotonation and implies that O–H bond cleavage during <b>peroxide</b> adsorption on titanium clusters is not necessary...|$|R

25|$|Unless a {{desiccant}} is used {{which can}} destroy the <b>peroxides,</b> they will concentrate during distillation, {{due to their}} higher boiling point. When sufficient <b>peroxides</b> have formed, they can form a crystalline, shock-sensitive solid precipitate. Minor mechanical disturbances, such as scraping {{the inside of a}} vessel or the dislodging of a deposit, can set off a violent explosion.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{stumbling}} blocks that would-be rocket pack builders have faced is the difficulty of obtaining concentrated hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> which is no longer produced by many chemical companies. The few companies that produce high-concentration hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> only sell to large corporations or governments, forcing some amateurs and professionals to {{set up their own}} hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> distillation installations.
