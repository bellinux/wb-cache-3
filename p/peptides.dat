5|$|In chemistry, <b>peptides</b> are {{synthesized}} by {{a variety}} of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different <b>peptides</b> by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of <b>peptides</b> for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.|$|E

5|$|<b>Peptides</b> {{in black}} mamba venom {{have been found}} to be {{effective}} analgesics. These <b>peptides,</b> part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins do not have a resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
40|$|Background Conventional {{nanofiber}} forming <b>peptide</b> amphiphiles {{comprise a}} beta sheet forming, short <b>peptide</b> sequence with an alkyl chain attached at one terminus. We report the self-assembly of a <b>peptide</b> amphiphile possessing a mid-chain located alkyl substituent (a T-shaped <b>peptide</b> amphiphile) into nanofiber networks. Method <b>Peptide</b> synthesis {{was carried out}} using standard 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase <b>peptide</b> synthesis protocols, followed by covalent attachment of the alkyl chains to yield target <b>peptide</b> amphiphiles. Self-assembly was then studied using electron microscopy and coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations. Results T-shaped <b>peptide</b> amphiphiles self-assembled into nanofibers just like linear <b>peptide</b> amphiphiles, but then unlike linear <b>peptide</b> amphiphiles, T-shaped <b>peptide</b> amphiphiles formed inter-fiber associations and ultimately nanofiber networks. Conclusion Changing {{the position of the}} alkyl chain in a <b>peptide</b> amphiphile from the terminal end of the <b>peptide</b> to the middle part of the <b>peptide,</b> to form a T-shaped <b>peptide</b> amphiphile, does not disrupt the molecular interactions required for the self-assembly of the <b>peptide</b> amphiphiles into nanofibers.

In S. scabies the precursor <b>peptide,</b> termed BtmD, is a 44-amino acid <b>peptide.</b> The precursor <b>peptide</b> is termed BmbC in S. bottropensis. The amino acids forming the bottromycin core are residues 2-9 in BtmD: Gly-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Phe-Asp-Cys.

Unlike other ribosomal <b>peptide</b> natural products, which are normally synthesized with a leader <b>peptide</b> that is cleaved, bottromycin is synthesized with a follower <b>peptide.</b> The presence of a follower <b>peptide</b> was identified by bioinformatic analysis of the bottromycin biosynthetic cluster.|$|R

5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other <b>peptides,</b> with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor <b>Peptides)</b> were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature <b>peptides.</b> The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the <b>peptides</b> bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other <b>peptides</b> activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the <b>peptides</b> have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E

The leader <b>peptide</b> is usually important for enabling enzymatic processing of the precursor <b>peptide</b> via aiding {{in recognition of the}} core <b>peptide</b> by biosynthetic enzymes and for cellular export. Some RiPPs also contain a recognition sequence C-terminal to the core peptide; these are involved in excision and cyclization.

5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor.

In tobacco, it is processed into two <b>peptides,</b> in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described.

However, these toxic <b>peptides</b> can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats, and are consequently expensive. Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium is only about 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions.|$|E

40|$|Proteolytically stable <b>peptide</b> {{architectures}} {{are required}} {{for the development of}} long-acting <b>peptide</b> therapeutics. In this work, we found that a phage-selected bicyclic <b>peptide</b> antagonist exhibits an unusually high stability in vivo and subsequently deciphered the underlying mechanisms of <b>peptide</b> stabilization. We found that the bicyclic <b>peptide</b> was significantly more stable than its constituent rings synthesized as two individual macrocycles. The two rings protect each other from proteolysis when linked together, conceivably by constraining the conformation and/or by mutually shielding regions prone to proteolysis. A second stabilization mechanism was found when the bicyclic <b>peptide</b> was linked to an albumin-binding <b>peptide</b> to prevent its rapid renal clearance. The bicyclic <b>peptide</b> conjugate not only circulated 50 -fold longer (t(1 / 2) = 24 h) but also became entirely resistant to proteolysis when tethered to the long-lived serum protein.

25|$|Antimicrobial <b>peptides</b> {{have been}} {{successively}} incorporated into topical therapeutics.

25|$|A major {{limitation}} to {{the therapeutic}} potential {{is the possibility}} of bacteria developing resistance to the <b>peptides,</b> and particularly if that produces a resistance to the body's own immune system use of those <b>peptides.</b> That is, providing a lot of the <b>peptides</b> as a therapeutic agent makes it easier for resistance to evolve; unlike antibiotic resistance, however, resistance to antimicrobial <b>peptides</b> mimicking those produced by humans can make the bacteria more resistant to the body's own immune system rather than just the antibiotic.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide is also {{involved}} in the clearance of amyloid-β peptide. Amyloid-β <b>peptides</b> {{are one of the}} hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. When they are not degraded properly, these <b>peptides</b> accumulate and create plaques, which are clumps of amyloid-β peptide pieces, and they are highly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β peptide clearance is important so that this accumulation does not occur. Sulfatide facilitates amyloid-β peptide removal through an endocytotic pathway, so when there are high levels of sulfatide, there are lower amounts of amyloid-β <b>peptides.</b> Since subjects with Alzheimer's disease have lower sulfatide levels, the clearance of amyloid-β <b>peptides</b> is lower, which allows the <b>peptides</b> to accumulate and create plaques in the brain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is an {{increasing}} usage of ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IMMS) in proteomics. IMMS combines the features of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and mass spectrometry (MS). It separates and detects <b>peptide</b> ions on a millisecond time-scale. IMS separates <b>peptide</b> ions based on drift time that {{is determined by the}} collision cross-section of each <b>peptide</b> ion in a given experiment condition. A <b>peptide</b> ion's collision cross-section is related to the ion size and shape resulted from the <b>peptide</b> amino acid sequence and their modifications. This inherent relation between the drift time of <b>peptide</b> ion and <b>peptide</b> sequence indicates that the drift time of <b>peptide</b> ions can be used to infer <b>peptide</b> sequence and therefore, for <b>peptide</b> identification. Results This paper describes an artificial neural networks (ANNs) regression model for the prediction of <b>peptide</b> ion drift time in IMMS. Each <b>peptide</b> in this work was represented using three descriptors (i. e., molecular weight, sequence length and a two-dimensional sequence index). An ANN predictor consisting of four input nodes, three hidden nodes and one output node was constructed for <b>peptide</b> ion drift time prediction. For the model training and testing, a 10 -fold cross-validation strategy was employed for three datasets each containing different charge states. Dataset one contains 212 singly-charged <b>peptide</b> ions, dataset two has 306 doubly-charged <b>peptide</b> ions, and dataset three has 77 triply-charged <b>peptide</b> ions. Our proposed method achieved 94. 4 %, 93. 6 % and 74. 2 % prediction accuracy for singly-, doubly- and triply-charged <b>peptide</b> ions, respectively. Conclusions An ANN-based method has been developed for predicting the drift time of <b>peptide</b> ions in IMMS. The results achieved here demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the prediction model. This work can enhance the confidence of protein identification by combining with current database search approaches for protein identification. </p...|$|R

40|$|Although {{proteins}} consist exclusively of L-amino acids, we {{have reported}} that aspartyl (Asp) 58 and Asp 151 residues of αA-crystallin of eye lenses from elderly cataract donors are highly inverted and isomerized to D-β, D-α and L-β-Asp residues through succinimide intermediates. Of these Asp isomers, large amounts of D-β- and L-β-isomers are present but the amount of D-α-isomer is not significant.
