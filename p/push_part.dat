40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe primary purpose of material control strategies such as MRP/push and Kanban/pull is to provide an efficient mechanism for determining the way production is triggered and inventory is controlled on the manufacturing shop floor. Both types of production control systems have advantages and disadvantages, thus it would be valuable to integrate both types to utilize their advantages. This research explores {{the question of whether}} each part type should have its own junction point (less constrained) or whether there should be one common junction point for the overall system (easier to implement). In this research a hybrid push/pull production control strategy is applied to Fork/Join Queuing manufacturing systems (FJQNs) with multiple part types. Certain parts of the system will be controlled using a push mechanism and the other parts will be controlled using a pull mechanism. The system is optimized by locating points of integration, and determining the optimal values of safety stocks for the <b>push</b> <b>part</b> and numbers of Kanbans for the pull part. The number of possible combinations of values of these variables exceeds 1014 in the moderate-sized motivating example in this research and so a solution strategy is required. A specialized genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain optimal solution for this large-scale problem. A modification of the GA chromosomes and crossover process is developed for the optimization. The optimization involves evaluations of the stochastic variables by a discrete event simulation model. Tunable software that integrates GA and computer simulation is developed. An algorithm based on the adjacency matrix of a directed graph is proposed to generate all push/pull points of integration for any Fork/Join Queuing Network (FJQN). Two motivating case studies from an aerospace manufacturer are presented. First a multiproduct multistage serial manufacturing system of a tube shop is analyzed. Second, a Landing gear assembly line, is modeled as a FJQN and analyzed...|$|E

50|$|In the Miller-cycle engine, {{the piston}} begins to {{compress}} the fuel-air mixture {{only after the}} intake valve closes; and the intake valve closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total piston travel of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the fuel-air mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the compression stroke. During the initial part of the compression stroke, the piston <b>pushes</b> <b>part</b> of the fuel-air mixture through the still-open intake valve, {{and back into the}} intake manifold.|$|R

40|$|Biorefinery of {{sunflower}} whole {{plant can}} be conducted with water using a nine modules Clextral Evolum HT 53 twin-screw extruder (TSE). Aqueous extraction of oil is an environmentally cleaner alternative technology to solvent extraction. TSE carries out three unit operations: conditioning and grinding, liquid/solid (L/S) extraction and L/S separation. The compressing {{action by the}} reverse screws (CF 2 C) is essential for L/S separation. Positioned in module 9, CF 2 C screws <b>push</b> <b>part</b> of the mixture upstream against the general movement in TSE, and this counter pressure ensures the L/S separation efficiency above the metal filter, located in eighth position. Oil is extracted {{in the form of}} two emulsions, stabilized by phospholipids and proteins, and usable as co-emulsifiers in cosmetic industry. An aqueous extract containing water-soluble components from whole plant is also generated; it could be recycled. As a mixture of fibers and proteins, the cake can be moulded by thermo-pressing into boards, usable in the furniture and building industries. In this study, fractionation was conducted from next inlet flow rates: 54 kg/h solid and 183 kg/h water (3. 4 L/S ratio). The screw speed varied from 249 to 124 rpm, corresponding to a filling coefficient (ratio of the solid inlet flow rate to the screw speed) from 217 to 436 g/h rpm. The filling coefficient directly affects the L/S separation efficiency. The latter can be estimated from next experimental data: the outlet flow rates of both cake and filtrate, the cake moisture content, the residual contents of oil and water-soluble components in the cake, and the extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and water-soluble components. For low filling coefficients (i. e. high screw speed), the L/S mixture compression in CF 2 C screws is insufficient, not allowing a satisfactory L/S separation. Conversely, for high filling coefficients (i. e. low screw speed), solid particles accumulate more upstream from the pressing zone, obstructing part of the filtering screens and thus reducing the filtration surface. A less efficient L/S separation is then observed. From the experimental data evolution, optimal screw speed was estimated at 182 rpm using a second order polynomial regression, corresponding to a filling coefficient of 297 g/h rpm. Extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and water-soluble components were 22 %, 49 % and 40 %, respectively. Such filling would lead to a specific mechanical energy of 103 W/h kg whole plant processed...|$|E
40|$|Bending {{actuators}} of {{a proposed}} type would partly resemble ordinary bending actuators, but would include simple additional components that would render them capable of exerting large forces at small displacements. Like an ordinary bending actuator, an actuator according to the proposal would include a thin rectangular strip that would comprise two bonded layers (possibly made of electroactive polymers with surface electrodes) and would be clamped at one end {{in the manner of}} a cantilever beam. Unlike an ordinary bending actuator, the proposed device would include a rigid flat backplate that would support part of the bending strip against backward displacement; because of this feature, the proposed device is called a backed bending actuator. When an ordinary bending actuator is inactive, the strip typically lies flat, the tip displacement is zero, and the force exerted by the tip is zero. During activation, the tip exerts a transverse force and undergoes a bending displacement that results from the expansion or contraction of one or more of the bonded layers. The tip force of an ordinary bending actuator is inversely proportional to its length; hence, a long actuator tends to be weak. The figure depicts an ordinary bending actuator and the corresponding backed bending actuator. The bending, the tip displacement (d(sub t)), and the tip force (F) exerted by the ordinary bending actuator are well approximated by the conventional equations for the loading and deflection of a cantilever beam subject to a bending moment which, in this case, is applied by the differential expansion or contraction of the bonded layers. The bending, displacement, and tip force of the backed bending actuator are calculated similarly, except that it is necessary to account for the fact that the force F(sub b) that resists the displacement of the tip could be sufficient to <b>push</b> <b>part</b> of the strip against the backplate; in such a condition, the cantilever beam would be effectively shortened (length L*) and thereby stiffened and, hence, made capable of exerting a greater tip force for a given degree of differential expansion or contraction of the bonded layers. Taking all of these effects into account, the cantilever-beam equations show that F(sub b) would be approximately inversely proportional to d(sup 1 / 2) for d less than a calculable amount, denoted the transition displacement (dt). For d less than d(sub t), part of the strip would be pressed against the backplate. Therefore, the force F(sub b) would be very large for d at or near zero and would decrease as d increases toward d(sub t). At d greater than d(sub t), none of the strip would be pressed against the backplate and F(sub b) would equal the tip force F of the corresponding ordinary bending actuator. The advantage of the proposal is that a backed bending actuator could be made long to obtain large displacement when it encountered little resistance but it could also exert a large zero-displacement force, so that it could more easily start the movement of a large mass, throw a mechanical switch, or release a stuck mechanism...|$|E

40|$|A key recent {{theme in}} {{maritime}} freight transport is {{the involvement of}} shipping lines in terminal management. Such investments are costly but allow liners to provide better service.

In this way, the liner investor <b>pushes</b> <b>part</b> of the rival's freight from the open to the new terminal.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a microfluidic pump operated by an asymmetrically deformed membrane, which {{was inspired by}} caterpillar locomotion. Almost all mechanical micropumps consist of two major components of fluid halting and fluid <b>pushing</b> <b>parts,</b> whereas the proposed caterpillar locomotion-inspired micropump has only a single, bilaterally symmetric membrane-like teardrop shape. A teardrop-shaped elastomeric membrane was asymmetrically deformed and then consecutively touched {{down to the bottom}} of the chamber in response to pneumatic pressure, thus achieving fluid pushing. Consecutive touchdown motions of the teardrop-shaped membrane mimicked the propagation of a caterpillar's hump during its locomotory gait. The initial touchdown motion of the teardrop-shaped membrane at the centroid worked as a valve that blocked the inlet channel, and then, the consecutive touchdown motions pushed fluid in the chamber toward the tail of the chamber connected to the outlet channel. The propagation of the touchdown motion of the teardrop-shaped membrane was investigated using computational analysis as well as experimental studies. This caterpillar locomotion-inspired micropump composed of only a single membrane can provide new opportunities for simple integration of microfluidic systems. © the Partner Organisations 2014...|$|R
