40|$|This article {{continues}} in Part II by defining predatory lending practices, identifying borrowers {{who are likely}} to face predatory lenders, and discussing the consequences of predatory lending. Next, Part III provides a background for existing federal regulation, again in reference to RESPA and TILA. Part IV discusses state legislative efforts to curb predatory lending and identifies the problems of inconsistency and federal exemptions that undermine these state statutes. Part V examines the elements of state consumer protection acts and unfair and deceptive acts or practices (2 ̆ 2 UDAP 2 ̆ 2) statutes and their application to predatory practices. Part VI argues that, because consumer protection statutes have nearly uniform elements in all states, such statutes provide significant <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>borrowers</b> and have a considerable effect on curbing abuses in the mortgage industry. Thus, consumer protection statutes represent an effective alternative to weakened federal and state predatory lending statutes. Part VII concludes this article with the recommendation that predatory lending victims utilize the protection afforded by state consumer protection and UDAP statutes to hold predatory brokers and lenders responsible for engaging in predatory practices...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the idea of}} neutral counseling {{as a measure of}} improving decisions of borrowers when choosing a mortgage loan. The developments regarding foreign-currency mortgage loans, popular in Central and Eastern Europe in recent years, illustrate how incorrect mortgage choices may have detrimental effects on borrowers and their families. Taking a skeptical approach toward mandated pre-contractual disclosure as a <b>protection</b> measure <b>for</b> <b>borrowers,</b> the paper advocates neutral counseling of mortgage applicants in case they are offered risky types of mortgages. Drawing on the experience of an American mortgage counseling programme, a set of recommendations is made regarding the design of a possible neutral mortgage counseling scheme. While the counseling solution has imminent limitations, it displays clear potential toward improving the process of financial decision-making...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{home loan}} market is failing in {{spectacular}} fashion. A housing bubble created partly by lax consumer protection laws has burst, sending delinquencies and foreclosures soaring and hobbling the national economy. While Oregon {{has so far}} avoided {{the worst of the}} crisis, recent trends are worrisome. Home prices have turned negative in a rising share of neighborhoods and delinquencies are surging. Oregon's housing troubles may only get worse. Driving the housing market's collapse are subprime loans, high-cost loans often issued to borrowers with impaired or no credit history. As of the third quarter of 2007, payment was past due on more than one in ten subprime loans in Oregon, and the delinquency rate on these loans was rising. Policymakers and elected leaders can best ameliorate the impact of rising subprime delinquencies if they know where subprime loans are concentrated. For instance, the Oregon Legislative Assembly is debating HB 3630, which would establish new consumer <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> <b>borrowers</b> facing foreclosure. If the bill becomes law, legislators and the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services could target public education efforts about the new law in neighborhoods at higher risk for foreclosures. But where are the potential trouble spots? OCPP has developed maps showing the concentration of subprime loans by census tract for each state legislative district (see appendix). Among legislative districts with the highest share of subprime mortgage originations in 2006 were those of legislative leaders: Senate President Peter Courtney (36. 9 percent), Senate Republican Leader Ted Ferrioli (31. 4 percent), and House Speaker Jeff Merkley (35. 7 percent). Even in the district with the lowest share of subprime loans, Representative Sara Gelser's House District 16, one in eight residents who took out a home loan in 2006 (13. 0 percent) received a subprime loan. Of course, factors besides subprime loans impact the foreclosure rate. These include declining home prices, a weak local economy, or a high concentration of risky mortgage products besides subprime loans. But with subprime loan delinquencies already high and rising, census tracts in which these loans are concentrated should concern policymakers and those seeking to ameliorate the problem through public education and other means...|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} this {{reference}} to [...] "3000 years" [...] {{is that in a}} primitive protective measure, the common law said mortgage terms must always allow for the property to be redeemed in the end, when the debt is repaid. In the 18th century decision of Vernon v Bethell Lord Henley LC refused to enforce the conveyance of Vernon's sugar plantation in Antigua to a deceased London lender, Bethell, when Vernon had trouble repaying, even though some exchanges between the two had raised the possibility of giving up the land to satisfy the debt. Given the considerable interest paid already, Lord Henley LC held it would frustrate (or [...] "clog") Vernon's right to redeem property. As he put it <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> the <b>borrower</b> was warranted because [...] "necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men, but, to answer a present exigency, will submit to any terms that the crafty may impose upon them". Accordingly, the rule developed that [...] "once a mortgage, always a mortgage", meaning a mortgage cannot be turned into a conveyance of the property by the operation of terms in an agreement. It means that a lender may at most sell a property to realise its value, but may not take ownership, and the borrower must always practically be able to get back the property. The rule was suspended for companies by the Companies Act 2006 section 739, and was criticised in Jones v Morgan for being inappropriate in commerce, but it still survives as a rudimentary common law method to protecting vulnerable borrowers.|$|R

40|$|We use a large matched {{sample of}} {{individual}} loans, borrowers, and banks {{to investigate whether}} bank financial health affects terms of lending, holding constant proxies <b>for</b> <b>borrower</b> risk and information costs. In particular, we focus on measuring effects of borrower and bank characteristics on loan interest rates; we also investigate implications of borrower and bank characteristics for indirect measures of credit availability.; Our principal findings are six. First, even after controlling <b>for</b> proxies <b>for</b> <b>borrower</b> risk and information costs, the cost of borrowing from low-capital banks {{is higher than the}} cost of borrowing from well-capitalized banks. Second, this cost difference is traceable to <b>borrowers</b> <b>for</b> which information costs and incentive problems are a piori important. Third, weak bank effects on the cost of funds are higher in periods of aggregate contractions in bank lending. Fourth, estimated weak bank effects remain even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in the matching of borrowers and banks. Fifth, weak bank effects are quantitatively important only <b>for</b> high-information-cost <b>borrowers,</b> consistent with models of switching costs in bank-borrower relationships and with the underpinnings of the bank lending channel of monetary policy. Sixth, when we investigate determinants of cash holdings of borrowing firms, we find that firms facing high information costs hold more cash than other firms, all else being equal, and those firms (and only those firms) have higher cash holdings when they are loan customers of weak banks. These results suggest declines in banks' financial health can lead to "precautionary saving" by some firms, a response which may affect their investment spending.; This evidence sheds light on two sets of questions. First, our estimated effects of bank characteristics on borrowing cost are consistent with models of switching costs <b>for</b> <b>borrowers</b> <b>for</b> whom banking relationships are most valuable. Second, our findings are consistent with switching costs <b>for</b> the <b>borrowers</b> stressed by the "bank lending channel" of monetary policy. Bank loans; Interest rates; Bank capital...|$|R
