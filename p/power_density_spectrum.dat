50|$|Fluctuation-enhanced sensing (FES) is a {{specific}} type of chemical or biological sensing where the stochastic component, noise, of the sensor signal is analyzed. The stages following the sensor in a FES system typically contain filters and preamplifier(s) to extract and amplify the stochastic signal components, which are usually microscopic temporal fluctuations that are orders of magnitude weaker than the sensor signal. Then selected statistical properties of the amplified noise are analyzed, and a corresponding pattern is generated as the stochastic fingerprint of the sensed agent. Often the <b>power</b> <b>density</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the stochastic signal is used as output pattern however FES has been proven effective with more advanced methods, too, such as higher-order statistics.|$|E

40|$|Context: Low mass X-ray {{binaries}} {{were found}} to have very low frequency breaks in their <b>power</b> <b>density</b> <b>spectra</b> below which the <b>power</b> <b>density</b> <b>spectra</b> are nearly in white noise structure and at higher frequencies they approximately follow the P_ν∝ν^- 1. 3 law. Aims: In 2005, Gilfanov and Arefiev studied X-ray variability of persistent LMXBs in the 10 ^- 8 - 10 ^- 1 Hz frequency range and To determine whether high mass X-ray binary <b>power</b> <b>density</b> <b>spectra</b> have similar properties and the findings for low mass X-ray binaries are also valid for high mass binaries, we analyzed the time series of high mass X-ray binary sources produced by All Sky Monitor of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Method: We obtained the <b>power</b> <b>density</b> <b>spectra</b> of the high mass X-ray binaries using the cosine transform of autocorrelation function. Results: We identified break frequencies for seven sources, namely OAO 1657 - 415, SS 433, Vela X- 1, SMC X- 1, 4 U 1700 - 377, GX 301 - 2, and LMC X- 1. The normalized break frequencies with respect to the orbital frequency (f_break/f_orbit) for sources OAO 1657 - 415, SS 433, SMC X- 1 and LMC X- 1 are consistent with those of Roche lobe overflow systems. The other high mass X-ray binary systems, Vela X- 1, GX 301 - 2, and 4 U 1700 - 377, however, have larger break frequency ratios, f_break/f_orb, which are indicative of short viscous times. These are all wind-accreting sources and the stellar winds in the systems allow the formation of only short radius discs. Consequently, we qualitatively distinguished the Roche lobe overflow binaries from the wind accreting system by comparing their normalized break frequencies.

5000|$|SEPTIC {{utilizes}} bacteriophages {{as indicators}} to trigger an ionic response by the bacteria during phage infection. Microscopic metal electrodes detect the random fluctuations of the electrochemical potential {{due to the}} stochastic fluctuations of the ionic concentration gradient caused by the phage infection of bacteria. The electrode pair in the electrolyte with different local ion concentrations at the vicinity of electrodes form an electrochemical cell that produces a voltage depending on the instantaneous ratio of local concentrations. While the concentrations are fluctuating, an alternating random voltage difference will appear between the electrodes.

50|$|The {{measurement}} of 1/f noise spectrum in voltage or current {{is done in}} the same way as the {{measurement of}} other types of noises. Sampling spectrum analyzers take a finite-time sample from the noise and calculate the Fourier transform by FFT algorithm. Then, after calculating the squared absolute value of the Fourier spectrum, they calculate its average value by repeating this sampling process by a sufficiently large number of times. The resulting pattern is proportional to the power-density spectrum of the measured noise. It is then normalized by the duration of the finite-time sample and also by a numerical constant in the order of 1 to get its exact value. This procedure gives correct spectral data only deeply within the frequency window determined by the reciprocal of the duration of the finite-time sample (low-frequency end) and the digital sampling rate of the noise (high-frequency end). Thus the upper and the lower half decades of the obtained <b>power</b> <b>density</b> <b>spectrum</b> are usually discarded from the spectrum. Conventional spectrum analyzers that sweep a narrow filtered band over the signal have good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), since they are narrow-band instruments. Unfortunately, these instruments do not operate at frequencies low enough to fully measure flicker noise. Sampling instruments are broadband, and hence high noise. They reduce the noise by taking multiple sample traces and averaging them. Conventional spectrum analyzers still have better SNR due to their narrow-band acquisition.|$|E
