He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>director,</b> appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts to charm some of the elderly women into doing his work fails miserably, as they ignore him and all adore Andy.|$|E
5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>director</b> was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E

5|$|Chris (Rob Lowe) has fired Denis Cooper, {{the former}} health {{department}} <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>director,</b> who hung posters around city hall to publicly condemn his adulterous wife. Leslie (Amy Poehler) suggests Ann (Rashida Jones) replace him, mainly {{because they can}} spend more time together, since Ann has been so busy dating numerous men. Although reluctant to leave {{her job as a}} nurse, Ann agrees to attend the job interview, and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it. Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge, a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage, Snake Juice. Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing. April (Aubrey Plaza) shows little interest in attending, until Andy (Chris Pratt) suggests they make a game of it by role-playing as different people at the bar. April pretends to be Janet Snakehole, an aristocratic widow with a dark secret, while Andy poses as his frequent alter-ego, FBI agent Burt Macklin.|$|E
5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who {{said that if he}} were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>director</b> was Eisenhower's personal assistant.
