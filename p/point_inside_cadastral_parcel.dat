The core –and always available– entity of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcels</b> schema is the <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Parcel.</b> The other three entities are Cadastral Zoning (the intermediary areas used to divide the national territory into <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcels),</b> <b>Cadastral</b> Boundary (part of {{the outline of a}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcel)</b> and Basic Property Unit (the basic unit of properties which may consist of one or more parcels), and are to be provided under certain circumstances. Each entity consists of three kinds of attributes: the obligatory, the voidable and the information about time (also voidable). The voidable characteristics in the INSPIRE context are ‘those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial datasets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world’.|$|R

Moreover it seems that all obligatory data are either present in the current model or can easily be created from the existing ones and be maintained from that moment onwards. This means that INSPIRE can be regarded as a subset of HC and the transition from the HC spatial model to an INSPIRE-compliant one can be performed in an automated way. Furthermore, the strict modelling of the <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Parcels,</b> allows for an easy and at all times harmonised creation of metadata that will allow data users to evaluate the adequacy of the data provided and examine whether they are fit for purpose.

This document includes two executive summaries that provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, {{and the content of}} the data specification on <b>Cadastral</b> <b>parcels</b> in particular.

The definition of the spatial objects, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue in 5. 1. 2. People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue.

The Helmert method is employed for the estimation of variance components of these two types of observations, thus providing a determination of accurate weights between them. At the same time, inconsistencies between the registered and digitized areas of the parcels are adjusted through a least-squares adjustment. The mathematical models for adjusting the boundaries of the parcel areas are derived, incorporating both the area conditions and geometric conditions. An empirical test is conducted and the results are compared to those obtained from the conventional method, assuming that the digitized coordinates are treated as observations while the registered parcel areas are not. The analysis of the results demonstrates that the least-squares adjustment, when based on Helmert's variance component estimates, refinds the weights of the observations more accurately, improves the accuracy of the adjusted coordinates in parcel digitization, and resolves the inconsistencies between the registered areas and digitized areas of the parcels more rigorously.

40|$|In this paper, a least-squares based <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcel</b> area {{adjustment}} in geographic information systems (GIS) is developed based on (1) both the areas and coordinates {{being treated as}} observations with errors; and (2) scale parameters being introduced to take the systematic effect into account {{in the process of}} cadastral map digitization. The area condition equation for <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcel</b> considerations of scale parameters and geometric constraints is first constructed. The effects of the scale error on area adjustment results are then derived, and statistical hypothesis testing is presented to determine the significance of the scale error. Afterwards, Helmert's variance component estimation based on least-squares adjustment using the condition equation with additional parameters is proposed to determine the weight between the coordinate and area measurements of the parcel. Practical tests are conducted to illustrate the implementation of the proposed methods. Four schemes for solving the inconsistencies between the registered areas and the digitized areas of the parcels are studied. The analysis of the results demonstrates {{that in the case of}} significant systematic errors in cadastral map digitization, the accuracies of the adjusted coordinates and areas are improved by introducing scale parameters to reduce the systematic error influence in the parcel area adjustment. Meanwhile, Helmert's variance component estimation method determines more accurate weights of the digitized coordinates and parcel areas, and the least-squares adjustment solves the inconsistencies between the registered areas and the digitized areas of the parcels.

When agricultural land is highly in demand and agriculture land becomes scarce, the government land, mostly forest areas are being encroached for this purpose. The forest encroachment which include cutting down trees on hill slopes, can cause {{negative impact on}} forested area in Cameron Highlands including Mentigi Forest Reserved (MFR) area, which also serve as water catchment area. This study is to detect and assess this encroachment especially that caused by agricultural activity in MFR area and its surrounding, using remote sensing datasets and <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcel.</b> The hybrid classification method was applied on remote sensing images to classify the land-cover types in the study area. <b>Cadastral</b> <b>parcel</b> {{was used as a}} reference for forest reserve area boundary to detect some agricultural activities inside the forest reserve area. The findings reveal that around 8. 75 ha of forest encroachment was detected using SPOT 5 image of year 2010, and 2. 98 ha were detected using IKONOS image of year 2001. It was found that most of the encroachments were meant for agricultural purpose. Accuracy of the extracted forest boundaries from satellite images was assessed using the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE). The displacement value for IKONOS and SPOT 5 were 8. 11 m and 12. 99 m respectively. These errors were further reduced using buffer zones that was applied to reduce the error effect on encroachment detection. This method was also applied to the entire subset of satellites image to identify encroachment areas inside the forest reserve and surrounding areas. Results of this analysis show that forest encroachment occurred inside MFR area despite its relatively small size.

40|$|The Dough Rule, in Turkish Land Law terminology, is a {{technical}} approach to readjust land resources in urban and agricultural areas. The Regulation on the 18 th Article of the Land and Building Development Law defines the procedures of land readjustment. The procedure is as follows: First obtain cadastral land resources and ownership records and then overlay graphic information {{on top of}} zoning plans, later allocate the land resources to the relevant owners after proportional deduction for public uses, such as schools, roads, and parks. In many cases, in the allocation process, relevant parties compete for higher-value urban lots, and the resulting allocation scheme is taken to court. In this study, the primary goal is to develop techniques to handle the difficulties in land readjustment and reallocation practices in Turkey. The developed techniques contain three authentic features: The first feature is the original mathematical models based on operation research techniques. In this feature, there are two Linear Programing (LP) and one Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models reallocating <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcel</b> areas into standard high quality urban subdivision lot(s) after proportional deduction of public land uses from all landowners under {{the frame of the}} Regulation on the 18 th Article. The second feature is the evaluation criteria which are developed to present superiority of the optimization models over the existing expert based subjective practices in land reallocation. Those criteria are defined in the form of equations utilizing the allocation results (objective and subjective). The third feature is the graphical presentation of allocation results in a system of rays from <b>cadastral</b> <b>parcel</b> centroids to urban subdivision lot centroids. This provides a succinct way of visual comparison among alternative allocation results. Over a case study area, first, the optimization techniques are applied, then, the obtained results are evaluated via the evaluation criteria, and later visually presented by the ray based allocation/transfer diagrams. Finally superiority of the developed techniques are discussed for further sophistications...|$|R

It uses a constrained triangulation as a support for the validation, and permits us to avoid different problems that arise with existing solutions based on the construction of a planar graph.
