30|$|From {{the set of}} {{relevant}} papers associated to the input sequences we extract a set of MeSH terms appearing in these <b>papers.</b> <b>We</b> then search the MEDLINE database for the papers that have the MeSH terms {{in common with the}} set’s. Since the whole MEDLINE has a huge number of <b>papers,</b> <b>we</b> use the MeSH terms as a filter to reduce the initial volume of data to a reduced potentially relevant number of <b>papers.</b> Thus <b>we</b> create a MEDLINE sample with papers for classification, that are, somehow related to the introduced sequences because they possess the highest number of MeSH terms in common with the relevant <b>papers</b> <b>we</b> have so far. With this we construct a data set of papers to be given to the classifier for classification. After classification we get a set of papers classified as relevant. To this data set {{of relevant}} <b>papers</b> <b>we</b> add a random set of 50 papers, extracted from the set of papers associated to the similar sequences, associated themselves in the first step with the initial sequences entered by the biologist. This procedure was only performed in the experiments intending to decide on the components of the ranking function. The procedure is not performed in the current use of the tool.|$|R
