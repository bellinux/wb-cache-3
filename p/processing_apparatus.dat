50|$|STS-37 Atlantis (April 5-April 11, 1991) was {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, {{and returned to}} land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 93 orbits of the mission, the crew deployed the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) to study gamma ray sources in the universe. GRO, at almost 35,000 pounds (16 Mg), was the heaviest payload deployed to date by the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The crew also conducted an unscheduled space walk to free the GRO high gain antenna, and conducted the first scheduled extravehicular activity in 5½ years to test concepts for moving about large space structures. Several middeck experiments and activities were conducted including test of elements of a heat pipe to study fluid transfer processed in microgravity environments (SHARE), a chemical <b>processing</b> <b>apparatus</b> to characterize the structure of biological materials (BIMDA), and an experiment to grow larger and more perfect protein crystals than can be grown on the ground (PCG II). Atlantis carried amateur radio equipment for voice contact, fast scan and slow scan TV, and packet radio. Several hundred contacts were made with amateur radio operators around the world. Mission duration was 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an in vitro transcription system, using HeLa nuclear extract, that supports not only efficient splicing of a multiexon transcript but also efficient cleavage and polyadenylation. In this system, both last-intron splicing and cleavage/polyadenylation are functionally coupled to transcription via the tether of nascent RNA that extends from the terminal exon to the transcribing polymerase downstream. Communication between the 3 ′ splice site and the poly(A) site across the terminal exon is established within minutes of their transcription, and multiple steps leading up to 3 ′-end processing of this exon can be distinguished. First, the 3 ′ splice site establishes connections to enhance 3 ′-end processing, while the nascent 3 ′-end <b>processing</b> <b>apparatus</b> makes reciprocal functional connections to enhance splicing.

The statistical approaches are expected to consider different aspects of dissolution including drug formulation, packaging, <b>processing,</b> storage, dissolution <b>apparatus,</b> and analytical systems thereof in simulation. The statistical approach has to take temperature and relative humidity ranges in consideration for successfully simulating a dissolution profile. One such example of statistical tools is ASAPprime®, which was presented (Li et al. 2016) for predicting the stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in solid-dosage forms as well as the slow-down in dissolution of two APIs in an immediate release tablet. ASAPprime® based modeling, that uses a relative humidity-modified Arrhenius equation, efficiently determined the effects of temperature (T in K) and relative humidity (RH) ranges on dissolution for different storage times. As with chemical stability, water activity rather than water content of the tablet was found to be critical, with the overall impact of T and RH following a modified Arrhenius behavior.|$|R
