40|$|The {{favorable}} {{position that}} 1 -isonicotinyl- 2 -isopropyl hydrazine (iproniazid) has occupied {{in the field}} of antidepressant therapy has given rise to the concept that the pharmacologic effects of the drug derive from its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase activity. This has led to the widespread use of drugs which inhibit monoamine oxidase as research tools and as possible thera-peutic agents in conditions of <b>psychic</b> <b>depression</b> and other clinical diseases. Since monoamine oxidase is considered {{to play a major role}} in the physiologic inactivation of serotonin and nor-epinephrine in the brain (Shore et al., 1957; Davison, 1958), the pharmacologic activity of these drugs is generally associated with the me-tabolism of these amines. Recently trans- 2 -phenylcyclopropylamine (SKF 385) was shown to be a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (Maass and Nimmo, 1959) and to possess marked central stimulatory properties (Tedesehi et al., 1959). The present report describes the effect of oral administration of SKF 385 upon the mono-amine oxidase activity and norepinephrine con-centration of rat brain. METHODS. Trans- 2 -phenylcyclopropylamine HC 1 and 1 -isonicotinyl- 2 -isopropyl hydrazine phosphate (iproniazid) were dissolved in H,O and administered orally in volumes of 1. 5 to 3. 0 ml by stomach tube to fasted albino rats weigh-ing between 100 and 150 g.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the prevalence and associated factors of steep cornea/keratoconus {{in the adult}} Chinese population. METHODS: The population-based Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals {{with a mean age}} of 64. 6 ± 9. 8 years (range: 50 - 93 years). A detailed ophthalmic examination was performed including optical low-coherence reflectometry. Steep cornea/keratoconus were defined as an anterior corneal refractive power exceeding 48 diopters. RESULTS: Mean refractive power of the cornea was 43. 16 ± 1. 45 diopters (range: 36. 51 to 48. 46 diopters; flattest meridian) and 43. 98 ± 1. 52 diopters (range: 37. 00 to 52. 88 diopters; steepest meridian). A steep cornea/keratoconus defined as corneal refractive power of ≥ 48 diopters and ≥ 49 diopters was detected in 27 subjects (prevalence rate: 0. 9 ± 0. 2 %) and 6 (0. 2 ± 0. 1 %) subjects, respectively. Presence of steep cornea/keratoconus was associated with shorter axial length (P< 0. 001), smaller interpupillary distance (P =  0. 038), lower best corrected visual acuity (P =  0. 021), higher cylindrical refractive error (P< 0. 001) and more myopic refractive error (P< 0. 001). It was not significantly associated with gender, body height, <b>psychic</b> <b>depression,</b> cognitive function, blood concentrations of glucose, lipids, creatinine and C-reactive protein, blood pressure and quality of life score, nor with intraocular pressure, dry eye feeling, and lens thickness. CONCLUSIONS: A steep cornea/keratoconus defined as corneal refractive power of 48 + diopters has a prevalence of 0. 9 ± 0. 2 % among Chinese aged 50 years and above. Its prevalence was significantly associated with the ocular parameters of shorter axial length, smaller interpupillary distance, higher cylindrical and myopic refractive error and lower best corrected visual acuity, however, with none of the systemic parameters tested...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chemotherapy {{efficacy}} {{in advanced}} non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients may be augmented if combined with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with anti-angiogenetic activity. Metronomic chemotherapy is a newest approach which employs cytotoxic drugs at lower doses with very close and regular administrations, which has shown anti-angiogenetic effects, epigenetic attenuation of cancer phenotype and immune-modulation. Metronomic chemotherapy with cisplatinum and oral etoposide (mPE) {{has been tested}} in NSCLC patients with promising results. We have thus investigated a newest biochemotherapy regimen with mPE + bevacizumab (mPEBev regimen) in advanced NSCLC patients. Methods: This is a phase IB/II trial designed to evaluate toxicity, anti-tumor and biological activity of bevacizumab given at escalating doses in combination with mPE chemotherapy. Twenty-six patients with inoperable NSCLC and an ECOG≤ 2 {{were enrolled in the}} study and received every 21 days, iv. cisplatinum (30 mg/sqm, days 1 - 3), oral etoposide (50 mg/sqm, days 1 - 15) and bevacizumab (day 3) at different dose levels (no antibody/control group; 2. 5; 5; 7. 5; and 10 mg/kg). Results: The treatment resulted very active in those patients who received bevacizumab with a 95 % objective response rate (19 / 20), with a median time to progression of 7. 55 months. There were two early deaths at higher bevacizumab dosages: one due to a cardiovascular accident (7. 5 mg/kg) and another to lung hemorrhage (10 mg/kg). We reported also 4 cases of <b>psychic</b> <b>depression</b> and 4 cases of pneumonia which evolved into lung cavitation. A magnetic resonance monitoring showed a significant treatment-related blood perfusion reduction in the tumor site. It was also observed a progressive decrease in VEGF, thrombospondin- 1 levels which were not dependent upon bevacizumab dose and were not observed in the controls. Conclusions: mPEBev regimen resulted very active in advanced NSCLC patients. Our metronomic biochemotherapy regimen with lower bevacizumab doses (2. 5 - 5 mg/Kg) deserves to be investigated in further phase II-III trials...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Depression {{and anxiety}} in {{patients}} with coronary heart disease (CHD) {{are associated with a}} poorer prognosis. Therefore the screening for psychological distress is strongly recommended in cardiac rehabilitation. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a widely used screening tool that has demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity for mental disorders. Methods We assessed mental distress in in-patient cardiac rehabilitation in Germany. The factor structure of the German language version of the HADS was investigated in 1320 patients with CHD. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to determine the underlying factor structure of the instrument. Results Three-factor models were found to offer a superior fit to the data compared to two-factor (anxiety and depression) models. The German language HADS performs similarly to the English language version of the instrument in CHD patients. The German language HADS fundamentally comprises a tri-dimensional underlying factor structure (labelled by Friedman et al. as psychomotor agitation, <b>psychic</b> anxiety and <b>depression).</b> Conclusion Despite of clinical usefulness in screening for mental disturbances the construct validity of the HADS is not clear. The resulting scores of the tri-dimensional model can be interpreted as psychomotor agitation, <b>psychic</b> anxiety, and <b>depression</b> in individual patient data or clinical investigations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{development}} of several effective treatments for depression, symptoms often persist {{in a number of}} individuals. Unfortunately, these residual symptoms are associated with several negative outcomes, including persistence of depressive illness. Few studies have examined the exact nature of individual residual symptoms across specific treatment modalities, and studies have failed to distinguish between depression courses. The current study expands on previous findings by examining, among a chronically depressed population, differences in individual residual symptoms and clusters between treatment modality (medication, psychotherapy, combination) and treatment response (full response, partial response). Five hundred and nineteen chronically depressed participants completed the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment with nefazodone, CBASP, or the combination of both. Residual symptoms were assessed with two depression severity ratings, a clinician administered interview and a self-report questionnaire. The frequency and severity of individual residual symptoms and clusters were examined between treatment and response groups. The emergence of symptoms after treatment was compared between treatment groups. Residual symptoms were common, reported in over 90 % of the sample. The most common residual symptoms reflected both core depressive symptoms and co-morbid symptoms not specific to depression. In general, similar residual symptoms were reported among partial and full responders. The only individual residual symptoms that differed between treatment groups were early insomnia, OCD symptoms, hopelessness, hypersomnia, concentration, and decreased libido. Treatment groups also differed on two factors of the HDRS. The Nefazodone group reported a greater number of Disturbed Thinking items than the CBASP group. The CBASP group reported more items on the <b>Psychic</b> <b>Depression</b> factor compared to the Nefazodone group for full responders only. Analyses revealed that the Nefazodone group was more likely to report the emergence of guilt and psychic anxiety after treatment than the CBASP and Combination group, and the emergence of weight loss occurred more frequently among participants in the Nefazodone and Combination groups when compared with the CBASP group. Results suggest residual weight loss may be a side effect of medication and CBASP may offer protection against {{the development}} of guilt and anxiety...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{conducted}} in community samples suggest that psychotic-like experiences {{are common in}} the general population, leading to suggestions that they are either variations of normal personality or are different expressions of underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorder. Different types of psychotic symptoms may exist, some being normal variants and some having implications for mental health and functioning. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine if different subtypes of psychotic-like experiences could be identified in a community sample of adolescents and to investigate if particular subtypes were more likely to be associated with psychosocial difficulties, that is, distress, depression and poor functioning, than other subtypes. Eight hundred and seventy-five Year 10 students from 34 schools participated in a cross-sectional survey that measured psychotic-like experiences using the Community Assessment of <b>Psychic</b> Experiences; <b>depression</b> using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; and psychosocial functioning using the Revised Multidimensional Assessment of Functioning Scale. Factor analysis was conducted to identify any subtypes of psychotic experiences. Four subtypes of psychotic-like experiences were identified: Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities, Persecutory Ideas, and Magical Thinking. Intermittent, infrequent psychotic experiences were common, but frequent experiences were not. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas were strongly associated with distress, depression and poor functioning. Magical Thinking was only weakly associated with these variables. Overall these findings may suggest that infrequent psychotic-like experiences are unlikely to be a specific risk factor for onset of a psychotic disorder in community samples. Given that the different subtypes had varying associations with current difficulties it is suggested that not all subtypes confer the same risk for onset of psychotic disorder and poor outcome. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas may represent expressions of underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorder, but Magical Thinking may be a normal personality variant...|$|R
50|$|According to the <b>psychic</b> pain hypothesis, <b>depression</b> is {{analogous}} to physical pain in that it informs the sufferer that current circumstances, such as {{the loss of a}} friend, are imposing a threat to biological fitness. It motivates the sufferer to cease activities that led to the costly situation, if possible, and it causes him or her to learn to avoid similar circumstances in the future. Proponents of this view tend to focus on low mood, and regard clinical depression as a dysfunctional extreme of low mood—and not as a unique set of characteristics that are physiologically distanced from regular depressed mood.Alongside the absence of pleasure, other noticeable changes include psychomotor retardation, disrupted patterns of sleeping and feeding, a loss of sex drive and motivation—which are all also characteristics of the body's reaction to actual physical pain. In depressed people there is an increased activity in the regions of the cortex involved with the perception of pain, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the left prefrontal cortex. This activity allows the cortex to manifest an abstract negative thought as a true physical stressor {{to the rest of the}} brain.|$|R
40|$|Cannabis {{remains the}} most {{commonly}} used illicit substance during adolescence, yet little is understood about the influences on changes in use patterns. There has been more focus on risk as compared to resilience in assessments of cannabis and psychopathology. This thesis aimed to assess self-reported factors influencing changes in patterns of cannabis use in adolescents, and to integrate resilience in the assessment of cannabis use, alcohol use, and psychopathology. A 6 -month prospective design involving a sample of 288 adolescents recruited from schools and from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services was utilised. Participants completed the Cannabis and Young People Questionnaire, Resilience Scale for Adolescents, Community Assessment of <b>Psychic</b> Experiences, and <b>Depression</b> Anxiety Stress Scales. Multiple factors influenced changes in cannabis use, with an overarching influence of peers. Cannabis use was not related to psychopathology, nor did it moderate the relationship between psychopathology and resilience. However personal competence emerged as a negative predictor of psychopathology. Level of social resources was the strongest negative predictor of alcohol use, and alcohol users had higher levels of depression. Therefore, there may be potential for utility of resilience factors, notably personal competence, and social resources in prevention and early intervention for mental health in adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Segundo Hawkley et al (2008;Savikko, Routasalo, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pitkala 2005, cit. in Cacioppo, Hawkley, & Thisted, 2010) existem uma série de fatores situacionais que aumentam o risco de solidão, nos mais idosos, fatores esses que associados às perdas contínuas, ao declínio físico e à maior presença de incapacidades propiciam, simultaneamente, a depressão nos mais idosos (Ballone, 2002, cit. in Martins, 2008), fazendo com que esta seja a alteração psiquiátrica mais frequente nesta faixa etária: dois em cada três seniores que vão à {{consulta}} externa de psiquiatria têm depressão (Mirchandani (1991, cit. in Martins, 2008). A solidão, por sua vez, tem vindo a ser associada a diversas doenças físicas e psíquicas (depressão e ansiedade) (DiTomaso & Spinner (1997, cit. in Fernandes & Neto, 2009) existindo mesmo diversos estudos que apontam a solidão como fator de risco para a morbilidade e mortalidade (Luo, Hawkley, C, Waite & Cacioppo, 2012). Assim sendo, e tendo por base a revisão bibliográfica, o objetivo da investigação foi investigar em que medida a solidão seria um fator de risco para a depressão, na terceira- idade. A amostra foi constituída por 100 idosos isolados, referenciados pela GNR e do distrito de Braga, sendo constituída por indivíduos de ambos os géneros, com um total de 77 mulheres (77 %) e 23 homens (23 %). Para a colheita de dados e, uma vez que, o que pretendemos avaliar com o estudo é a solidão e a depressão, na terceira- idade e em que medida existirá uma relação entre ambos, os instrumentos escolhidos foram o questionário sociodemográfico que permitiu fazer uma caracterização individual dos participantes, em seguida, a Escala de Solidão (UCLA) que avaliou a solidão, distinguindo-a de outros construtos e, por fim, a Escala Geriátrica da Depressão (GDS) que avaliou especificamente a sintomatologia depressiva. Os resultados do presente estudo revelaram uma relação significativa entre os sentimentos de solidão e depressão e que idosos que vivem sós têm níveis de solidão estatisticamente superiores aos que vivem acompanhados. A variável sociodemográfica género demostrou influência na depressão, mas não na solidão. According to Hawkley et al (2008;Savikko, Routasalo, Tilvis, Strandberg & Pitkala 2005, cit. in Cacioppo, Hawkley & Thisted, 2010) {{there are}} plenty of situational factors that increase the risk of loneliness on the most elderly people, factors that associated to continuous loses, to physical decline, and to the presence of disabilities propitiate, simultaneously, depression on elderly people (Ballone, 2002, Cit. in Martins, 2008), being this the most frequent psychic alteration at this age group: two in each three seniors that go to the external <b>psychic</b> appointment have <b>depression</b> (Mirchandani (1991, cit. in Martins, 2008). Loneliness, on the other hand, has been associated to several physical and <b>psychic</b> diseases (<b>depression</b> and anxiety) (DiTomaso & Spinner (1997, cit. in Fernandes & Neto, 2009), existing several studies that point loneliness as a risk fator to morbidity and mortality (Luo, Hawkley, C, Waite & Cacioppo, 2012). Therefore, and having as base the bibliographic review, the objetive {{of this study was to}} investigate in what dimension loneliness would be a risk fator to depression in third age. The sample is constituted by 100 isolated seniors, referenced by the GNR and the district of Braga, of both genders, with a total of 77 women (77 %) and 23 men (23 %). For the data collection, and once what we pretend to evaluate is loneliness and depression in third age and in what point there is a relation between both, the chosen instruments were the sociodemographic survey, which allowed making an individual characterization of the participants. Next the Scale of Loneliness (UCLA), which has evaluated loneliness distinguishing it of other constructs and, finally, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) that has specifically evaluated the depressive symptomatology. The results of the present study revealed a significant relation between the feelings of loneliness and depression and that the seniors that live alone have levels of loneliness statistically superiors to those who don’t live by themselves.

40|$|Depression in {{patients}} with mastocytosis is often reported but its prevalence and characteristics are not precisely described. In addition, the impact of therapies targeting mast cells proliferation, differentiation and degranulation on <b>psychic</b> symptoms of <b>depression</b> have never been investigated. Our objective {{was to determine the}} prevalence and to describe features of depression in a large cohort of mastocytosis patients (n =  288) and to investigate the therapeutic impact of the protein kinase inhibitor masitinib in depression symptoms. The description of depression was based on the analysis of a database with Hamilton scores using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Efficacy of masitinib therapy was evaluated using non parametric Wilcoxon test for paired data within a three months period (n =  35). Our results show that patients with indolent mastocytosis present an elevated prevalence of depression (64 %). Depression was moderate in 56 % but severe in 8 % of cases. Core symptoms (such as psychic anxiety, depressed mood, work and interests) characterized depression in mastocytosis patients. Masitinib therapy was associated with significant improvement (67 % of the cases) of overall depression, with 75 % of recovery cases. Global Quality of Life slightly improved after masitinib therapy and did not predicted depression improvement. In conclusion, depression is very frequent in mastocytosis patients and masitinib therapy is associated with the reduction its psychic experiences. We conclude that depression in mastocytosis may originate from processes related to mast cells activation. Masitinib could therefore be a useful treatment for mastocytosis patients with depression and anxiety symptoms...|$|R

La combinación que mejores resultados ha demostrado, es la de interferón con ribavirina, pero puede originar efectos adversos con dificultades para la adherencia al tratamiento que en ocasiones, incluso, obligan a suspenderlo. OBJETIVO: identificar las reacciones adversas del tratamiento de la combinación de interferón con ribavirina. MÉTODOS: se realizó un estudio de una serie de 13 pacientes con hepatitis crónica C, atendidos durante los años 2006 y 2007 en consulta especializada del Hospital Universitario "Vladimir Ilich Lenin" tratados con interferón alfa- 2 b humano recombinante y ribavirina (Heberviron). RESULTADOS: la fiebre, cefalea, escalofríos, astenia, mialgias y artralgias fueron los efectos adversos más frecuentes, así como síntomas digestivos: anorexia, náuseas, epigastralgia; psíquicos: depresión; hematológicos: anemia y leucopenia. Se observó hipotiroidismo asociado a un cuadro reumatoide en una paciente en la que fue necesario suspender el tratamiento, así como en uno con trombopenia y otro con leucopenia. CONCLUSIONES: al indicar tratamiento con Heberviron al paciente con hepatitis crónica C, hay que tener presente, la frecuencia y magnitud de los efectos secundarios, pues pueden interferir con la adherencia y la respuesta al tratamiento, y ocasionar un impacto negativo en la calidad de vida de los pacientes.

Design: The study design was a randomized controlled pilot trial with blinded assessors and three points of assessment: before intervention (baseline, T 0), at the end of treatment (T 1) and a 3 -months follow-up (T 2). Setting: Outpatient clinic. Patients: Patients from the waiting list of the Fibromyalgia day hospital program fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Intervention: During eight weeks, 14 sessions of EMG-biofeedback training versus usual care only. Outcome Measures and Analysis: For primary outcome, the disease specific health status was followed using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Secondary outcome measures comprise assessment of pain (Tender Point Score), tenderness (Tender Point Count = number of Tender Points, Pain Pressure Threshold), generic health status (SF- 36), Patients’ Global Clinical Impression of Change and <b>psychic</b> impact (Beck <b>depression</b> Inventory, Symptom Checklist 90 -Revised). Effects were analyzed with sensitivity statistics (effect size, ES), parametric and nonparametric tests. Results: The data of 36 patients with complete follow-up data could be analyzed. EMG-EMG-biofeedback did not improve health status of patients with Fibromyalgia (FIQ, T 1 : ES = 0. 02, p = 0. 95, T 2 : ES = 0. 26, p = 0. 43). Also, the secondary outcome measures, {{with the exception of the}} pressure pain threshold (T 1 : ES = 0. 26, p = 0. 014), showed no superiority of EMG-biofeedback in addition to usual care compared to usual care alone.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{neurological}} and non-neurological medical illnesses {{very often}} complain {{of depressive symptoms}} {{that are associated with}} cognitive and functional impairments. We compared the profile of depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with that of control subjects (CS) suffering from non-neurological medical illnesses. Methods: One-hundred PD patients and 100 CS were submitted to a structured clinical interview for identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) and minor depressive disorder (MIND), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), criteria. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were also administered to measure depression severity. Results: When considering the whole groups, there were no differences in depressive symptom frequency between PD and CS apart from worthlessness/guilt, and changes in appetite reduced rates in PD. Further, total scores and psychic and somatic subscores of HDRS and BDI did not differ between PD and CS. After we separated PD and CS in those with MDD, MIND, and no depression (NODEP), comparing total scores and psychic/somatic subscores of HDRS and BDI, we found increased total depression severity in NODEP PD and reduced severity of the <b>psychic</b> symptoms of <b>depression</b> in MDD PD, with no differences in MIND. However, the severity of individual symptom frequency of depression was not different between PD and CS in MDD, MIND, and NODEP groups. Conclusion: Although MDD and MIND phenomenology in PD may be very similar to that of CS with non-neurological medical illnesses, neurological symptoms of PD may worsen (or confound) depression severity in patients with no formal/structured DSM-IV-TR, diagnosis of depressive mood disorders. Thus, a thorough assessment of depression in PD should take into consideration the different impacts of neurological manifestations on MDD, MIND, and NODEP. © 2013 Assogna et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd...|$|R

A prospective design {{was used to compare}} patients' physical symptoms, emotional complaints, and restrictions at admission to the waiting list, immediately after, and 1 and 5 years after heart transplantation. Thirty-three patients were included (30 male, 3 female) in the study. Their mean age at admission was 48 +/- 10. 2 years. Of these, 23 suffered from cardiomyopathy, 8 from coronary heart disease, and 2 from valvular insufficiency. At admission, the patients suffered from symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, and were restricted in sports, gardening, hobbies, sexual life, job, food-intake, and mobility. More than three-fourths rated their physical and emotional status as moderate to poor. Emotionally, they suffered from irritability, restlessness, <b>depression,</b> <b>psychic</b> lability, lowered drive, lack of social contact, low self-esteem, and anxiety. At the end of rehabilitation (4 - 8 weeks after the operation), all physical and emotional complaints, as well as restrictions had significantly decreased (p < 0. 0001 to p < 0. 001), except for trembling, numbness of hands/feet, and food-intake. One year postoperatively, patients reported even fewer physical complaints (p < 0. 01). Three-fourths rated their physical and emotional status good or excellent. Five years postoperatively [...] in contrast to physical status, restrictions, and physical complaints [...] the emotional complaints had increased significantly (p < 0. 0001). Patients reported excellent physical performance up to 5 years postoperatively. On the other hand, the study revealed that their emotional well-being had significantly deteriorated from 1 to 5 years postoperatively.

So far, {{studies of}} stress {{have shown that}} {{physicians}} are at {{a high risk of}} sickness from psychic and somatic disorders related to professional stress, that can lead to important disturbance of personal, familiar and professional functionating. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the doctors exposition level to professional stress, to compare stress level in general practitioners (GP) group with that in the group of psychiatrists and risk level for the apperance of burnout syndrome. Methods. This cross-section study included subjects recruited by a random sample method. Thirty General Practice doctors and 30 psychiatrists (totally 60 doctors) filled the set of 3 questionnaires: Sociodemographics features, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; Goldberg D, 1991), and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Maslach C, 1996). Appropriate statistical procedures (Pearson test, t-test, variance analysis) in interpretation of the results were used. Results. A total level of psychic distress measured with the GHQ test in both groups of physicians was very low implying their good mental health. A difference in Burnout risk based on MBI test between the groups was statistically significant (χ 2 = 4, 286; p < 0. 05) only at subscale Personal Accomplishment (MBI-PA); it was a consequence of a higher number of GPs with medium burnout risk (13. 3 : 0. 0 %). However, even 35 physicians from the sample were affected with a high burnout risk measured with subscales Emotional Ehausation (MBI-EE) and MBI-DP, showing that both groups of physicians had risk for the appearance of burnout syndrome.

A single group, cross-sectional study. Method. Measurement performance was tested on 314 Chinese patients with CHD and repeated on 173 of them two weeks later. Results. The Chinese version of HADS (C-HADS) had acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0. 85 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 90, respectively. There was acceptable concurrent validity with significant (p < 0. 05) correlations between the anxiety and depression subscales of the C-HADS and CHD patients’ perceived health status as measured by the Chinese-Mandarin version of the Short Form- 36 health survey (CM:SF- 36). Principal components analysis revealed a three-factor solution accounting for 53 % of the total variance. The three underlying sub-scale dimensions are <b>depression,</b> <b>psychic</b> anxiety and psychomotor anxiety. The responsiveness of the C-HADS was also satisfactory with significant correlation between the changes in the C-HADS score and the changes in the mental health domain of the CM:SF- 36 (p < 0. 01). Finally, over one-third of the patients demonstrated psychological distress. Conclusion. Empirical data support the C-HADS as a reliable and valid screening instrument for the assessment of anxiety and depression in Chinese-speaking patients with CHD. A tri-dimensional scoring approach should be considered as potentially clinically useful for this group of patients. Relevance to clinical practice. The C-HADS can guide and evaluate the delivery of psychological care for Chinese patients with CHD...|$|R

We compared the profile of depressive symptoms in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) patients with that of control subjects (CS) suffering from non-neurological medical illnesses. Methods: One-hundred PD patients and 100 CS were submitted to a structured clinical interview for identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) and minor depressive disorder (MIND), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), criteria. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were also administered to measure depression severity. Results: When considering the whole groups, there were no differences in depressive symptom frequency between PD and CS apart from worthlessness/guilt, and changes in appetite reduced rates in PD. Further, total scores and psychic and somatic subscores of HDRS and BDI did not differ between PD and CS. After we separated PD and CS in those with MDD, MIND, and no depression (NODEP), comparing total scores and psychic/somatic subscores of HDRS and BDI, we found increased total depression severity in NODEP PD and reduced severity of the <b>psychic</b> symptoms of <b>depression</b> in MDD PD, with no differences in MIND. However, the severity of individual symptom frequency of depression was not different between PD and CS in MDD, MIND, and NODEP groups. Conclusion: Although MDD and MIND phenomenology in PD may be very similar to that of CS with non-neurological medical illnesses, neurological symptoms of PD may worsen (or confound) depression severity in patients with no formal/structured DSM-IV-TR, diagnosis of depressive mood disorders. Thus, a thorough assessment of depression in PD should take into consideration the different impacts of neurological manifestations on MDD, MIND, and NODEP.

40|$|Fatique is the {{persistent}} psychic {{as well as}} physically felt tiredness and exhaustion. This symptom goes along with a serious restriction {{of the quality of}} life and is often observed with patients with a chronic liver illness. The objective of this work is to examine the fatigue symptom and its influence on the quality of life, psychic load and cognitive abilities with patients with chronic hepatitis C. In the present study 46 patients with chronic hepatitis C, 13 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 22 patients with not virale hepatitis were enclosed and compared to control group with a chronically not hepatic illness 32 patients with a chronically inflammatory intestinal illness (Morbus Crohn or Colitus ulcerosa). A second control group consists of 38 healthy test persons. Patients and controls completed an self-report questionnaire with a total of 11 different tests (3 tiredness tests: Visual Analog Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Fatigue Impact Scale; 2 tests for the judgement of <b>psychic</b> load: Beck <b>Depression</b> Inventory, Symtom Check Liste; 1 test for the judgement of cognitive deficits: Fragebogen erlebter Aufmerksamkeitsdefizite; 5 tests for the judgement of the quality of life: Modulares System zur Lebensqualität, Fragen zur Lebenszufriedenheit, Nottingham Health Profile, Befindlichkeitsliste, Beschwerdeliste). As a function of subjectively felt tiredness the evaluation occurred for every illness group after allocation of the patients in subgroups with and without subjective tiredness. Regardless of the etiology of the illness, 50 - 60 % of all patients showed a subjective fatigue symptom, which could well be proved in the fatigue tests. Therefore the tiredness is neither liver nor hepatitis C specific, but can appear {{as a result of a}} chronic illness. Subjectively felt tiredness leads in the Fatigue Impact Scale to an interference of the physical, cognitive and psychosocial functions. The chronically inflammatory intestinal illness shows in comparison to chronic liver illness regardless of the tiredness a decrease of the energy and physical interference. Subjective tiredness and depression show moderate to good correlation for patients with chronic hepatitis C and not virale hepatitis. In contrast, a depression independent of the subjective tiredness was ascertained moreover with the chronically inflammatory intestinal illness. The cognitive efficiency showed in the group of the chronic hepatitis C with subjective tiredness the highest self-experienced deficits. Cognitive interferences also show the comparative group of the Morbus of Crohn/Colitis patients, so that these deficits are not specific for liver. An interference of most aspects of the quality of life was to be observed with chronic hepatitis C only in the subgroup with subjective tiredness, while the subgroup without tiredness does not differ in the quality of life from a healthy control group. Besides, an increase of the depression and the tiredness resulted in a clear reduction of the quality of life. However, a restriction of the quality of life also counts to the other forms of the chronic hepatitis C if a subjective tiredness persist. The patients without tiredness are essentially not limited in their quality of life in spite of their chronic liver illness. By contrast a decrease of the quality of life can be ascertained in the comparative group of the chronically inflammatory intestinal illnesses widely independently of the subjective tiredness. Hence, for the diagnostics and therapy of the chronic hepatitis C illness it is crucial to recognize depressive symptoms and mental changes with the patients, because an important role comes up to them in the pathogeny of the tiredness...|$|R
