5|$|His {{dispute with}} the General Assembly over the naming of a land {{registrar}} left Garrard embittered, and he retired from <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expiration of his second term. He privately backed Christopher Greenup's bid to succeed him in 1804, and Bourbon County's vote broke heavily for Greenup in the election. Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Black sought {{election}} to the United States Senate from Alabama, following the retirement of Senator Oscar Underwood. Since the Democratic Party dominated Alabama <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, he easily defeated his Republican opponent, E. H. Dryer, winning 80.9% of the vote. He was reelected in 1932, winning 86.3% of the vote against Republican J. Theodore Johnson.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, John Bevan {{replaced}} Stanley {{as head of}} the LCS, {{after the}} latter had asked Winston Churchill for permission to re-enter <b>politics.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the committee was given much broader powers. Hardboiled was sidelined by the new regime, and had been dropped entirely from the LCS programme by the end of May.|$|E
5|$|Treatt {{first entered}} <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1927 state {{election}} as an Independent Nationalist {{candidate for the}} Legislative Assembly seat of Willoughby. He narrowly lost on a margin of 49.47%.

On this occasion he was successful, gaining 53.62% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|At the 13 February 1971 election, Askin's {{majority}} {{was reduced}} by four seats to the Labor Party under Pat Hills. Morton retained his seat, despite {{a significant reduction}} in his majority to 62.68%. Morton stayed in office for another year when, on 16 June 1972 he retired from <b>politics.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of his departure it had been rumoured that he had been threatening to dismiss Blacktown City Council if they did not stop blocking a $200 million development in Mount Druitt.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as Minister of the Environment, Hareide was parodied in the {{television}} comedy program Tre brødre som ikke er brødre. The character Knut Arild Hareide, played by Harald Eia, was portrayed in several sketches as a physically weak person. These parodies were criticized by the authors in a 2005 book about different forms of mobbing; this stirred a minor debate in the Norwegian media. Nonetheless, Hareide himself showed a video clip {{of one of the}} parodies when publicly announcing his stepdown from national <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2007 party congress.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, Alasdair Cochrane studied <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Sheffield and the London School of Economics (LSE). His {{doctoral}} thesis, {{supervised by}} Cécile Fabre with Paul Kelly acting as an adviser, was entitled Moral obligations to non-humans. He subsequently became a fellow and lecturer at the LSE. During this time, Cochrane published articles in Res Publica, Utilitas and Political Studies presenting {{aspects of his}} interest-based theory of animal rights, which is defended in the final chapter of An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. The book was Cochrane's first, and the political theorist Robert Garner acted as an important discussant during the writing process.|$|E

5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local level in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for {{a seat in the}} Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E
5|$|Alasdair Cochrane (born 31 March 1978) is a British {{political}} theorist and ethicist who {{is currently}} a senior lecturer in political theory in the Department of <b>Politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Sheffield. He {{is known for his}} work on animal rights from the perspective of political theory, which is the subject of his two books: An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory (2010, Palgrave Macmillan) and Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012, Columbia University Press). He {{is currently working on a}} third book. He is a founding member of the Centre for Animals and Social Justice, a UK-based think tank focussed on furthering the social and political status of nonhuman animals. He joined the Department at Sheffield in 2012, having previously been a faculty member at the Centre for the Study of Human Rights, London School of Economics.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, when Unitarist Bernardino Rivadavia {{became the}} {{governor}} of the Buenos Aires province, he held a meeting with representatives from all provinces in Argentina. Facundo was present as {{the governor of}} La Rioja. Rivadavia was soon overthrown, and Manuel Dorrego became the new governor. Sarmiento contends that Dorrego, a Federalist, was interested neither in social progress nor in ending barbaric behaviour in Argentina by improving the level of civilization and education of its rural inhabitants. In the turmoil that characterized Argentine <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, Dorrego was assassinated by Unitarists and Facundo was defeated by Unitarist General José María Paz. Facundo escaped to Buenos Aires and joined the Federalist government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. During the ensuing civil war between the two ideologies, Facundo conquered the provinces of San Luis, Cordoba and Mendoza.|$|E

5|$|Mary Docherty (27 April 1908 – 2 February 2000) was {{an activist}} {{and member of}} the Communist Party of Great Britain. Born to a working-class family in Cowdenbeath, Scotland, she was {{influenced}} by the communist beliefs of her father, a miner, {{as well as by the}} poverty she grew up in. She joined the Communist Party at the age of 18, and in 1929 traveled to the Soviet Union as a Scottish delegate to a gathering of young communists. She founded a local children's wing of the Communist Party, carried out a successful agitation to declare 1 May a school holiday, and worked for communist Member of Parliament Willie Gallacher. She retired from active <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 60, but continued to give talks and write her memoirs, published in 1991 as A Miner's Lass.|$|E
5|$|The Northumbrian king, Æthelred, {{was assassinated}} in April 796, and {{less than a month}} later his successor, Osbald, was deposed in favour of Eardwulf. Eardwulf had Alhmund killed in 800; Alhmund was the son of King Alhred of Northumbria, who had reigned from 765 to 774. Alhmund's death was {{regarded}} as a martyrdom, and his cult subsequently developed at Derby, in Mercian territory, perhaps implying Mercian involvement in Northumbrian <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Coenwulf gave hospitality to Eardwulf's enemies, who had been exiled from Northumbria, and consequently Eardwulf invaded Mercia in 801. The invasion was inconclusive, however, and peace was arranged on equal terms. Coenwulf may also have been behind the coup in 806 that led to Eardwulf losing his throne, and he likely continued to support Eardwulf's enemies after Eardwulf returned in 808.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in world <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of Europe), the FPÖ were more positively inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of}} the Iraq War; he subsequently condemned US foreign policy and derided George W. Bush for not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised US foreign policy as promoted by Bush, which it saw as leading to increased levels of violence in the Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E
