Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked.

Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, {{as well as}} pharmaceutical drugs. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are facing {{the end of the}} effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.|$|E
500|$|A broken china plate {{bearing the}} name of Zhiyuan was found, which helped to {{identify}} the vessel. Naval historian Chen Yue {{stressed the importance of}} finding common living items to those researching the Sino-Japanese War and expressed a high hope of discovering the official seal of the vessel. He said, [...] "The ship seal was invariably made of good materials and stored in a sturdy box. It is highly <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can find it." [...] During the excavation, the bodies of seven of the crew were recovered. The idea of floating the wreck were initially discounted due to the risk of structural collapse, but plans to raise the vessel have not yet been finalised. It is intended for the artifacts to be displayed at a new museum, located in nearby Dandong.|$|E

It is a car we can reference for another 25 years if we choose. Its status is assured."

[...] In the same statement, Hajizadeh {{threatened to}} attack American bases in the Middle East as well. Hajizadeh said {{that as a result}} of this attack, Israel would [...] "sustain heavy damage and that will be a prelude to its obliteration." [...] On the same day, Deputy Commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Brigadier General Hossein Salami said that while Iran isn't concerned by Israeli [...] "threats" [...] to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, such an attack would be [...] "a historic opportunity for the Islamic Revolution to wipe them off the world's geographic history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Max Harris {{and other}} Angry Penguins writers {{represent}} an Australian outcrop {{of a literary}} fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be intellectuals and Bohemians, both here and abroad, as great poetry. [...] However, it was <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair enough. If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.|$|E
2500|$|British Prime Minister David Cameron said in October 2011 {{that the}} United Kingdom may {{withhold}} aid from countries {{that do not}} recognise LGBT rights. In response, Deputy Information Minister Sheka Tarawallie told the news media in November 2011 that [...] "it is not <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will legalise same sex marriages as they run counter to our culture". The president of the Methodist Church in Sierra Leone, Bishop Arnold Temple, said, [...] "The church in Sierra Leone will {{do everything possible to}} protect democracy but our values will not accept the call from ... Mr Cameron for countries in the Commonwealth ... to accept the practice of lesbianism and gayism. We call on the government ... to inform the British leader that such practices are unacceptable and we condemn it totally. Africa should not be seen as a continent in need to be influenced by the demonic threat as our values are totally different." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boeing {{cited the}} 747-8F {{as the main}} driver behind {{potential}} future 747-8 orders. To help reduce production costs in the meantime and maintain the 747 production line's viability, {{the company plans to}} integrate the 747 and 767 production lines more closely with each other. Boeing expected the cargo market to improve by mid-2019 and were planning to increase the 747's production rate back to 1/month from then on. However, in July 2016, this production rate increase was cancelled, i.e. 747 production remained at 0.5 per month. At the same time, the company announced another after tax charge of $814 million, reflecting a lower estimation of frames to be produced and revenue realised. In an SEC filing submitted at the same time, Boeing stated that if they were [...] "unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, [...] it is reasonably <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could decide to end production of the 747." ...|$|E

[...] According to the Pall Mall Budget, [...] "the players seemed to be nervous from the start. [...] Miss Braham forgot her lines, and was not in voice. [...] Mr. (George) Grossmith was in the same plight". [...] The Times also criticised Braham, stating that she [...] "acted most charmingly, but sang persistently out of tune". [...] The staging was also criticised: The Times stated, [...] "The ghost scene ... of which preliminary notices and hints of the initiated had led one to expect much, was a very tame affair." [...] The Era thought Sullivan's score [...] "far from being fresh and spontaneous as is his wont".|$|E

Hence, we can go ahead studying the population by introducing the competitiveness.|$|R
