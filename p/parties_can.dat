5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E

25|$|Liberalism is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} dominant ideology of modern times. Politically, liberals have organised extensively throughout the world. Liberal parties, think tanks, and other institutions are common in many nations, although they advocate for different causes based on their ideological orientation. Liberal <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> be centre-left, centrist, or centre-right depending on their location.|$|E

25|$|The European Green Party is an {{international}} association without lucrative purpose constituted out of political parties from European countries (although not necessarily from European Union member states). <b>Parties</b> <b>can</b> also become associate member.

25|$|The informateur has {{the task}} of {{exploring}} the various possibilities for a new federal government and for examining which <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> form {{a majority in the}} Federal Parliament. He also meets with prominent people in various fields to hear their views on what policies the new federal government should pursue. The informateur then reports to the King and advises him about the appointment of a formateur. However, the King can also decide to appoint a second informateur or appoint a royal mediator.|$|E
25|$|Any {{transfer}} {{of more than}} 30% of the ownership of a broadcasting licence (including cable/satellite distribution licences) requires advance approval of the commission. One condition normally {{taken into account in}} such a decision is the level of foreign ownership; federal regulations require that Canadian citizens ultimately own a majority of a broadcast license. Usually this {{takes the form of a}} public process, where interested <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> express their concerns and sometimes including a public hearing, followed by a commission decision.|$|E

25|$|Fractional {{ownership}} {{is a method}} in which several unrelated <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> share in, and mitigate the risk of, ownership of a high-value tangible asset, usually a jet, yacht or piece of resort real estate. It can be done for strictly monetary reasons, but typically there is some amount of personal access involved. One of the main motivators for a fractional purchase {{is the ability to}} share the costs of maintaining an asset that will not be used full-time by one owner.|$|E
25|$|Political party {{candidates}} were selected within party elections, or were elected by party bodies, {{and they are}} the party's sole official candidates. All parliamentary parties have a policy to support only one candidate, and if their member announces an independent nomination, he or she automatically loses their party membership. Parliamentary parties that do not candidate their member for the president, usually publicly support someone. These <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> be listed on the electoral list for the president, but sometimes their support is just a public endorsement. Regional-right wing HDSSB supported independent candidate Milan Bandić, and regional-centrist PGS supported independent Nadan Vidošević.|$|E
25|$|With Nanda, Indjejikian {{argues that}} {{incentive}} problems are a crucial aspect of responsibility accounting. Due to the Ratchet effect, the employer {{would be better}} off if both <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> agree on a multi-period contract without subsequent revisions. Two responsibility center structures are analyzed: Consolidated structures are produced when managers are attributed to multiple activities. These structures imply less ratcheting but at the loss of comparative performance information. Specialized structures mean managers are responsible for one activity thus providing a higher level of comparative performance information but also a higher level of ratcheting. Performance evaluation in firms with specialized structures is more informative because of the use of comparative measurements.|$|E

25|$|In Article 3 of the Law on the National Arms, Flag and Anthem (Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales) also {{describes}} {{that the}} national flag can be decorated with a special tie called a corbata (cravat). The corbata is composed of a bow, two ribbons of different length and both ribbons are attached with a golden tassel called fringe. The corbata {{is placed on the}} top of the flag at the point where the truck is, and the colours of the corbata match that of the national flag. Organizations and political <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> adopt their own corbatas, such as the National Action Party (PAN), which uses a white corbata with blue fringes.|$|E
25|$|As in all Australian elections, {{the flow}} of {{preferences}} from minor <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> be crucial in determining the final outcome. The close of nominations {{was followed by a}} period of bargaining among the parties. Howard made a pitch for the preferences of the Australian Greens by appearing to offer concessions on the issue of logging in old-growth forests in Tasmania, and the Coalition directed its preferences to the Greens ahead of Labor in the Senate, but the Greens nevertheless decided to allocate preferences to Labor in most electorates. In exchange, Labor agreed to direct its preferences in the Senate to the Greens ahead of the Democrats (but critically, not ahead of other minor parties), increasing the chances that the Greens would displace Australian Democrats Senators in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} that the {{exhaustion}} doctrine is grounded in considerations of public policy, and to {{the extent that}} the interests of the public and third parties (such as Quanta in the Quanta case) are to be considered as well as those of the contracting parties, the courts may be more likely to place limits on whether the <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> by contract make the doctrine inapplicable to the goods that are the subject of their contract. On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts may be more likely to uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law.|$|E

25|$|Final Fantasy All the Bravest {{features}} the player controlling {{a party of}} characters, and controlling them to fight an opposing enemy party of characters. Characters traverse an overhead map between battles, and engage {{in a series of}} battles culminating in a boss fight. Player <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> hold up to 40 characters. The game {{features the}} Active Time Battle (ATB) system. In this system, battles are turn-based, with turns being taken when the gradually increasing ATB gauge reaches its capacity. Upon attacking, the bar is emptied and gradually starts refilling again. Defeating enemies grants experience points the player needs to level up and in turn gain character slots to use for the player's party. When weaponry is found, it's auto equipped to all characters that can wield it. Once every three hours, the Fever option is made available, granting the player the ability to attack without needing the ATB gauge to be refilled.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} of Iceland is a largely ceremonial {{head of state}} {{and serves as a}} diplomat, but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum. The current president is Guðni Th. Jóhannesson. The head of government is the prime minister who, together with the cabinet, is responsible for executive government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent Sveinn Björnsson, who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.|$|E
25|$|Procedures which {{necessarily}} lead to {{a determination}} which {{the parties to the}} dispute may not enter into an agreement upon: Some court procedures lead to judgments which bind all members of the general public, or public authorities in their capacity as such, or third parties, or which are being conducted in the public interest. For example, until the 1980s, antitrust matters were not arbitrable in the United States. Matters relating to crimes, status and family law are generally not considered to be arbitrable, as the power of the parties to enter into an agreement upon these matters is at least restricted. However, most other disputes that involve private rights between two <b>parties</b> <b>can</b> be resolved using arbitration. In some disputes, parts of claims may be arbitrable and other parts not. For example, in a dispute over patent infringement, a determination of whether a patent has been infringed could be adjudicated upon by an arbitration tribunal, but the validity of a patent could not: As patents are subject to a system of public registration, an arbitral panel would have no power to order the relevant body to rectify any patent registration based upon its determination.|$|E
