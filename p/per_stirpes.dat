2500|$|The Toulmin trusts {{were the}} subject of {{substantial}} legal problems. [...] Both Toulmin Sr. and Toulmin Jr. had testamentary trusts, {{and some of the}} $178million was shared between the two trusts. [...] Toulmin Jr.'s first wife, Margaret McCarty, was a life beneficiary under Toulmin Sr.'s trust, where the remainder after Toulmin Jr.'s first wife death was to be allotted to the living descendants of Toulmin Sr.'s grandfather. After the death of Margaret McCarty on September 29, 1994, the Toulmin Sr. remainder trust money had grown to a considerable sum. [...] Since the Toulmin Sr. remainder trust money was to revert under Toulmin Sr.'s will to descendants of his grandfather <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> it became necessary for the executors of Harry Aubrey Toulmin Sr. to trace the living descendants of Toulmin Sr.'s grandfather, Theophilus Lindsey Toulmin (1820?–1895?) [...] On April 21, 1996, eighty-two senior representatives of every surviving branch of Theophilus Lindsey Toulmin received a letter addressing the trust and their potential inheritance from Toulmin Sr.|$|E
6000|$|On this principle, {{the law of}} {{inheritance}} {{had admitted}} some amendment in the old time, and long before {{the era of the}} Revolution. Some time after the Conquest great questions arose upon the legal principles of hereditary descent. It became a matter of doubt whether the heir per capita or the heir <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> was to succeed; but whether the heir per capita gave way when the heirdom <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> took place, or the Catholic heir when the Protestant was preferred, the inheritable principle survived with a sort of immortality through all transmigrations,-- ...|$|E
5000|$|In inheritance, an in {{pari passu}} (per capita) {{distribution}} {{can be distinguished}} from a <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> (by family branch) distribution.|$|E
50|$|In this case, the {{descendants}} of the parents will inherit the entire estate in equal shares. The descendants inherit <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> by representation.|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to the descendants of a parent of the deceased, {{division of the estate}} takes place <b>per</b> <b>stirpes.</b> Representation is allowed ad infinitum.|$|E
50|$|Example 2B: The {{per capita}} and <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> results would differ if D also pre-deceased with one child, D1 (figure 2). Under <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> B1 and B2 would each receive one-sixth (half of Bs one-third share), and D1 would receive one-third (all of Ds one-third share). Under per capita, the two-thirds {{remaining}} after C 's one-third share was taken would be divided equally among all three children of B and D. Each would receive two-ninths: B1, B2, and D1 would all receive two-ninths.|$|E
5000|$|Example 1A: The {{testator}} A, specifies in {{his will}} that his estate is to be divided among his descendants in equal shares <b>per</b> <b>stirpes.</b> A has three children, B, C, and D. B is already dead, but has left two children (grandchildren of A), B1 and B2. When As will is executed, under a distribution <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> C and D each receive one-third of the estate, and B1 and B2 each receive one-sixth. B1 and B2 constitute one [...] "branch" [...] of the family, and collectively receive a share equal to the shares received by C and D as branches (figure 1).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Per</b> <b>stirpes</b> ( [...] ; [...] "by branch") is a {{legal term}} from Latin. An estate of a decedent is {{distributed}} <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> if each branch of the family is to receive an equal share of an estate. When the heir in {{the first generation of}} a branch predeceased the decedent, the share that would have been given to the heir would be distributed among the heir's issue in equal shares. It may also be known as right of representation distribution, and differs from distribution per capita, as members of the same generation may inherit different amounts.|$|E
50|$|In this case, the {{surviving}} parent will inherit {{half of the}} estate, and {{the descendants of the}} deceased parent will inherit the residue <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> by representation.In this case, {{the surviving}} parent is the sole heir.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 2. Comparison between <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> {{inheritance}} and {{per capita}} by generation inheritance. On the left, each branch receives {{one third of}} the estate. On the right, As only surviving child, C, receives {{one third of the}} estate. The remaining two thirds are divided among the descendants in the next generation.|$|E
50|$|Where an heir {{who is a}} {{descendant}} of the testator, whether {{as a member of}} a class or otherwise, is disqualified from inheriting on any one of the grounds treated above, the benefit that he would have received devolves to his descendants <b>per</b> <b>stirpes.</b> This statutory rule is subject to there being no contrary intention in the will.|$|E
50|$|The 1580 Ordinance {{adopted the}} schependomsrecht {{distribution}} <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> restricting {{it in the}} case of collaterals to the fourth degree inclusive. Finally, the 1599 Placaat compromised between the two systems with respect to distribution, and gave one half of the estate to the surviving parent, and the other half to the descendants of the deceased parent.|$|E
50|$|Example 2A: In {{the first}} example, {{children}} C and D survive, so the estate is divided at their generation. There were three children, so each surviving child receives one-third. The remainder - Bs share - is then divided {{in the same}} manner among Bs surviving descendants. The result is the same as under <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> because Bs one-third is distributed to B1 and B2 (one-sixth to each).|$|E
50|$|The Wills Act {{provides}} {{that if any}} descendant of a testator, excluding a minor or mentally ill descendant, who together with the surviving spouse of the testator, is entitled a benefit {{in terms of the}} will, renounces his or her right to receive such a benefit, such benefit shall vest in the surviving spouse. Where the surviving spouse does not stand to inherit, and unless the will indicates otherwise, the renounced benefit must devolve on the descendants of that descendant <b>per</b> <b>stirpes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} and usually {{used in the}} field of statistics in place of saying [...] "per person" [...] (although per caput is the Latin for [...] "per head").It is also used in wills to indicate that each of the named beneficiaries should receive, by devise or bequest, equal shares of the estate. [...] This is in contrast to a <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> division, in which each branch (Latin stirps, plural stirpes) of the inheriting family inherits an equal share of the estate.|$|E
50|$|A direct {{substitution}} {{will not be}} implied unless it is clear, {{as a matter of}} “necessary implication,” that the testator so intended in respect of an event actually contemplated by the testator. But a form of implied {{direct substitution}} has been created by statute: Whenever a predeceased descendant of the testator would have become entitled, if he had survived the testator, to any benefit under the will of the testator, the descendants of that descendant are entitled to take that benefit <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> unless the terms of the will indicate a contrary intention.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{suppose a}} {{testator}} {{had two children}} A and B. A has two children, and B has three. The testator leaves his entire estate to his grandchildren in equal shares in pari passu, each grandchild would inherit one fifth of the estate. If the testator left his entire estate to his grandchildren <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> (by family branch), the children of A would share {{one half of the}} estate equally between the two of them, and the children of B would share one half of the estate equally amongst the three of them.|$|E
50|$|The Huaman Family, <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> {{belonged to}} the wealthy among the Inca Empire, before and after. As {{it used to be}} common, the marriages among the ruling {{families}} took place, to remain in control and current. At the time, the Huaman (or Waman, in Quechua; or Guaman after the Spaniard conquest) were a selected family of warriors, and land owners in several regions of the pre-Inca empire. They venerated the wild bird (similar to a Falcon), that only grows in the Andean Region of Peru, above 4,000 meters above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Example 1B: If {{grandchild}} B1 had predeceased A, leaving {{two children}} B1a and B1b, and grandchild B2 had also died leaving three children B2a, B2b and B2c, then distribution <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> would give one-third each to C and D, one-twelfth each to B1a and B1b, who {{would constitute a}} branch, and one-eighteenth each to B2a, B2b and B2c. Thus, the B, C, and D branches receive equal shares of the whole estate, the B1 and B2 branches receive equal shares of the B branch's share, B1a and B1b receive equal shares of the B1 branch's share, and B2a, B2b and B2c receive equal shares of the B2 branch's share.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many states}} of the United States, such as New York, a statute has {{modified}} this definition and utilizes a [...] "Modern Per Stirpes" [...] approach (or Per Capita with Right of Representation). Under the Modern <b>Per</b> <b>Stirpes</b> approach, the number of branches is determined by reference to the generation nearest the testator which has a surviving descendant. Thus, in the first example, if C and D also are already dead, and each left one child, named (respectively and appropriately) C1 and D1, then each of B1, B2, C1 and D1 would receive {{one quarter of the}} estate. This method is also utilized in the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, and West Virginia.|$|E
50|$|If any {{descendants}} of a testator, excluding a minor or a mentally ill descendant, who, {{together with the}} surviving spouse of the testator, is entitled to a benefit {{in terms of a}} will renounces his right to receive such benefit, such benefit shall vest in the surviving spouse.If a descendant of the testator, whether {{as a member of a}} class or otherwise, would have been entitled to a benefit in terms of the provisions of a will if he had been alive at the time of death of the testator, or had not been disqualified from inheriting, or had not after the testator’s death renounced his right to receive such a benefit, the {{descendants of}} that descendant shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (1), <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> be entitled to the benefit, unless the context of the will otherwise indicates.|$|E

5000|$|A {{testator}} devised {{lands and}} personal property to his executors and their successors and their heirs, in trust, and directed that the income, until his youngest grandchild who might {{live to be}} twenty-one years of age should arrive at that age, should be divided equally among the testator's children or the issue of any child dying, and among the grandchildren also as they successively came of age; that [...] "after the decease of all my children, and when {{and as soon as}} the youngest grandchild shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years," [...] the lands should be [...] "inherited and equally divided between my grandchildren per capita," [...] in fee, and that [...] "in like manner" [...] the personal property should [...] "at the same time be equally divided among my said grandchildren, share and share alike per capita," [...] and that if any grandchild should have died before the final division leaving children, they should take and receive <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> the share which their parent would have been entitled to have and receive if then living, and provided that any assignment, mortgage, or pledge by any grandchild of his share should be void, and the executors, in the final division and distribution, should convey and pay to the persons entitled under the will. Held that the executors took the legal title in fee, to hold until the final division, and that the trusts were imposed upon them as executors. Held, also that all the grandchildren took equitable vested remainders, opening to let in those born after the testator's death, and subject to be divested only as to any grandchild who died before the expiration of the particular estate, leaving issue, by an executory devise over to such issue.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{will attempt}} to {{describe}} and evalute {{certain aspects of the}} wealth transmission process. Attention will be given to the surviving spouse 2 ̆ 7 s intestate share and its size, the spouse 2 ̆ 7 s protection against disinheritance through forced share legislation or otherwise, and, more significantly, whether such a drastic legislative intrusion on freedom of testation is really needed. The adequacy of the support allowance for the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s family during the period of administration will also be explored. Attention will also be focused on selected provisions of the intestacy scheme, such as the order of succession, the doctrine of advancements, whether distribution is per capita or <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> and whether unlimited inheritance by remote collateral relatives should continue to be allowed. Finally, special situations which affect the normal course of inheritance will be considered. For example, the rules that determine succession by, from, and through adopted and illegitimate children and the effect of homicide of the decedent on the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s right to succession will be discussed. In all of these areas contemporary statutory patterns will be described, including those of Georgia and other states throughout the country. Suggestions will be made with a view toward improving existing legislation so as to make the process work better and more effectively...|$|E
