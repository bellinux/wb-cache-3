5|$|A Multiple Property Submission (MPS) is a {{thematic}} group {{listing of}} the National Register of Historic Places that consists of related <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> share a common theme and can be submitted as a group. Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of properties {{to be included in}} the National Register.|$|E
5|$|All NHLs {{are also}} {{included}} on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of historic <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> the National Park Service deems to be worthy of preservation. The NHLs in Michigan comprise approximately 2% of the 1,757 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan as of January 2012. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E

50|$|An {{intrinsic}} property is a <b>property</b> <b>that</b> an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context. An extrinsic (or relational) property is a <b>property</b> <b>that</b> {{depends on a}} thing's relationship with other things. For example, mass is a physical {{intrinsic property}} of any physical object, whereas weight is an extrinsic <b>property</b> <b>that</b> varies depending {{on the strength of}} the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed.|$|R
50|$|Property, says Pashukanis, is {{the basis}} of the legal form, but only {{capitalist}} <b>property</b> <b>that</b> can be disposed of in the market. The subject in law is the expression of the freedom of <b>property,</b> <b>that</b> is, the freedom of alienate property.|$|R
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E
5|$|As {{interactions}} between proteins are reversible, and depend {{heavily on the}} availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the {{interactions between}} specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> distinguish particular cell types.|$|E
5|$|As of 1999, {{there have}} been 982 {{properties}} removed from the Register, most often due to being destroyed. Among the <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> were demolished after their listing are the Jobbers Canyon Historic District in Omaha, Nebraska (listed in 1979, demolished in 1989), Palace Amusements in Asbury Park, New Jersey (listed in 2000, demolished in 2004), and seven of the nine buildings included in the University of Connecticut Historic District in Storrs, Connecticut (listed in 1989, demolished in 2017).|$|E

5000|$|Linearity {{guarantees}} that the minimum Hamming distance d between a codeword c0 {{and any of}} the other codewords c ≠ c0 is independent of c0. This follows from the <b>property</b> <b>that</b> the difference c &minus; c0 of two codewords in C is also a codeword (i.e., an element of the subspace C), and the <b>property</b> <b>that</b> d(c, c0) = d(c &minus; c0, 0). These <b>properties</b> imply <b>that</b> ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>property</b> <b>that</b> is not {{essential}} or inherent is called an extrinsic property. For example, density is an intrinsic property of any physical object, whereas weight is an extrinsic <b>property</b> <b>that</b> varies depending {{on the strength of}} the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed.|$|R
5|$|At one point, Disney had {{approached}} Cyan Worlds about constructing {{a theme park}} inspired by Myst, which included scouting an island area within Disney's Florida <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> Rand Miller felt was perfect for the Myst setting. However, plans for this park fell through over time.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} {{groups such}} as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.|$|E

5000|$|The {{family of}} {{infinite}} arithmetic progressions of integers {{also has the}} 2-Helly <b>property.</b> <b>That</b> is, whenever a finite collection of progressions has the <b>property</b> <b>that</b> no {{two of them are}} disjoint, then there exists an integer that belongs to all of them; this is the Chinese remainder theorem.|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen is {{commonly}} used in power stations as a coolant in generators due {{to a number of}} favorable <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules. These include low density, low viscosity, and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th-century German alchemist Andreas Libavius {{described}} {{the production of}} acetone from the dry distillation of lead acetate, ketonic decarboxylation. The presence of water in vinegar has such {{a profound effect on}} acetic acid's <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist Pierre Adet proved them identical.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> are {{unusual for a}} metal; taken together, these are {{sometimes}} used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|Listed {{properties}} are generally {{in one of}} five broad categories, although there are special considerations for other types of <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> in any one, or into more specialized subcategories. The five general categories for National Register {{properties are}}: building, structure, site, district, and object. In addition, historic districts consist of contributing and non-contributing properties.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{science of}} the Middle Ages had a {{considerable}} influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among the upper classes. One's lifestyle—including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies—was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.|$|E
