40|$|Previous work on {{electron}} heating mechanisms {{operating at}} the supercritical earth's bow shock is {{extended to the}} generally lower Mach number interplanetary shocks. This is done by studying electron velocity distributions observed both upstream and downstream of interplanetary shocks observed by ISEE 3 between August 1978 and December 1979. It is found that perpendicular heating accompanied by little or no <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> occurs at the weaker shocks but that <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> is dominant for the stronger shocks. When perpendicular heating is dominant, downstream velocity distributions {{are for the most}} part Gaussian at low energies (core) and Lorentzian at high energies (halo). When <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> is dominant, however, these distributions are flat-topped at low energies, having power law extensions to higher energies.

40|$|We {{study the}} heating of charged test {{particles}} in three-dimensional numerical simulations of weakly compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence (``Alfvenic turbulence''); {{these results are}} relevant to particle heating and acceleration in the solar wind, solar flares, accretion disks onto black holes, and other astrophysics and heliospheric environments. The physics of particle heating depends on whether the gyrofrequency of a particle {{is comparable to the}} frequency of a turbulent fluctuation that is resolved on the computational domain. Particles with these frequencies nearly equal undergo strong perpendicular heating (relative to the local magnetic field) and pitch angle scattering. By contrast, particles with large gyrofrequency undergo strong <b>parallel</b> <b>heating.</b> Simulations with a finite resistivity produce additional <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> due to parallel electric fields in small-scale current sheets. Many of our results are consistent with linear theory predictions for the particle heating produced by the Alfven and slow magnetosonic waves that make up Alfvenic turbulence. However, in contrast to linear theory predictions, energy exchange is not dominated by discrete resonances between particles and waves; instead, the resonances are substantially ``broadened. '' We discuss the implications of our results for solar and astrophysics problems, in particular the thermodynamics of the near-Earth solar wind. We conclude that Alfvenic turbulence produces significant <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> via the interaction between particles and magnetic field compressions (``slow waves''). However, on scales above the proton Larmor radius, Alfvenic turbulence does not produce significant perpendicular heating of protons or minor ions. Comment: Submitted to Ap...|$|E

40|$|A novel kinetic-fluid {{model is}} presented, which {{describes}} collisionless time evolution of zonal flows in tokamaks. In the new zonal-flow closure relations, the <b>parallel</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes are {{written by the}} sum of short- and long-time-evolution parts.

40|$|In the auroral zone, {{quasi-static}} parallel electric fields produce {{beams of}} ionospheric ions (e. g., H(+), He(+) and 0 (+)), which flow outward into the magnetosphere, providing a {{significant source of}} ions for the ring current and plasma sheet. Because the velocities to which these beams are accelerated is dependent on the mass of the ions, differential flows between the various ion species can develop which are unstable to an ion-ion streaming instability. Particle simulations and observations from DE 1 are used to investigate the heating of the ion beams produced by this instability. It is shown that there is net transfer of energy from the light ions to the heavy ions, with the heavy ions reaching maximum velocities near the beam velocity of the light ions. Bulk heating of the heavy ions occurs when their relative density is low while high-energy tails are produced when their relative density is high. The heating is primarily parallel to the magnetic field if the difference in the heavy and light ion beam velocities is subsonic while both perpendicular and <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> can occur if it is supersonic. In the latter case, very strong heating of an intermediate ion's species such as He(+) can also occur. Comparison with observations shows features consistent with heating via the ion-ion instability including perpendicular heating in the supersonic regime and <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> in the subsonic regime and a change in the heating between these regimes as the ratio of the H(+) beam speed to the local sound speed is observed to decrease.

40|$|The heating of {{electrons}} in collisionless magnetic reconnection is explored in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations with non-zero guide fields so that electrons remain magnetized. In this regime electric fields parallel to B accelerate particles directly while those perpendicular to B do so through gradient-B and curvature drifts. The curvature drift drives <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> through Fermi reflection while the gradient B drift changes the perpendicular energy through betatron acceleration. We present simulations {{in which we}} evaluate each of these mechanisms {{in space and time}} in order to quantify their role in electron heating. For a case with a small guide field (20 % of the magnitude of the reconnecting component) the curvature drift is the dominant source of electron heating. However, for a larger guide field (equal to the magnitude of the reconnecting component) electron acceleration by the curvature drift is comparable to that of the parallel electric field. In both cases the heating by the gradient B drift is negligible in magnitude. Heating by the curvature-drift dominates in the outflow exhausts where bent field lines expand to relax their tension and is therefore distributed over a large area. In contrast, the parallel electric field is localized near X-lines. Acceleration by parallel electric fields may play a smaller role in large systems where the X-line occupies a vanishing fraction of the system. The curvature drift and the parallel electric field dominate the dynamics and drive <b>parallel</b> <b>heating.</b> A consequence is that the electron energy spectrum becomes extremely anisotropic at late time, which has important implications for quantifying the limits of electron acceleration due to synchrotron emission. An upper limit on electron energy gain that is substantially higher than earlier estimates is obtained by balancing reconnection drive with radiative loss.

First the mechanism requires both a warm electron population with a loss cone distribution, and a cold electron distribution. At the Moon, the incoming solar wind distribution naturally provides the former, and the component of photoelectrons and/or secondary electrons that escapes from the near-surface sheath region naturally provides the latter. The predicted heating resulting from this process should be efficient at parallel electron velocities a few times the thermal speed of the warm population, or in our case a few tens of eV, in relatively good agreement with our observations.

We first model NPCH by considering the differences in radial {{as well as in the}} direction perpendicular to the line of sight (los) in temperature, particle number density and non-thermal velocities between plumes and interplume lanes for the specific case of OVI ions. This model includes parallel and perpendicular (to the magnetic field) heat conduction and viscous dissipation. Next, we derive the dispersion relations for the MHD waves in the case of absence and presence of <b>parallel</b> <b>heat</b> conduction. In the case of absence of <b>parallel</b> <b>heat</b> conduction, we find that MHD wave dissipation strongly depends on the viscosity for modified acoustic and Alfven waves. The energy flux density of acoustic waves varies between 10 ^ 4. 7 and 10 ^ 7 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1 while the energy flux density of Alfven waves turned out to be between 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 8. 6 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1. But, solutions of the magnetoacustic waves show that the <b>parallel</b> <b>heat</b> conduction introduce anomalous dispersion to the NPCH plasma wherein the group velocity of waves exceeds the speed of light in vacuum.

The degree of electron heating is well {{correlated with the}} inflowing Alfvén speed c_Ar based on the reconnecting magnetic field through the relation Δ T_e = 0. 033 m_i c_Ar^ 2, where Δ T_e is the increase in electron temperature. For the range of simulations performed, the heating shows almost no correlation with inflow total temperature T_tot = T_i + T_e or plasma β. An out-of-plane (guide) magnetic field of similar magnitude to the reconnecting field {{does not affect the}} total heating, but it does quench perpendicular heating, with almost all heating being in the parallel direction. These results are qualitatively consistent with a recent statistical survey of electron heating in the dayside magnetopause, which also found that Δ T_e was proportional to the inflowing Alfvén speed. The net electron heating varies very little with distance downstream of the x-line. The simulations show at most a very weak dependence of electron heating on the ion to electron mass ratio.

All these events occurred during periods of northward or weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). These outflowing beams were generally detected below 100 eV and typically between 40 and 70 eV, just above the photoelectron level. Their energy gain {{can be explained by}} the presence of a field-aligned potential drop below the spacecraft, as in the auroral zone. The careful analysis of the beams distribution function indicates that they were not only accelerated but also heated. The <b>parallel</b> <b>heating</b> is estimated to about 2 to 20 eV and it globally tends to increase with the acceleration energy. Moreover, WHISPER observed broadband electrostatic emissions around a few kHz correlated with the outflowing electron beams, which suggests beam-plasma interactions capable of triggering plasma instabilities. In presence of simultaneous very weak ion fluxes, the outflowing electron beams are the main carriers of downward field-aligned currents estimated to about 10 nA/m 2 . These electron beams are actually not isolated but surrounded by wider structures of ion outflows. All along its polar cap crossings, Cluster observed successive electron and ion outflows.

We find heating transverse to the local magnetic field in the core plasma, with significant heating of 0 (+), He(+), and H(+), as well as tail heating events that occur independently of the core heating. The 0 (+) velocity distribution departs from bi-Maxwellian, at one point exhibiting an apparent ring-like shape. However, these observations are shown to be aliased within the auroral arc by temporal variations that arc not well-resolved by the core plasma instrument.
