5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E

25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} {{is often}} associated with <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> as it is the most common cause. <b>Pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> results from an autoimmune disorder which destroys the cells that produce intrinsic factor within the stomach lining, thereby hindering B12 absorption. B12 absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron, thus, people with <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> often present with typical symptoms of anemia, such as pale skin, dizziness, and fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Mild to {{moderate}} cases of <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> may show symptoms of bleeding gums, headache, poor concentration, shortness of breath, and weakness.

25|$|<b>Pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> is an {{autoimmune}} disease wherein the body lacks intrinsic factor, required to absorb vitamin B12 from food. Vitamin B12 {{is needed for}} the production of hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} is {{the cause}} of <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> an anemic disease that was usually fatal and had unknown etiology when it was first described in medicine. The cure, and B12, were discovered by accident. George Whipple had been doing experiments in which he induced anemia in dogs by bleeding them, and then fed them various foods to observe which diets allowed them fastest recovery from the anemia produced. In the process, he discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to most rapidly cure the anemia of blood loss. Thus, he hypothesized that liver ingestion might treat <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia.</b> He tried this and reported some signs of success in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 is used {{to treat}} vitamin B12 deficiency, cyanide poisoning, and {{hereditary}} deficiency of transcobalamin II.|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/vitamin-b12.html |work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=April 3, 2011}} It is given {{as part of the}} Schilling test for detecting <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of {{clinical}} studies, George Richards Minot and William Murphy set out to partly isolate the substance in liver which cured anemia in dogs, {{and found that it}} was iron. They also found that an entirely different liver substance cured <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> in humans, that had no effect on dogs under the conditions used. The specific factor treatment for <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> found in liver juice, had been found by this coincidence. Minot and Murphy reported these experiments in 1926. This was the first real progress with this disease. Despite this discovery, for several years patients were still required to eat large amounts of raw liver or to drink considerable amounts of liver juice.|$|E

Her body was cremated in Cincinnati two days later and the ashes buried at Brock Cemetery near Greenville, Ohio. Assuming that their marriage took place in 1876, Oakley and Butler had been married just over 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those at}} highest risk for B12 {{deficiency}} are the elderly population, as 10-15% of people aged 60+ may present with some form of hypocobalaminemia. High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B12, as production of intrinsic factor declines with age. However, <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> {{is the most common}} cause of B12 deficiency in North American and European populations.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 {{requires}} {{intrinsic factor}} from the gastric mucosa to be absorbed. In {{patients with a}} small gastric pouch, {{it may not be}} absorbed, even if supplemented orally, and deficiencies can result in <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> and neuropathies. Vitamin B12 deficiency is quite common after gastric bypass surgery with reported rates of 30% in some clinical trials. Sublingual B12 (cyanocobalamin) appears to be adequately absorbed. In cases where sublingual B12 does not provide sufficient amounts, injections may be needed.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, American {{zoologist}} Charles Wardell Stiles identified progressive <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> seen in {{the southern}} United States as being caused by the hookworm A. duodenale. Testing in the 1900s revealed very heavy infestations in school-age children. In Puerto Rico, Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, a US Army physician, organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign, which cured approximately 300,000 people (one-third of the Puerto Rican population) and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent during the years 1903–1904.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{avoiding}} things {{that cause the}} disease. Treatment includes medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. During an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help. If gastritis is due to NSAIDs these may be stopped. If H. pylori is present it may be treated {{with a combination of}} antibiotics such as amoxicillin and clarithromycin. For those with <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> vitamin B12 supplements are recommended either by mouth or by injection. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{confusion}} in terminology, Norton and Zager and Grady classified erythromelalgia in 1998 as either: primary/idiopathic erythromelalgia or secondary erythromelalgia. The primary/idiopathic form of erythromelalgia is not associated with any other disease process and can be either early onset (in children) or adult onset. In their paper they described secondary erythromelalgia as being associated with another disease, often related to a myeloproliferative disorder and has also seen cases of: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, astrocytoma of the brain, vasculitis, and <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia.</b>|$|E

By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items. In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 {{for the treatment of}} <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George R. Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist. Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|Common causes include poor {{absorption}} {{from the}} stomach or intestines, decreased intake, and increased requirements. Decreased absorption {{may be due}} to <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> surgical removal of the stomach, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, intestinal parasites, certain medications, and some genetic disorders. Decreased intake may occur in those who eat a vegan diet or are malnourished. Increased requirements occur in HIV/AIDS and in those with rapid red blood cell breakdown. Diagnosis is typically based on vitamin B12 blood levels below 120–180 picomol/L (170–250 pg/mL) in adults. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels (values >0.4 micromol/L) may also indicate a deficiency. A type of low red blood cells known as megaloblastic anemia is often but not always present.|$|E
25|$|The sublingual route, {{in which}} B12 is presumably or {{supposedly}} taken in more {{directly under the}} tongue, has not proven to be necessary or helpful, even though a number of lozenges, pills, and even a lollipop designed for sublingual absorption are being marketed.

As noted below, such very high doses of oral B12 may be effective as treatments, even if gastrointestinal tract absorption is impaired by gastric atrophy (<b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients {{deficient}} in B12 despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration {{of at least}} 6mg of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B12. Strategy for treatment {{is dependent on the}} patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning. Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000mg of B12 administered intramuscularly daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly {{for the rest of the}} patients life. Daily oral supplementation of B12 mega-doses may be sufficient in reliable patients, but it is imperative that the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} {{typically}} unknown. It {{is believed to}} be due to genetic susceptibility that is triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs. This results in the destruction of skin pigment cells. Risk factors include a family history of the condition or other autoimmune diseases, such as hyperthyroidism, alopecia areata, and <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia.</b> It is not contagious. Vitiligo is classified into two main types: segmental and non-segmental. Most cases are non-segmental, meaning they affect both sides; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically expands with time. About 10% of cases are segmental, meaning they mostly involve one side of the body; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically does not expand with time. Diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy.|$|E
25|$|Absorption of food vitamin B12 thus {{requires}} an intact and functioning stomach, exocrine pancreas, intrinsic factor, and small bowel. Problems with {{any one of}} these organs makes a vitamin B12 deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B12. In <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia,</b> {{there is a lack of}} IF due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis, in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B12 protective function. Due to the complexity of B12 absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B12 deficiency. This results in 80–100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30–60% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.|$|E
25|$|Gastritis is {{inflammation}} of {{the lining of the}} stomach. It may occur as a short episode or may be of a long duration. There may be no symptoms but, when symptoms are present, the most common is upper abdominal pain. Other possible symptoms include nausea and vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite and heartburn. Complications may include bleeding, stomach ulcers, and stomach tumors. When due to autoimmune problems, low red blood cells due to not enough vitamin B12 may occur, a condition known as <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia.</b> Endoscopy, a type of X-ray known as an upper gastrointestinal series, blood tests, and stool tests may help with diagnosis. The symptoms of gastritis may be a presentation of a myocardial infarction. Other conditions with similar symptoms include {{inflammation of}} the pancreas, gallbladder problems, and peptic ulcer disease.|$|E

25|$|Thymidine kinase {{has been}} {{determined}} in tissue samples after extraction of the tissue. No standard method for the extraction or for the assay has been developed and TK determination in extracts from cells and tissues have not been validated in relation to any specific clinical question, see however Romain et al. and Arnér et al. A method has been developed for specific determination of TK2 in cell extracts using the substrate analog 5-Bromovinyl 2'-deoxyuridine. In the studies referred to below the methods used {{and the way the}} results are reported are so different that comparisons between different studies are not possible. The TK1 levels in fetal tissues during development are higher than those of the corresponding tissues later. Certain non-malignant diseases also give rise to dramatic elevation of TK values in cells and tissue: in peripheric lymphocytes during monocytosis and in bone marrow during <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia.</b> As TK1 is present in cells during cell division, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the TK activity in malignant tissue should be higher than in corresponding normal tissue.

25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and {{has been used as}} an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with <b>pernicious</b> <b>anemia</b> who have optic neuropathy.|$|E

2500|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{intestinal}} absorption of B12 {{point out that}} the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5µg: [...] "Studies in normal persons indicated that about 1.5µg is assimilated when a single dose varying from 5 to 50µg is administered by mouth.
