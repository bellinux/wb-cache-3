The first four Bond films had been popular in Japan, and Eon {{decided to take}} advantage of the market by producing You Only Live Twice.

25|$|During the 1850s, {{the more}} <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> {{of the navy}} won out and the fleet was {{augmented}} with more ships. In 1855, the first iron propeller-driven ships were ordered from England. These were the steamships Panopi, Pliksavra, Afroessa, and Sfendoni.|$|E
25|$|Although {{more than}} 100 vocal {{compositions}} by Buxtehude survive, {{very few of}} them were included in the important German manuscript collections of the period, and until the early twentieth century, Buxtehude was regarded primarily as a keyboard composer. His surviving church music is praised for its high musical qualities rather than its <b>progressive</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E
50|$|West was {{associated}} with the left-wing <b>progressive</b> <b>element</b> of the Green Party. He left the Green Party of British Columbia after Stuart Parker was ousted as its leader in March, 2000, and left the Green Party of Canada in 2003, citing differences with its new leader Jim Harris.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{groups of}} Dutch/North German Mennonites came to North America from the Russian Empire after 1873, {{especially}} to Kansas and Manitoba. While the more <b>progressive</b> <b>element</b> of these Mennonites assimilated into mainstream society, {{the more conservative}} element emigrated to Latin America. Since then {{there has been a}} steady flow of Mennonite remigrants from Latin America to North America.|$|R
5000|$|In That Hideous Strength by C. S. Lewis, the Warden of Bracton College {{is given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Non-Olet" [...] for having written [...] "a monumental report on National Sanitation. The subject had, if anything, rather recommended him to the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Element.</b> They regarded it as {{a slap in the}} face for the dilettanti and Die-hards, who replied by christening their new Warden Non-Olet." ...|$|R
25|$|With the {{approach}} of the Civil War, the American Party had collapsed over the issue of temperance, and the <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> of that party joined with other old line Whigs in a Delaware People’s Party. Most of this group would eventually join with the new Republican Party in Delaware. Burton ran for Governor a second time, in 1858, against the candidate of this party, James S. Buckmaster, a Frederica merchant, and narrowly won. He then served from January 18, 1859 until January 20, 1863.|$|E
25|$|Hackett's first {{professional}} playing experience {{came as a}} member of three rock bands, Canterbury Glass, Heel Pier and Sarabande, all of whom performed rock with <b>progressive</b> <b>elements.</b> He then joined Quiet World in 1970 which featured his brother John on flute. He did not write any material with the group as the band's founders directed what the other members played, which did not bother Hackett as he wished to get more experience in a recording studio since the band had secured a contract with a label. Hackett played on the band's only studio album, The Road (1970), released on Dawn Records, and left them soon after.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{calls for}} reform throughout the 1960s and 70s, {{it was not}} until 1982 that women’s legal status was brought to the forefront of public debate in Morocco. Eventually, public debates and discussions led to a broad rewriting of the Mudawana in 2003–4, which many attribute to the increase in activity and organization within Moroccan civil society in the 1990s as well as a changing international environment surrounding women's rights and gender equality. Beginning in the 1990s, women’s rights organizations in Morocco gained leverage and influence by incorporating <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> from academia, publishing, and government, and using rhetoric that drew from Islamic sources as well as the language of national development and the rights of women and children.|$|E
50|$|Wilson eked out {{a narrow}} re-election, but his Democratic Party lost seats to the {{opposition}} Republican Party. Wilson's hybrid approach, which injected a <b>progressive</b> <b>element</b> into Democratic policies, had proved to be dissatisfying {{to much of the}} nation. International affairs also became important in the traditionally non-interventionist United States, as voters attempted to determine which party would be best served to keep the nation from entering The Great War.|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine}} the way Genesis retained <b>progressive</b> rock <b>elements</b> during its 1978 - 91 pop-rock period. Genesis began composing music in a pop-rock style in 1978, adapting to the changes in rock by incorporating <b>progressive</b> rock <b>elements</b> into a pop-rock style. This study analyzes thirty-four selected songs from six Genesis albums considered in the pop-rock genre, identifying some of the <b>progressive</b> rock <b>elements</b> in these songs. The project begins with a historical survey of Genesis, shedding light {{on the development of the}} band`s progressive style, its transition through personnel changes and in the music before and after the departure of Peter Gabriel, and the shift toward pop-rock beginning in 1978. A review of published literature and analyses addresses the progressive nature of Genesis. The <b>progressive</b> rock <b>elements</b> pertinent to this study are defined using scholarly literature and analyses of Genesis and other established progressive rock bands. Analytical charts that indicate form, harmony, and rhythm are used to examine the common progressive characteristics in each song addressed in this study...|$|R

A review from Sea of Tranquility states [...] "Serenity {{is one of the}} best bands to arrive on the metal scene in quite some time. This album is a thing of beauty. The orchestral arrangements and huge choirs really add that <b>progressive</b> <b>element</b> to the music that puts this album in the upper echelon of metal releases...." ...|$|R
25|$|Taylor was {{a strong}} critic of the Bush Administration's fiscal policy. He voted against the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, {{claiming}} that the cuts contained in those bills would only increase the national debt. He derided the prescription drug plan passed in 2003 as a giveaway to companies that donate to the Republican Party. He {{is one of the}} House's most vehement opponents of free trade agreements and was strongly opposed to the Bush administration's proposals for reforming Social Security. He has also voted at times with more liberal members of the House with regards to Cuba. Since coming to the House, he has voted in favor of most campaign finance laws and other laws favored by more <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> of the Democratic Party to reform politics.|$|E
25|$|While the {{conservative}} Ethiopian aristocracy was generally supportive of Zewditu, {{it was less}} enthusiastic about many of her relatives. Zewditu's stepmother and the aunt of her husband, Dowager Empress Taytu Betul, had withdrawn from the capital after Menelik's death, but was still distrusted somewhat due to the evident favorism she had practiced {{during the reign of}} her late husband. In an attempt to limit her influence, the aristocracy arranged for her nephew—Zewditu's husband Ras Gugsa Welle—to be appointed to a remote governorship, removing him from court. This move, while intended as a strike against Taytu rather than against Zewditu, is believed to have upset Zewditu considerably. Zewditu also suffered guilt for taking the throne from Lij Iyasu, whom her father had wanted to succeed him – while she believed that Iyasu's overthrow was necessary, she had admired her father greatly, and was unhappy at having to disobey his wishes. Her separation from her husband and her guilt about Iyasu's overthrow combined to make Zewditu not particularly happy as Empress. Interestingly, even though he had treated her abominably, she held much personal affection for her nephew Iyasu, and is said to have wept bitterly for him when told that she was being made Empress as her nephew had been excommunicated for apostasy. Increasingly, the Empress retreated from state responsibility into a world of fasting and prayer, whilst the <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> that surrounded the heir, Tafari Makonnen, gained in strength and influence at court.|$|E
25|$|The {{permanent}} council {{established at the}} instance of the Russian government (1773–1788) served as the highest administrative tribunal, and occupied itself with the elaboration of {{a plan that would}} make practicable the reorganization of Poland on a more rational basis. The <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous Komisja Edukacji Narodowej ("Commission of National Education"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One {{of the members of the}} commission, kanclerz Andrzej Zamoyski, along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some szlachta and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the French Revolution of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.|$|E
50|$|The Regiment was {{composed}} of three battalions, and a headquarters company, totaling about 1000 Soldiers. The first battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Woo Beomseon. The second battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yi Doohwang, and the third battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yi Jinho. All of these commanders had participated successfully during operations against the Donghak peasant rebels and the Chinese Army in 1894-1895. The regiment {{was composed}} of the most <b>progressive</b> <b>element</b> of the Korean Army.|$|R
5000|$|Accordingly, {{the term}} [...] "universal dialectic" [...] {{can be seen}} as part of an attempt to Westernize and/or {{modernize}} the concept of taiji in regard to the fundamental role and nature of complementary opposites in the ongoing self-organizing process of creation. It associates this traditionally Eastern view with the concept of dialectic advocated by Socrates, Hegel, and Marx. This Western influence adds a <b>progressive</b> <b>element</b> to the inexorable process of change, a concept which is absent in Oriental thought.|$|R
30|$|Between 1944 and 1954 {{the system}} was {{extended}} further covering almost all formal workers, although {{there was still a}} marked heterogeneity across sectors. This last feature changed in 1954, when the system moved from one of individual accounts to a one of PAYG type, also a <b>progressive</b> <b>element</b> was introduced with low- and medium-wage workers receiving higher replacement ratios at retirement. Another feature was that the system, due to its relative youth, enjoyed a financial surplus, but this would change quickly.|$|R
500|$|Jamie Lee Rake of HM Magazine {{wrote of}} the Endtime Productions re-release of Martyrium, {{wondering}} if the <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> of the album made the band unnoticed innovators in the early Norwegian extreme metal scene: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s they dubbed their musical style as [...] "sorrow metal" [...] rather than black metal because the black metal {{movement}} was publicly affiliated with Satanism in Norway. According to HM magazine, the <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> on the debut album, Martyrium, were possibly {{ahead of their}} time in the Norwegian extreme metal scene.|$|E
500|$|The {{early work}} of Meshuggah, {{influenced}} mainly by Metallica, is [...] "simpler and more straightforward than their more recent material, {{but some of}} their more <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> {{are present in the}} form of time-changes and polyrhythmics, and Fredrik Thordendal's lead playing stands out". According to Allmusic, their debut album is a relatively immature, but original, release. Double bass drums and [...] "angular" [...] riffing also defined the early work of Meshuggah.|$|E
50|$|The track {{includes}} many <b>progressive</b> house <b>elements,</b> including a sidechained lead {{backed by a}} 120 bpm kick drum pattern. The track also includes 808 percussion in its fills.|$|R
50|$|Without {{the more}} <b>progressive</b> <b>element,</b> the {{original}} Franconia Conference maintained its traditional, guarded church order, through the Civil War and World War I periods. As the local Pennsylvania German language {{gave way to}} English with the dawning of the twentieth century, attempts to guard against change and worldliness produced a codification of traditional rules, and eventually a written constitution. At the same time, as conservative Mennonites began to learn outreach from neighboring Christians, youthful energy broke through into the forming of local mission congregations. Some twenty new congregations appeared from these efforts, ranging from Philadelphia to New England.|$|R

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that …And Justice for All was both the band's [...] "most ambitious" [...] and ultimately [...] "flattest-sounding" [...] album. AllMusic's Steve Huey noted that Metallica followed the blueprint {{of the previous}} two albums, with more sophisticated songs and [...] "apocalyptic" [...] lyrics that envisioned a society in decay. Music journalist Mick Wall was critical of the <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> on the album and felt that, apart from [...] "One" [...] and [...] "Dyers Eve", most of the album sounded clumsy. Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), wrote that, apart from the praiseworthy [...] "One", the album diminished the band's creativity by concentrating the songs with too many riffs. Ulrich said in retrospect that the album has improved with time and it is well-liked among their contemporaries.|$|E
500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> or the metal elements that were on the first record. We thought we could do something just a little more groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E
500|$|Mike Stagno {{said that}} Youthanasia {{features}} [...] "a more traditional type of metal". He explained {{that even though}} the music on a number of tracks remains quite heavy, it was obvious that the thrash metal is [...] "very scarce" [...] on this record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed that Megadeth have abandoned some of the more experimental, <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> in their music. Similarly, Chris Ayers of Exclaim! felt that with Youthanasia, the band [...] "eroded their brilliant thrash to mid-paced chug". According to the band's official website, [...] "Youthanasia marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of their previous album." [...] Speaking about the stylistic direction of the album, then-guitarist Marty Friedman stated: [...] "We pretty much stick to our guns. It's not like we're gonna change our next album to try and follow the trend. We don't really change with the times." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cannon also {{reserved}} {{to himself}} {{the right to}} appoint not only the chairs of the various House committees, but also all of the committees' members, and (despite the seniority system that had begun to develop) used that power to appoint his allies and proteges to leadership positions while punishing those who opposed his legislation. Crucially, Cannon exercised these powers to maintain discipline within the ranks of his own party: the Republicans were divided into the conservative [...] "Old Guard," [...] led by Cannon, and the progressives, led by President Theodore Roosevelt. His committee assignment privileges ensured that the party's <b>Progressive</b> <b>element</b> had little influence in the House, and his control over the legislative process obstructed progressive legislation.|$|R
500|$|The {{band had}} grown {{dissatisfied}} with Gull; the tight finances led Moore {{to leave the}} band a second time—this time permanently. [...] The album {{caught the attention of}} , {{and with the help of}} new manager David Hemmings, the band signed with CBS and received a £ budget for their next record, Sin After Sin (1977). [...] Downing described how the disappointed feelings the group had over Gull's management influenced the dark themes that appeared on Sad Wings of Destiny. [...] The signing required breaking their contract with Gull, resulting in the rights to the first two albums and all related recordings—including demos—becoming property of Gull. [...] Gull periodically repackaged and re-released the material from these albums, such as on the 1981 double album Hero, Hero. [...] For the most part, the band was to abandon the progressive rock elements of their first two albums for a more straight-ahead heavy rock sound; the band revisited these <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> in 2008 on the album Nostradamus.|$|E
500|$|Throughout their career, the band's {{style has}} {{remained}} largely unchanged, {{in spite of}} the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's Somewhere in Time, keyboards on 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and an attempt to return to the [...] "stripped down" [...] production of their earlier material on [...] No Prayer for the Dying. In recent years, however, the band have begun using more <b>progressive</b> <b>elements</b> in their songs, which Steve Harris describes as not progressive [...] "in the modern sense, but like Dream Theater, more in a 70s way". According to Harris, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the band's first album which was [...] "more progressive", while they would only return to this style from 1995's The X Factor, which he states is [...] "like an extension of Seventh Son..., {{in the sense of the}} progressive element to it". The development contrasts with the band's raw sounding earlier material, which AllMusic states was [...] "clearly drawing from elements of punk rock", although Harris firmly denies this.|$|E
500|$|In {{composing}} A Dramatic Turn of Events, Petrucci {{admitted to}} feeling {{a sense of}} responsibility to fans following Portnoy's departure. He also explained {{that the majority of the}} songs on the album were written to prove to people that everything was grounded and intact with the band. Opener [...] "On the Backs of Angels" [...] was designed to reflect Dream Theater's signature sound, the heavy [...] "Build Me Up, Break Me Down" [...] was written far into the making of the album to serve as a contrast to its <b>progressive</b> <b>elements,</b> [...] "Outcry" [...] was intended to be the anthem of the album, and [...] "Breaking All Illusions" [...] was used as an epic piece that would not bind the band to conventional songwriting arrangements. The final song written for the album was the ballad [...] "Beneath the Surface", which is also its closing track. Petrucci wrote the song himself, demoed and recorded it, and then presented it to the band, who were open to including it on the album.|$|E

50|$|Musically, In the Heart of the Young {{followed}} closely {{in the footsteps}} of the band's first album. The members, however, also made some notable changes in comparison to that, particularly given the new emphasis on both <b>progressive</b> rock <b>elements</b> and sentimental ballads.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{contains}} {{the original version}} of [...] "Slark" [...] which was later re-recorded in a much shorter version for a single.
