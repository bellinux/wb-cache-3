5|$|Gypsy <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> used {{primarily}} for construction work. Thousands died of typhus and noma due to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and malnutrition. Anywhere from 1,400 to 3,000 <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> transferred to other concentration camps {{before the murder}} of the remaining population.|$|E
5|$|Convicted <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> {{refused the}} same rights as internees until July 1972, when Special Category Status was {{introduced}} following a hunger strike by 40 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political, status meant <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> treated similarly to prisoners of war; for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.|$|E
5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted {{the faces of the}} prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign they were to be executed. The <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short distance away from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in the faces of Crawford and Knight.|$|E

50|$|As of March 2013 a {{prisoner}} typically {{comes from his}} regularly assigned unit to Jester IV for several days of psychiatric treatment. After the <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> stabilized, the <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> sent back to his regular unit. There <b>are</b> <b>prisoners</b> that have stayed longer.|$|R
5000|$|The supervillain <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> jailed in an {{area known}} as [...] "the Pipeline." [...] The Pipeline is the dark, dank {{basement}} of Iron Heights where the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> treated under awful living conditions with little food or water. The <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> kept in their costumes so the guards can identify them immediately. Guards have orders to shoot any [...] "mask" [...] spotted outside the Pipeline.|$|R
5|$|In 1941, the Germans {{introduced}} the Flamenpolitik, intended to divide German-occupied Belgium by favouring Dutch speakers over French ones. In February 1941, repatriation of Flemish prisoners began. At the time, Dutch dialects were still widely spoken in French Flanders and, although Belgian <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> primarily {{targeted by the}} policy, some French <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> also released as a result.|$|E
5|$|Many of the <b>{{prisoner}}s</b> <b>were</b> {{marched to}} the city of Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were {{marched to the}} river Scheldt and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. The <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Work Kommandos {{were very}} variable, but those in {{agriculture}} were generally considered better than ones in factories or mining, where conditions were worse and <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> vulnerable to Allied bombing raids. In {{rural areas of}} Germany, French prisoners replaced locals conscripted into the German army as agricultural labourers. Guarding Kommandos came {{to be regarded as}} an unnecessary waste of manpower - it was thought unlikely that a prisoner would attempt to escape in a country where he did not know the language. This meant that, in practice, <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were often viewed with curiosity by the German rural population, and the French <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> often allowed to mix quite freely with German civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships with German women.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout history, <b>prisoners</b> have <b>been</b> {{frequent}} {{participants in}} scientific, medical and social human subject research. Some {{of the research}} involving <b>prisoners</b> has <b>been</b> exploitative and cruel. Many of the modern protections for human subjects evolved {{in response to the}} abuses in prisoner research. Research involving <b>prisoners</b> <b>is</b> still conducted today, but <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> now one of the most highly protected groups of human subjects ...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the special}} status of prisoners in Qincheng Prison, each <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> only allowed to {{exercise}} alone. Prisoners cannot see any other prisoners due to the high walls, {{and they are not}} allowed to see any other <b>prisoners</b> while they <b>are</b> in the jail house. If two <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> released from their cells to exercise and they meet each other, one is ordered to back to his or her cell to wait until the other <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> gone.|$|R
50|$|Parchman {{also has}} three cemeteries; <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> buried on-site. A dead <b>prisoner</b> may <b>be</b> buried {{in one of}} two of the cemeteries. Hundreds of <b>prisoners</b> had <b>been</b> buried at two of the cemeteries.|$|R
5|$|As sick <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> often repatriated, many faked {{illness in}} an attempt to return home. From 1941, when those in certain occupations were repatriated, others {{produced}} fake identification documents to enable them to be released.|$|E
5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for convicts transported from Britain. Longer term local <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> also held there from 1858, at a cost to the colonial government, as the then-newly {{constructed}} Perth Gaol had been handed over to the British imperial government for use as a convict station for short term prisoners. Local <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> also been kept in the Round House, or on Rottnest Island. In 1876 Perth Gaol was transferred back to local control.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{in which}} Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas {{had one of}} three {{internment}} camps in the country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, but men aged 15–45 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque). The <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> released the following year, {{after the end of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{forced to}} perform hard and {{dangerous}} slave labor with primitive means in mining and agriculture. The food rations are very small, so the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{constantly on the}} brink of starvation. In combination with the hard work, this leads to huge numbers of prisoners dying. An estimated 40% of prisoners die from malnutrition. Moreover, many <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> crippled from work accidents, frostbite or torture. There is a rigid punishment system in the camp. Prisoners who work too slowly or do not obey an order are beaten or tortured. In cases of stealing food or attempting to escape, the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> publicly executed.|$|R
5000|$|A false {{negative}} error, or in short a {{false negative}}, {{is a test}} result that indicates that a condition does not hold, while in fact it does. I.e., erroneously no effect has been inferred. An example is a truly guilty <b>prisoner</b> who <b>is</b> acquitted of a crime. The condition [...] "the <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> guilty" [...] holds (the <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> guilty). But the test (a trial {{in a court of}} law) failed to realize this, and wrongly decided the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> not guilty, falsely concluding a negative about the condition.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prisoners</b> <b>are</b> up to {{five times}} more likely to be {{affected}} by mental health disorders and illnesses than the general public. [...] The rate of <b>prisoner</b> suicide <b>is</b> 11 times higher than that of the general public. [...] Section 75(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 provides that a <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> entitled to receive medical treatment that is reasonably necessary.|$|R
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century Fort al-Jalali was {{the main}} prison in Oman, holding about 200 prisoners. Some were Omanis from the {{interior}} captured during the Jebel Akhdar War (1954–59), or taken after that war. Other <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> taken during the Dhofar Rebellion (1962–76).|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many {{believed that they}} had only been allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who {{had served in the}} Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{preceding}} the Battle of Taejon, {{some of the}} Bodo League massacres took place around Taejon, where between 3,000 and 7,000 South Korean leftist political <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> shot and dumped into mass graves by South Korean troops, partially recorded by a US Army photographer.|$|E
25|$|In general, in Canada, <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{eligible}} {{to apply for}} full parole after serving one-third of their sentences. <b>Prisoners</b> <b>are</b> also {{eligible to}} apply for day parole, and can do this before being eligible to apply for full parole.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{notified}} by a warden before the interrogation, and the warden {{would let the}} prisoner out {{of his or her}} cell, and lead the prisoner to the interrogation room. After the <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> seated in the interrogation room, the warden would withdraw and wait outside. Based on the experience of former <b>prisoners,</b> there <b>are</b> two type of interrogation rooms. Most <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> interrogated in the interrogation room with a stool inside where the prisoner sits, and facing the <b>prisoner,</b> there <b>was</b> a semicircle shaped platform. On top of the platform, there are several tables next to each other covered with white table cloth. Interrogators and recorders sit behind the tables at the opposite ends.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{prisoner}} enters the prison, {{his or her}} original name is no longer used. Instead, the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> referred by number. The number consists of two parts, with the first two digits indicating the year the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> sent to Qincheng prison, while the remaining digits are the sequential number. For example, prisoner 6299 means that the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> sent to the prison in 1962, while he or she <b>was</b> the 99th <b>prisoner</b> sent to Qincheng Prison that year.|$|R
5|$|In the convict era, {{particularly}} during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> punished with flogging, solitary confinement, {{and working in}} chain gangs at gunpoint. Particularly difficult <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, {{out of a total}} of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of the battle, the {{evacuation}} of the Vukovar hospital was negotiated between Croatian authorities, the JNA and the European Community Monitor Mission in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The JNA subsequently refused the ICRC access to the hospital despite the agreement and removed approximately 300 people from its premises. The group, largely consisting of Croats but also including Serbs, Hungarians, Muslims and two foreign nationals who fought on the side of the Croatian National Guard, was initially transported to the JNA barracks in Vukovar. Several <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> identified as hospital staff and removed from the group to be returned to the hospital while the rest of them were transported to the Ovčara farm south of Vukovar. Once at the farm, the <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> beaten for several hours before the JNA pulled its troops from the site, leaving the prisoners in the custody of the Croatian Serb TO and Serbian paramilitaries. The <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> then taken to a prepared site, shot in groups of ten to twenty and buried in a mass grave.|$|E
5|$|Initially most French <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> {{detained}} in France, but after repeated escapes, the Germans {{decided to move}} the vast majority to new camps in Germany and Eastern Europe.|$|E
30|$|Even if they work, <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{treated as}} a special category, {{distinct}} from other wage earners. Working <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> paid one-third of the previous year’s minimum wage, an amount less than one-ninth of the average wage. We treat prisoners as non-employed, earning zero wages.|$|R
50|$|Oral {{hearings}} {{are used to}} consider {{the majority of cases}} where an indeterminate sentence <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> applying for release and also for some cases involving both determinate and indeterminate sentences where a <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> making representations against a decision to recall them to prison.|$|R
25|$|A protest {{calling for}} {{political}} <b>prisoners</b> to <b>be</b> freed occurred in Buraidah on 14 July. Ten women, relatives of Saleh al-Moteq, a political <b>prisoner,</b> <b>were</b> detained.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{resistance}} was focused in the French-speaking areas of Belgium (Wallonia {{and the city of}} Brussels), although Flemish involvement in {{the resistance}} was also significant. Around 70 percent of underground newspapers were in French, while 60 percent of political <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> Walloon.|$|E
5|$|One {{group was}} sent to Çankırı (and Çorum between Çankırı and Amasya) {{and the other to}} Ayaş. Those {{separated}} for Ayaş were transported in carts {{for a couple of hours}} further to Ayaş. Almost all of them were killed several months later in gorges near Ankara. Only 10 (or 13) deportees of this group were granted permission to return to Constantinople from Ayaş. A group of 20 latecomers arrested on 24 April arrived in Çankırı around 7 or 8 May 1915. Roughly 150 political <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> detained in Ayaş, and another 150 intellectual <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> detained in Çankırı.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 Strangeways Prison riot was a 25-day prison riot and rooftop protest at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, England. The riot {{began on}} 1 April 1990 when prisoners {{took control of}} the prison chapel, and the riot quickly spread {{throughout}} most of the prison. The riot and rooftop protest ended on 25 April when the final five <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> removed from the rooftop, making it the longest prison riot in British penal history. One prisoner was killed during the riot, and 147 prison officers and 47 <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> injured. Much of the prison was damaged or destroyed with the cost of repairs coming to £50million.|$|E
50|$|Jewish <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} issued kosher rations.|$|R
25|$|Less {{than two}} full {{days into the}} experiment, one inmate began {{suffering}} from depression, uncontrolled rage, crying and other mental dysfunctions. The <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> eventually released after screaming and acting unstable {{in front of the}} other inmates. This <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> replaced with one of the alternates.|$|R
50|$|A Takron-Galtos <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> {{recruited}} for the Lantern's enemies, the Sinestro Corps. Bur'Gunza, a model <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> {{let out of}} his restraints {{on the day of}} his release. He slays forty-two guards before he is defeated. This brings him {{to the attention of the}} Sinestro Corps.|$|R
