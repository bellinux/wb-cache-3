In meat production, an important measure to prevent zoonotic agents being transferred from animals to humans via meat is modern meat inspection. Systems for food safety assurance at the level of food producers include HACCP and GMP. One of the methods for validation and verification of GMP and HACCP systems is the implementation of <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria</b> at slaughterhouses. In case of the occurrence of foodborne disease, reliable and fast methods for detection of the causative agent are necessary...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} 2006 - 2011 six public {{catering}} establishments (3 canteens and 3 cafeterias) were monitored, trough audit and sampling, {{in order to}} verify the application of good manufacturing and hygiene practices during food production, handling and serving. The compliance to microbiological food safety criteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.) and <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria</b> were investigated using ISO standards for microbiological analyses. A total of 612 samples were collected: 192 food samples and 288 environmental swab samples from canteens; 33 food samples and 99 swab samples from cafeterias. Regarding food safety, two samples were in disagreement with criteria fixed in EU Regulation as Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from a turkey breast in a canteen and from a sandwich in a cafeteria. Regarding <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria,</b> as no microbiological limits are legally defined for catering services, for this study limits were fixed according to the quality standards of tender, scientific literature and laboratory experience. 23. 4 % foodstuffs and 8. 7 % swabs resulted non-compliant in canteens; 48. 5 % foodstuffs and 6. 1 % swabs resulted non-compliant in cafeterias. The count of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) was higher of the fixed limits in raw turkey meat and in cooked spinach: the presence among CPS of S. aureus was confirmed, strains {{were not able to}} produce enterotoxins. The most common non-compliance in hygiene criteria was represented by aerobic colony count (60. 7 % of total non-compliance in canteens and 75. 0 % in cafeterias) and coliform bacteria (20. 3 % in canteens and 25. 0 % in cafeterias). Nine raw foods or raw readyto- eat food samples were non-compliant for both coliform bacteria and aerobic count; one sample (raw turkey meat) was non-compliant for CPS and aerobic count but resulted to be compliant after cooking. Auditing and sampling are the most effective tools to improve food quality standard and to enhance food business operators’ awareness of hygiene procedures...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the Piophila casei colonization under controlled conditions on “casu marzu”, a typical Sardinian sheep milk cheese. Three batches of two different kind of cheese (PO, holed paste and PC, firm paste) were produced in duplicate (test and control). Test cheeses were exposed to the Piophila casei colonization in a conditioned store room, while control cheeses were suitably protected. All the samples were analyzed at 0, 10, 30, 60 and 90 days from the production. The pH and aw, the chemical composition and the microbiological parameters (food safety and <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria)</b> were determined. The colonization was unhomogeneous between the batches: PO cheeses were more easily colonized and showed more intense proteolysis and lipolysis respect to PC cheeses. The microbiological parameters were strongly affected by the experimental process conditions. The authors discuss about the opportunity of a controlled production of “casu marzu” and the implications to the health of consumers...|$|E
40|$|Providing {{guidance}} on detailed rules {{of a food}} safety criterion (FSC) for fresh poultry meat (chicken and turkey) during shelf life (i. e. n and c values) with the purpose to be {{in accordance with the}} existing <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criterion</b> (PHC) on poultry carcasses (i. e. n= 50, c= 7) proved to be difficult given differences between both criteria in their principle concepts and methodological design. The selected approach taken was to estimate, based on certain assumptions, possible n and c values of an FSC that performs detecting a similar Salmonella prevalence to that detected by the current PHC with a given degree of certainty. Calculations presented consider both batch and carcass prevalence. Guidance was additionally provided on a possible revision of both the PHC and the FSC when the EU target (1 % or less broiler flocks remaining positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium) would be achieved. If a target for only these two serovars is set for flock prevalence, the impact on the prevalence of Salmonella on carcasses will depend on the relative contribution of those two serovars to all Salmonella serovars. Thus, if the current flock prevalence target is changed to a prevalence target for all serovars there may be a better relationship between the occurrence of flock infection and the prevalence of Salmonella in carcasses. Advice is given on possible changes in both the PHC and the FSC under such low Salmonella flock prevalence scenario. A series of recommendations are made on data needs in case future related analysis would be needed...|$|R
40|$|Poultry can be {{a source}} of {{biological}} hazards for consumers. Campylobacteriosis, for example, has been the most frequently reported zoonosis in European Union since 2005. Annually the number of campylobacteriosis cases in humans in the EU is estimated at 9 million cases. To diminish this number, risk assessment studies suggest that reducing the number of Campylobacter on chicken meat is needed. Potentially, such interventions could be effective for other hazards as ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli, and the level of process control could be measured by generic E. coli. However concentrations of Campylobacter, ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli and generic E. coli along the processing were not yet known. The aim of this thesis was to study changes in the contamination of broiler chicken carcasses with Campylobacter, ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli and generic E. coli through the broiler processing line, and to identify and quantify factors related to processing technology and management that might influence these changes. The results obtained in this thesis can be relevant for processing plants, equipment manufacturers and governments and serve as a background to develop interventions. The results obtained in this thesis demonstrated that bacterial levels at the end of processing are affected by the initial bacterial contamination, which varies between incoming batches. Moreover they are affected by changes in the concentration of bacteria during processing that are specific for each slaughterhouse. Bacterial concentrations in excreta and caeca were the most prominent risk factors, because they were associated with concentration on carcasses at various processing steps. This thesis reveals for the first time, that processing hygiene may be affected by the practices of food handlers. The presence of that are visibly contaminated carcasses with faeces may be associated with compliance with prescribed procedures. As such carcasses carried higher E. coli concentrations, it suggests that compliance influences food safety. In the near future the European slaughterhouses may have to comply with a <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criterion</b> (PHC) for Campylobacter. To achieve this limit, they will need to implement improvements using technological solutions e. g. cleaning the exterior of carcasses at the first processing steps. This intervention was tested and was shown potential to diminish the bacterial concentration on carcasses. Further interventions could aim at minimising contamination during subsequent processing steps, especially during defeathering and evisceration. Slaughterhouses may also implement managerial interventions, such as revisions of procedures and measures to ensure the compliance of food handlers. A combination of both technological and managerial approaches might reduce the bacterial concentrations most efficiently. Different slaughterhouses might need different interventions because contamination patterns were found to differ between slaughterhouses. To determine which risk factors and measures are most relevant, slaughterhouses will need to monitor bacterial contamination throughout their processing line. This monitoring could be based on generic E. coli because similarities in the effect of processing steps have been identified between this organism and ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli and Campylobacter at most of the tested processing steps. Once the risk factors are determined, and interventions are in place, those might effectively reduce the levels of multiple hazards on broiler carcasses, thus contributing to public health protection...|$|R

40|$|Current {{legislation}} in Europe uses the Enterobacteriaceae as a parameter in <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria</b> for various food products and {{refers to the}} corresponding ISO standard (ISO 21528 - 1 : 2004) as mandatory analytical method for this purpose. The ISO procedure includes an enrichment step in EE (“Enterobacteriaceae Enrichment”) broth, {{but it has been}} reported recently that some isolates of Enterobacteriaceae do not grow well or will even die off in this broth, which could lead to false negative results. To determine if this trait is common among the Enterobacteriaceae, a collection of 95 strains was screened for growth in EE broth. Inhibition was observed with 9 strains (7 Cronobacter sakazakii, 1 Cronobacter malonaticus and 1 Enterobacter amnigenus). Factors affecting cell death were found to be related mainly to the inclusion of bile salts and dyes in this medium. In a second step, an alternative method omitting the EE broth was evaluated using 326 samples, comprising 8 different food matrices and environmental samples from the corresponding manufacturing sites. Positive results were obtained for 235 samples using the ISO standard method and 232 samples using the alternative shortened method. No significant difference was found between the results for the two methods. It is proposed that the standard method for detection of Enterobacteriaceae is revised accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{products}} and related processes must {{be safe to}} protect consumers’ health. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate microbiological criteria of a traditional Piedmont cheese, made by two different cheese producers (A and B). Three batches of each cheese were considered. The following seven samples of each batch were collected: raw milk, milk at 38 °C, curd, cheese at 7, 30, 60, 90 days of ripening. During cheese making process, training activities dealing with food safety were conducted. Analyses regarding food safety and <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria</b> were set up according to the EC Regulation 2073 / 2005. Other microbiological and chemical-physical analyses [lactic streptococci, lactobacilli, pH and water activity (Aw) ] were performed as well. Shiga-toxin Escherichia coli, aflatoxin M 1 and antimicrobial substances were considered only for raw milk. All samples resulted negative for food safety criteria; Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) were high in the first phase of cheese production, however they decreased at the end of ripening. A high level of CPS in milk was found in producer A, likewise in some cheese samples a count of > 5 Log CFU/g was reached; staphylococcal enterotoxins resulted negative. The pH and Aw values decreased during the cheese ripening period. The competition between lactic flora and potential pathogen microorganisms and decreasing of pH and Aw are considered positive factors in order to ensure safety of dairy products. Moreover, training activities play a crucial role to manage critical points and perform corrective action. Responsible application of good manufacturing practices are considered key factors to obtain a high hygienic level in dairy products...|$|E

The FSMS diagnosis indicated FSMS activities at an average level operating in moderate-risk context level but with good system output. Likewise, microbiological assessment revealed a better system output with respect to pathogens (Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.) and faecal hygiene (Escherichia coli) as none of these were detected in any critical sampling location throughout the study.

40|$|A risk ranking process {{identified}} Toxoplasma gondii and pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) as {{the most}} relevant biological hazards for meat inspection of sheep and goats. As these are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance system using risk-based interventions was proposed. Further studies are required on T. gondii and pathogenic VTEC. If new information confirms these hazards as a high risk to public health from meat from sheep or goats, setting targets at carcass level should be considered. Other elements of the system are risk-categorisation of flocks/herds based on improved Food Chain Information (FCI), classification of abattoirs according to their capability to reduce faecal contamination, and use of improved <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria.</b> It is proposed to omit palpation and incision from post-mortem inspection in animals subjected to routine slaughter. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible {{and based on the}} risk of occurrence, taking into account FCI, which should be expanded to reflect the extensive production systems used, and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated and include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control plans, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for tuberculosis and fasciolosis at animal level. Surveillance of tuberculosis at the slaughterhouse in small ruminants should be improved and encouraged, as this is in practice the only surveillance system available. Extended use of FCI could compensate for some, but not all, the information on animal health and welfare lost if only visual post-mortem inspection is applied...|$|E
40|$|European {{legislation}} has defined as <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria</b> for themain livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and pigs) themonitoring of {{aerobic colony count}} and Enterobacteriaceae. Detected values above the de- fined criteria require an improvement in slaughter hygiene and the reviewof process control. Themain source of microbiological contamination of beef carcasses along the slaughterline is of fecal origin, therefore Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae seemto be themost suitable indicators to assess the hygienic status of the slaughter process. Althoughmicrobiological criteria addressing indicator bacteria have beeninplace inindustrializedcoun- tries for several years, scattered information still exists on factors affecting their counts on beef carcasses along the slaughterline. Therefore, a systematic literature review, covering the period 2000 – 2012, was conducted to gather information concerning: 1) counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses linked to different stages of the slaughterline; 2) factors influencing presence/counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef car- casses; and 3) the relationship between indicator bacteria (E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) counts and visual fecal contamination of beef carcasses. According to the 41 retrieved papers the following conclusions were drawn. A decrease of the indicator bacteria counts was recorded after sequential decontamination treatments, such as pasteurization and hot water washing. Slaughterhouse characteristics influenced bacterial load of beef carcasses, although {{it was difficult to}} assess which factors (i. e., slaughterhouse throughput, design of the plant, surveillance system in place) had the greatest effect. Finally, carcasses from fecal contaminated animals had higher bacterial loads than those fromclean animals.

Prevalence differed between slaughterhouses (P< 0. 5), and Salmonella was isolated from 39 of 244 samples of finishing slaughtered pigs (15. 9 %) and from 4 of 45 environmental samples (8. 9 %). In pig samples, carcasses showed the highest prevalence (18 %) followed by colon content (14. 8 %), lymph nodes (13 %) and liver (1. 6 %). S.

Keine der Proben wies gemäß VO (EG) Nr. 2073 / 2005 und den Empfehlungen der Kommission 2004 / 24 /EC und 2005 / 175 /EC Mängel hinsichtlich der mikrobiologischen Qualität auf. Der {{qualitative}} Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae in Anlehnung an die ISO-Norm 21528 - 1 ergab für 55 Proben (44 %) einen positiven Befund. Die quantitative Bestimmung von coliformen Keimen in Anlehnung an die Methoden L 01. 00 - 54 und L 01. 00 - 3 der ASUV nach § 64 LFGB ergab für 41 Proben (33 %) einen positiven Befund. Die Mehrzahl der positiven Proben (88 %) wies einen niedrigen Keimgehalt auf (< 102 KbE/g), der maximale Keimgehalt lag bei 3, 4 x 104 KbE/g. Eine Kontamination mit Enterobacteriaceae bzw. coliformen Keimen wurde häufiger bei unverpackt angebotenen Proben festgestellt (70 % bzw. 56 % positiv), die in der Mehrzahl der Fälle im Einzelhandel oder auf dem Wochenmarkt erworben worden waren. Frischkäse mit Zutaten (Paprika, Tomate, Gewürze) waren häufiger positiv für Enterobacteriaceae bzw. coliforme Keime. Die am häufigsten nachgewiesenen Enterobacteriaceae-Spezies waren Enterobacter cloacae (30 % der Proben), Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae (19 %), Escherichia coli (14 %), Serratia liquefaciens, Pantoea agglomerans (beide 13 %) und Klebsiella oxytoca (10 %). E. coli wurde in 17 Proben (14 %) nachgewiesen, der maximale Keimgehalt lag bei 9, 5 x 101 KbE/g. Eine Überprüfung von 48 E. coli-Isolaten aus diesen Proben auf das Vorkommen der Gene stx 1 und stx 2 ergab keinen Hinweis auf Verotoxin-bildende E. coli. Listeria monocytogenes war in keiner Probe nachweisbar. Lediglich in drei Proben (2, 4 %) wurde L. innocua nachgewiesen. Koagulase-positive Staphylokokken wurden in einer Probe (1, 4 %) nachgewiesen (4, 0 x 101 KbE/g). Für fünf Frischkäsezubereitungen wurde die Veränderung des Gehaltes an Enterobacteriaceae während der Lagerung über 7 Tage bei + 6 °C geprüft. Bei allen Proben wurde eine Reduktion des Keimgehaltes um ein bis zwei Zehnerpotenzen festgestellt. Für den qualitativen Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae wurde in Anlehnung an die ISO-Norm 21528 - 1 gemäß VO (EG) Nr. 2073 / 2005 der VRBG-Agar verwendet. Ein Vergleich mit einem neueren Selektivnährmedium (ECC-Agar) zeigte, dass der ECC-Agar bezüglich der Nachweisbarkeit gleichwertig war und zudem auch noch eine eindeutigere Identifizierung von E. coli ermöglichte. Für die quantitative Bestimmung von coliformen Keimen bzw. E. coli wurden in Anlehnung an die Methoden L 01. 00 - 54 und L 01. 00 - 3 der ASUV nach § 64 LFGB die LST-MUG-Bouillon und der VRB-MUG-Agar verwendet. Zusätzlich wurde der ECC-Agar eingesetzt. Es wurde gezeigt, dass der ECC-Agar sich als alternatives Selektivnährmedium für Nachweis von coliformen Keimen eignet. Die Verwendung der LST-MUG-Bouillon ergab für 41 Proben (33 %), der ECC-Agar für 34 Proben (27 %) und der VRB-MUG-Agar für 28 Proben (22 %) einen positiven Befund. Im Bezug auf die Nachweishäufigkeit der verschiedenen Coliformen-Spezies unterschieden sich die geprüften Medien meist nicht wesentlich. Deutliche Unterschiede wurden jedoch für den Nachweis von E. coli festgestellt. Für den qualitativen Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae wurde eine Voranreicherung (nicht-selektiv und selektiv) durchgeführt, für die quantitative Bestimmung von coliformen Keimen wurden die Nährmedien direkt beimpft. Nach Durchführung einer Voranreicherung waren 55 Proben positiv für Enterobacteriaceae, nach Direktbeimpfung nur 41 Proben. Das Spektrum der nachgewiesenen Enterobacteriaceae-Spezies war weitestgehend ähnlich, die Nachweisrate einzelner Spezies unterschied sich jedoch. Für den Anteil der E. coli-positiven Proben nach Direktbeimpfung (sieben Proben) und nach Voranreicherung (17 Proben) wurde ein signifikanter Unterschied festgestellt (p < 0, 05). Generell war die mikrobiologische Qualität der untersuchten Frischkäse als zufriedenstellend zu beurteilen. Sowohl der Nachweis von coliformen Keimen als auch der Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae eignet sich als Parameter zur Beurteilung der mikrobiologischen Qualität, auch wenn die derzeit gültige EU-Verordnung diese Parameter für Frischkäse nicht vorsieht. In this study, a {{total of}} 125 curd (fresh) cheese samples from retail shops in Hesse, Germany (all made from pasteurized milk) were examined during 2007, to study their microbiological quality. According to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073 / 2005 and Commission Recommendations 2004 / 24 /EC and 2005 / 175 /EC none of these products was of unsatisfactory quality. The detection of Enterobacteriaceae according to ISO 21528 - 1 gave a positive results for 55 of the fresh cheese samples (44 %). The enumeration of coliform bacteria, performed according to methods L 01. 00 - 54 und L 01. 00 - 3 of the German collection of analytical methods for food (ASUV) in accordance to article 64 of the German food and feed law (LFGB) gave positive results for 41 of the samples (33 %). However, the number of colony forming units (cfu) of these bacteria was very low (< 102 cfu/g) {{in most of the}} positive samples (88 %), the maximum number was 3. 4 x 104 cfu/g. Contamination with Enterobacteriaceae and coliform bacteria was more frequent in cheese samples obtained as open slices from retail shop counters or from farmers markets (70 % and 56 % positive, respectively). Furthermore, curd cheese with ingredients (paprika, tomato, spices) was more frequently contaminated with Enterobacteriaceae or coliform bacteria than curd cheese without other ingredients. The most abundant Enterobacteriaceae species were Enterobacter cloacae (30 % of the samples), Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae (19 %), Escherichia coli (14 %), Serratia liquefaciens, Pantoea agglomerans (both 13 %), and Klebsiella oxytoca (10 %). E. coli was identified in 17 samples (14 %), the maximum value was 9. 5 x 101 cfu/g. The examination of 48 E. coli-isolates of these samples for the occurrence of stx 1 and stx 2 did show no indication for Verotoxin-building E. coli. Listeria monocytogenes was not detected in any sample. Only three samples (2. 4 %) were positive for L. innocua. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in one (1. 4 %) sample (4. 0 x 101 cfu/g). Five fresh cheese varieties were examined for the alteration of the Enterobacteriaceae-concentration during storage for 7 days at + 6 °C. A reduction of the bacterial count about 1 log cfu/g to 2 log cfu/g was observed in all samples. VRBG agar was used for the detection of Enterobacteriaceae according to ISO 21528 - 1 consistent with 2005 / 2073 /EC. A comparison with a newer selective medium (ECC agar) showed that the ECC agar gave comparable results with regard to the detectability, and allowed identification of E. coli. LST MUG broth and VRB MUG agar were used for the detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria and E. coli according to ASUV methods L 01. 00 - 54 and L 01. 00 - 3. Additionally, the ECC agar was used. The ECC agar was found to be a suitable alternative selective medium for the detection of coliform bacteria. The LST MUG broth gave a positive result for 41 samples (33 %), the ECC agar for 34 samples (27 %), and the VRB-MUG agar for 28 samples (22 %). With regard to the detection rate of different coliform species, the tested media were equivalent in most cases, but considerable differences were observed for the detection of E. coli. For the qualitative detection of Enterobacteriaceae, pre-enrichment using non-selective and selective media was performed, while for the enumeration of coliform bacteria the media were directly inoculated. After pre-enrichment, 55 samples were positive for Enterobacteriaceae, after direct inoculation only 41 samples were positive. The range of detected Enterobacteriaceae species was similar, but the detection rate of some species was different. In particular for the number of E. coli-positive samples, a significant difference (p < 0. 05) was observed between positive results after direct inoculation (n = 7) and pre-enrichment (n = 17). Generally the microbiological quality of the examined fresh cheeses was satisfactory. The detection of coliform bacteria, as well as the detection of Enterobacteriaceae are both suitable parameters to estimate the microbiological quality of curd cheese, even though the current EU regulations do not demand these parameters to be implemented as a <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>criterion</b> for curd cheese...|$|R
40|$|The {{causes of}} {{differences}} in Campylobacter and Escherichia coli concentrations on broiler chicken carcasses after chilling between slaughterhouses are not fully identified. Therefore, {{it is a challenge}} for slaughterhouses to comply with <b>Process</b> <b>Hygiene</b> <b>Criteria</b> for broiler meat. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify which processing steps contribute to increases or decreases in Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations within and between two slaughterhouses. Identifying the processing steps with variable performance could explain the differences in bacterial concentrations after chilling between slaughterhouses. Thermotolerant Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations on carcasses during broiler processing were measured during the summer period in 21 trials after bleeding, scalding, defeathering, evisceration and chilling. In two slaughterhouses with comparable Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations in the incoming batches (after bleeding), the mean log 10 concentrations are found to be significantly different after chilling. Campylobacter concentrations decreased by 1. 40 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 1 and by 1. 86 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 2, whereas E. coli decreased by 2. 19 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 1 and by 2. 84 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 2. Higher concentrations of Campylobacter and E. coli on carcasses after chilling were observed in Slaughterhouse 1 in which an increase in concentrations was observed after evisceration. The effect of processing on Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations in Slaughterhouse 1 did not differ between batches. In Slaughterhouse 2, the effect of processing on the concentrations of both bacteria varied over batches. Changes in E. coli concentration levels during processing were similar to Campylobacter except for defeathering. E. coli concentration significantly decreased after defeathering in both slaughterhouses, whereas Campylobacter increased in Slaughterhouse 2 and in Slaughterhouse 1 no significant changes were observed. The patterns of increases and decreases in bacterial concentrations during processing are specific for each slaughterhouse. Inhomogeneous patterns potentially explain the differences in concentrations after chilling between slaughterhouses.

30|$|The {{impact of}} urban contamination, {{degrading}} the microbiological quality of La Paz River basin {{can be measured}} by the {{dramatic increase in the}} number of thermotolerant coliforms in surface water at all impacted sites. According to thermotolerant coliform data, site 1 —not impacted by wastewater discharges-, can be classified as a source of water of maximum quality (Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia 1992), opposed to sites 2 – 4, that largely exceeded the standards for recreational water (i.e. 10, 000 MPN/ 100  ml) (Osmond et al. 1997). Moreover, the average density at the agricultural area—site 3, surpassed in two orders of magnitude the allowed concentration for unrestricted irrigation water, according to WHO guidelines (WHO 1989) (i.e. < 1000 MPN/ 100  ml). In this line, the density of thermotolerant coliforms found in fresh produce also exceeded the satisfactory microbiological <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria</b> level 1000 MPN/ 100  g of fresh weight (ICMSF 1996). Overall, these parameters indicate that La Paz River basin at downstream locations aside from point 1, has a very poor microbiological water quality and is severely polluted by urban contaminants throughout the year. It is estimated that around 4.08  ×  107  m 3 /year of wastewater from municipal, industrial and hospital sources, is directly released into the river (Duran et al. 2003).|$|R

It is {{the objective of this}} study to investigate the hygiene condition of dentures worn by some elderly people in South East Local Government Area Ibadan Nigeria. Two trained and calibrated examiners examined the oral cavity and dentures of 39 elderly individuals who were 65 years and above, living in South East Local Government area in Ibadan Nigeria. They were examined using a mouth mirror, a blunt probe of diameter 0. 5 mm and a W. H. O assessment form, modified to include denture <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria,</b> developed by the authors. The findings were recorded by two trained recorder clerks. The results highlight the poor hygiene condition of dentures used by some elderly in this local government area. Thirty two (82. 1 %) of them had plaque or calculus on their dentures. Only 17. 9 % had clean dentures and 38. 1 % had calculus on their dentures. Denture stomatitis was observed in 15. 4 % of denture wearers. Denture wearers among the elderly individuals in south East Local Government area in Ibadan exhibited inadequate denture hygiene conditions. In spite of poor denture hygiene which is known to contribute to denture stomatitis, the prevalence of denture stomatitis was very low in the study group.

The {{aim of this study}} was to define the prevalence of Chlamydiaceae in Swiss fattening pigs by applying sensitive and specific detection methods and to correlate prior antibiotic treatment and farm related factors with differences in prevalence. Conjunctival and fecal swabs were collected from 636 pigs in 29 Swiss fattening pig farms with and without antibiotic treatment, at the beginning and the end of the fattening period. The swabs were screened by real-time PCR for Chlamydiaceae. For the chlamydial detection and species-identification, a DNA-microarray analysis was performed. All farms were positive for Chlamydiaceae with 94. 3 and 92. 0 % prevalence in fecal swabs as well as 45. 9 and 32. 6 % in conjunctival swabs at the first and second time points, respectively. Antibiotic treatment could not clear the infection on herd level. Potential contact with wild boars was a significant risk factor, while <b>hygiene</b> <b>criteria</b> did not influence chlamydial prevalence. A correlation of chlamydial positivity to diarrhea, but not to conjunctivitis was evident. Chlamydia suis was the predominant species. Mixed infections with C. suis and C. pecorum were common, with a substantial increase in C. pecorum positivity at the end of the fattening period, and this finding was associated with ruminant contact. C. abortus was detected in one conjunctival swab. In this study, C. suis inhabited the intestinal tract of nearly all examined pigs, implying a long-term infection. C. pecorum was also common and might be transmitted to pigs by ruminants...|$|R
40|$|Background: Indicator {{bacteria}} are considered an interesting target for microbiological analysis {{in order to}} obtain information about the <b>hygiene</b> of <b>processes</b> and products. Quantitative analysis targeting in- dicator bacteria offers several advantages over pathogenic bacteria since indicator bacteria prevalence and counts are higher, and their distribution is more homogeneous, than pathogens. However, although microbiological criteria addressing indicator {{bacteria are}} already in place in industrialised countries such as the EU and US, information on factors affecting their counts on carcasses at slaughter is scattered. Objectives: The aim of this review was to provide valuable information about the variability of indicator bacteria along the pig slaughterline, and to suggest suitable means for the implementation of GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) and <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> in pig slaughterhouses. Conclusions: Along the slaughterline, scalding and chilling stages effectively reduce both Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae counts on pig carcasses and have to be considered in the implementation of HACCP systems. Surface pasteurisation under experimental slaughter conditions was also effective; in contrast, washing did not reduce microbial contamination on pig carcasses. Evisceration was confirmed as a key contamination point, in particular regarding Enterobacteriaceae, but {{it has been suggested that}} bacterial load can be controlled by anal plugging if it is performed according to good manufacturing practices (GMP) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Grapevine {{production}} by classical grafting methods and in commercial scale emerged over 130 years. This system remained handmade until the mid- 1950 s, {{when the first}} international certification programs aimed at obtaining mother plants with high viral sanity emerged. The necessity to increase the scale of production on industrial model and plant material production based on minimum morphological standards appeared {{at the end of}} the 1960 s. Along the 1970 s, research unlocked knowledge on semi-automated grafting, <b>process</b> <b>hygiene,</b> use of plant growth regulators and understanding of physiological events of rootstock-scion compatibility, callus formation and rooting. So, until the mid- 2000 s, certification schemes and propagation processes advanced little in technical standard. However, grapevine growing areas were expanded and demands for plant material increased, and new diseases emerged from contaminated nurseries. These new diseases (new viral complexes, phytoplasmas, bacteria and grapevine trunk diseases) were discovered by high-sensitivity diagnostic methods. Today, there is a new discussion on the nursery segment worldwide. The propagation techniques have been reviewed from the perspective of reducing the incidence of new diseases and minimum physiological damage of nursery plants during the production stages. Therefore, technological innovations regarding equipment, practices and production inputs have been incorporated in new certification schemes. However, despite these advantages, these schemes have become more complex and multidisciplinary than previous ones, bringing difficulties in adaptation of nurserymen...|$|R

As a consequence, adequate hygienic measures and correct consumer’s information {{is required in}} order to reduce any potential risk linked to this product. In the present study, the occurrence of pathogens (Salmonella spp., verocytotoxigenic E. coli, Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus) in raw milk and bovine faeces collected in 4 farms in the province of Pesaro-Urbino (Italy), between January 2007 and March 2009 has been investigated; 99. 5 % of milk samples resulted negative for the pathogens considered and complying with the regulation S. aureus limits. Campylobacter has been found in 0. 44 % of the samples, collected during summer, while only one sample resulted positive to a non-verocytotoxigenic E. coli O 157. In respect to faeces, 62. 6 % of the samples resulted negative, 33. 6 % were contaminated by Campylobacter spp. (68 % Campylobacter coli and 32 % Campylobacter jejuni) and 3. 8 % by E. coli O 157.

40|$|During colony relocation, the {{selection}} of a new nest involves exploration and assessment of potential sites followed by colony movement {{on the basis of a}} collective decision making <b>process.</b> <b>Hygiene</b> and pathogen load of the potential nest sites are factors worker scouts might evaluate, given the high risk of epidemics in group-living animals. Choosing nest sites free of pathogens is hypothesized to be highly efficient in invasive ants as each of their introduced populations is often an open network of nests exchanging individuals (unicolonial) with frequent relocation into new nest sites and low genetic diversity, likely making these species particularly vulnerable to parasites and diseases. We investigated the nest site preference of the invasive pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis, through binary choice tests between three nest types: nests containing dead nestmates overgrown with sporulating mycelium of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum (infected nests), nests containing nestmates killed by freezing (uninfected nests), and empty nests. In contrast to the expectation pharaoh ant colonies preferentially (84 %) moved into the infected nest when presented with the choice of an infected and an uninfected nest. The ants had an intermediate preference for empty nests. Pharaoh ants display an overall preference for infected nests during colony relocation. While we cannot rule out that the ants are actually manipulated by the pathogen, we propose that this preference might be an adaptive strategy by the host to "immunize" the colony against future exposure to the same pathogenic fungus...|$|R

In this study it was determined the level of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli contamination on the skin of 100 pigs and in the corresponding carcasses. It also was analysed, for each pig, the skin visible level of faecal contamination (VLFC), recorded the holding time in lairage and the slaughter order (beginning or ending). In each animal, sponge swabs were performed on the skin and in the respective carcasses (approximate 1000 cm 2). A total of 200 samples were microbiologically analyzed according to ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004 (Enterobacteriaceae) and ISO 16649 - 2 : 2001 (E. coli). The achieved results showed that there was no significant correlation (p-value 3 ̆e 0, 05) between VLFC in the skin´s pig and its level of bacteria contamination which could be due to the shower, used before stunning, that maybe had a different effect on the removal of VLFC and bacteria from the skin (that could still adhered to the skin after shower). Increasing holding time in lairage leaded to a highly significant increasing level of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 001), both on swines’ skin and in the respective carcasses. Achieved results also showed that pigs mean time in lairage was significantly higher for pigs slaughtered at the beginning than for those ones slaughtered {{at the end of the}} session (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), which could help to explain why the average level of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli on pigs skin´s and in carcasses was significantly higher for pigs slaughtered at the beginning than for those slaughtered at the end. The results allows to underline lairage logistic and showers efficiency before slaughter as important processes that should be efficiently controlled in order to improve hygiene level of pork carcasses...|$|R
40|$|In this report, {{harmonised}} epidemiological {{indicators are}} proposed for food-borne biological hazards {{that are related}} to domestic sheep and goats and meat thereof and that can be addressed in the context of meat inspection. These hazards include Toxoplasma gondii, pathogenicverocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli and mycobacteria. An epidemiological indicator is defined as the prevalence or concentration of the hazard at a certain stage of the food chain or an indirect measure of the hazard that correlates with the human health risk caused by the hazard. The indicators can be used by the European Commission and the Member States to consider when adaptations to meat inspection methods may be required, and to carry out risk analysis to support such decisions. It is foreseen that the indicators will be used in the integrated sheep and goats meat safety assurance system outlined in the EFSA Scientific Opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by inspection of meat from sheep and goats, particularly to help categorise farms/flock and slaughterhouses according to the risk related to the hazards and <b>process</b> <b>hygiene.</b> Depending on the purpose and the epidemiological situation, risk managers should decide on the most appropriate indicator(s) to use, either alone or in combination, at national, regional, slaughterhouse or farm/flock level.

40|$|In the {{research}} area of cleaning and <b>process</b> <b>hygiene</b> {{it is important}} to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the deposition of particles and macromolecules onto surfaces. The deposition process is described as the transport of particles to the surface followed by attachment. If the hydrodynamic forces are strong enough, the particles can be re-entrained. In this work particle deposition was studied in situ. In order to obtain a well-defined mass transfer to a glass surface covered with indium-tin oxide onto which deposition was to occur, an experimental setup consisting of a wall-jet cell was employed. Model solutions consisting of polystyrene latex particles of two particle radii, 0. 23 um and 0. 38 um, were used in the deposition experiments. The deposited particles were visualized by total internal reflection microscopy. The construction of the cell made it possible to radially scan the surface and thus follow the deposition of particles at positions exposed to different wall shear rates in one single experiment. To be able to better understand the different phenomena which are thought to affect deposition a model was employed. By using a transport term describing the particle flux to the surface and another term expressing the detachment of particles, transport to and from the collector surface could be included in the model. The flux term to the surface included a so-called shielding function. The phenomenon of surface shielding was used to explain the decrease in deposition rate. The study of shielding was expanded by applying a computer algorithm based on the concept of random sequential adsorption. It was found that the size of the shielded area increased with increasing wall shear rate, as well as with decreasing bulk particle concentration...|$|R
