25|$|The key {{innovation}} that made ocean-going steamers viable was {{the change from}} the paddle-wheel to the screw-propeller as the mechanism of propulsion. These steamships quickly became more popular, because the <b>propeller's</b> <b>efficiency</b> was consistent regardless of the depth at which it operated.

5000|$|When a {{propeller}} {{is added}} to a ship its performance is altered; there is the mechanical losses in the transmission of power; a general increase in total resistance; and the hull also impedes and renders non-uniform the flow through the propeller.

2500|$|Even {{with these}} {{modifications}} in place, the Forssman could not fulfil the Idfliegs acceptance criteria, and Villehad Forssman severed his connections with Siemens-Schuckert {{owing to the}} failure of his design. With Siemens-Schuckert still eager to recoup its investment in the design, the firm assigned Harald Wolff to improve the aircraft. Wolff deleted the tacked-on pulpit from the nose and redesigned the forward fuselage to taper to a sharp point, surmounted by a teardrop-shaped cupola for the pilot. The redesign also replaced the two inner D.III engines with more powerful Mercedes D.IVa engines mounted on faired struts. [...] The outer engines remained unchanged, but were moved from their original position to mountings on faired struts midway in the interplane gap, to improve <b>propeller</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Gun positions were added in the nose and in dorsal and ventral locations in the fuselage, although all these positions remained faired-over during testing and {{there is no evidence that}} armament was ever fitted. In September 1915, and after another pilot had refused to fly the aircraft following some ground tests, Lt Walter Höndorf agreed to test the redesigned Forssman. After a one or two hops, the aircraft turned over on its nose while alighting. The nose was crushed, and the leading-edge spar in the upper wing was fractured.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the performance of}} several propellers on the YP- 47 M airplane at high blade loadings has been conducted in the Cleveland altitude wind tunnel {{at the request of the}} Air Materiel Command, Army Air Forces. As part of the program, a study was made of a Curtiss 836 - 14 C 2 - 18 R 1 four-blade propeller. The investigation was made for a range of power coefficients from 0. 10 to 1. 00 at free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 30, 0. 40, and 0. 50 for density altitudes from 10, 000 to 45, 000 feet, engine powers from 150 to 2500 brake horsepower, and for engine speeds from 1000 to 2900 rpm.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was made for}} the purpose of determining the characteristics of five full-scale propellers in flight. The equipment consisted of five propellers in conjunction with a VE- 7 airplane and a Wright E- 2 engine. The propellers were of the same diameter and aspect ratio. Four of them differed uniformly in thickness and pitch and the fifth propeller was identical with one of the other four with exception of a change of the airfoil section. The <b>propeller</b> <b>efficiencies</b> measured in flight are found to be consistently lower than those obtained in model tests. It is probable that this is mainly a result of the higher tip speeds used in the full-scale tests. The results show also that because of differences in propeller deflections it is difficult to obtain accurate comparisons of propeller characteristics. From this it is concluded that for accurate comparisons it is necessary to know the propeller pitch angles under actual operating conditions. (author) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{propeller}} {{passes through}} the fuselage wake, wing and other flight surface downwashes - moving asymmetrically through a disk of irregular airspeed. This reduces <b>propeller</b> <b>efficiency</b> and causes vibration inducing structural propeller fatigue and noise.|$|E
50|$|The <b>propeller</b> <b>efficiency</b> is {{increased}} by recovering {{energy from the}} tangential (rotational) flow from the leading propeller. Tangential flow does not contribute to thrust, conversion of tangential to axial flow increases both thrust and overall system efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Efficiency can {{be gained}} by {{mounting}} a propeller behind the fuselage, because it re-energizes the boundary layer developed on the body, and reduces the form drag by keeping the flow attached to the fuselage.

40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the ongoing 7 th Framework European Project DREAM, this article {{presents}} a synthesis of Cenaero, DLR, and Onera’s joint effort to demonstrate the aerodynamic and acoustic optimization potential of a contra-rotating open rotor. Within WP 3. 2 led by Snecma, the objective was to maximize the <b>propellers</b> <b>efficiency</b> at top-of-climb conditions and to minimize the noise emission at take-off focusing on interaction noise while fulfilling the thrust and torque split specifications at both operating points. These objectives were successfully met by the development and exploitation of efficient multi-objective three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) -based surrogate-assisted optimization strategies. In order to assess the aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of both baseline and optimized geometries, coupled unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation and farfield prediction based on an integral Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings approach were then carried out. The results demonstrate that although the acoustic criterion driving the optimization process did not lead to an improvement of the noise characteristics over the whole directivity range, it may be regarded as a cost-effective way to incorporate noiserelated aspects into the design intent...|$|R

50|$|These {{figures are}} {{somewhat}} suspect though, {{and are likely}} just optimistic guesses {{that could not have}} been met - something Heinkel was famous for. <b>Propellers</b> lose <b>efficiency</b> as they approach the speed of sound, and eventually they no longer provide an increase in thrust for an increase in engine power.

For the model experiment results available a PC program for database-based ship trial prognosis has been developed. In addition to the database-based method a novel statistical method for estimating the ships resistance has been developed.

Furthermore formulas for estimating the wake factor, the thrust deduction factor and the relative rotative efficiency for single and twin screw vessels are presented.

5000|$|Even {{before the}} start of World War II, {{engineers}} were beginning to realize that engines driving propellers were self-limiting in terms of the maximum performance which could be attained; the limit was due to issues related to <b>propeller</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which declined as blade tips approached the speed of sound.

50|$|Prop {{efficiency}} is usually at least 2-5 % less {{and in some}} cases more than 15% less than an equivalent tractor installation. Fullscale wind tunnel investigation of the canard Rutan VariEze showed a <b>propeller</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 0.75 compared to 0.85 for a tractor configuration - a loss of 12%. Pusher props are noisy, and cabin noise may be higher than tractor equivalent (Cessna XMC vs Cessna 152).Propeller noise may increase because the engine exhaust flows through the props. This effect may be particularly pronounced when using turboprop engines due to the large volume of exhaust they produce.|$|E
50|$|Propellers lose {{efficiency}} as {{aircraft speed}} increases, so turboprops are normally not used on high-speed aircraft above Mach 0.6-0.7. However, propfan engines, {{which are very}} similar to turboprop engines, can cruise at flight speeds approaching Mach 0.75. To increase <b>propeller</b> <b>efficiency,</b> a mechanism can be used to alter their pitch relative to the airspeed. A variable-pitch propeller, also called a controllable-pitch propeller, {{can also be used to}} generate negative thrust while decelerating on the runway. Additionally, in the event of an engine outage, the pitch can be adjusted to a vaning pitch (called feathering), thus minimizing the drag of the non-functioning propeller.|$|E
50|$|Turboprops have {{a fairly}} narrow sweet spot at speeds below about 450 mph. All <b>propellers</b> lose <b>efficiency</b> at high speed, due to an effect known as wave drag which occurs just below {{supersonic}} speeds.
