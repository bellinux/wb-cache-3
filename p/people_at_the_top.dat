500|$|The climatic {{scene where}} Olivia {{encounters}} Nick {{and the group}} of <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the building was shot at 902 Broadway in Manhattan. Though the actors appeared {{to be on the}} edge of a very tall building, there was in fact a hidden roof extending out that they would have fallen on instead. The visual and special effects departments worked in conjunction to simulate the woman jumping off the building. While the actress simply jumped onto a tarp several feet below her, the crew rigged the car with pneumatic rams, air cannons, and cables to implode under the [...] "weight" [...] of her body, and then CGI was used to make the woman appear to fall on the car.|$|E
500|$|Stefani was {{the first}} artist Oxley wrote a song for outside of Keane, and the singer remarked that [...] "he's like Clark Kent-subtle, but Superman-talented. I'm lucky I was his first, because I'm sure he's going to go write with lots of girls after me." [...] Oxley would later {{collaborate}} with artists like Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and in an interview he talked about working with her and Stefani, saying [...] "I've been very lucky to work with <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the industry. Both were very talented and more creative than I think they’re given credit for. They’re both very good writers and singers and they both work so hard, just grafting the whole time. Honing those pop sensibilities through writing with them was good fun".|$|E
500|$|... m. Drastic {{cuts were}} {{implemented}} in progressive taxation and public spending, including on welfare. Income and wealth were massively redistributed toward {{a small number}} of <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> at the price of impoverishment of a large number at the bottom. The unemployment had reached an all-time high of 20% by the end of 2003, just before the European Union membership came to the rescue. As a result of high unemployment, it took at least a decade for the average real pay to reach the level from before 1989 and joining the Union triggered the greatest peacetime wave of permanent economic migration out of the country. The reforms undertaken by the Polish elites were of an overwhelmingly economic character. Their socially detrimental consequences included the lasting political polarization over the practically limited range of choices: economic liberalism lacking any communal concerns on the one hand, and the conservative, patriarchal and parochial backwaters of Polish nationalism on the other.|$|E

500|$|The Masonic Temple was {{the most}} {{prominent}} of these skyscrapers. Built by the Freemasons of Chicago in 1892, {{at a time when the}} Masons was a fast-growing social community, the lavish [...] tall skyscraper had 19 stories, the bottom ten holding shops and the higher levels containing the Masons' private suites and meeting halls, some able to hold up to 1,300 <b>people.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> was a roof garden and observation gallery. The Freemasons were competing with their local rivals the Odd Fellows, who intended to build a much higher skyscraper, [...] tall, that they announced would be the tallest building in the world. Newspapers picked up the story, circulating facts about the size of the Temple and making comparison to historical buildings such as the Capitol or the Statue of Liberty. The Odd Fellows project failed, but the Masonic Temple capitalized on the publicity, being declared the [...] "tallest commercial building in the world".|$|E
500|$|Although {{some critics}} and historians view the {{language}} and examples employed by the Drapier to describe the possible economic harms as over the top, others consider that Swift's imagery was grounded in truth. Even Swift's satire of Wood's character is based on actual evidence and added very little to what Wood provided the public through his words and actions. Although the Drapier emphasises Wood's involvement and not the king's, glosses of the first letter reveal allusions to Wood bribing the Duchess of Kendal that obscure the distinction to the careful reader. However, the Drapier always respects the king {{as leader of the}} Irish nation and the Irish church, although some critics see his bold language and free use of the king's name and title as undermining those positions. The Drapier makes sure that Wood appears to be the primary target, which, when combined with only an indirect attack upon <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the British political system, reassured the people of Ireland that they could rebel against an [...] "insignificant hardware man".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, a dime honouring Canadian volunteers was issued. [...] It {{depicts a}} sun at the bottom, and {{the faces of}} three <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> To commemorate the {{international}} Year of the Volunteer, a total of 224,714,000 are minted for circulation.|$|E

30|$|In {{the age of}} consumerism, {{efforts at}} {{developing}} products and services have largely been focused on utilizing resources in addressing the wants and needs of <b>people</b> especially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> economic pyramid.

2500|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{about where the}} scope of employment rights really lie.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with China Central Television (CCTV) on 12 June 2005, Lee stressed {{the need to have}} a continuous renewal of talent in the country's leadership, saying:"In a different world we need to find a niche for ourselves, little corners where in spite of our small size we can perform a role which will be useful to the world. To do that, you will need <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did... My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation and so it goes on. The moment that breaks, it's gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, as <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> {{level of}} the party retire, {{there is room for}} younger members of the party to move up one level. [...] Hence the party {{congress}} is a time of a general personnel reshuffle, and the climax of negotiations that involve not only the top leadership but practically all significant political positions in Mainland China. [...] Notably, fifth-generation leadership hopefuls Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang will leave vacancies in the top leadership position of Shanghai and Liaoning. In addition, Hubei, Guangdong, Chongqing and possibly Tianjin will all go through regional leadership changes. Because of the pyramid structure of the party and the existence of mandatory retirement ages, cadres who are not promoted at a party congress are likely to face the end of their political careers. Current provincial level officials see the Congress as a chance for promotion to Beijing. The Congress will also be significant in determining the amount of influence still held by former General secretary Jiang Zemin, as reflected by the personnel changes.|$|E

5000|$|A {{third is}} that there is a [...] "persistent and {{disturbing}} reluctance of businesses to invest and consumers to spend", perhaps in part because so much of the recent gains have gone to the <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> and they tend to save more of their money than people—ordinary working people who can't afford to do that.|$|E

Wrapping styles also differ in whether the wrap extends, sling-like, beneath the fetlock joint. While the amount of support the sling affords the tendons and ligaments is debatable, it does provide {{a limited amount of}} protection to the joint from scrapes, bruises, and accidental overstep with the hind legs ("overreaching").|$|R

5000|$|Socialists {{believe that}} the concept of [...] "hard work" [...] is meant to delude the working class into {{becoming}} loyal servants to the elite, and that working hard, in itself, is not automatically an honorable thing, but only a means to creating more wealth for the <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the economic pyramid.

So you persuade yourself that, actually, government services, things like spending on education, which is what created that social mobility in the first place, need to be cut so that the deficit will shrink, so that your tax bill doesn't go up. And what I really worry about is, there is so much money and so much power <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very <b>top,</b> and <b>the</b> gap between those <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very <b>top</b> and everybody else is so great, {{that we are going to}} see social mobility choked off and society transformed.

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} {{theories about the}} meaning of the book’s title.

Michiko Kakutani, on the other hand, believes the book’s title refers to a song Tassie wrote which includes the lyric [...] "I’d climb up that staircase/past lions and bears,/but it’s locked/at the foot of the stairs." [...] However, there is also a gate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of the Brink house that takes on symbolic significance as Tassie first approaches the house. The gate is slightly off its hinges, and Tassie notes mentally [...] "it should have communicated itself as something else: someone’s ill-disguised decrepitude, items not cared for properly but fixed repeatedly in a make-do fashion, needful things having gotten away from their caregiver." ...|$|R
