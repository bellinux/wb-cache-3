40|$|Purpose Although {{previous}} {{studies have suggested that}} greater community densities <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> sales outlets are associated with greater alcohol use and problems, the mechanisms are unclear. The present study examined whether density was associated with increased <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> by adolescents younger than the legal <b>purchase</b> age <b>of</b> 18 in Australia. Methods The number <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> outlets per 10, 000 population was identified within geographic regions in Victoria, Australia. A state-representative student survey (N = 10, 143) identified adolescent reports <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and multilevel modeling was then used to predict the effects for different densities of outlet types (packaged, club, on-premise, general, and overall). Results Each extra sales outlet per 10, 000 population was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} risk <b>of</b> underage adolescent <b>purchasing.</b> The strongest effect was for club density (odds ratio = 1. 22) and packaged (takeaway) outlet density (odds ratio = 1. 12). Males, older children, smokers, and those with substance-using friends were more likely to purchase alcohol. Conclusions One mechanism by which alcohol sales outlet density may influence population rates <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use and related problems is through increasing the illegal underage <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> © 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine...|$|R

The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (UDABC) has regulated the sale of alcoholic beverages since 1935, two years after the end of Prohibition. Utah is one of 18 control states, meaning the state has a monopoly over the wholesaling and/or retailing of some or all categories of alcoholic beverages.|$|R

50|$|A {{few decades}} {{in the past the}} villagers mainly lived on {{agriculture}} only. The people who had many pieces of land were financially good, however {{the rest of the population}} was living at or below the poverty line. This poverty would often force the people to take short cuts for getting money which would lead them to criminal activities, like stealing, selling wine(Selling and <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> is illegal in Pakistan), robbery etc. However in the recent years many people from the village moved to nearby cities, some even to the distant business hubs of Pakistan Lahore and Karachi. Some even went abroad. Now Kalibair people are in U.A.E, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Malaysia. This changed the financial map of the village and people returned to jobs and businesses to get rid of the acute poverty they had been facing for years.|$|R
50|$|Most {{countries}} have prescribed a legal drinking age which prohibits the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> by minors. Most countries also prohibit {{the consumption of}} alcohol to minors. Some {{countries have}} a tiered structure that limits the sale of stronger alcoholic drinks to older adults (typically based upon the percentage of ABV) Other restrictions that some countries impose {{is based on the}} place in which alcohol is consumed, such as in the home, in a restaurant, or in a bar. The age at which these restrictions come to an end varies significantly from country to country, as does the degree to which it is enforced, which can also vary within a country.|$|E

5000|$|The Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The {{purpose of}} the Act was to empower police {{officers}} to confiscate alcohol from the possession of any minors {{under the age of}} 18. Previously only the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> was illegal by minors, and officers could take no action against a minor in possession of alcohol unless they were committing another offence. The Act was introduced to close this loophole and allow officers to seize alcohol in a minor's possession and create an offence for any person who fails to comply with a request to confiscate. The Act can also be applied to a person over 18 if the officer believes that the person intends to supply a minor with alcohol in their possession.|$|E

25|$|Whether an {{individual}} develops certain diseases or disorders is also established, {{to a certain}} degree, {{on the basis of}} nature and nurture. Genes often predispose individuals to certain disorders or diseases, while environmental factors can trigger the onset. Susceptibility of diabetes is determined by inherited differences in DNA, but environmental factors such as diet, weight, age, and physical activity seem to be triggering the onset of the disease. Genetic make-up, in addition to the environment with which the genes are exposed to, is influencing the behaviour of consumers with regard to the food choices they make. Addiction to substance abuse is partially determined by genes, which predispose individuals to have addictive personalities; however the stimuli with which an addiction develops is dependent on the environment. Addiction is persistent and compulsive, and has a significant impact upon consumer behaviour. Individuals who experience substance abuse, for example, are prone to basing their consumption primarily around the <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> even {{at the expense of other}} important aspects of well-being.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, {{there were}} still many abstainers in Finland who had moral {{objections}} to alcohol use, {{in contrast to the}} small minority of drinkers who accounted {{for more than half of}} total national consumption. In the late 1960s, a relaxation of the rules for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> had as its goal a lessening of drink's glamorous appeal because it was, in a sense, forbidden. This policy may have backfired when sales of beer in grocery stores and the availability of hard liquor at more restaurants caused alcohol consumption to more than double within a decade. Since the mid-1970s, however, analysts of Finnish alcohol use have seen consumption rates level off and drinking habits become more moderate. Although the number of abstainers had dropped sharply in the postwar period, causing some sociologists to refer to Finns who became adults in the 1950s and the 1960s as [...] "the wet generation," [...] alcohol was gradually coming to take a more ordinary place in everyday life.|$|E

40|$|The joint {{selection}} and <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> and tobacco in Spain is modeled using bivariate probit and endogenous switching regression analysis {{to account for}} the interaction between drinking and smoking. Different expenditure structures for tobacco and alcohol arise when one or both are consumed. Endogenous switching among structures exists because households are not randomly assigned. The results show that the correlation term of the selection equations and most correction terms for selfselectivity bias are statistically significant. The results also show that income and household demographic variables are important determinants of both {{selection and}} expenditures on tobacco and alcohol...|$|E

40|$|Behavioural {{economic}} {{models of}} substance choice describe {{the relationship between}} changes in unit price and consumption. As the majority of UK non-dependent substance misusers are polysubstance misusers, we investigated the influence of price upon hypothetical <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> amphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy. Forty-three current polysubstance misusers (25 males, 18 females; mean age 21. 3 ± 2. 8) were recruited into the study. As the price <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> rose, demand was inelastic. Amphetamine was a substitute for alcohol, cocaine was a compliment drug and ecstasy was independent. Demand for amphetamine was elastic as its price rose, but only alcohol {{was identified as a}} substitute drug and other drug <b>purchases</b> were independent <b>of</b> amphetamine price. As the price of cocaine increased, demand was elastic. Alcohol and ecstasy were substitute drugs but amphetamine purchase was independent, indicating asymmetrical substitution <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> and cocaine. Finally, demand for ecstasy was also elastic, but only cocaine substituted as ecstasy price rose. These results extend previous findings in substance dependent populations using behavioural economic models and support the opinion that purchasing substances is a complex process, involving both socio-economic and psychopharmacological factors. Whilst subjects expressed a preference for ecstasy, these behavioural findings indicated that alcohol was their drug of choice when economic considerations were brought into play. Self-reported drug preference, although facilitating between subjects experimental design, may therefore not accurately represent real world polysubstance misuse...|$|R
