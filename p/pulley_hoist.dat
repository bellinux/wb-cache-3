50|$|The {{introduction}} of the winch and <b>pulley</b> <b>hoist</b> soon lead to a widespread replacement of ramps as the main means of vertical motion. For the next 200 years, Greek building sites witnessed a sharp reduction in the weights handled, as the new lifting technique made the use of several smaller stones more practical than fewer larger ones. In contrast to the archaic period with its tendency to ever-increasing block sizes, Greek temples of the classical age like the Parthenon invariably featured stone blocks weighing less than 15-20 metric tons. Also, the practice of erecting large monolithic columns was practically abandoned in favour of using several column drums.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{reference to}} a winch {{can be found in}} the account of Herodotus of Halicarnassus on the Persian Wars (Histories 7.36), where he describes how wooden winches were used to tighten the cables for a pontoon bridge across the Hellespont in 480 B.C. Winches may have been employed even earlier in Assyria. By the 4th century BC, winch and <b>pulley</b> <b>hoists</b> were regarded by Aristotle as common for architectural use (Mech. 18; 853b10-13).|$|R

50|$|In many cultures, {{jewellery}} {{is used as}} {{a temporary}} body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin. Although this procedure is often carried out by tribal or semi-tribal groups, often acting under a trance during religious ceremonies, this practice has seeped into western culture. Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin. Most often, these hooks are used in conjunction with <b>pulleys</b> to <b>hoist</b> the recipient into the air. This practice is said to give an erotic feeling to the person and some couples have even performed their marriage ceremony whilst being suspended by hooks.|$|R
50|$|The Lab hosts four {{classes of}} Arlington County {{students}} a week, amounting to over 9,000 students a year. Activities vary by grade. Third graders will set up <b>pulley</b> mechanisms to <b>hoist</b> their classmates to study simple machines while seventh graders will collect specimens and test water {{quality in the}} Lab's streams. Fifth graders traditionally stay overnight at the lab in tents they erect themselves between hiking and lessons on ecology and biology utilizing local flora and fauna.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 Athey {{became a}} figure in a culture war, as {{conservative}} politicians fought to bar artwork with visible gay and feminist content from receiving public funding. Controversy regarding {{the nature of his}} work was part of a series of battles regarding work by especially gay artistsâ€”such as a lawsuit filed by the NEA Four (Karen Finley, Holly Hughes, Tim Miller and John Fleck), and legal battles around the exhibition of work of Robert Mapplethorpe, David Wojnarowicz, Andres Serrano and Joel-Peter Witkin. Excerpts from Four Scenes in a Harsh Life were staged at Patrick's Cabaret in Minneapolis on March 5, 1994, with support from the Walker Art Center. The Walker's Performing Arts Director, John Killacky remembers that [...] "the sold-out performance was well received by an audience of about one hundred. Post-show discussions with the artist, attended by 80 people, were thoughtful and engaging. Theatre and dance critics had been invited, none chose to attend." [...] During one scene in this performance, Athey made light cuts in co-performer Darryl Carlton's (stage name Divinity Fudge) back, placed strips of absorbent paper towel on the cuts and then, using a <b>pulley,</b> <b>hoisted</b> the blood-stained cloths into the air. Local art critic/reporter Mary Abbe (who had not witnessed the performance) wrote a news account of complaints concerning the performance; this story appeared {{on the front page of}} the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The report quoted the Walker's director Kathy Halbreich and performing arts director John Killacky, audience members, and Minnesota state health officials. The supervisor of the AIDS epidemiology unit in Minnesota's state health department said that [...] "it did not appear that audience members were endangered." [...] That story was picked up by the Associated Press and quickly made national headlines. The then-widespread anxiety about AIDS combined with a shocked reaction from those unfamiliar with S&M-related art: some critics and lawmakers, including Jesse Helms, falsely described his performances as exposing audience members to HIV-infected blood.|$|R
5000|$|A {{young woman}} tells {{a man that}} her parents keep her too close for them to meet. The man has his brother make a ladder and a <b>pulley</b> to <b>hoist</b> a basket (creel) down the chimney; the ladder takes him to the chimney, and riding in the large creel he is lowered into her bedroom. Her mother guesses there is {{a man in the}} daughter's bed and sends the father. She hides her lover and persuades her father she was praying. Her mother, still suspicious, goes herself. She trips and is caught ("keach" [...] being catch, [...] "keach i the creel" [...] being [...] "the catch in the basket" [...] - usually {{referring}} to fish caught and stored in a basket slung from the fisherman's hip or shoulder) in the creel and tossed all about in it; the father professes that he's fed up with all of them, for he's had no rest all the night with the goings-on.|$|R
50|$|The Regent was {{constructed}} using two cranes {{but after the}} main building had been constructed and the cranes had been removed, many items {{too big for the}} elevators had to be placed in all the residential units. The main contractors, Jacobsen Construction came up with a Push & <b>Pulley</b> system to <b>hoist</b> the items and material through the double doors on each balcony. It took the Jacobsen Construction team a total of six days to lay every concrete floor; the project itself consumed a total of 22,634 cubic yards of concrete. To lay the concrete they had to use specially designed forming systems.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the ergonomic hazards {{that are associated}} with scaffold building/erecting for one of the local construction companies and proposed recommendations for solution/control measures to mitigate those hazards. Ergonomic hazards were identified based on field observation and conversation with workers, superintendents/foremen, and managers. REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment) was used to estimate the risks of entire-body injuries and disorders. Building/erecting scaffolds requires lifting/carrying heavy and bulky materials, awkward postures (e. g., reaching and holding overhead, and kneeling on the scaffolds), and repetitive motions (e. g., hammering the cuplocks). Exposure to these hazards lead to a high risk of musculoskeletal injuries and disorders, especially to the back and shoulder, for scaffold builders. Discussion among the researcher and the pertinent personnel of the company was made during presentation of the research findings, so recommendations for control measures could be better communicated. The recommendations include, but are not limited to: installing scaffold <b>hoist</b> <b>pulley</b> system or other hoist assistance systems, training provided to all field personnel on ergonomics of scaffold building/erecting, proper work-rest scheduling, and workplace stretching program...|$|R
5000|$|The present mill was a corn {{mill and}} worked {{until the late}} 1960s. It has an {{overshot}} waterwheel of 10 ft diameter and 7 ft wide, made by Weeks of Maidstone. The axle is cast iron and 7+1/2 in square. The pit wheel is cast iron with 96 lignum vitae cogs. The cast iron upright shaft carries a cast iron wallower with 38 teeth and a cast iron Great Spur Wheel with 104 cogs. It powered three pairs of millstones. One pair are French Burr stones (by Hughes & Son of Dover and London) of 44 in diameter, one pair are Peak stones of 46 in diameter and the third pair have a Peak runner stone on a French Burr bedstone, both 42 in diameter. The Crown Wheel drove two layshafts, which powered various machines including a [...] "Ureka" [...] winnower and an oat crusher by Ganz & Co., of Budapest, Hungary. A saw bench outside the mill was also driven by belts & <b>pulleys.</b> The sack <b>hoist</b> is driven {{from the top of}} the upright shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Beside {{the open}} ground floor within the arches {{there are two}} more floors to the mill, the first, lower, or stone floor 15 ft above ground level, housing millstones, great spur wheel, hurst frame, sack hoist rope passing through the floor trap, and the upper, second, or hoist floor with brake wheel, main gearing (wallover), sack <b>hoist</b> <b>pulley,</b> {{and parts of the}} winding winch. The windshaft and the main parts of the winding system {{including}} the wind direction indicator is installed within the cap. The space inside the arches, until 1930, used to have a wooden structure to store the grain, and an open timber staircase to reach the milling floors. This structure was removed to prevent vandalism. The cap of the mill is a shallow dome which used to be covered with lead sheet, but also because of vandalism is now covered with aluminium. Between the cap and the top of the wall is a system of rollers running in a track plate allowing the cap to be rotated easily. There is a wind direction indicator on the roof which is continued into the interior, and a small repeat indicator at its lower end, so that the miller could set the mill without leaving his work. The lattice-type-sails are 60 ft span counter clock-wise rotation (seen from outside the mill; most of all windmills worldwide rotate clockwise seen from inside the mill - from [...] "under the wind") and with 450 sq ft of canvas. The arched tower covers a very small diameter of 22 ft and it has an unusual [...] "in cap" [...] winding gear for an English windmill, the cap being winded by a hand operated winch having spur and worm gears.|$|R
5000|$|Chegworth mill is {{probably}} not the Domesday mill recorded at Ulcombe. The first reference to Chegworth occurs in 1200. The first definite reference to this mill was in 1317, when the mill was held by John de Cheggeworth. John de Chageworth was recorded at the mill in 1324. The mill was in the ownership of Sir Cheney Culpeper in 1657. It was then known as the Lower Mill. The previous owners were Thomas Hatche and Richard Austen, who had recently sold the mill at that date. John Pecke was the miller. Seventeenth century millers in Ulcombe include Willia Pettit (1612), Percival Austen (1669), Thomas Sylliborne (1673) and John Baker (1682). It is not known which mill each was at, there being two watermills and a windmill in Ulcombe during this period. William Taylor was the miller in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1702, John Feverstone was the miller. The mill was known as Pendmill in 1745 when the miller was recorded as John Feverstour the Elder. John Feverstone the older was the miller in 1766, when the lease was renewed. Richard Tilbe being the owner at this time. Thomas Willett leased the mill in 1792 and in 1800 Chegworth Mill, otherwise Pendmill was mortgaged by Willett. The mill was recorded as Checqworth Mill on the 1801 Ordnance Survey map. John Taylor was the miller in 1847, followed by G Craddock in 1852, J Gilbert, William and Thomas Taylor in 1854, Mrs M Cradduck, J Gilbert and Thomas Taylor 1855 - 1861, Charles Wicks in 1874, Alfred Wick 1895 - 1907, Frederick James Potter 1930 - 1934. The last miller was Ted Uren, who started at the mill in 1961, and took over from Harold Potter. The mill was house converted c.1990.The present mill was a corn mill and worked until the late 1960s.
