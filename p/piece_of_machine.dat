40|$|Proof-Carrying Code (PCC) is {{a static}} {{mechanism}} that mechanically verifies safety of machine-language programs. But {{the problem in}} conventional PCC is, who will verify the verifier (the type checker) itself? The Foundational Proof-Carrying Code (FPCC) project at Princeton verifies the soundness of the type checker from the smallest possible set of axioms — logic plus machine semantics. One challenge in the verification is that machine code, unlike high-level languages, contains unstructured control flow (due to arbitrary jumps). A <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> code can contain multiple entry points that jump instructions might jump to, and multiple exit points. Traditional Hoare logic and its variants either verify programs with only one entry and one exit, or need the whole program to verify jump instructions, which is not modular. The major contribution of this dissertation is a program logic, Lc, which modularly verifies properties of machine-code fragments. Unlike previous program logics, the basic reasoning units in Lc are multiple-entry and multiple-exit code fragments. Lc provides composition rules to combine code fragments and to eliminate intermediat...|$|E

40|$|Decompilation, {{or reverse}} compilation, takes a {{computer}} program and produces high-level code that works like the original source code. This {{makes it easier to}} understand {{a computer program}} when source code is not available. However, there are very few tools for decompilation available today. This report describes the design and implementation of Desquirr, a decompilation plug-in for Interactive Disassembler Pro. Desquirr has an object-oriented design and performs basic decompilation of programs running on Intel x 86 processors. The low-level analysis uses knowledge about specialized compiler constructs, called idioms, to perform a more accurate decompilation. Desquirr implements data flow analysis, meaning the conversion from primitive machine code instructions into code in a high-level language. The major part of the data flow analysis is the Register Copy Propagation which builds high-level expressions from primitive instructions. Control flow analysis, meaning to restore high-level language constructs such as if/else and for loops, is not implemented. A high level representation of a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> code contains the same information as an assembly language representation of the same machine code, but in a format that is easier to comprehend. Symbols such as ?*? and ?+? are used in high-level language expressions, compared to instructions such as ?mul? and ?add? in assembly language. Two small test cases which compares decompiled code with assembly language shows promising results in reducing the amount of information needed to comprehend a program. Dekompilering, eller omvänd kompilering, tar ett datorprogram och omvandlar det till högnivåspråk som fungerar som den ursprungliga källkoden. Detta gör det lättare att förstå ett datorprogram när källkod inte finns tillgänglig. Det finns väldigt få verktyg för dekompilering tillgängliga idag. Den här rapporten beskriver design och implementation av Desquirr, en dekomplator-plugin för Interactive Disassembler Pro.

Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.|$|R

40|$|Many {{simulators}} employ computer-generated {{images as}} part of the training process, and the concept of a virtual environment is nothing new to industry. However, immersive and interactive Virtual Reality (VR) systems will provide new training paradigms for existing and new training applications to modern industry.

Presently, trainees acquire their operating skills by observing, referring the operation manual and then operating under the guidance of an experienced operator.

In this paper, we describe a VR-based Training System (VRTS) for CNC milling machine operations in which a trainee can acquire the set of skills necessary to perform basic milling operations. Based on the analysis of possible scenarios which may occur during the operations, two patterns of virtual training: 1) guide training and 2) self-learning training were designed & developed for two different training stages. Experimental results demonstrated that VR-based training is an efficient and cost-effective alternative to standard factory training...|$|R

50|$|The {{established}} jewelry {{houses of}} Paris in the period, Cartier, Chaumet, Georges Fouquet, Mauboussin, and Van Cleef & Arpels all created jewellry and {{objects in the}} new fashion. The firm of Chaumet made highly geometric cigarette boxes, cigarette lighters, pillboxes and notebooks, made of hard stones decorated with jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds and sapphires. They were joined by many young new designers, each with his own idea of deco. Raymond Templier designed pieces with highly intricate geometric patterns, including silver earrings that looked like skyscrapers. Gerard Sandoz was only 18 {{when he started to}} design jewelry in 1921; he designed many celebrated pieces based on the smooth and polished look of modern machinery. The glass designer René Lalique also entered the field, creating pendants of fruit, flowers, frogs, fairies of mermaids made of sculpted glass in bright colors, hanging on cords of silk with tassels. The jeweler Paul Brandt contrasted rectangular and triangular patterns, and embedded pearls in lines on onyx plaques. Jean Despres made necklaces of contrasting colors by bringing together silver and black lacquer, or gold with lapis lazuli. Many of his designs looked like highly polished <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>machines.</b> Jean Dunand was also inspired by modern machinery, combined with bright reds and blacks contrasting with polished metal.|$|R
