500|$|Today, 78 skins of {{the great}} auk remain, mostly in museum collections, along with {{approximately}} 75 eggs and 24 complete skeletons. All but four of the surviving skins are in summer plumage, and only two of these are immature. No hatchling specimens exist. Each egg and skin has been assigned a number by specialists. Although thousands of isolated bones were collected from nineteenth century Funk Island to Neolithic middens, only a few complete skeletons exist. Natural mummies also are known from Funk Island, and the eyes and internal organs {{of the last two}} birds from 1844 are stored in the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen. The whereabouts of the skins from the last two individuals has been unknown for more than a hundred years, however, that mystery has been partly resolved using DNA extracted from the organs of the last individuals and the skins of the candidate specimens suggested by Errol Fuller [...] (those in Übersee-Museum Bremen, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Zoological Museum of Kiel University, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, and Landesmuseum Natur und Mensch Oldenburg). A <b>positive</b> <b>match</b> was found between the organs from the male individual and the skin now in the RBINS in Brussels. No match was found between the female organs and a specimen from Fuller's list, but authors speculate that the skin in Cincinnati museum of Natural History and Science may be a potential candidate due to a common history with the L.A. specimen.|$|E

40|$|Determining the {{function}} of proteins {{is a problem with}} immense practical impact on the identification of inhibition targets and the causes of side effects. Unfortunately, experimental determination of protein function is expensive and time consuming. For this reason, algorithms for computational function prediction have been developed to focus and accelerate this effort. These algorithms are comparison techniques which identify matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs, representing known functional sites, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins (targets). Matches of statistically significant geometric and chemical similarity can identify targets with active sites cognate to the matching motif. Unfortunately, statistically significant matches can include false <b>positive</b> <b>matches</b> to functionally unrelated proteins. We target this problem by presenting Cavity Aware Match Augmentation (CAMA), a technique which uses C–spheres to represent active clefts which must remain vacant for ligand binding. CAMA rejects matches to targets without similar binding volumes. On 18 sample motifs, we observed that introducing C–spheres eliminated 80 % of false <b>positive</b> <b>matches</b> and maintained 87 % of true <b>positive</b> <b>matches</b> found with identical motifs lacking C–spheres. Analyzing a range of C–sphere positions and sizes, we observed that some high-impact C– spheres eliminate more false <b>positive</b> <b>matches</b> than others. High-impact C–spheres can be detected with a geometric analysis we call Cavity Scaling, permitting us to refine our initial cavity-aware motifs to contain only high-impact C–spheres. In the absence of expert knowledge, Cavity Scaling can guide the design of cavity-aware motifs to eliminate many false <b>positive</b> <b>matches...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Search for a {{tertiary}} substructure that geometrically {{matches the}} 3 D {{pattern of the}} binding site of a well-studied protein provides a solution to predict protein functions. In our previous work, a web server has been built to predict protein-ligand binding sites based on automatically extracted templates. However, a drawback of such templates is that the web server was prone to resulting in many false <b>positive</b> <b>matches.</b> In this study, we present a sequence-order constraint to reduce the false <b>positive</b> <b>matches</b> of using automatically extracted templates to predict protein-ligand binding sites. The binding site predictor comprises i) an automatically constructed template library and ii) a local structure alignment algorithm for querying the library. The sequence-order constraint is employed to identify the inconsistency between the local regions of the query protein and the templates. Experimental results reveal that the sequence-order constraint can largely reduce the false <b>positive</b> <b>matches</b> and is effective for template-based binding site prediction.

In January 2002, Ivins suggested that DNA sequencing should show differences in the genetics of anthrax mutations which would allow the source to be identified. Despite researchers advising the FBI that this may not be possible, Ivins tutored agents on how to recognise them. Considered cutting edge at the time, this technique is now commonplace. In February 2002, Ivins volunteered to provide samples from several variants of the Ames strain in order to compare their morphs. He submitted two test tube [...] "slants" [...] each from four samples of the Ames strain in his collection. Two of the slants were from flask RMR-1029. [...] Although the slants from flask RMR-1029 were later reported to be a <b>positive</b> <b>match,</b> all eight slants were reportedly in the wrong type of test tube and would therefore not be usable as evidence in court. On March 29, 2002, Ivins's boss instructed Ivins and others in Suites B3 and B4 on how to properly prepare slants for the FBI Repository. [...] The subpoena also included instructions on the proper way to prepare slants. When Ivins was told that his February samples did not meet FBIR requirements, he prepared eight new slants. [...] The two new slants prepared from flask RMR-1029 submitted in April by Ivins did not contain the mutations that were later determined to be in flask RMR-1029.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background High-throughput shotgun {{proteomics}} data {{contain a}} significant number of spectra from non-peptide ions or spectra of too poor quality to obtain highly confident peptide identifications. These spectra cannot be identified with any <b>positive</b> peptide <b>matches</b> in some database search programs or are identified with false positives in others. Removing these spectra can improve the database search results and lower computational expense. Results A new algorithm has been developed to filter tandem mass spectra of poor quality from shotgun proteomic experiments. The algorithm determines the noise level dynamically and independently for each spectrum in a tandem mass spectrometric data set. Spectra are filtered based on a minimum number of required signal peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2. The algorithm was tested with 23 sample data sets containing 62, 117 total spectra. Conclusions The spectral screening removed 89. 0 % of the tandem mass spectra that did not yield a peptide match when searched with the MassMatrix database search software. Only 6. 0 % of tandem mass spectra that yielded peptide matches considered to be true <b>positive</b> <b>matches</b> were lost after spectral screening. The algorithm was found to be very effective at removal of unidentified spectra in other database search programs including Mascot, OMSSA, and X!Tandem (75. 93 %- 91. 00 %) with a small loss (3. 59 %- 9. 40 %) of true <b>positive</b> <b>matches.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA novel {{method to}} {{stabilize}} the correlated color temperature in pcW-LEDs from their initial turn-on state to thermal equilibrium is proposed and demonstrated. Under the normal operation condition, it can stabilize the CCT of a pcW-LED by the <b>positive</b> <b>matching</b> of the blue LED peak wavelength to the phosphor excitation spectrum. When the operating temperature unavoidably becomes higher in the LED die quickly after the initial turn-on, the phosphor conversion efficiency degrades and the LED blue light performs red shift. With the <b>positive</b> <b>matching,</b> the red shift actually helps enhance the excitation efficiency of the phosphor to compensate the thermal quenching and efficiency degradation. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} blue light to the yellow light can keep almost constant, as well as the CCTs. In the experiments, the CCT variation could be as small as from 7 K to 83 K in different cases. Finally, we introduce a new factor, the so-called guide number, which is used to count the total change of the enhancement in equivalent excitation efficiency and the relative reduction of the phosphor light emission. The guide number essentially helps in designing the matching blue LED die and phosphor pair for good CCT stabilization...|$|R
