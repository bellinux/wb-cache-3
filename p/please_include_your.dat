40|$|Jet cross {{sections}} in deeply inelastic scattering {{in the case}} of transverse photon exchange for the production of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1) jets are calculated in next-to-leading order QCD (here the `+ 1 ' stands for the target remnant jet, which is included in the jet definition for reasons that will become clear in the main text). The jet definition scheme is based on a modified JADE cluster algorithm. The calculation of the (2 + 1) jet cross section is described in detail. Results for the virtual corrections {{as well as for the}} real initial- and final state corrections are given explicitly. Numerical results are stated for jet {{cross sections}} as well as for the ratio σ_ (2 + 1) jet/σ_ tot that can be expected at E 665 and HERA. Furthermore the scale ambiguity of the calculated jet cross sections is studied and different parton density parametrizations are compared. Comment: 40 pages, LBL- 34147 (Latex file).

40|$|Hector is a {{feasibility}} study on high-tech corpus lexicography. Oxford University Press provided the lexicographers and a corpus of 20 million words of running English text; Digital Equipment Corporation Systems Research Center provided the high tech tools {{to enable the}} lexicographers {{to do all of}} their work on-line. The tools provide the ability to query the corpus in various ways and see the resulting matches, to write and edit dictionary entries, and to link each occurrence of a word in the corpus with its sense as displayed in the entry editor. Additional support tools give statistical information about words in the corpus, derivatives and related words, syntactic structures, collocates, and case-variants. This report describes the tools and the status of the project as of July, 1992. An accompanying videotape demonstrates the Hector tools.

Smoking, diet, genetic susceptibility and immunosuppression (due to HIV infection or drug use) are risk factors for acquisition of both HPV infection and the progression to cancer. Testing for HPV DNA can now be performed on specimens collected by cervicovaginal lavage or in the newer liquid-based Pap tests. HPV testing is now advised for women with mildly abnormal or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) Pap test results and of low-risk post-menopausal women with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) results. As of this printing, however, the FDA has not approved HPV testing as a routine screening tool. Vaccines are under development that would protect from infection by the oncogenic strains of HPV, especially type 16, which accounts for about one half of cervical cancer cases in the U. S, and to boost the immune systems of those already infected. None of these vaccines is yet licensed...|$|E
