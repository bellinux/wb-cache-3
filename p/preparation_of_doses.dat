40|$|Project {{investigates the}} design {{requirements}} of a computer based drug dosing system suitable for use by general physicians. One area of medicine in which knowledge-based systems may improve day to day patient care is {{in the design of}} initial dosing regimens and dosage adjustment of certain drugs whose plasma levels correlate with their toxicity and/or efficacy. Since the general clinician is responsible for the appropriate administration of many of these drugs, a way must be found to enable these clinicians to rapidly detrmine the appropriate dose or dosage adjustment required to achieve the desired plasma concentration and thus the desired clinical effect. To obtain the best results, a good knowledge of pharrnacokinetic principles is required as well as the facility to apply these principles easily and safely. In this study, the intention was to construct a knowledge-based system for the design of drug dosing regimens and to investigate issues relating to the design of such a system which will affect its' utility in general medicine. A multidisciplinary approach to the problem was adopted. A combination of standard pharmacokinetic modelling and artificial intelligence techniques was used to design a system suitable for use by the general physician. The approach was informed by ethnography with the design incorporating features seen as desirable by prospective users and a knowledge base with facts and rules related to the safe and effective use of the system. In addition, a more general method of pharmacokinetic parameter estimation than that employed in most current pharmacokinetic systems was investigated. In the clinical environment, {{there are a number of}} sources of error which may invalidate pharmacokinetic calculations. The most important of these being those associated with the incorrect <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> and the recording of incorrect times of dosing and specimen collection. It was observed that current pharmacokinetic systems do not address these sources of error directly. A more general Bayesian approach which might be extended to incorporate these 'external' errors would be appropriate. The method investigated in the report is a Bayesian formulation of the Kalman filter. It was applied to the one and two compartment linear models and to the one compartment nonlinear model. These models being sufficient to cover the majority of drugs of interest in the general hospital setting. Kalman filtering is a general method for handling state-space models which gives optimal estimates of the current state of a dynamic system. It is commonly encountered in the field of control engineering but is also used in the analysis of time series. The method was shown to be adaptable in principle to pharmacokinetic parameter estimation and it is theoretically extendable to incorporate the external sources of error described above. The positive initial results presented in the report form the basis for ongoing research into the possible extension of the system and a formal assessment of user acceptance...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: (1) To {{compare the}} rate of {{contamination}} of syringes prepared under laminar flow conditions in pharmacy with those prepared by nurses in the emergency department; (2) {{to determine whether the}} time elapsed since <b>preparation</b> or number <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> given affected the contamination rate; (3) to determine whether any adverse effects resulted from bacterially contaminated drugs. METHODS: Prospective, blinded trial exploring the effect <b>of</b> method <b>of</b> <b>preparation,</b> time since <b>preparation,</b> and number <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> given on contamination rates and infective adverse events associated with bacterially contaminated specimens.

40|$|International audienceRhenium- 188 (188 Re) is of {{widespread}} interest for treating various diseases {{because of its}} attractive physical and chemical properties. The routine <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> therapeutic <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 188 Re-labelled tracers can result in significant radiation exposure to the operator. We studied the impact <b>of</b> automating the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> 188 Re-Lipiodol on the radiochemist's exposure, {{as well as the}} importance of the model of syringe shielding. To monitor radiation exposure continuously readable electronic personal dosimeters were used. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were fixed to the probable most exposed fingers of the radiochemist during <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> the radiotracer and during the syringing. Dose rates were measured using a Babyline. Automation of the synthesis reduced personal dose equivalents from 2. 60 ± 4. 35 to 1. 61 ± 1. 20 µSv/GBq [Hp(10) ] and from 38. 37 ± 55. 28 to 21. 84 ± 16. 14 µSv/GBq [Hp(0. 07) ].

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study {{has been on the}} ability of crushed seed {{suspensions}} of the pan-tropical tree Moringa oleifera Lam. to clarify turbid waters. Information regarding the coagulant effect of the seeds was first published in 1979. Since then {{a number of studies have}} been carried out to establish the effectiveness and nature of the coagulant effect. These are reviewed. The coagulation effect has been attributed to water soluble, low molecular weight cationic proteins contained within the seed kernel. The mode of activity has been proposed to be charge neutralisation via the patch mechanism. In an attempt to further the understanding of coagulation behaviour, four water sources in Malawi and Zimbabwe have been examined. A modified theory of protein coagulation that involves a combined charge neutralisation and protein precipitation mechanism is presented. Further work required to fully determine the mechanism of activity is discussed.;In order to establish whether seed solutions could be considered for use within continuous flow water treatment systems a pilot plant was designed and constructed in Malawi. Details of the design are presented. Studies undertaken over a three-year period demonstrated that, as a coagulant, seed solutions were effective. Subsequent to these trials, an evaluation of the efficacy of using seed solutions on an operational treatment works was undertaken. Factors that might be potential constraints to utilisation at this scale, for example seed processing and dosing solution preparation, were investigated. Although effective as a coagulant, it has been concluded that the use of powdered seed suspensions is not a viable option for large-scale applications. Amongst those constraints identified, problems with the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dosing</b> solutions, the potential for increasing Total Organic Carbon levels in treated water and regulatory issues are considered...|$|R

We aimed to assess the effectiveness <b>of</b> different <b>preparations</b> and <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> NSAIDs on osteoarthritis pain in a network meta-analysis. METHODS For this network meta-analysis, we considered randomised trials comparing {{any of the following}} interventions: NSAIDs, paracetamol, or placebo, for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the reference lists of relevant articles for trials published between Jan 1, 1980, and Feb 24, 2015, with at least 100 patients per group. The prespecified primary and secondary outcomes were pain and physical function, and were extracted in duplicate for up to seven timepoints after the start of treatment. We used an extension of multivariable Bayesian random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons with a random effect at the level of trials. For the primary analysis, a random walk of first order was used to account for multiple follow-up outcome data within a trial. Preparations that used different total daily dose were considered separately in the analysis. To assess a potential dose-response relation, we used preparation-specific covariates assuming linearity on log relative dose.

We {{report on a}} phase I dose-escalation trial using clinical-grade manufactured mature RNA-electroporated DC in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. METHODS: CD 14 (+) cells were isolated from leukapheresis products by immunomagnetic CliniMACS separation and differentiated into mature DC (mDC). mDC were electroporated with clinical-grade mRNA encoding the Wilm's tumor (WT 1) antigen, and tested for viability, phenotype, sterility and recovery. To test product safety, increasing <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> DC were administered intradermally four times at 2 -week intervals in 10 AML patients. RESULTS: In a pre-clinical phase, immunomagnetic monocyte isolation proved superior over plastic adherence in terms of DC purity and lymphocyte contamination. We also validated a simplified DC maturation protocol yielding a consistent phenotype, migration and allogeneic T-cell stimulatory capacity in AML patients in remission. In the clinical trial, highly purified CD 14 (+) cells (94. 5 +/- 3. 4 %) were obtained from all patients. A monocyte-to-mDC conversion factor of 25 +/- 10 % was reached. All DC preparations exhibited high expression of mDC markers. Despite a decreased cell recovery of mDC after a combination of mRNA electroporation and cryopreservation, successful vaccine preparations were obtained in all AML patients. DC injections were well tolerated by all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our method yields a standardized, simplified and reproducible <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> clinical-grade mRNA-transfected DC vaccines from a single apheresis with consistent mature phenotype, recovery, sterility and viability.

This will result in increased potential for human and environmental exposure to MNs during manufacturing, use, and disposal of nanoenabled products. Scientifically based risk assessment for MNs necessitates the development of reproducible, standardized hazard testing methods such as those provided by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Currently, there is no comprehensive guidance {{on how best to}} address testing issues specific to MN particulate, fibrous, or colloidal properties.

Characteristics of albumin metabolism—pool sizes, catabolic rate, etc—were in agreement with currently accepted normal values. It is concluded that this <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> iodinated albumin is suitable for metabolic use...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{side effects}} <b>of</b> estrogen-progestin {{combination}} <b>preparations,</b> the <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> estrogen has continuously been reduced in the pill. As an alternative, estrogen-free preparations are increasingly used {{and are now}} available as oral, subdermal, intrauterine and intramuscular applications. The benefits of estrogen-free contraceptives are the prevention of estrogen-related side effects (nausea, edema, weight gain, mastodynia) and of cycle-dependent side effects (dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, premenstrual syndrome [PMS], hypermenorrhea, menstrual migraine). Furthermore, {{they can be used}} in women with risk factors, in whom estrogens are contraindicated. These include hypertension, thrombophilia, status post thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, liver tumors, cholelithiasis and during lactation. In the following sections, the available preparations are being discussed. J Reproduktionsmed Endokrinol 2010; 7 (Special Issue 1) : 97 – 105.

30|$|Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fasted 24 h {{prior to}} the time of scan. On the day of the study, rats were anesthetized using 4.0 % isoflurane. The rat was then {{positioned}} on the scanner bed by placing it on a warm water circulating heating pad, and anesthesia was applied using a nose cone. A transmission scan was subsequently acquired. The <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dose</b> injection was as follows: 0.7 - 1.0 mCi of 18 F-nifene was drawn into a 1 -mL syringe with a 25 -gauge needle and was diluted with sterile saline to a final volume of 0.3 mL. The dose was injected intravenously into the tail vein of the rat. Isoflurane was reduced and maintained at 2.5 % following the injection. The scans were carried out for 90 min and were acquired by the Inveon microPET in full list mode. The list mode data were collected dynamically which were rebinned using a Fourier rebinning algorithm. The images were reconstructed using a two-dimensional Filter Back Projection using a Hanning Filter with a Nyquist cutoff at 0.5, and were corrected for attenuation using the Co- 57 attenuation scan data. A calibration was conducted to Becquerel per cubic centimeter units using a germanium- 68 phantom which was scanned in the Inveon microPET and was reconstructed under the same parameters as the subjects. Analyses of all data were carried out using the Acquisition Sinogram Image Processing IDL's virtual machine (ASIPRO VM) and Pixelwise Modeling software (PMOD 3.0). The test and retest microPET studies on the same animal were carried out within an interval of approximately 2 weeks.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} type C 1 botulinum toxin (BoTx) on neuromuscular {{junctions}} was investigated using tibial nerve-soleus muscle <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> rats. Sublethal <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> purified type C 1 BoTx were injected subcutaneously into the postero-lateral {{region of the}} right lower hind limb. At 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days after the injection, the preparation was excised and analyzed in vitro for blockade of neuromuscular transmission. Analysis of alterations in miniature end-plate potentials (m. e. p. p. s) and end-plate potentials (e. p. p. s) was also carried out using a <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> 0. 25 mouse intraperitoneal LD 50 at 1 day after injection, to avoid the complication of denervation-like effects. The following results were obtained. 1. A dose-dependent blockade of neuromuscular transmission was induced by type C 1 BoTx. The recovery from the blockade also showed a dose-dependency. 2. The mean quantal content, the amplitude of e. p. p. s, and the amplitude and frequency of fast m. e. p. p. s in BoTx-poisoned preparations were significantly lower than those in unpoisoned controls. In addition, failure of e. p. p. s was frequently observed in BoTx-poisoned preparations. 3. Type C 1 BoTx {{did not affect the}} shape of the amplitude histogram for fast m. e. p. p. s. 4. There {{were no significant differences between}} the amplitude and frequency of slow m. e. p. p. s in BoTx-poisoned and unpoisoned preparations. 5. The acetylcholine sensitivity of postsynaptic membrane and the magnitude of resting membrane potential of muscle fibers were uninfluenced by type C 1 BoTx. From these results, we concluded that the blockade of neuromuscular transmission induced by type C 1 BoTx was attributable to the inhibition of Ca++-sensitive quantal release from the motor nerve terminals...|$|R
