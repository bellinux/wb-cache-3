50|$|A single {{spun yarn}} may be crochet as is, or braided or <b>plied</b> with another. In <b>plying,</b> {{two or more}} yarns are spun together, almost always in the {{opposite}} sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually <b>plied</b> with an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. <b>Plied</b> yarns may themselves be <b>plied</b> together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. Sometimes, the yarns being <b>plied</b> are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. The single yarns may be dyed separately before <b>plying,</b> or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|R

Returning to the Norwood reserves team, Harley helped the team reach their second successive Grand Final appearance against the Port Magpies and capture the reserves premiership.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study was undertaken {{to investigate the}} mechanical response of four hybrid titanium composite laminate (HTCL) systems, each prepared using a graphite fiber reinforced thermoplastic polyimide as the adhesive in a unidirectional prepreg.

Each HTCL system consisted of either three <b>plies</b> or four <b>plies</b> of the titanium alloy. Systems with only three <b>plies</b> of titanium had <b>plies</b> measuring 10 mils thick, whereas systems consisting of four <b>plies</b> of titanium had <b>plies</b> measuring 5 mils thick.

5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to <b>ply</b> the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner <b>ply</b> of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean {{initially}} provided England's {{most important}} and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits. Colonies in St Lucia(1605) and Grenada(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts(1624), Barbados(1627) and Nevis(1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships {{would be able to}} <b>ply</b> their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas {{at the expense of the}} Dutch. In 1655, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas.|$|E
