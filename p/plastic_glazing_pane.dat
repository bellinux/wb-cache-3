40|$|Regarding {{the thermal}} {{resistance}} of the external envelop of buildings, windows are the weakest places. This {{is especially true for}} historic windows with original single <b>pane</b> <b>glazing</b> in historic buildings. To reduce the energy consumption and to improve thermal comfort of historic buildings, replacing these windows by modern double glazed windows would be a logical choice. The authentic character of these buildings, however, would be affected too much. Therefore, special effort has to be given to this kind of windows. There are a number of ways to improve the thermal performance of these windows. One approach is to add a single <b>glazing</b> <b>pane</b> from the inside or outside to the existing single <b>pane</b> <b>glazing,</b> making use of a (ventilated) cavity. Apart from that, special glazing has been developed, e. g. vacuum glazing, to replace the single <b>glazing</b> <b>pane,</b> with a vacuum glazing with comparable thickness. To predict the thermal performance of these windows, a multi-physical simulation approach is necessary. The paper will deal with the modeling approach of these types of glazing. The typical total thermal transmittance of these windows will be calculated, making use of the three-dimensional thermal bridge coupling effects on the thermal performance of the <b>glazing</b> <b>panes.</b> COMSOL will be used to solve the multi-physical coupling of the differential equations for Heat, Air and Moisture (HAM). The results of the three-dimensional simulations are compared with relatively simple 1 -dimensional calculations by hand and measurements in a so-called hot-box measurement laboratory device and also with in-situ measurements. Generally, good results are obtained by numerical simulation, compared to measurement results. For a number of glazing types, 1 -dimensional calculations by hand give a good impression of the thermal performance of rather complex glazing configurations. Surface temperatures of the <b>glazing</b> <b>panes,</b> risks on condensation and energy losses can be estimated with a reasonable accuracy. If the boundary conditions are more complex and if ventilation of air in the cavity is introduced, calculations by hand are not sufficient or possible anymore and more complex computer simulations are necessary...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of large glazed surfaces {{in office and}} residential buildings demands the integration of shading devices {{in the design of}} the facade in order to reduce overheating and high cooling loads during warm periods. However, the physical phenomena occurring at the facade, between the external layer of louvers, the <b>glazing</b> <b>pane(s)</b> and the interior space are very complex and depend on numerous factors. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of solar radiation on the airflow and heat transfer on a glazing facade with exterior louvers.

40|$|Being {{responsible}} for {{a significant proportion of}} total heat loss in façade dominated buildings, the design and specification of the envelope, particularly the building’s glazing system, is a key factor in determining overall energy consumption. To address this, an innovative double glazed façade system comprising parallel transparent/translucent plastic slats sandwiched between the glass panes to form a Parallel Slat Transparent Insulation Material (PS-TIM) system is proposed as a potential solution. This PS-TIM system reduces heat transfer between the <b>glazing</b> <b>panes</b> whilst maintaining access to solar radiation and daylight. The presence of the PS-TIM structure significantly affects the thermal and optical performance of the window system in which it is employed. This presents a further significant challenge when trying to predict its performance using dynamic building simulation approaches. Using a typical small office as a case study subject to varying climatic conditions, we investigate the thermal and optical behaviour of a range of PS-TIMs with respect to their daylight and energy performance. We find that when compared to a conventional double glazed system, the application of PS-TIMs can result in a more visually comfortable and uniformly lit environment, which might be desired in an office space, and, in the specific case of the small office under test, can result in a reduction in energy consumption of up to 35. 8...|$|R
40|$|Windows are {{designed}} primarily {{to control the}} indoor climate and also to provide proper ventilation (air circulation). The primary objective is achieved by controlling the heat flow through the window from inside to outside in winter & from outside to inside in summer. Window solar gain has a strong influence on the building energy consumption and peak cooling load. Double glazed window are known to prevent the entry of solar gain to inside the room. Shading systems such as Venetian blinds, louver shades, draperies etc. enhances the control of solar gain through windows. In this paper the thermal performance of a double-glazed window with adjacent commercially available blinds has been studied using LBNL research software WINDOWS 6. 3 and the results so obtained are validated using a Guarded Heat Plate Apparatus.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Plastics</b> <b>glazing</b> materials have properties which allow their widespread use in construction, for example as rootlights. However, they are more susceptible than is glass to degradation by weathering, notably the combined effects of ultraviolet light, heat and moisture. Examples of unacceptable durability have been seen in practice, particularly when high operating temperatures occur in sunlight. Artificial weathering tests are used to assess <b>plastics</b> <b>glazing</b> materials in a reasonably short time, two main types being utilised in this study. The applicability of ultra-fast methods of accelerated degradation {{has been shown to}} depend {{on the extent to which}} the mechanisms of degradation simulate practical weathering, since different procedures were found to promote different mechanisms in the materials tested. Misleading information was obtained when the full spectrum of solar UV and much of the visible was not adequately reproduced in the accelerated tests. In particular an established grade of PVC-U performed unexpectedly poorly under fluorescent lamps. Procedures based on xenon arc sources were found to be the most generally applicable because they better reproduce the full solar spectrum range and, hence, the typical effects observed in plastics materials in practice. Several analytical techniques were used to characterise the virgin polymers and to assess the weathered materials. Two commercial grades of each polymer type (poly[vinylchloride], polycarbonate and poly[methylmethacrylate]) were studied, and measured changes explained in terms of initial polymer properties. Profiling of chemical (e. g. carbonyl index measured by photo-acoustic fourier transform infrared), physical (e. g. molecular weight, surface gloss/roughness), optical (e. g. colour, light transmission) and mechanical properties (e. g. impact resistance) as a function of exposure period and environmental conditions enabled degradation rates and mechanisms to be established for each material. In conducting these tests particular attention was given to the control and effects of sample temperature during weathering, and to the wavelength range of the light source used. Poly(vinylchloride) was affected much more by weathering at higher temperatures, and by exposure to short wavelength radiation, than was polycarbonate, with acrylic being the most durable overall. Practical applications of this work are through Standards committees primarily. in particular with plastics rootlights (B/ 542 / 8 and CEN/TCI 28 /SC 9) ...|$|R
