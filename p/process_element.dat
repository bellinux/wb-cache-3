In exploring the currently overlooked ontology-related interactions between the analysis and design phases of software development for MAS, iterative verification during the design and development of the system becomes also possible. A validation approach to complement this ontology-based view was recently developed in [20] to precisely use ontologies during the creation of the MAS requirement models. With respect to improving the process of creating intermediate software work products, using an ontology-based development methodology is impossible without the appropriate <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> that can harness domain knowledge within ontologies. In other words, the presence of problem solving methods is couple with partial usage of any ontology for any single agent.

That is why the next section focuses on identifying the <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> required to create an ontology-driven methodology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Petri nets are a {{suitable}} language for modeling business processes with complex flow structures. Processes {{with a number}} of alternative, concurrent or sequential flow structures on the same process abstraction level may result in complex processes. Such complex and poorly unstructured processes are particularly difficult for users to understand. Process decomposition can significantly improve the comprehensibility and consistency of process models and enables faster reuse of process models. To maintain homogenous process decomposition demands a significant amount of modeling experience. In this paper, we will present our approach for (semi-) automatic detection of nonuniformly specified <b>process</b> <b>element</b> names on the same process decomposition level. Our detection system validates <b>process</b> <b>element</b> names regarding reasonable hierarchical specifications.

40|$|Abstract. Large process models may {{comprise}} {{hundreds or}} thousands of <b>process</b> <b>elements,</b> like activities, gateways, and data objects. Present-ing such process models to users and enabling them to interact with these models constitute crucial tasks of any process-aware information systems (PAISs). Existing PAISs, however, neither provide adequate techniques for visualizing and abstracting process models nor for interacting with them. In particular, PAISs do not provide tailored process visualizations as needed in complex application environments. This paper presents ex-amples of large process models and discusses some of the challenges to be tackled when visualizing and abstracting respective models. Further, it presents a comprehensive framework that allows for personalized process model visualizations, which can be tailored to the specific needs of the different user groups. First, process model complexity can be reduced by abstracting the models, i. e., by eliminating or aggregating <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> not relevant in the given visualization context. Second, the appearance of <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> can be customized independent of the process modeling language used. Third, different visualization formats (e. g., process diagrams, process forms, and process trees) are supported. Finally, it will be discussed how tailored visualizations of process models may serve as basis for changing and evolving process models at a high level of abstraction. ...|$|R

However, in order for this potential to be realized, models must be valid for the application and must provide results that are credible and reliable. The process of ensuring validity, credibility, and reliability typically consists of three elements- verification, validation and calibration. In current traffic engineering practice, there appears to be little uniformity in the definition of each of these three process elements. It also appears that there exists a lack of consensus among both model developers and model users regarding the actions required to carry out each <b>process</b> <b>element</b> and the division of responsibilities between the two groups. This paper attempts to provide traffic model developers and users with a framework for the verification, validation and calibration of traffic models.
