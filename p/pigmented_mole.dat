40|$|Background: Ultraviolet {{radiation}} (UVR) {{exposure is}} associated with excessive <b>pigmented</b> <b>mole</b> formation in childhood and subsequent melanoma risk. School children receive most of their UVR at school. Body-sites protected by clothing develop fewer moles. School uniforms provide children with a physical barrier to UVR exposure, reducing subsequent melanoma risk. We evaluated the body surface area (BSA) covered by Queensland primary school regulation uniforms to determine if coverage varied by region, gender or school ownership. Method: Publicly available uniform images and guidelines were sought for all primary and combined schools in 10 Queensland regions in a cross-sectional study conducted 2009 - 2014. BSA of the regulation summer uniform (each gender) was determined for each body-site, excluding the head using an established method. Results: 672 schools [482 (71. 7...|$|E
40|$|Cells of {{a benign}} <b>pigmented</b> <b>mole</b> and a {{malignant}} melanoma {{were used to}} compare electron microscopy (EM) and light microscopy (LM) with high-resolution TV-scanning and multivariate analysis methods. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} different kinds of chromatin texture features and their discriminating power. Comparative studies on EM and LM are useful to look for the reliability of light microscopic features for the recognition of malignant melanoma cells. Identical cells of benign pigmented moles and malignant melanomas could be scanned by both EM and LM techniques. As a result, there is a significant correlation between EM and LM texture features, derived from the co-occurrence matrix and the difference statistics histogram. This helps to demonstrate that classification in LM is sufficiently good using texture features only...|$|E
40|$|Childhood sun {{exposure}} {{is linked to}} excessive <b>pigmented</b> <b>mole</b> development and melanoma risk. Clothing provides a physical barrier, protecting skin from ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Extending sleeves to elbow length and shorts to knee length {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce mole acquisition in preschoolers from tropical Queensland. We used publicly available uniform images and guidelines from primary schools in Townsville (latitude 19. 25 °S, n = 43 schools), Cairns (16. 87 °S, n = 46) and the Atherton Tablelands (17. 26 °S, n = 23) in tropical Australia to objectively determine the body surface proportion covered by regulation school uniforms. Uniforms of nongovernment, large (≥ 800 students), urban, educationally advantaged schools with comprehensive sun protection policies covered more skin than those of government schools (63. 2 % vs 62. 0 %; P < 0. 001), smaller schools (63. 4 % vs 62. 3 %; P = 0. 009), rural (62. 7 % vs 61. 9 %; P = 0. 002) and educationally disadvantaged schools (62. 8 % vs 62. 3 %; P < 0. 001) with underdeveloped sun protection policies (62. 8 % vs 62. 2 %; P = 0. 002). Overall, SunSmart and non-SunSmart school uniforms covered identical body surface proportions (62. 4 %, P = 0. 084). Although wearing regulation school uniforms is mandatory at most Australian primary schools, this opportunity to improve children's sun protection is largely overlooked. Recent evidence suggests that even encouraging minor alterations to school uniforms (e. g. slightly longer sleeves/dresses/skirts/shorts) to increase skin coverage may reduce mole acquisition and melanoma risk, especially in high-risk populations...|$|E

40|$|Sunlight is a known skin carcinogen. Skin {{cancer is}} {{the most common form of}} cancer in humans,and {{typically}} affects sun-exposed parts of the body. Sunny Australia and New Zealand have the highest incidence of skin cancer globally. Clothing provides a protective barrier that reduces the amount of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the skin. Australia pioneered the development of a relative ranking of the sun-protective capabilities of clothing based on the transmission of UVR through fabric. Standardized Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) measurement procedures and associated labeling specifications are documented in the Australian and New Zealand Standard,AS/NZS 4399 : 1996. The standard was intended to enable consumers to make informed choices. Since its introduction, this standard has been adopted almost universally by the textile industry, and is still in use almost two decades on, with plans to revise it only commencing recently. However, AS/NZS 4399 : 1996 does not consider garment design, particularly in relation to body surface coverage. Although swim-shirts have grown in popularity in Australia since the late 1990 s, particularly among children, clothing remains under-utilized as a form of sun-protection in contemporary society. Skin cancer prevention campaigns should emphasize the sun-protective benefits of clothing and collaboration with the fashion industry is urgently needed to improve the aesthetic appeal, comfort, durability and affordability of sun-protective clothing to increase its popularity in skin cancer prone populations. In light of recent evidence showing that high UPF clothing which covers more of the body surface reduces <b>pigmented</b> <b>mole</b> development in children (major risk factor for melanoma), the rating system for sun-protective clothing should incorporate body surface covered as well as the UPF of the fabric. We discuss progress towards developing a protocol for measuring the extent of coverage of sun-protective garments. Once fully evaluated and refined, the testing protocol developed from this research may influence future revisions of international standards for evaluating and classifying sun-protective clothing...|$|E
40|$|While the {{clinical}} syndrome of melanoma was described {{during the nineteenth}} century, the pathology, aetiology and classification of the tumour remained controversial well into the twentieth. For instance, {{the debate about the}} type of tumour, its aetiology, classification and the relationship between <b>pigmented</b> <b>moles</b> and melanoma were common. This debate was widely regarded as settled by the 1960 s, and we are now accustomed to think of melanoma as a single pathological and aetiological entity, with a number of possible clinical manifestations. A number of systems of classification are in common use. We may classify by site. So melanoma may occur on the skin (cutaneous), on the palms, soles and under the nails (acral) or on mucosal surfaces (mucosal). We may classify by tumour morphology – so tumours may be superficial spreading or nodular. Or we may classify by combinations of site and morphology. There are problems for these unificatory classifications, however. For instance, certain types of tumour (acral in particular) have widely varying incidence by race. A more significant challenge arises from recent research findings, especially the discovery that various genetic mutations (notably c-KIT and BRAF) seem to correlate with particular sub-types of melanoma. Their aetiological role i...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent molecules, {{hereafter}} {{referred to}} as fluorophores, can be excited by illumination with light and subsequently can de-excite into the ground state through, amongst others possibilities, emission of fluorescence. In case the fluorophore is selectively {{taken up by the}} cancer and not by surrounding normal tissues the fluorescence may thus be used for the detection and localization of cancers. The research described in this thesis focuses on the development of methods and technology for real-time in vivo fluorescence imaging for cancer detection and image-guided surgical tumor resection. Subsequently, the introduced methods and technology are evaluated through modelling studies and validated with pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials in patients. After a general introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 describes the development of a fluorescence imaging device for the detection of superficial cancer based on the Double Ratio technique. In practical use this device resembles an operation microscope and {{can be used in a}} clinical environment. This device acquires 4 different fluorescence images excited at two wavelengths each detected at two wavelengths. From these images it calculates, displays and stores Double Ratio images at a maximum speed of 1 Hz. The Double Ratio image gives the distribution of the fluorophore amount present in tissue and is not affected by local variations in tissue optics, i. e. tissue absorption and tissue scattering.

40|$|Turner Syndrome (TS) is a sex-chromosome {{disorder}} {{occurring in}} approximately 1 in 2, 500 female births. The main features are short stature and dysfunctional gonads, {{resulting in a}} lack of sex hormones, delayed puberty and infertility. Physical characteristics associated with TS include webbed neck and <b>pigmented</b> <b>moles.</b> Women with TS have {{a high risk of}} developing chronic ill health and require ongoing medical monitoring. This qualitative study aims to develop an understanding of the psychosocial impact of living with TS during adulthood, with particular reference to chronic ill health, body-image and infertility. Ten women were interviewed and data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Two superordinate themes were developed: 'Living with an Evolving Condition' and 'Oscillating between a Positive and Negative Identity'. The meaning of TS changed for participants depending on their life stage and they described living with uncertainty and difficulty in differentiating themselves from the manifestations of TS. Various consequences of TS impacted upon participants' struggles to establish a coherent and positive identity, including dissatisfaction with their appearance, receiving differential treatment and their medical care. Infertility was a particularly important aspect of participants' experiences of TS across the life stage and challenged their establishment of a positive identity. A limited version of Foucauldian Discourse Analysis was adopted to understand the influence of the socio-cultural (pronatalist) context on being infertile and provided a 'material-discursive' approach to the experience of infertility. Participants' struggles to maintain a positive identity were related to a lack of available, positive discursive resources to define themselves as (infertile) women. The participants also constructed their infertility as a 'dis-ability' and a 'reproductive impairment', placing them in positions of deficit and dysfunction. Potential clinical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Almost {{nothing is}} known about why <b>pigmented</b> birthmarks (<b>moles</b> or nevi) occur in {{particular}} locations of the skin. The causes of most birth defects are also unknown. About 35 % of children who claim to remem-ber previous lives have birthmarks and/or birth defects that they (or adult in-formants) attribute to wounds on a person whose life the child remembers. The cases of 210 such children have been investigated. The birthmarks were usually areas of hairless, puckered skin; some were areas of little or no pig-mentation (hypopigmented macules); others were areas of increased pigmen-tation (hyperpigmented nevi). The birth defects were nearly always of rare types. In cases in which a deceased person was identified the details of whose life unmistakably matched the child's statements, a close correspondence was nearly always found between the birthmarks and/or birth defects on {{the child and the}} wounds on the deceased person. In 43 of 49 cases in which a medical document (usually a postmortem report) was obtained, it confirmed the corre-spondence between wounds and birthmarks (or birth defects). There is little evidence that parents and other informants imposed a false identity on the child in order to explain the child's birthmark or birth defect. Some paranor-mal process seems required to account for {{at least some of the}} details of these cases, including the birthmarks and birth defects.

40|$|Abstract Background Melanoma {{incidence}} in the UK {{has doubled}} over two decades, {{yet there is}} conflicting evidence about factors which prompt or delay patients seeking advice. Aim: To explore patient understanding of <b>pigmented</b> skin lesions (<b>moles)</b> and skin cancer, and factors which influence seeking help in primary care. Method Semi-structured interviews with forty MoleMate Trial participants, analysed using the theoretical framework of the Safer-Andersen model of Total Patient Delay. Results Patient understanding and awareness was influenced by personal, family and friends' experiences of moles, skin cancer and other cancers, knowledge of risk factors, and the lay media. The route to consulting was complex and often iterative. For lesions that people could see, detecting and appraising change was influenced by comparisons with a normal mole on themselves, a family member, friend or image. Inferring illness came about with recognition of changes (particularly size) as serious, and associated 'internal' symptoms such as pain. For lesions that people could not see, family, friends and health professionals detected and appraised changes. Deciding to seek help was often prompted by another person or triggered by rapid or multiple changes in a mole. Three of four people subsequently diagnosed with melanoma did not seek help; instead, their GP opportunistically noticed the lesion. Conclusions Changing moles are often perceived as trivial and not signifying possible skin cancer. This study contributes to current national strategies to improve patient awareness and earlier diagnosis of cancer by highlighting factors that can trigger or act as barriers to seeking help.

Powyższe wyniki mogą świadczyć o niekompletności wiedzy ankietowanych w zakresie wpływu UV na zdrowie człowieka. Abstract 1. Introduction and aim Ultraviolet radiation is present in the daily life of every human being. The constantly growing number of new cases of skin cancer in Poland and in the world can suggest a lack of adequate knowledge of photoprotection. Raising public awareness, especially among young people about the health effects of excessive UV radiation use, plays a key role in relation to their current and future health. The aim of the study was to assess the level of knowledge among high school students in Warsaw about the health effects resulting from excessive use of ultraviolet radiation, as well as knowledge concerning health behaviors of young people using UV radiation. 2. Material and methods The study group consists of 153 students from Warsaw high schools. The gender distribution was random, the age range of the respondents was 17 to 19 years. The study was conducted using paper questionnaire, consisting of 29 questions. To examine the relationship between the selected traits has been applied test of independence chi-square (χ 2) (STATISTICA 12 package). In tests the level of significance was p≤ 0. 05. Depending on the size used appropriate amendments to the chi-square test. 3. Results and conclusions There was no relationship between such features as: the use of tanning devices and perception of skin burns as a carcinogenic factor, the use of the solarium and regularly reviewing <b>pigmented</b> <b>moles,</b> the occurrence of malignant melanoma of the skin in the past in the family and the use of tanning devices, the occurrence of skin burns and frequency of use of formulations with UV protection. This may indicate incomplete knowledge of the respondents in terms of the impact of UV on human health...|$|R
