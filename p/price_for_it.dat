25|$|The {{predominant}} {{theme in}} Notorious is trust—trust withheld, or given too freely. T. R. Devlin {{is a long}} time finding his trust, while Alexander Sebastian offers his up easily—and ultimately pays a big <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Likewise, the film addresses a woman's need to be trusted, and a man's need to open himself to love.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{that have}} cornered their markets have usually {{done so in}} an attempt to gain greater leeway in their decisions; for example, they may desire to charge higher prices for their {{products}} without fears of losing too much business.

[...] "Father thinks since the news came from Concord and Lexington that all the provincials ought to turn to and show their mettle; but mother says {{so long as the}} king's troops buy truck and pay good <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> it is our business to see that we don't take the bread and butter out of our own mouths." ...|$|R
50|$|Sapiano {{was born}} at Balzan, Malta, in 1911. He began his studies at the Lyceum, where he showed special {{interest}} in literature, and was also awarded <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Afterwards, he pursued his studies at the Gregorian University in Rome (1928-39). He was ordained a priest in 1934. At Rome he obtained a doctorate in philosophy, another in theology, and a licentiate in Church history.|$|R
50|$|At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a {{hotly contested}} property, with {{constant}} conflicts over titles and rights. Had {{any of their}} competitors became aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, they may well have bought up the land the pair were after, and charged exorbitant <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Or worse, refuse to sell it at all. Thus, they chose to operate in secret. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the actual ownership of the land.|$|R
25|$|For {{the next}} few years he {{continued}} to work on the Missa, composing piano sonatas and bagatelles to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income, and completing the Diabelli Variations. He was ill again for an extended time in 1821, and completed the Missa in 1823, three years after its original due date. He also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work, an idea that was arguably not fully realised until 1971. Beethoven's brother Johann began to take a hand in his business affairs, much in the way Kaspar had earlier, locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the Missa to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{awaiting}} the long-ballyhooed communist spring offensive, the U.S. improved its forward air control procedures. Lacking the institutional memory to recall prior experience during World War II, the Americans reinvented all-weather bombing and night FAC operations. Newer radio jeeps with 12 channels replaced {{the older ones}} that had only four. Ordnance specialists began loading proximity fused bombs matched to specific targets. Forward airfields were opened to stage aircraft closer to the enemy. When the communist offensive began on 22 April 1951, the 337,000 attacking troops disregarded UN air power and paid a heavy <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Tactical aviation from three aircraft carriers became available for close air support on 18 May. In mid-May, radar guided night air strikes killed communist troops within 400 yards of the U.S. 2nd Division, to General Almond's delight. However, even with copious air support, the UN forces gave ground until the communist attack petered out. Then they counter-attacked. Although they drove the communists back, {{for the first time}} the latter did not withdraw out of artillery range as usual to regroup, but clung in place. On 1 July 1951, North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung and General Peng Te-huai agreed to a cease fire as both sides settled into fixed positions. As the communists dug in, there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes.|$|E

[...] "The Bahraini army has done what the Egyptian army {{did not do}} and exactly what the United States and its other partners urged it not to do -- it has opened fire on its own people," [...] its Washington director said. Fareed Zakaria, CNN's international affairs analyst, said that the crackdown on protesters was a [...] "rash move that will enrage many of its people and cost the regime international prestige". [...] "This is a terrible mistake and they will pay a heavy <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The regime in Bahrain is doing something very rash and unwise; {{it is trying to}} respond by using force and punitive measures. This {{is not going to work}} in the end", he added.|$|E
5000|$|Upton and Hoffman {{ignored the}} [...] "great American quilt revival" [...] trends in quilt making {{that had begun}} in the 1960s. Instead of replicating {{traditional}} quilting patterns, Upton and Hoffman, along {{with a handful of}} their contemporaries, began to synthesize a fine arts perspective with the quilt format. [...] Their abstract “Quilted Tapestries” were original designs. They invited comparison of their work with contemporary art, and they asked art world <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Their work coupled high standards of aesthetic quality with an uncompromising vision of its own value and importance.|$|R

2500|$|Lee, {{despite being}} outnumbered by {{a ratio of}} over two to one, won arguably his {{greatest}} victory of the war, sometimes described as his [...] "perfect battle." [...] But he paid a terrible <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> taking more casualties than he had lost in any previous battle, including the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Antietam. With only 60,000 men engaged, he suffered 13,303 casualties (1,665 killed, 9,081 wounded, 2,018 missing), losing some 22% of his force in the campaign—men that the Confederacy, with its limited manpower, could not replace. Just as seriously, he lost his most aggressive field commander, Stonewall Jackson. Brig. Gen. Elisha F. Paxton was the other Confederate general killed during the battle. After Longstreet rejoined the main army, he was highly critical of Lee's strategy, saying that battles like Chancellorsville cost the Confederacy more men than it could afford to lose.|$|E
