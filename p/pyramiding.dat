And then he found himself with a surplus of gold, deposited in the two newly organized banks; and he was promptly besieged by men and groups of men to enlist his capital in their enterprises.|$|E

Therefore, models provided can be used straight to prepare and execute telerobotics missions. Modelling with <b>Pyramide</b> is made from video images. The software is strongly oriented to provide interactive functions. This allows the operator to adapt its modelling strategy according to the circumstances. <b>Pyramide</b> appeared to be well suited to this modelling application in reason of its versatility. Constraints on the modelling were indeed very strong: great number of parts, highly reflective material, restrained access and radioactive environment. <b>Pyramide</b> allowed to adapt modelling strategy and to take into account at the same time, a-priori knowledge on the scene, data captured on-line and unpredictable situation...|$|R
