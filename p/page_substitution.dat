50|$|A simple {{parametric}} {{description of}} various hysteretic loops {{may be found}} in the Lapshin model of hysteresis. Along with the classical loop (see figure {{at the top of the}} <b>page),</b> <b>substitution</b> of trapezoidal or triangle pulses instead of the harmonic functions also allows piecewise-linear hysteresis loops (see Electronic circuit example) frequently used in discrete automatics to be built in the model. There is an implementation of the hysteresis model in R programming language (package Hysteresis).|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the popular}} {{perception}} that ”natural ” is by definition and always better for the environment than ”synthetic, ” {{it has been suggested}} that petrochemical surfactants should be replaced with oleochemical ones because this would improve the environmental profile of detergents. As this will be discussed in more detail in the following <b>pages,</b> a total <b>substitution</b> is not recommended for many reasons: • The wide range in consumer needs (wash conditions) would be more difficult to meet with oleochemical surfactants alone. • Data from biodegradation, removal by sewage treatment, toxicity and LCA studies support that petrochemical and oleochemical surfactants are of comparable environmental quality. • Replacement of petrochemical by oleochemical surfactants would not lead to any significant reductions in water or air emissions, nor would it reduce energy consumption across the life-cycle of the surfactants. • Colder wash temperatures will result in energy savings during the consumer use phase of the surfactant life-cycle. This will have positive consequences for the environment: reduced air emissions, conservation of petroleum stocks, reduced waste. Ideally, both oleochemical and petrochemical surfactants are available to detergent formulators. Having the flexibility to use both oleochemical and petrochemical surfactants allows our formulators to create products that maximize the value in the bottle of detergent, so to speak, by optimizing cleaning ability under a variety of laundry conditions while keeping the price low in the current market. These days, our formulation scientists focus quite a lot on developing detergents that perform well at lower wash temperatures. This approach will continue to yield energy savings during the consumer use phase, hence a reduction of CO 2 emissions. ...|$|R
