The {{hierarchical structure}} afforded by linguistic systems, together with interelement relationships, is suggested {{as a means}} of representing interpretations of generative design processes. The utility of relational descriptions for describing spatial arrangements and performing geometric transformations is discussed. Tree systems are shown to be a useful representation for relational descriptions, by making explicit the possible hierarchical organizations, and a search mechanism is introduced to look for 'interesting' design interpretations. A method for inferring tree automata from positive sample sets is employed to infer relational grammars. New spatial arrangements are generated using the inferred grammars. The inferred automata are used to recognize other spatial arrangements of the same style. Issues in the representation and the grammatical inference method are discussed in the light of examples from the domain of spatial configuration. ...|$|E

This paper focuses on misbehaving {{as part of}} the <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> research that explores new ways to think our objects, spaces and interactions. We built upon a mosaic of case-studies and conceptual inputs to identify how “misbehaving attitudes” may operate within contexts informed by habitus, norms, regulations, standards, protocols, procedures, and/or laws. The hypothesis of this in-progress research is that these attitudes should be considered as potential methodological approaches that can enrich and extend the most “classical” practices of design. To put it forthright: can “misbehaving” approaches in design enhance the practices of design? To conclude, this paper will discuss how “misbehaving” in design education could foster the “critical thinking” advocated in numerous curriculums (Combs, Cennamo & Newbill, 2009; Finn, Baum & Newbill, 2011; Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche, 2012; etc.) ...|$|E

Based on cognitive and computational approach, with the integration of scaffolding strategies and multiple representations, an interactive and real-time design computing learning system is constructed. By interactively manipulating the various attributes, codes, parameters and digital media contents in a distributed system, learners are gradually exposed to the mutual relationship of representational digital multimedia and the underlining programming syntax in a collaborative environment.

40|$|It may be {{absurd to}} suggest {{that people in the}} future would choose to consume sock-services as {{convoluted}} as the ones de-scribed. However, the development of PSS as a model of provision makes clear that such schemes are being considered and it is certainly not beyond the realm of imagination to suppose that producers are thinking of ways to make these kinds of arrangements a reality. Through an analysis of the interaction of the ontological coordinates set by PSS itself—the product, the service, and the system—it is argued that the key challenge that the designer faces in such situations is ethical in character. Not because designers are considered to be the ultimate arbiters of good or bad; rather, since the focus of research has moved from the nature of objects to the behavior of people, it is suggested that design for use has become the design of use. The intention, therefore, is to question what conditions govern the way in which designers can operate in the emerging systemic <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>design,</b> making, and provision...|$|E
40|$|Recently we {{are urged}} to {{transform}} education into an evidence based profession, and promote scientific standards or practice. These calls are not new – they seem to emerge every few years. We do not argue with their goal, but we contend that the suitable frame of reference is the <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> science, rather than the common metaphor of medical research. This paper proposes Design Inquiry of Learning as a projection of educational design science into a professional domain, and offers the Learning Design Studio as a pedagogical manifestation of this approach. The learning design studio is a collaborative, blended, project based framework for training educators in effective and evidence-based use of educational technology. We present its theoretical underpinnings, note its fundamental principles and structures, and review three independent cases {{where it has been}} trialed. The results show that this model is effective in developing learners’ theoretical knowledge as well as their practical skills, and allows them to link the two. However, it requires a considerable commitment of both learners and tutors, and may not be applicable in more casual settings...|$|E

But when information on the query distribution is available, the alternative <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>designing</b> and analyzing algorithms {{from the perspective of}} expected-case performance appears more attractive. In this thesis, we study the approximate nearest neighbor problem from this point of view. As a first step in this direction, we assume that the query points are chosen uniformly from inside a hypercube that encloses all the data points. However, we make no assumption on the distribution of data points. We show that with very simple data structures, it is possible to achieve linear space and logarithmic (or polylogarithmic) query time in the expected case. In contrast, the data structures known to achieve linear space and logarithmic query time in the worst case are complicated, and algorithms on them run more slowly in practice...|$|R
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{high-speed}} communication networks grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to re-examine system design with respect to resource allocation. Particularly in wireless networks where the spectrum is a shared and limited resource, {{it is important for}} networks to respond to randomly fluctuating conditions by adapting the allocation of resources in an efficient, fair, and scalable manner. The difficulty in doing this lies in the inherently distributed structure of large-scale networks with many autonomous and possibly selfish users. Recently, a large body of work in which resource allocation is modeled as a constrained optimization problem has emerged. In such work, the parallel computation of the solution to an optimization problem is mimicked in order to design practical, distributed algorithms for resource allocation. This <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> philosophy can be applied to a wide-range of networks and applications. The contributions of this research lie in four main areas: i) distributed and adaptive rate assignments for CDMA 1 xEVDO-type systems, ii) cross-layer optimal rate assignments for hybrid wired/ wireless CDMA networks, iii) leveraging downlink for socially optimal and incentive compatible uplink rate allocation in cellular networks, and iv) capacity- achieving rate assignments in unicast networks that employ network coding.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> is changing. Designers now need to be equipped with {{the skills and knowledge}} that will enable them to participate in the global move towards a sustainable future. The challenges arise as Design for Sustainability deals with very complex and often contradictory issues. Collaborative learning experiences recognise that these complex issues can be addressed with the pooling of diverse knowledge, perspectives, cultures, skills and tools. Unless, however the process of collaboration is explored in detail, the opportunity for reflection, learning and improvement is lost. This paper proposes that by introducing and analysing collaboration within third level design education, the capacity for responsible design practice can be developed, leading to a transformative shift in how designers are taught as students and subsequently practice as professionals. Over two multidisciplinary projects devised and undertaken by design students from the University of Limerick (Ireland), Hogeschool Utrecht (Netherlands) and Virginia Commonwealth University (USA), the collaborative path is mapped and critical junctions identified. From this process of mapping and visualisation, collective narratives of the overall project experience are constructed (through the eyes of the participants and planners). This leads to a greater understanding and appreciation of the benefits and limitations of the collaborative experience...|$|E

What meaning does the airport create for the millions of people who fly through often without pause? A web based survey was used to ascertain a wider scope of public views on airports as well as gathering opinions on some of the critical questions surrounding their future. Namely should the airport be connected to its local region, then should the airport be opened up as a citywide destination to the public [or non-passengers], and finally should the airport become a forum of social networking? Synthesizing these responses with different readings on airports as well as a variety of observations a framework for analyzing and designing these environments emerged. By considering earlier models in an attempt to understand the evolution of airport typologies and their connection to the urban landscape the concept anthroportscape was developed. The anthroportscape is the democratic, resilient, organic, and sustainable progressive evolutionary pathway of the airport. As the focus of this honors thesis investigation applying this urban design framework to the southern Indian city of Hyderabad yielded many fruitful speculations for sustainable development of the city and region. This further reinforced the conclusion that airports can drive sustainable urban development.
