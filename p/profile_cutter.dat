40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area of gear cutting tool design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field of gear shaper cutter design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey of involute cylindrical gearing geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems of gear design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process of gear manufacturing using the gear shaper cutters. It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process of gear shaper cutter. With cylindrical gear being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry of gear shaper cutters. The knowl- edge about the <b>profile</b> of the <b>cutter</b> teeth and the profile cut by the cutter in the gear blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The gear shaper cutter is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These re-sharpening operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile of the gear it cuts. The changes in the cutter and gear geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. Gear shaper <b>cutter</b> <b>profiles</b> usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better <b>cutter</b> <b>profile,</b> while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for gear shaper cutter design should be able to show the <b>profile</b> of the <b>cutter</b> and the <b>profile</b> cut by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation of gear shaper <b>cutters</b> <b>profiles</b> cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding of the principles of operation of gear generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies of the real-life gear shaper cutter designs were performed...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth <b>profile</b> <b>cutters</b> of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread milling cutter with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section.
