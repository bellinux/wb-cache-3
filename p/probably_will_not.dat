The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> do another album, as {{he felt that the}} energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{the most}} formal contexts, BP never uses the {{contracted}} combinations of direct and indirect object pronouns which are sometimes used in EP, such as me + o = mo, lhe + as = lhas. Instead, the indirect clitic is replaced by preposition + strong pronoun: thus BP writes ela o deu para mim ("she gave it to me") instead of EP ela deu-mo; the latter most <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be understood by Brazilians, being obsolete in BP.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Moran's {{daughter}} Dorothy {{was suffering}} from an inoperable brain tumor. During the campaign, neither Moran or McSlarrow used the negative tactics of two years earlier. On his campaign strategy that election, McSlarrow said [...] "It {{would not be a}} community service to shut down this campaign, but I <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> talk much about Moran." [...] Moran was reelected with 59 percent of the vote.|$|E

500|$|Columbia Law School {{professor}} Tim Wu did {{not think}} Disney would have any defensible intellectual property claim. [...] "Though the filmmakers may have committed trespass when they broke Disney World's rules and if it violated the terms of entry on their tickets, the film itself is a different matter," [...] he wrote on The New Yorkers blog. [...] "As commentary on the social ideals of Disney World, it seems to clearly fall within a well-recognized category of fair use, and therefore <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be stopped by a court using copyright or trademark laws." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill C-22 (previously Bill C-56), titled [...] "An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Democratic representation)" [...] was a bill which would add 22 seats to the House of Commons. This would {{increase}} the number to 330 seats, although these seats <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be in use until at least 2014. Under the proposed plan, Ontario would gain ten seats, British Columbia would get another seven seats, and Alberta would receive another five seats. The bill did not pass {{by the end of}} the 1st session of parliament, and was reintroduced in the 2nd session. The bill was delayed by an amendment by the Bloc and did not become law {{by the end of the}} session.|$|E
500|$|Alice and Louis's {{return to}} Darmstadt as Grand Duke and Duchess {{was met with}} celebration that Alice did not expect. However, she found her duties overwhelming, writing to her mother that she [...] "dreaded everything". Alice used her new role to reform the social {{conditions}} of Darmstadt, but found the responsibility of being Landesmutter (mother of her people) strenuous. In another letter to her mother, she wrote that her duties were [...] "more than she could stand in the long run". She was distressed by a rumour that she was once unkind to Louis's aunt, Grand Duchess Mathilde Caroline, and she was hurt by an unkind letter from Queen Victoria. Alice complained to Louis that the letter [...] "made me cry with anger...I wish I were dead and it <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be too long before I give Mama that pleasure." [...] However, no mention is made of what provoked this angry outburst.|$|E

2500|$|Fire and Ice {{received}} mixed reviews. The {{novel was}} well received by a reviewer for Voice of Youth Advocates, who observed that [...] "Hunter works hard at incorporating authentic cat mannerisms and behaviors" [...] and that [...] "although more sophisticated teens might {{be put off}} by the coy dialogue attributes, younger readers <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> notice and will be caught up in Fireheart's adventures". On the other hand, a reviewer for Children's Literature found the plot to be [...] "flat, repetitious, much too long, and in the end unsatisfying except perhaps to devoted cat lovers or readers who revel in invented worlds". [...] School Library Journal observed that readers unfamiliar with the first novel would find this one difficult to follow and that the [...] "characterizations of the animals are somewhat flat, although it is possible to tell them apart, and the plot's twists and turns seem mapped out and predictable". Kirkus Reviews praised the increased tensions, noting that [...] "Hunter's world keeps getting more finely drawn, and her characters more complex" [...] though readers may be disappointed that Fireheart fails to resolve his [...] "conflicting responsibilities". Booklist likewise praised the novel's tension, noting that the [...] "characters remain true to their feline natures, adding to the plausibility of events in this tension filled story".|$|E

60|$|The {{quick glance}} of Delafield not only watched, but easily detected, both the rapid {{transitions}} {{and the character}} of these opposite emotions.

60|$|This was {{the first}} time I had ever heard my mate mention republicanism, his habits being {{certainly}} as much opposed to liberty, as those of Napoleon himself.
