40|$|Few Westerners have {{sufficient}} proficiency in Japanese for conference interpretation. The major stumbling block in their acquisition of Japanese as a <b>passive</b> <b>language</b> resides in vocabulary enhancement. Japanese vocabulary consists o/wago, kango and gairaigo and their compounds. Each category has different characteristics {{in terms of}} learning. While learning gairaigo is rather easy for the Westerner, wago proves more difficult to memorize, and kango poses special problems due to {{the small number of}} distinct syllables in Japanese as opposed to the large number of kanji used. The large number of words used in Japanese compounds the difficulty, especially as compared with the acquisition of a Western language where the large proportion of words having common Greco-Latin roots that can be recognized even at first sight, reduces the number of new words that actually have to be learned. These facts provide one explanation for the difficulty Westerners have in reaching an adequate level of comprehension of Japanese for interpretation purposes. They also raise questions as to the soundness of the philosophy interpreters' schools and their methods in developing high-level linguistic skills. Up to now, this question has been dealt with on the basis of" common sense " and the instructors' personal experience.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} sequential {{language acquisition}} of the researcher's daughter Safa who transformed from a monolingual Bengali speaker to an almost monolingual English speaker {{in a few months}} after moving to the UK. Safa was born in Bangladesh and was a monolingual Bengali speaker until she was three years and nine months when the family moved to the UK. Unlike most research on sequential bilingualism, Safa's transition from Bengali to English went through a period of an invented language, which she developed and used for a few months. Safa then underwent language shift as Bengali became her <b>passive</b> <b>language.</b> Safa's loss of fluency in Bengali was mainly due to the absence of Bengali linguistic environment, because her family lived outside the community. Safa's mother's indifference to Bangladeshi ethnicity and her parents’ positive attitude towards Britishness meant that her decline in Bengali did not cause them much concern. Despite the lack of proficiency in Bengali, Safa still retains a strong ethnic Bangladeshi identity. Tabors and Snow’s four-stage developmental process of sequential second-language acquisition has been applied to find the similarities and differences in Safa's case, while language maintenance and shift theories have contributed to the analysis of the process of her language shift...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. Abnormalities {{in brain}} struc-ture, cognition, and {{behavior}} {{have been described}} in children born prematurely. However, no direct in vivo evidence has yet demonstrated abnormal neural process-ing in these children. Our aim was to compare brain activity associated with phonologic and semantic pro-cessing of language between term and preterm children using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Methods. fMRI scans were acquired during a <b>passive</b> <b>language</b> comprehension task in 26 preterm children at 8 years of age and in 13 term community control children who were comparable in age, sex, maternal education, and minority status. IQ was assessed using a standard measure of intelligence. Results. The pattern of brain activity identified in a semantic processing task in the preterm children closely resembled the pattern of brain activity identified in a phonologic processing task in term controls. The greater this resemblance in the preterm children, the lower their verbal comprehension IQ scores and the poorer their language comprehension during the scanning task. Conclusions. Preterm children with the poorest lan-guage comprehension seemed not to fully engage normal semantic processing pathways in a language comprehen-sion task. These children instead engaged pathways that normal term children used to process meaningless pho-nologic sounds. Aberrant processing of semantic content in these preterm children may account in part for their lower verbal IQ scores.

Within this network, no processing leve l is related to a single cortical area. The temporal lobes seem to differ {{with respect to their}} involvement in post-lexical processing, in that the left temporal lobe has greater involvement than the right, and also in the degree of anatomical specialization for phonological, lexical, and sentence -level processing, with greater overlap on the right contrasting with a higher degree of differentiation on the left...|$|R
50|$|Active {{voice is}} used in a clause whose subject expresses the main verb's agent. That is, the subject does the verb's {{designated}} action.

In contrast, a clause in which the subject has the role of patient or theme is named a passive clause, and its verb is expressed in <b>passive</b> voice. Many <b>languages</b> have both an active and a passive voice; this allows for greater flexibility in sentence construction, as either the semantic agent or patient may take the subject syntactic role.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The rate of {{recovery}} from the vegetative state (VS) is low. Currently, little is known of the mechanisms and cerebral changes that accompany those relatively rare cases of good recovery. Here, we combined {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the evolution of one VS patient at one month post-ictus and again twelve months later when he had recovered consciousness. Methods fMRI was used to investigate cortical responses to <b>passive</b> <b>language</b> stimulation as well as task-induced deactivations related to the default-mode network. DTI was used to assess the integrity of the global white matter and the arcuate fasciculus. We also performed a neuropsychological assessment {{at the time of the}} second MRI examination in order to characterize the profile of cognitive deficits. Results fMRI analysis revealed anatomically appropriate activation to speech in both the first and the second scans but a reduced pattern of task-induced deactivations in the first scan. In the second scan, following the recovery of consciousness, this pattern became more similar to that classically described for the default-mode network. DTI analysis revealed relative preservation of the arcuate fasciculus and of the global normal-appearing white matter at both time points.

Conclusions These results suggest that the combination of different structural and functional imaging modalities may provide a powerful means for assessing the mechanisms involved in the recovery from the VS. </p...|$|E
40|$|Norwegian {{children}} in the 21 st century are quite massively exposed to English as an L 2, primarily through subtitled television programmes, films and various computer-based activities. The article investigates to what extent this passive exposure influences their basic phonological competence in the L 2 by analyzing their ability to actively distinguish between certain phoneme pairs in English which are considered difficult for Norwegian learners, mainly due to interference from the phonemic system in their L 1. The data material was collected through 136 recordings of 11 - 16 year old pupils in ten Norwegian state schools. By comparing the results to similar studies made in Norway 20 - 35 years ago, {{at a time when}} young people's exposure to English was considerably more limited, the article discusses the effects of incidental foreign language acquisition on young people's L 2 competence. The discussion is also placed in the light of recent, international research in this field. By critically investigating some of the findings of that research, the article furthermore attempts at problematizing the concept of L 2 acquisition by focusing on the distinction between active and <b>passive</b> <b>language</b> competence. The findings indicate that basic L 2 phonological competence is in no way automatically enhanced by passive exposure to the language. The article points to the necessity of structured teaching programmes to counterweight the complexity and variations in the L 2 input that young people encounter in their media based exposure to the L 2...|$|E

40|$|A {{controversial}} {{question in}} cognitive neuroscience is whether comprehension {{of words and}} sentences engages brain mechanisms specific for decoding linguistic meaning or whether language comprehension occurs through more domain-general sensorimotor processes.

To examine the involvement of these brain regions in language and nonlanguage tasks, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a group of 21 healthy adults. During the fMRI session, all participants 1) watched short object-related action movies, 2) looked at pictures of man-made objects, and 3) listened to and produced short sentences describing object-related actions and man-made objects. Our results are among the first to reveal, in the human brain, a functional specialization within the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) for observing actions and for observing objects, and a different organization for processing sentences describing actions and objects. These findings argue against the strongest version of the simulation theory for the processing of action-related language...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{characteristics}} of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) observed among relatives of people affected with autism {{are referred to}} as broader autism phenotype (BAP). Among the components of BAP are language and communication skills. Research to date on these skills amongst the relatives of individuals with ASD is inconclusive. Furthermore, limited data are available about preschool-aged siblings of children with ASD. Participants and procedure Eighty-six children aged 4 years and 6 months – 6 years and 11 months took part in the study (32 girls and 54 boys). They were divided into four groups: siblings of children with autism (S/ASD), high-functioning children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (HF/ASD), siblings of children with Down syndrome (S/DS) and siblings of typically developing children (Controls, C). Communication and language skills were tested using the Vocabulary Test for Children (TSD). It was used to assess two kinds of verbal skills: receptive <b>language</b> (<b>passive)</b> and expressive <b>language</b> (active). Results No differences were observed in expressive lanquage or receptive language between siblings of children with ASD and siblings of children with DS as well as typically developing children. In terms of receptive language and general communication skills, siblings of children with ASD scored higher than high functioning children with ASD. High functioning children with ASD displayed difficulties with receptive language, expressive language, general language and communication skills.

Following a grounded theory case study methodology, historical data, vis-??-vis 234 previous student writing assignments, were examined. The purpose of the data analysis was to explore student perceptions relative to the effectiveness of academic success courses in increasing academic self-efficacy beliefs. Students identified interpersonal and external factors that led to increased academic self-efficacy beliefs. The interpersonal factors included time management practices and using what was defined as creator language and mentalities. External factors that helped the students were meeting with their professors outside of class and participation in activities and services on campus. Specifically, students reported positive changes in their academic self-efficacy beliefs through a discovery that they were not the only students who struggle academically, a belief in self, increased confidence, and a sense of pride. Notably, while the specific factors that influenced student self-efficacy were consistent across student groups, male and female students tended to write about their future plans for success differently. The majority of male students wrote using <b>passive</b> <b>language,</b> whereas most of the female students used active language in their writing.

40|$|Campaigning {{organisations such as}} Carers UK, Help the Aged and Age Concern {{have worked}} tirelessly {{to ensure that the}} needs of carers are central to the Government’s {{emerging}} political agenda, culminating in the recently published New Deal for Carers strategy (Department of Health, 2007). While older carers - along with younger carers - will benefit from changes to existing funding streams and the creation of new ones, the needs of older carers are particularly challenging and to date they remain relatively under reported in research. Few older carers are involved in research as active partners which means that most of the information available - while essential in its own right – does not provide a personal account of the hidden work and world of older carers. One of the key aims of this study therefore was to develop a participatory methodology capable of involving older carers as co-researchers, in a study that sought to make visible their hidden work and world. Using naturalistic case study, older carers were supported to assume the dual role of research participant and co-researcher. In their role as research participants, older carers kept a research diary for seven days detailing their day-to-day activities. As co-researchers, older carers met together in a series of focus group meetings to carefully examine the contents of the diaries, using the meetings to add reflective notes, stories and anecdotal comments, thereby situating the diaries in their proper social and political context. Older carers identified a number of issues, including living with social exclusion, the importance of money and the difficulty of managing emergency situations – all key issues in the Government’s new strategy for older carers, and they proved that they had the necessary skills, knowledge, motivation and flair to contribute to research and debates of national importance. The complex nature of caring in later life was powerfully illustrated by stories that demonstrated the heroic means by which older carers lived their lives, every single day. In conclusion, this study called for a step change in the number of older people involved in research, planning and service development activities, and an end to the use of <b>passive</b> <b>language</b> when describing the skills, knowledge and experience of older people. It exhorted health and social care professionals to examine their own in-built bias and prejudices, so that fair and just systems of community involvement could be built...|$|E

The analysis is done on some existing literary translations from Arabic into English and French and data reflective to the problems and occurrences of voices are collected throughout the texts under study.
