I pointed out a fact that Neruda was a fearless, rather a rebellious writer in his period, and he had been breaking prudish literary stereotypes at that time. The first chapter presents the 19 th century itself and refers to the recent status of a woman but also to some situations which were placed under a taboo by local society.

40|$|Purpose ? Seeks {{to explore}} the {{assumptions}} and limitations of current programmes {{for the creation of}} electronic patient records by comparing ICT <b>programme</b> <b>statements</b> with hospital uses of information. Design/methodology/approach ? Compares qualitative data from medical ICT <b>programmes</b> <b>statements</b> with data from ethnographic studies of hospital decision making. Uses actor-network theory to develop a performative definition of information as that which secures a decision or ?qualculation?, whether in the form of calculation or judgement. Findings ? Shows that decision making depends on a mix of formal and informal considerations that are, however, always restricted in scope and number. Shows that some of these are locally and organisationally contingent. Research limitations/implications ? The ethnographic findings illustrate the character of information rather than offering data about the character of decisions in different clinical locations. Practical implications ? Caution is needed in the face of claims about ICT programmes in health care. It is possible to anticipate neither all the uses of information nor what will count as information in advance. Originality/value ? The paper develops a performative definition of information. This is whatever secures a decision in practice. Information thus reflects a situated process of simplification and bounding of relevancies. This suggests that information not only flows (which is assumed in ICT <b>programme</b> <b>statements)</b> but also is fluid, unpredictably changing its form and character. This claim is relevant both to the design and use of ICT in health care and to the theory of information...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: People with obesity {{experience}} {{a range of}} physical and psychological ill-health outcomes. This study examined patients' experiences of a group-based programme {{for the management of}} morbid obesity delivered within the UK National Health Service. The focus of the study was on the emerging dynamic of the group and patients' perceptions of its impact on health outcomes. Design: A qualitative interview study was conducted and involved patients recruited from a Tier 3 bariatric service in South West England. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Methods: Twenty patients (12 females) with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 participated in a semi-structured one-to-one interview. Participants had been registered with the bariatric service for at least 6 months. None of the participants had had bariatric surgery. Results: Most participants felt that they had benefited from participating in the group programme and talked about the group as a resource for lifestyle change. Participants' narratives centred on the emergence of a sense of self based upon their participation in the group: establishing psychological connections to other patients, or shared social identity, was regarded as a key mechanism through which the programme's educational material was accessed, and underpinned the experience of social support within the group. Through interaction with other patients, involving the sharing of personal experiences and challenges, participants came to experience their weight 'problem' through a collective lens that they felt empowered them to initiate and sustain individual lifestyle change. Discussion: Bariatric care groups have the potential to support lifestyle change and weight loss and may help address the psychological needs of patients. Nurturing a sense of shared social identity amongst patients with morbid obesity should be a core aim of the care pathway and may provide the foundation for successful translation of dietetic content in group <b>programmes.</b> <b>Statement</b> of contribution: What is already known on this subject?

40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} Bologna Agreement (1999) is {{to improve}} the {{efficiency}} and effectiveness of higher education in Europe. One of the main features of this process is the need to improve the traditional ways of describing qualifications and qualification structures. As a step towards achieving greater clarity in the description of qualifications, by 2010 all modules and programmes in third level institutions throughout the European Union will be written in terms of learning outcomes. International trends in education show a shift from the traditional teacher-centred approach to a student-centred approach, i. e. the focus is not only on teaching but also on what the students are expected {{to be able to do}} at the end of the module or <b>programme.</b> <b>Statements</b> called learning outcomes are used to express what the students are expected to achieve and how they are expected to demonstrate that achievement. Learning outcomes are defined as statements of what a learner is expected to know, understand and/or be able to demonstrate after completion of a process of learning (ECTS, 2005). When writing learning outcomes it is helpful to make use of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. This classification or categorisation of levels of thinking behaviour provides a ready-made structure and list of verbs to assist in writing learning outcomes. Most learning outcomes describe evidence of learning in areas like knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. This area is known as the cognitive domain. The other two main domains are the affective domain (attitudes, feelings, values) and the psychomotor domain (physical skills). In general, when writing learning outcomes begin with an action verb followed by the object of that verb. This handbook contains a list of action verbs for each area of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Sentences should be kept short to ensure clarity. Learning outcomes must be capable of being assessed. When deciding on the number of learning outcomes to write, the general recommendation in the literature is about six learning outcomes per module. The most common mistake in writing learning outcomes is to use vague terms like know, understand, learn, be familiar with, be exposed to, be acquainted with and be aware of. It is important to link learning outcomes to teaching and learning activities and assessment. This may be done with the aid of a grid to assist in checking that the learning outcomes map on to the teaching and learning activities as well as to the mode of assessment. The advantages of learning outcomes for teachers and students are well documented in the literature in terms of clarity, effectiveness of teaching and learning, curriculum design and assessment. In addition, learning outcomes assist greatly in the more systematic design of programmes and modules...|$|R

This paper describes a research priority setting exercise {{conducted by the}} National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia (NIAA). METHODS: Possible research questions were identified from a questionnaire sent to holders of the Final Fellowship in Anaesthesia in Great Britain and Ireland and to lay representatives. The responses to the first questionnaire were collated to produce a list of potential research questions which were then sent to the same constituency for scoring. The results of this scoring process were considered by an expert panel and statements of research need generated for selected questions. The questions from the first round were also reviewed {{with the help of}} representatives of NIHR Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC). RESULTS: For the first questionnaire, 308 responses with 447 suggestions for research were received. A total of 15 questions were included in the second questionnaire, for which 2226 responses were received. The expert panel identified five questions for prioritization.

The purpose of inclusion is to provide the best environment for the development of such children {{and at the same time}} try to teach children tolerance, compassion and respect to those who seem different.

Every day, kindergarten teachers are obliged to plan daily rituals and other routines that they need to carry out. But we often seem to forget the fact that kindergarten teachers are human as well and as such have views, opinions and fears that might affect their work and acceptance of special needs children in their groups. The main aim of the thesis is to analyse these views, as well as the main characteristics, shortcomings and challenges of this inclusion process.

Davidson used the word [...] "shirt-lifters" [...] in front of him, and was constantly asking if Dowling would like to try on one of [...] "John Virgo's lovely waistcoats", which Davidson owns. Davidson later described himself as a [...] "homophobic arsehole". The programme was broadcast on ITV on 4 September 2007. On 10 September, Davidson asked to leave Hell's Kitchen following further problems with Dowling. After Davidson's exit from the programme, the BBC reported that the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom had received 46 complaints alleging that Davidson had bullied Dowling. Ofcom concluded that nothing unacceptable had happened. ITV, the channel which had originally broadcast the <b>programme,</b> issued a <b>statement,</b> regretting Davidson's [...] "unacceptable remarks".|$|R
40|$|Fieldwork is {{regarded}} as {{an important component of}} many bioscience degree <b>programmes.</b> QAA benchmarks <b>statements</b> refer explicitly to the importance of fieldwork, although give no indication of amounts of field provision expected. Previous research has highlighted the importance of fieldwork to the learning of both subject-specific and transferable skills. However, it is unclear how the amount and type of fieldwork currently offered is being affected by the recent expansion in student numbers and current funding constraints. Here we review contemporary literature and report on the results of a questionnaire completed by bioscience tutors across 33 UK institutions. The results suggest, perhaps contrary to anecdotal evidence, that the amount of fieldwork being undertaken by students is not in decline and that on the whole, programmes contain reasonable amounts of fieldwork. The majority of programmes involved UK-based fieldwork, but a number of programmes also offered ‘exotic’ overseas fieldwork which was considered important in terms of student recruitment as well as exposing students to a diversity of field learning environments. Tutors were very clear about the benefits of fieldwork and the need to be proactive to maintain its provision...|$|R
40|$|The National Policy on Education {{specifically}} {{stipulates that}} there is need for equality of educational opportunities to all Nigerian children irrespective of any real or imagined disabilities (FNG 2004). The policy further states that Education of {{children with special needs}} shall be free at all levels and all necessary facilities that would ensure easy access to education shall be provided via inclusive education or integration of special class and units into ordinary/public classes under the Universal Basic Education (UBE) <b>programme.</b> These policy <b>statements</b> appear lofty but their attainment under the present situation seems to be a mirage. Already, about seven million Nigerian children of school going age are out of the school system. Besides most of the public schools are overcrowded and over populated with little or no attention paid to the special child. Furthermore, there are not enough qualified personnel and instructional materials in the school system. The implication of this state of affairs in children with special needs is not adequately catered for. Worst still, most of the children with special needs are not identified early enough let alone intervention and remedial programmes arranged for them. This paper, therefore, examines the current classroom environment vis-a-vis the desire to cater for the special needs of the child. It further identifies the challenges involved in catering for the special needs child and the way forward...|$|R
40|$|Poverty in Nigeria is {{concentrated}} in rural areas. Low resource or resource-poor farmers characterized by preponderance of small farm units, fragile soils, rain-dependent, minimum inputs and poor yield dominate the agricultural sector. The incidence of poverty is highest among households in which the head is engaged in agriculture as {{the main source of}} income. Agricultural growth is therefore important to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in Nigeria. Conscious policy efforts by government towards poverty alleviation began during the SAP era. Some companies like Shell and certain State Governments have shown real interest in alleviating poverty through their agricultural <b>programmes</b> and policy <b>statements.</b> Nigeria’s current vision for agricultural development is expressed in the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), the New Agricultural Policy (NAP), and the Rural Sector Development Strategy (RSDS). This paper posits that provision of electricity, potable water, health centres and formal schools will facilitate the sustainability of any impact of poverty alleviation programmes in Nigeria. Encouraging community development projects evolved by the communities themselves will minimize poverty incidence. Increasing the access of the poor to land and other productive resources will reduce poverty and generate employment. Development of infrastructural facilities in the rural areas has the two pronged approach of reducing poverty and developing the rural areas. Encouraging processing through adequate incentives to SMEs will also further empower the private sector. Farm Management, Food Security and Poverty,...|$|R
