5000|$|Foreign colonial {{influence}} {{played a}} role in shaping Minahasan cuisine. Brenebon (from Dutch [...] "bruin" [...] (brown) and [...] "boon" [...] (bean)) is a <b>pork</b> <b>shank</b> bean stew spiced with nutmeg and clove. Minahasan roast pork similar to lechon in the Philippines or pig roast in Hawaii are served in special occasions, especially weddings. Other unusual and exotic meats such as dog, bat, and forest rat are regularly served in North Sulawesi region. Paniki is the bat dish of Minahasa.|$|E
30|$|It is a {{cold winter}} evening, the {{temperature}} in the house is low, the heating system is activated to reach soon a temperature that will ensure comfort and well-being to Bob and Mary that are going to come back home after a busy working day. The blinds close to avoid the dispersion of heat. As soon as they get into the house, the lights turn on. Mary goes into the kitchen and set about making dinner; she turns on the oven that will soon bake tasty <b>pork</b> <b>shank.</b> In the laundry, the washer and dryer are temporarily suspended to avoid overload. Bob comes into the living room, where the lights turn on. He is very tired and decides to sprawl on the sofa and enjoy some videos. Therefore, he prepares the projector for watching the video taken by of his GoPRO while skying the previous Sunday on mountain holiday. The video projection begins, and the lights turn down to create soft lights.|$|E
50|$|Mexico City {{also has}} {{its own version of}} migas. It is a garlic soup which is {{thickened}} with sliced day-old bolillos. It is usually flavored with <b>pork</b> <b>shanks,</b> ham bones, epazote, oregano and different types of dried chillies. A raw egg is usually added to each plate when served and it is slowly cooked by the warm soup, similar to egg drop soup. It is a very popular dish in fondas around downtown Mexico city, especially in Tepito.|$|R
50|$|In October 2002, Hill {{published}} The Wiseguy Cookbook: My Favorite Recipes From My Life As a Goodfella To Cooking On the Run. In it, Hill shared {{some stories}} throughout his childhood, {{life in the}} mob, and running from the law. He also presents recipes he learned from his family, during his years in the mob, and some that {{he came up with}} himself. For example, Hill claimed his last meal the day he was busted for drugs consisted of rolled veal cutlets, sauce with <b>pork</b> butt, veal <b>shanks,</b> ziti, and green beans with olive oil and garlic.|$|R
40|$|Ab s t r a c t. The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the effect of curing brine composition on the water properties in sediments from <b>pork</b> <b>shank</b> and semi-membranous muscles. The applied brines were solutions of inorganic salts of varying composition. The performed analyses comprised active acidity pH, water activ-ity Aw, water absorbability expressed as percentage proportion of free water in the total water content, as well as the value of relaxation times spin-network T 1 and spin-spin T 2. An inversely proportional correlation was found between pH values and water activity in the examined muscles when brines containing sodium chlo-ride, pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate and a mixture of NaCl and pyrophosphate were applied. In the case of the control muscles as well as those containing a mixture of sodium chloride and tripolyphoshate, the above correlation was directly proportional. It was demonstrated that pyrophosphate, even at low pH values, signifi-cantly increased water absorbability of muscle tissue sediments. The analysis of relaxation parameters showed that pyrophosphate as a constituent of brine reduced the content of free water in relation to bound water as demonstrated by significant shortening of the spin-network relaxation time. In addition, the molecu-lar dynamics of bound water was found to be inhibited. The above observations allowed the authors to con-clude that pyrophosphate, as brine constituent, causes very good water binding in muscle tissue sediments.
