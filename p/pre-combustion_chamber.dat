40|$|This {{final report}} {{describes}} a project intended to identify, develop, test, and commercialize emissions control and monitoring technologies {{that can be}} implemented by E&P operators to significantly lower their cost of environmental compliance and expedite project permitting. Technologies were installed and tested in controlled laboratory situations and then installed and tested on field engines based on the recommendations of an industry-based steering committee, analysis of installed horsepower, analysis of available emissions control and monitoring technologies, and review of technology and market gaps. The industry-recognized solution for lean-burn engines, a low-emissions-retrofit including increased airflow and <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chambers,</b> was found to successfully control engine emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub X}) and carbon monoxide (CO). However, the standard non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) system recognized by the industry {{was found to be}} unable to consistently control both NO{sub X} and CO emissions. The standard NSCR system was observed to produce emissions levels that changed dramatically on a day-to-day or even hour-to-hour basis. Because difficulties with this system seemed {{to be the result of}} exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) sensors that produced identical output for very different exhaust gas conditions, models were developed to describe the behavior of the EGO sensor and an alternative, the universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor. Meanwhile, an integrated NSCR system using an advanced, signal-conditioned UEGO sensor was tested and found to control both NO{sub X} and CO emissions. In conjunction with this project, advanced monitoring technologies, such as Ion Sense, and improved sensors for emissions control, such as the AFM 1000 + have been developed and commercialized...|$|R

The pump is lubricated by {{a connection to}} the engine oil circulation and the fuel lift pump is mounted {{on the side of the}} injection pump. Preheating is by glow plugs with automatic control of preheating time.|$|E
5000|$|It is a four-stroke, vertical, {{water-cooled}} diesel engine. It {{is built}} around two cylinders (hence the [...] "2" [...] in 2GM20) of 75 mm in diameter and 72 mm in stroke, adding up to 0.635 litres in displacement: each cylinder is roughly the size and volume of a 300 ml soft-drink can. The compression system uses a proprietary swirl-type <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|Attached to the {{cylinder}} head is a cast aluminium alloy intake manifold on one side, and two cast iron exhaust manifolds {{on the same}} side (it's a non cross flow engine) (one manifold for three cylinders) followed by a two in one exhaust pipe system. The fuel system uses a Bosch mechanical distributor-type (Bosch VE type) injection pump which feeds indirect fuel injection into a remote whirl <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the First World War, the Heinrich Lanz Company {{built the}} Bulldog, an {{advanced}} tractor, powered by heavy oil. As {{a result of}} the invention of the <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> by Prosper L'Orange, Benz & Cie. developed the world's first compact diesel-powered car at its motor works in Mannheim in 1923. In 1922, the Grosskraftwerk Mannheim (Mannheim large power station) was opened. By 1930, the city, along with its sister city of Ludwigshafen, which had developed out of the old Mannheim Rheinschanze, had a population of 385,000.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the early}} CVCC engines {{had a problem with}} the {{auxiliary}} valves retaining collars vibrating loose. Once unscrewed, engine oil would leak from the valvetrain into the <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> causing a sudden loss of power and massive amounts of smoke to emanate from the exhaust pipe. The condition simulated a blown engine, even though the needed repair was quite simple. Honda eventually came up with a fix involving metal retaining rings that slipped over the collars and prevented them from backing out of their threads.|$|E

50|$|In diesel engines, a {{mechanical}} injector system vaporizes the fuel {{directly into the}} combustion chamber or a <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> (as opposed to a Venturi jet in a carburetor, or a fuel injector in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine). This forced vaporisation means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher {{as there is no}} risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.|$|E
50|$|Proper {{oxidizer}} vaporization {{is important}} for the rocket to perform efficiently. Improper vaporization can lead to very large regression rate differences at the head end of the motor when compared to the aft end. One method is to use a hot gas generator to heat the oxidizer in a <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> Another method is to use an oxidizer that can also be used as a monopropellant. A good example is hydrogen peroxide, which can be catalytically decomposed over a silver bed into hot oxygen and steam. A third method is to inject a propellant that is hypergolic with the oxidizer into the flow. Some of the oxidizer will decompose, heating {{up the rest of the}} oxidizer in the flow.|$|E
50|$|The oxidiser {{used with}} Gamma was 85% high-test {{peroxide}} (HTP), H2O2. Gamma used a silver-plated on nickel-gauze catalyst to first decompose the peroxide. For higher concentrations of H2O2 another catalyst {{would have been}} required, such as platinum. No ignition source was required since the very hot decomposed H2O2 is hypergolic (will spontaneously combust) with kerosene. Due to the high ratio (8:1) {{of the mass of}} H2O2 used compared to the kerosene, and also its superior heat characteristics, the H2O2 may also be used to regeneratively cool the engine nozzle before combustion. Any <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> used to power the pump turbines needs only to decompose H2O2 to provide the energy. This gives the efficiency advantages of closed cycle operation, without its usual major engineering problems.|$|E
5000|$|The TDI engine uses direct injection, where a fuel {{injector}} sprays atomised fuel directly into the main combustion chamber of each cylinder, rather than the <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> prevalent in older diesels which used indirect injection. The engine also uses forced induction {{by way of a}} turbocharger {{to increase the amount of}} air which is able to enter the engine cylinders, and most TDI engines also feature an intercooler to lower the temperature (and therefore increase the density) of the 'charged', or compressed air from the turbo, thereby increasing the amount of fuel that can be injected and combusted. [...] These, in combination, allow for greater engine efficiency, and therefore greater power outputs (from a more complete combustion process compared to indirect injection), while also decreasing emissions and providing more torque than the non-turbo and non-direct injection petrol engined counterpart from VAG.|$|E
5000|$|Announced at the 1978 Paris Auto Show, the Volvo 240 GL D6 was {{introduced}} in the spring of 1979. Volvo's new diesel engine was purchased from Volkswagen and was a six-cylinder iteration of the ones installed in diesel Volkswagen and Audi vehicles at the time. Production was initially low, with only around 600 built {{by the time of the}} introduction of the 1980 model year cars. These engines are all liquid-cooled, <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> diesel engines with non-sleeved iron blocks and aluminum heads. A Bosch mechanical injection system is used that requires constant electrical input so that the fuel supply can be cut off when the ignition key is removed. A 2.4-litre inline-six (the D24) and a 2.0-litre inline-five (the D20) were available, producing [...] and [...] respectively. The lesser D20 engine was only sold in select markets where it was favoured by the tax structures, most cars went to Finland but it was also marketed in Italy between 1979 and 1981. A turbocharged diesel was never sold in the 200 series. At the time of introduction, the Volvo was one of the fastest as well as quietest diesels sold.|$|E
5000|$|Diesel {{engines are}} also {{produced}} with two significantly different injection locations: [...] "direct" [...] and [...] "indirect." [...] Indirect injection engines place the injector in a <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> in the head, which, due to thermal losses, generally require a [...] "glow plug" [...] {{to start and}} a very high compression ratio, usually between 21:1 and 23:1. Direct injection engines use a generally donut-shaped combustion chamber void {{on the top of}} the piston. Thermal efficiency losses are significantly lower in DI engines which facilitates a much lower compression ratio, generally between 14:1 and 20:1 but most DI engines are closer to 17:1. The direct injection (DI) process is significantly more internally violent and thus requires careful design and more robust construction. The lower compression ratio also creates challenges for emissions due to partial burn. Turbocharging is particularly suited to DI engines since the low compression ratio facilitates meaningful forced induction. The increase in airflow allows capturing additional fuel efficiency, not only from more complete combustion, but also from lowering parasitic efficiency losses when properly operated, by widening both power and efficiency curves. The violent combustion process of direct injection also creates more noise, but modern designs using [...] "split shot" [...] injectors or similar multishot processes have dramatically ameliorated this issue by firing a small charge of fuel before the main delivery, which pre-charges the combustion chamber for a less abrupt, and in most cases slightly cleaner, burn.{citation needed} ...|$|E
50|$|The MCA-Jet {{system has}} a small third valve {{separate}} from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet {{it was found that}} stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Fortunately, each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980's.|$|E

Especially the origin of cyclic variability is of interest. The flame propagation process in a single cycle was captured using a high speed video camera.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringKirby S. ChapmanThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{continues}} to tighten pollutant emission regulations throughout the United States. As a result, {{the need to}} reduce air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO[subscript]x) and carbon monoxide (CO) remains a challenge for pipeline operators. NO[subscript]x formation is primarily a function of in-cylinder combustion temperatures. A challenge for engine researchers is to identify methods to lower combustion temperatures while maintaining complete combustion. Blending hydrogen into an engine's fuel can lower in-cylinder combustion temperatures and reduce pollutant emissions. Hydrogen has a wider flammability range in comparison to natural gas, which allows for leaner engine operation and lower combustion temperatures. Specifically, the very high molecular diffusivity of hydrogen creates a more uniform mixture of fuel and air. Hydrogen also has very low ignition energy, which translates into easier combustion. This paper presents test results of using hydrogen as a fuel additive for a large bore, two stroke cycle, single cylinder, natural gas fueled Ajax engine in a test laboratory. The engine was first operated at the test point on pure natural gas and allowed to stabilize. Then a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas at various molar percentages was introduced. The engine was operated entirely on the blended fuel without a <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> first. Next, a <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> was installed and the blended fuel was supplied to it while the main combustion chamber operated on pure natural gas. Engine and emissions data were recorded and physical observations were also noted, such as engine misfires. Results showed that the addition of hydrogen into the fuel gas {{without the use of}} a <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> reduced emissions. The addition of the <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> reduced NO[subscript]x emissions without the use of hydrogen. For both configurations, the engine ran smoother with no noticeable increase in misfires or detonation. The pollutant emission reduction and engine combustion stability suggest that hydrogen as a fuel additive would be a good method to meet emissions requirements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} thermo-acoustic effects in a gas turbine combustor. A quarter-wavelength burner with rectangular cross-section has been built and studied from an experimental and theoretical perspective. It has a premixed methane-air flame, which is held by a bluff body, and spans {{the width of the}} burner. The flame is compact, i. e. its length is much smaller than that of the burner. The fundamental mode of the burner is unstable; its frequency and pressure distribution have been measured. The complex pressure reflection coefficients at the upstream and downstream end of the burner were also measured. For the theoretical considerations, we divide the burner into three regions (the cold <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> the flame region and the hot outlet region), and assume one-dimensional acoustic wave propagation in each region. The acoustic pressure and velocity are assumed continuous across the interface between the precombustion chamber and flame region, and across the interface between the flame region and outlet region. The burner ends are modelled by the measured pressure reflection coefficients. The mean temperature is assumed to have the following profile: uniformly cold and uniformly hot in the <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and outlet region, respectively, and rising continuously from cold to hot in the flame region. For comparison, a discontinuous temperature profile, jumping directly from cold to hot, is also considered. The eigenfrequencies are calculated, and the pressure distribution of the fundamental mode is predicted. There is excellent agreement with the experimental results. The exact profile of the mean temperature in the flame region is found to be unimportant. This study gives us an experimentally validated Green's function, which is a very useful tool for further theoretical studies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation performed upon a single-ended self-recuperative radiant tube burner fuelled by natural gas in the non-premixed mode, which is used in the steel industry for surface treatment. The main goal of the research activity was a systematic investigation of the burner aimed to find the best operating conditions in terms of optimum equivalence ratio, thermal power and lower pollutant emissions. The analysis, which focused on the main parameters influencing the thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at the exhaust (NOx and CO), has been carried out for different operating conditions of the burner: input thermal powers from 12. 8 up to 18 kW and equivalence ratio from 0. 5 (very lean flame) to 0. 95 (quasi-stoichiometric condition). To significantly reduce pollutant emissions ensuring {{at the same time the}} thermal requirements of the heating process, it has been developed a new burner configuration, in which a fraction of the exhaust gases recirculates in the main combustion region through a variable gap between the burner efflux and the inner flame tube. This internal recirculation mechanism (exhaust gases recirculation, EGR) has been favoured through the addition of a <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> terminated by a converging nozzle acting as a mixing/ejector to promote exhaust gas entrainment into the flame tube.

40|$|Quantitative {{methods for}} characterizing both {{variability}} and uncertainty {{are applied to}} case studies of emission factors for stationary natural gas-fueled internal combustion engines. NOx and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) emission data sets for lean burn engines were analyzed. Data were available for uncontrolled engines and for engines with <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> (PCC) and "clean burn " NOx control approaches. For each data set, parametric probability distributions were fit to the data using maximum likelihood estimation to represent inter-engine variability in emissions. Bootstrap simulation methods were used to quantify uncertainty in the fitted distribution and uncertainty in the mean emission factor. Some methodological challenges were encountered in analyzing the data. For example, in one instance, only five data points were available, with each data point representing a different market share. Therefore, an approach was developed in which a parametric distribution was fitted to population-weighted data. The range of uncertainty in mean emission factors ranges from approximately plus or minus 10 percent {{to as much as}} minus 60 percent to plus 80 percent, depending on the pollutant, control technology, and nature of the available data. The wide range of uncertainty in some emission factors emphasizes the importance of recognizing an accounting for uncertainty in emissions estimates. The skewness in some uncertainty estimates illustrates the importance of using a numerical simulation approach that does not impose restrictive symmetry assumptions on the confidence interval for the mean.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the development {{work of the}} 10 kN hybrid rocket motor DHX- 200 Aurora. The DHX- 200 Aurora was developed by Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering (DARE) to power the Stratos II and Stratos II+ sounding rocket, with the later one being launched in October 2015. Stratos II and Stratos II+ are the flagship projects of DARE, a student group working on rocketry at Delft University of Technology. Successors of Stratos II have the eventual goal of reaching space. During the development process two major revisions of the motor have been designed with smaller changes between tests. The second major design revision was made after a first test series showed low combustion efficiency, through the usage of a CFD model to improve mixing. Both revisions have been tested statically in total for 14 times both at facilities of ’Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek’ (TNO) and ’Deutsches Zentrum f ¨ ur Luft- und Raumfahrt’ (DLR). All tests were conducted in a full-scale, flight-ready configuration with {{the primary goal of}} demonstrating the required performance for the Stratos II and Stratos II+ sounding rocket. It was found out that the motor suffered from combustion instabilities at around 450 Hz, when operated at its design oxidizer mass flux level of 600 kg=m 2 =s, that caused low combustion efficiency and elevated heat flux levels in the <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> Through design changes the instabilities could be lowered and both problems removed. The design goal of total impulse could not be met, but the specific impulse measured was higher than expected. Still, the overall performance proofed to be sufficient enough for the system to be used as the propulsion system for Stratos II+. Space Systems Egineerin...|$|E

In order to improve understanding of diesel soot oxidation, an experimental rig was designed and set up, in which the soot oxidation conditions, such as temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and CO 2 partial pressure, could be varied independently of each other. The oxidizing gas flow in the oxidizer was under laminar condition. This test rig comprised a naturally-aspirated single cylinder engine which acted as the soot generator, and a separate premixed oxidation burner system in which soot extracted from the engine was oxidized under controlled conditions. Diesel soot was extracted from the engine exhaust pipe and from the engine <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the soot-laden gas was then conveyed to the burner where it was oxidized. The burner was positioned vertically {{and it had a}} flat flame whose thickness was only a few millimetres. The hot gases from the flame flew upwards through a quartz transparent tube which acted as the soot oxidation duct. The soot-laden gas from the engine was premixed with the feedgas (itself a premixed mixture of methane, air, oxygen, and nitrogen) to the burner. The soot particles passed vertically through the flame front and continued burning in the post-flame gas flowing through the quartz tube oxidation duct. The oxygen concentration and temperature of the post-flame soot oxidation gas were controllable by adjusting the flowrate and composition of the burner feedgas. Diesel soot particles were sampled at different heights along the centreline of the quartz tube above the burner. Profiles of oxygen concentration, temperature, and soot particle velocity in the oxidation zone were thus measured. Morphology and size distributions of the sampled diesel soot particles were analyzed by means of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and a computer software called ImagePro Plus. Subsequently, the specific surface oxidation rates of the soot particles were worked out based on soot particle size distributions. The TEM micrographs obtained in this study showed that the diesel soot agglomerates existed in forms of clusters and chains, each containing between a small number and thousands of individual, mostly spherical tiny particles.

40|$|This {{quarterly}} report re-evaluates current market objectives in the {{exploration and production}} industry, discusses continuing progress in testing that evaluates emission control technologies applied to a two-stroke cycle natural gas-fueled engine, and presents a scheme for enacting remote monitoring and control of engines during upcoming field tests. The examination of current market objectives takes into account technological developments and changing expectations for environmental permitting which may have occurred over the last year. This demonstrates that the continuing work in controlled testing and toward field testing is on track Market pressures currently affecting the gas exploration and production industry are shown to include a push for increased production, {{as well as an}} increasing cost for environmental compliance. This cost includes the direct cost of adding control technologies to field engines as well as the indirect cost of difficulty obtaining permits. Environmental regulations continue to require lower emissions targets, and some groups of engines which had not previously been regulated will be required to obtain permits in the future. While the focus remains on NOx and CO, some permits require reporting of additional emissions chemicals. Continuing work in controlled testing uses a one cylinder Ajax DP- 115 (a 13. 25 in bore x 16 in stroke, 360 rpm engine) to assess a sequential analysis and evaluation of a series of engine upgrades. As with most of the engines used in the natural gas industry, the Ajax engine is a mature engine with widespread usage throughout the gas gathering industry. The end point is an assessment of these technologies that assigns a cost per unit reduction in NOx emissions. Technologies including one <b>pre-combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> in-cylinder sensors, the means to adjust the air-to-fuel ratio, and modification of the air filter housing have been evaluated in previous reports. Current work focuses on final preparations for testing pre-combustion chambers with different characteristics and using mid-to-high-pressure fuel valves. By using the Ajax DP- 115 these tests are completed in a low-cost and efficient manner. The various technologies can be quickly exchanged with different hardware, and it is inexpensive to run the engine. Progress in moving toward field testing is discussed, and a sketch of the first planned field test is presented. While early field tests will be completed using 4 -stroke cycle rich-burn engines, later tests will be conducted on 2 - and 4 -stroke cycle lean-burn engines. The advantages of beginning with the rich-burn engine are summarized...|$|E
