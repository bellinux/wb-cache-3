Images are uploaded to the Autodesk server for processing which normally takes a few minutes. The program uses photogrammetric techniques to measure distances between objects yielding a 3 D model; i.e., image processing is performed by stitching a <b>plain</b> <b>seam</b> with correct sides together. However, the software may ask the user to select common points on the seam that could not be determined automatically [24, 25].|$|E
