40|$|Advertising phrases of women's {{magazines}} adopt various {{methods to}} achieve an effective communication with readers. Japanese advertising phrases show a tendency of providing readers firstly with background reasons of why they need a product and secondly with what kind of effects they can get if they buy it, trying to avoid to look too pushy. Korean advertising phrases show a tendency of making readers pay attentions on a product by providing product features directly. We can say in communication with readers, Japanese advertising <b>phrases</b> <b>are</b> receiver-oriented, while Korean advertising <b>phrases</b> <b>are</b> sender-oriented. In other words, Japanese advertising <b>phrases</b> <b>are</b> relationship-oriented, while Korean advertising <b>phrases</b> <b>are</b> product-oriented...|$|R
50|$|The <b>phrase</b> <b>was</b> first {{identified}} in print by the OED in the 1980s. Anecdotal evidence exists for earlier usage; the <b>phrase</b> <b>was</b> also {{used as the}} name for some fish and chip shops in Manchester during the same period.|$|R

5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the <b>phrase</b> <b>is</b> not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question {{whether it was}} ever used as a customary salute. It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E
5|$|Lance Henriksen was {{concerned}} {{that it would be}} out of character for Frank Black to recklessly take untested drugs, and suggested adding a line of dialogue—"I don't even take aspirin"—to the script to help clue the audience in to the fact that his involvement in the clinical trial was an attempt to aid his daughter. The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget". The <b>phrase</b> <b>is</b> found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E

50|$|Although the Romans {{first came}} to Britain in 55BC, Roman Law has had {{negligible}} influence on English common law. Latin <b>phrases</b> <b>are</b> used in English only because latin was the lingua franca of the medieval period. Although in legal circles some <b>phrases</b> <b>are</b> in common use, (such as res ipsa loquitur, novus actus interveniens, talem qualem, de minimis non curat lex, & consensus ad idem) the common law does not rely on civil law principles, {{and the use of}} Latinisms is declining while vernacular <b>phrases</b> <b>are</b> increasing.|$|R
5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active <b>phrase</b> <b>is</b> either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the <b>phrase</b> <b>is</b> found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the <b>phrase</b> <b>is</b> the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

40|$|Six {{experiments}} {{examined the}} connections in memory between two stories describing the same action sequence. The action sequences represented script-like MOP {{structures such as}} eating at a restaurant, like those proposed by Schank (1982. Dynamic memory: A theory of reminding and learning in computers and people. New York: Cambridge University Press). In the experimental procedure, subjects read {{a long list of}} stories, and then, after reading all the stories, they were presented with a list of phrases for which they were required to make old/new recognition judgments. Connections among the stories in memory were examined with pairs of phrases placed in the test list such that a priming phrase immediately preceded a target phrase. When a priming <b>phrase</b> <b>was</b> from the same story as its target phrase, responses to the target were facilitated. When a priming <b>phrase</b> <b>was</b> from another story of the same MOP as the target, responses were facilitated only if the test <b>phrases</b> <b>were</b> related to the MOP; there was no significant facilitation if the test <b>phrases</b> <b>were</b> not related to the MOP. In the case where the <b>phrases</b> <b>were</b> related to the MOP, there was as much facilitation when the <b>phrases</b> <b>were</b> from different stories as when they were from the same story. These results are shown to contradict previously proposed models of memory for script-like sequences, and a new, limited encoding, model is proposed...|$|R
