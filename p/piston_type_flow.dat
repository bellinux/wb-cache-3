In this paper, flow structures of the turbine stator blade with six hole-rows at different blowing ratio (M= 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5) and setting angles (β= 40 °, 50 °, 60 °, 70 °, 80 ° and 90 °) was measured by PIV in <b>piston</b> <b>flow</b> <b>type</b> of low-speed wind tunnel laboratory. Velocity was analyzed. Results show that: velocity gradient of suction side was much higher than pressure side and increased with setting angle reduction; Adherence of film is influenced by setting angle and blowing ratio, when M= 1. 0 and β= 70 ° anchorage dependent is best and suction side is greater than pressure side...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} isotope oxygen- 18 {{and natural}} water chemistry {{were used to}} identify both the percent individual source component and mechanisms responsible for generating summer surface storm runoff in a small Precambrian Shield catchment. In addition, variations in radon gas (Rn- 222) concentration in both surface and groundwaters were monitored {{in order to gain}} additional information not obtainable through use of the above stated tracers. Results indicate that the percent component contribution and the mechanism(s) responsible for stormflow generation within the study basin are largely dependent upon antecedent basin conditions and physical storm characteristics. Generally speaking, shortly after initiation of precipitation under any given antecedent condition a <b>piston</b> <b>flow</b> <b>type</b> mechanism operates delivering pre-event water (primarily phreatic zone water) to the stream channel. Rapid throughflow of water occurs during intense precipitation events as well as during wet antecedent conditions. The composition of throughflow is largely composed of event water. Under wet antecedent conditions throughflow is generally a mixture of event and pre-event waters. In this case pre-event water is primarily vadose zone water...|$|R

As the results, the leakage depended on correlation among density, viscosity, clearance area by the low temperature.

Among the proposed <b>piston</b> shapes, D <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> shape had the most air-tightness.

40|$|Abstract. The water {{hydraulic}} reciprocating {{plunger pump}} driven by linear motor is suitable to deep sea application with high efficiency and variable control. Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed. And the control method and the performance were analyzed by simulation based on the AMESim model. The {{results show that the}} pressure and <b>flow</b> pulsation of <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump are much smaller than the valve type, even though the <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a valve distribution tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear motor reciprocating plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, and the flow pulsation rate is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007. These results contribute to the research on deep-sea water hydraulic power pack and direct drive pump with high efficiency and energy conservation...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. <b>Piston</b> <b>type</b> pumps are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this type of pump due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump. The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different types of pumps. From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and <b>flow</b> of a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump by measuring the pulsation effect.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm <b>type</b> or the <b>piston</b> <b>type.</b> Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|R
