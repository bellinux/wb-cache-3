INTRODUCTION As is well known (Davison, 1957; Gelbard, 1968), the spherical-harmonics (PN) method for solving transport problems cannot accommodate boundary conditions exactly, and so this aspect of the method has become a subject of research interest in transport theory. In the 40 's, Marshak (1947) and Mark (1945) developed the boundary conditions that carry their names and that are still widely used (Garcia [...] ...|$|E

I. INTRODUCTION Recently, 1 during a study that compared different types of <b>PN</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions for a few basic transport problems, we found numerical evidence that the PN method with boundary conditions of the Mark type yields, in any order, the exact scalar flux at the boundary of an isotropically scattering half-space subject to an isotropic incident distribution. Since we {{are not aware of}} any previous mention of this result, we report here a proof that confirms our numerical observations. II. THE PROOF We start with the transport equation, for x ? 0 and Γ 1 ¯ 1, ¯ @ @x Ψ(x; ¯) + Ψ(x; ¯) = c 2 Z 1 Γ 1 Ψ(x; ¯ 0) d¯ 0 (1) and the boundary conditions, for ¯ ? 0, Ψ(0; ¯) = 1 (2 a) and lim x! 1 Ψ(x [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the interpretation of}} the deep seismic structure from the wide-angle reflection/refraction Caledonian Suture Seismic experiment which extends from the Mid North Sea High across Northern England, the Irish Sea to southwest Ireland. A new method of displaying the large number of travel times in the form of contoured composite plots for a particular phase has been developed. The interpretation methods used include analysis of the wide-angle reflection travel times, time-term analysis, gravity modelling, and, ray tracing and synthetic seismogram modelling. A mid-crustal gradient which returns PcP occurs between depths of 15. 0 - 18. 5 km beneath the line and is overlain by an upper crust with an average velocity of 6. 16 - 6. 20 km/s excluding sediments. This mid-crustal gradient was not recognised previously in the Irish Sea. A lower-crustal boundary recognised from the PmP phase occurs at 25. 0 km depth beneath the Irish Sea and at 30 km beneath the North Sea. The average crustal velocity is 6. 49 - 6. 54 km/s excluding sediments and for the lower crust is 6. 75 - 6. 77 km/s. The sub-Moho Pn velocity is estimated to be 8. 19 km/s beneath the Irish Sea, 8. 32 km/s beneath Northern England and 8. 02 km/s beneath the North Sea. The PmP and <b>Pn</b> <b>boundaries</b> diverge beneath the Irish Sea and define a transitional Moho over a 5 km depth range with an average velocity of 7. 8 - 7. 9 km/s. The PcP and <b>Pn</b> <b>boundaries</b> correspond approximately with the top and base respectively of the reflective deep crust observed beneath the Irish Sea on BIRPS WINCH. The transitional Moho beneath the Irish Sea has a reflective character similar to the lower crust. The coincident PmP and <b>Pn</b> <b>boundaries</b> beneath the North Sea define an abrupt increase in velocity from 6. 75 to 8. 0 km/s which approximately corresponds to the prominent reflections beneath the non reflective lower crust observed on the BIRPS NEC line at 10. 5 to 11. 0 s. The upper crust of velocity 6. 15 - 6. 20 km/s appears to lie below the suture beneath Northern England and the North Sea along the line but may also occur above it further west. The lower crust and deeper structures lie below the suture and represent crust of the Southern Caledonides. The anomalous structure of the Moho and upper mantle beneath the Irish Sea found from CSSP and BIRPS {{may be related to the}} post-Caledonian formation of the Irish Sea basins. The reflective lower crust and transitional Moho may result from crustal thinning produced by ductile stretching...|$|R

40|$|Electrostatic {{confinement}} {{of charge}} carriers in graphene {{is governed by}} Klein tunneling, a relativistic quantum process in which particle-hole transmutation leads to unusual anisotropic transmission at <b>pn</b> junction <b>boundaries.</b> Reflection and transmission at these novel potential barriers should affect the quantum interference of electronic wavefunctions near these boundaries. Here we report the use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to map the electronic structure of Dirac fermions confined by circular graphene pn junctions. These effective quantum dots were fabricated using a new technique involving local manipulation of defect charge within the insulating substrate beneath a graphene monolayer. Inside such graphene quantum dots we observe energy levels corresponding to quasi-bound states and we spatially visualize the quantum interference patterns of confined electrons. Dirac fermions outside these quantum dots exhibit Friedel oscillation-like behavior. Bolstered with a theoretical model describing relativistic particles in a harmonic oscillator potential, our findings yield new insight into the spatial behavior of electrostatically confined Dirac fermions.

Acoustic modal and transient analyses of the FE models are performed in frequency and time domains. The frequency response functions and time responses are calculated in the nodes near the lips and nostrils. Both FE models involve the effect of cleft palate. The numerical results are compared with acoustic measurements. 1. Finite element {{models of the}} vocal tract The FE models were created from MRI images using a direct transformation of MRI data into FE models. The FE model relevant to the nasal cavities {{was added to the}} models of vocal tract manually according to the anatomical literature. Both models involve effect of clefting of the soft palate for various the cleft sizes. Material properties: speed of sound c 0 = 353 m/s, air density ρ 0 = 1. 2 kg/m 3. Boundary conditions: zero acoustic pressure at the lips and nostrils, boundary areas of acoustic spaces acoustically hard and the absorption was modelled by the coefficient β = r/ρ 0 c. Figure 3 : Excitation pulses according to Titze et al [1]. A connection of the nasal and oral cavities was considered in the back area of the soft palate modelling the velofaryngeal insufficiency.
