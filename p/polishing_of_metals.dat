50|$|Chalk may be {{used for}} its {{properties}} as a base. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. The most common forms are CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing. For example, toothpaste commonly contains small amounts of chalk, which serves as a mild abrasive. Polishing chalk is chalk prepared with a carefully controlled grain size, for very fine <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals.</b> Chalk can also be used as fingerprint powder.|$|E
40|$|<b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> by {{remelting}} with {{laser radiation}} {{is a method}} for automated polishing of 3 D surfaces. A thin surface layer is molten and the surface tension leads to a material flow from the peaks to the valleys. The achievable polishing quality depends on the material and its quality. Results for polishing of titanium- and nickel-based alloys with cw laser radiation are represented in this paper. Starting from a roughness of Ra= 1 µm a Ra value of 0. 16 µm is achieved in 7 s/cm 2 for Ti 6 Al 4 V and a Ra value of 0. 11 µm is achieved in 10 s/cm 2 for Inconel 718...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{electrolytic}} Polishing (PeP) is a non-conventional {{technology for}} the surface treatment of electrically conductive materials. It is an effective machining technique for cleaning and <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> and considered as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the electropolishing process. The electropolishing process uses aggressive media such as acids, whereas in PeP, acids or toxicants are replaced by low concentrated water solutions of various salts. In PeP, high DC voltage {{is applied to the}} electrodes in the aqueous electrolyte solution, which establishes a thin steam-gas layer around the surface of the work piece resulting in the generation of plasma. From the previous research, it is found that the formation of stable plasma generally takes place between 180 - 370 volts, where it results in better surface conditions. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the behaviour of current according to different voltages and their effects on surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR) of stainless steel in Plasma electrolytic Polishing process...|$|E

50|$|McDonald took {{a couple}} of years to {{research}} the contents and improve the technology to rework the formula and return in 2006 with the modern day <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal.</b> Now centering purely on the life and times <b>of</b> Heavy <b>Metal,</b> <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> managed to impress both the industry and music fans alike. Except for the graphic arts, music & video conversions, the entire <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> project was written and conceived by Derek McDonald. The elements that made Recorded History a true interactive multimedia experience were still there but they were augmented with the glitz of entertainment. This time featuring some 19 music videos, 5 and a half hours of music in both MP3 and standard audio format allowing the disc promotion on radio, some 5000 pages of PDF & HTML encoded text, Internet links and 1304 artist biographies with some 900 album reviews. The cover art was updated to feature a new rendition of long-time mascot Skel (Skel has appeared on the cover of all of McDonald’s projects) and was drawn by Barry Waddell of Florida, USA act Seasons Of The Wolf.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> would be printed book format but no publisher showed {{interest in what}} would be a specialty textbook on this form of music, and the cost of self-publishing proved to be prohibitive, so the project was set aside.|$|R
50|$|During 1995 {{computer}} programmer and heavy music enthusiast Derek McDonald began {{research on the}} origins <b>of</b> Heavy <b>Metal</b> Music as a personal project. Seeing that his McBBS project was winding down he needed a new project to pass his time. The original text that would eventually evolve into <b>Polishing</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Metal,</b> as it later became known, was a set of articles published in an obscure Gothic underground pulp publication named Legends Magazine released by Marcus Pan and his Inferno Publishing in Linden, New Jersey, United States in 1997 from February to December of that year. Pan agreed to release the early text {{as a form of}} gathering ratings from its readership. These articles went largely unseen in the larger society but remained popular amongst the magazine readers; the core content of those articles would become the central nucleus for <b>Polishing</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Metal.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{sometime}} {{the official}} history of McBBS was {{available at the}} Emperor Multimedia website. Emperor Multimedia has since moved on {{to invest in the}} entertainment industry, specializing in Multimedia, with assets in internet applications, e-books, databases and web design. McDonald (with Emperor Multimedia) later releases <b>of</b> <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal,</b> and the Diskery music distribution firm, would once again see him and his company with commercial success.|$|R
5000|$|As {{an added}} feature the disc {{also had an}} {{extensive}} interactive help database/user manual programmed onto it, {{as well as a}} dictionary of industry and Heavy Metal cultural terminology called the [...] "Metalopedia". Each genuine copy <b>of</b> <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> was custom engraved with the text: EMPEROR MULTIMEDIA POLISHING <b>OF</b> <b>METAL</b> CD-ROM ERC4-EB etched into the reflection hub band of the CDs.

50|$|The legacy <b>of</b> <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> {{was not so}} {{much the}} story of its author, its technology, or any artist {{featured}} on it, but the statement it made to the recording industry. During {{the early part of the}} 21st century recording companies were suffering financial blows due to the encroachment of the computer industry and the wide availability of the Internet allowing consumers to download audio tracks or wholesale copy music in digital format anywhere on Earth. Indeed, many computer companies such as Apple Inc. with their successful iPod product quietly but indirectly encouraged this behavior to boost their profits. The cost of distribution of the now 25-year-old Compact Disc technology was becoming prohibitive.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> was cleverly {{engineered}} {{as there}} was a large amount of [...] "hidden technology" [...] behind the operation of it. This technology was featured from the start where a special program was on the disc that allowed the CD-ROM to bootstrap all the needed applications at start-up instead of the single application start provided by Windows; the application could also detect and stop disc execution if the needed support software was not in the computer. Although the data on the disc can be viewed on several OS platforms, this special autostart program only worked on Windows. Other OSes must start the disc manually; instructions were provided. This limitation was later overcome.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video for}} the band Penetrator {{featured}} on the CD is the only video ever made for this band. The video was only ever published on <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> and was never seen anywhere else, although the intention was for mass distribution. This video is the only live-action ever seen of Derek McDonald for he appears {{on one of his}} own projects for the first time. He is the leather-clad biker on the left when he and band singer (and personal friend) Maxel Black encounter the seductive lady in the alleyway; another scene featuring him in Gothic attire was cut from the final copy. The video was filmed at the Gladstone Hotel (Toronto), a location suggested by McDonald.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of study <b>of</b> the {{electrolytic}} <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> pieces, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Utilization of ultrasonically irradiated electrolytes in the electrolytic <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> copper and steel pieces leads to enhanced polishing quality. (2) Polishing time for the reference pieces was {{twice as long as}} for the test pieces. (3) The chemical attack exerted {{on the surface of the}} test pieces in order to get the structure <b>of</b> the respective <b>metal</b> lasted less than half as long and yielded superior qualitative results in the copper as well as in the OT 60 - 2 steel test pieces polished with ultrasonically irradiated electrolytes. (4) The utilization <b>of</b> higher <b>polishing</b> current densities can be explained by the fact that the cavitational effect that arises in the electrolyte owing to ultrasounds contributes to an increase in the solution's electrical conductivity and elimination of gases from the electrolyte...|$|R
40|$|An iron-poor {{stream of}} nearly neutral pH {{polluted}} by mine tailings {{has been investigated}} for a natural phenomenon responsible for the <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>metals</b> in mine wastewaters. A white mineralized mat, which {{was determined to be}} hydrozincite [Zn 5 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 6] by X-ray diffraction analysis, was observed in the stream sediments mainly in spring. The precipitate shows a total organic matter residue of 10 % dry weight and contains high concentrations of Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, and other metals. Scanning electron microscopy analysis suggests that hydrozincite is mainly of biological origin. Dormant photosynthetic microorganisms have been retrieved from 1 -year-old dry hydrozincite. The autofluorescent microorganisms were imaged by a scanning confocal laser microscope. A photosynthetic filamentous bacterium, classified as Scytonema sp. strain ING- 1, was found associated with microalga Chlorella sp. strain SA 1. This microbial community is responsible for the natural <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>metals</b> in the water stream by coprecipitation with hydrozincite...|$|R

50|$|After {{working on}} several private CD {{production}} contracts and software development, McDonald would resurrect the <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> documents. The cost of CD production was plummeting and his {{access to the}} artists and technology now made it affordable to create complex multimedia projects for CD distribution. His first attempt at {{this was in the}} form of Recorded History, released December 31, 2002. In an attempt to attract a wider audience the disc centered more on the history of Rock Music in general, with the discussions on Heavy Metal maintaining {{a significant part of the}} over-all project. The multimedia presentation featured PDF encoded text, with 500 artist biographies, 900 album reviews and some 100 photographs. It featured a single music video by Robert Jackson and 14 audio tracks in MP3 format. Although the disc was a true multimedia production it lacked what the consumers were looking for and it fell short of popular demand.|$|R
5000|$|A finer or softer {{abrasive}} {{will tend}} to leave much finer scratch marks which may even be invisible {{to the naked eye}} (a [...] "grainless finish"); a softer abrasive may not even significantly abrade a certain object. A softer or finer abrasive will take longer to cut as tends to cut less deeply than a coarser, harder material. Also, the softer abrasive may become less effective more quickly as the abrasive is itself abraded. This allows fine abrasives {{to be used in the}} <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> and lenses where the series of increasingly fine scratches tends to take on a much more shiny or reflective appearance or greater transparency. Very fine abrasives may be used to coat the strop for a cut-throat razors, however, the purpose of stropping is not to abrade material but to straighten the burr on an edge. The final stage of sharpening Japanese swords is called polishing and may be a form of superfinishing.|$|R

50|$|For all <b>of</b> its advancements, <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> {{suffered}} a major handicap: It was expensive to produce. Completed during {{a sort of}} economic boom to its publishing company, Emperor Multimedia, by 2013 the tide had changed. Money was not as {{easy to come by}} and the market for Compact Discs was faltering. Unable to gain financing for a follow-up, the project was terminated. Emperor Multimedia Corporation ended all compact disc manufacture and production shortly after. On March 17, 2013 the last shipment of CDs were shipped for commercial sale, the remaining inventory was given to charity. The date was carefully chosen as it coincided with the release date of the firm's first production, The Alliance of March 17, 1999. McDonald purchased all rights to the intellectual properties held by Emperor Multimedia to that date so he could continue production in the digital realm on a potential future website called 'The Diskery Music Archives' {{to take the place of}} the his defunct music on-line retail shop The Diskery and the RRCA Music Archives.|$|R
5000|$|McDonald’s {{approach}} {{was a simple}} one, [...] "if you can’t beat them then join them. Use that same technology to impress the customer enough they will want to buy the compact disc", as he once said in a famous radio interview. He used the music to sell his technology and not the reverse that tended to be normal operation, and to keep costs low he distributed the disc exclusively via his own company and restricted sales only to on-line (internet) retailers. This approach may have slowed the sales of the project, but it allowed a more profitable distribution and manufacturing model. <b>Polishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> was, for its time, the most advanced E-book ever made and the first on this subject matter. It showcased many unknown acts while demonstrating {{some of the latest}} techniques in publishing and multimedia technology.
