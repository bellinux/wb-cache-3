40|$|The {{transplantation}} of <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduits combining {{bone marrow}} mesenchymal stem cells and extracellular matrix gel for the repair of sciatic nerve injury {{is effective in}} some respects, but few data comparing the biomechanical factors related to the sciatic nerve are available. In the present study, rabbit models of 10 -mm sciatic nerve defects were prepared. The rabbit models were repaired with autologous nerve, a <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, or a <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel. After 24 weeks, mechanical testing was performed to determine the stress relaxation and creep parameters. Following sciatic nerve injury, the magnitudes of the stress decrease and strain increase at 7, 200 seconds were largest in the <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel group, followed by the <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells group, and then the autologous nerve group. Hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrated that compared with the <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells group and the autologous nerve group, a more complete sciatic nerve regeneration was found, including good myelination, regularly arranged nerve fibers, and a completely degraded and resorbed conduit, in the <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel group. These results indicate that bridging 10 -mm sciatic nerve defects with a <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel construct increases the stress relaxation under a constant strain, reducing anastomotic tension. Large elongations under a constant physiological load can limit the anastomotic opening and shift, which is beneficial for the regeneration and functional reconstruction of sciatic nerve. Better regeneration was found with the <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel grafts than with the <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells grafts and the autologous nerve grafts...|$|E
30|$|To {{overcome}} these obstacles, considerable {{attention has been}} given to synthetic nerve conduits as an alternative to autographs. Synthetic nerve conduits are easily fabricated and show good reproducibility in structure specifications [5]. A variety of synthetic nerve conduits have been developed using different biomaterials such as polyamides [6], polyethylene terephthalate [7], poly(L-lactide) [8, 9], poly(ε-caprolactone) [10 – 12], <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid)</b> [13 – 15], and collagen [16, 17]. Blending of polymers has also been used to produce different types of conduits including simple hollow tubes [18], tubes with longitudinally aligned nanofibers along the interior lumen wall, and tubes with sheets of aligned nanofibers. Recently, more sophisticated conduits containing intraluminal microchannels of aligned nanofibers have shown promising results [19]. These aligned nanofibers and microchannels increase the surface area for which cells may interact with the conduit. However, these polymers rely solely on topographical cues to guide axonal growth and cell migration. It is likely that incorporating biochemical cues into these nerve conduits will further induce cell attachment and spreading, accelerating axonal extension during nerve regeneration [20 – 25].|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe major {{problems}} {{in the development of}} tracheal prosthesis are anastomotic dehiscence and stenosis, caused by poor epithelialization of the prosthetic graft. We developed a novel tracheal prosthesis with viable mucosa transplanted from the oral cavity and reported excellent long-term results after thoracic tracheal replacements in dogs. In the current study, we used tissue-engineering techniques to construct a mucosal prosthetic lining from skin cells and evaluated its usefulness in tracheal replacement. MethodsAbdominal skin patches (5 × 10 cm) were harvested from 10 adult mongrel dogs. The epithelial cells were separated, cultured in vitro for 4 weeks, and then seeded onto a porous <b>polylactic</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> scaffold (6 × 8 cm) to construct a lining mucosa. This was then mounted onto the prosthesis framework, made with polypropylene mesh reinforced with polypropylene rings. The mucosa-lined prosthesis was wrapped with the greater omentum of the same dog and placed in the peritoneal cavity for 1 week. Complete surgical resection and replacement of a thoracic tracheal segment (5 cm in length, just above the carina) was then performed using the prosthesis. ResultsThe animals regained full activity and survived with normal activity. Bronchoscopy at 1 week and at 1 and 2 months revealed no stenosis in the anastomosis. ConclusionsThis highly biocompatible tracheal prosthesis could prove useful for the reconstruction of large, circumferential tracheal defects...|$|E
30|$|A {{biomimetic}} scaffold for dentine-pulp regeneration {{should be}} a biphasic structure with a suitable medullary region for pulp regeneration and a cortical region suitable for dentine regeneration. Since the pulp area is chiefly composed of organic tissue the medullary element of such a biomimetic scaffold should be fabricated from organic materials such as gelatin, collagen, elastin, fibrin, etc. Because hydroxyapatite forms the greater percentage of dentine (Goldberg 2011), the outer cortical area of such a scaffold should be made-up of inorganic materials such as hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate (Wang et al. 2013). To improve scaffold drug delivery and mechanical properties, small amounts of synthetic materials such as <b>polylactic</b> co <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (PLGA), <b>polylactic</b> acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) may {{be incorporated into the}} medullary and cortical regions of the desired scaffold as a basic mesh (Zheng et al. 2011). In addition, due to the irregular shape of pulp canals, injectable scaffolds with small particle sizes are desirable (Nagaveni et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Prediction of <b>poly(lactic</b> co <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid)</b> (PLGA) micro- and nanoparticles' {{dissolution}} rates plays {{a significant}} role in pharmaceutical and medical industries. The prediction of PLGA dissolution rate is crucial for drug manufacturing. Therefore, a model that predicts the PLGA dissolution rate could be beneficial. PLGA dissolution is influenced by numerous factors (features), and counting the known features leads to a dataset with 300 features. This large number of features and high redundancy within the dataset makes the prediction task very difficult and inaccurate. In this study, dimensionality reduction techniques were applied in order to simplify the task and eliminate irrelevant and redundant features. A heterogeneous pool of several regression algorithms were independently tested and evaluated. In addition, several ensemble methods were tested in order to improve the accuracy of prediction. The empirical results revealed that the proposed evolutionary weighted ensemble method offered the lowest margin of error and significantly outperformed the individual algorithms and the other ensemble techniques...|$|R

It can be found at: [URL] supplementary material at [URL] for movies on cell trajectories during division on the grooves, {{as well as for}} alignment and elongation of pre-mitotic protrusions on PLGA grooves. Retraction fibers (RFs) determine orientation of the cell division axis and guide the spreading of daughter cells. Long and unidirectional RFs, which are especially apparent during mitosis of cells in three-dimensional (3 D) environments, enable improved control over cell fate, following division. However, 3 D gel environments lack the cues necessary for predetermining the orientation of RFs to direct tissue architecture. While patterning of focal adhesion regions by microcontact printing can determine orientation of the RFs through enhancing focal adhesion numbers along particular directions, the RFs remain short due to the two-dimensional culture environment. Herein, the authors demonstrate that nanoimprinted grooves of <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (PLGA) with a high aspect ratio (A. R. of 2. 0) can provide the cues necessary to control the direction of RFs, as well as enable the maintenance of long and unidirectional RFs as observed within 3 D cultures, while the same is not possible with PLGA grooves of lower A. R. (1. 0 or lower). Based on enhanced levels of contact guidance of premitotic fibroblast protrusions at high A. R. grooves and deeper levels of focal adhesion due to filopodia extensions into these grooves, it is suggested that submicron (800 [*]nm width) PLGA grooves with A. R. of 2 are capable of supporting mechanical forces from cell protrusions to a greater depth, thereby enabling the maintenance of the protrusions as long and unidirectional RFs during cell division. Given the scalability and versatility of nanoimprint techniques, the authors envision a platform for designing nanostructures to direct tissue regeneration and developmental biology...|$|R

The results from the statistical evaluation show that OC-Fe 3 O 4 and TiO 2 NPs are genotoxic in the experimental conditions used. When all NPs were included in the analysis, no differences were seen among cell lines - demonstrating the usefulness of the assay in all cells to identify genotoxic and non-genotoxic NPs.

40|$|ObjectivesCardiac {{functional}} {{deterioration in}} dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) {{is known to}} be reversed by intramyocardial up-regulation of multiple cardioprotective factors, whereas a prostacyclin analog, ONO 1301, has been shown to paracrinally activate interstitial cells to release a variety of protective factors. We here hypothesized that intramyocardial delivery of a slow-releasing form of ONO 1301 (ONO 1301 SR) might activate regional myocardium to up-regulate cardiotherapeutic factors, leading to regional and global functional recovery in DCM. Methods and ResultsONO 1301 elevated messenger RNA and protein level of hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and stromal-derived factor- 1 of normal human dermal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Intramyocardial delivery of ONO 1301 SR, which is ONO 1301 mixed with <b>polylactic</b> and <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> polymer (PLGA), but not that of PLGA only, yielded significant global functional recovery in a canine rapid pacing–induced DCM model, assessed by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization (n =  5 each). Importantly, speckle-tracking echocardiography unveiled significant regional functional recovery in the ONO 1301 -delivered territory, consistent to significantly increased vascular density, reduced interstitial collagen accumulation, attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, and reversed mitochondrial structure in the corresponding area. ConclusionsIntramyocardial delivery of ONO 1301 SR, which is a PLGA-coated slow-releasing form of ONO 1301, up-regulated multiple cardiotherapeutic factors in the injected territory, leading to region-specific reverse left ventricular remodeling and consequently a global functional recovery in a rapid-pacing–induced canine DCM model, warranting a further preclinical study to optimize this novel drug-delivery system to treat DCM...|$|R
40|$|Lipoatrophy is a {{condition}} that affects certain individuals, most commonly those who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. 1 – 3 Injectable fillers are used {{for the treatment of}} these dermal contour deformities to smooth dermal depressions formed by the loss of volume. These dermal fillers (also known as soft tissue augmentation devices) can correct contour deformities caused by lipoatrophy in patients who are human immunodeficiency virus positive or negative. The product used in this study is a patented, second-generation, injectable, dermal collagen stimulator that combines <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> used is not a polymer, but rather an acid derived from sugar cane. Its chemical structure corresponds to that of an alpha-hydroxy <b>acid.</b> <b>Glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> is a well-characterized agent that is present in a number of cosmetic products. Polylactic acid is a synthetic, biocompatible, biodegradable, inert, synthetic polymer from the poly a-hydroxy-acid family that is believed to stimulate fibroblasts to produce more collagen, thus increasing facial volume. Together, <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> and <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> act in concert to 1) stimulate collagen production and 2) hydrate the outer layers of the skin. A multicenter, clinical investigation authorized by the Mexican Secretariat of Health was conducted between September 20, 2002, and September 19, 2004. This clinical study was conducted in male patients between 32 and 60 years of age with lipoatrophy as a result of highly active antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection. The study objective was to measure the improvement of contour deformities after the injection of a dermal collagen stimulator containing <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and <b>polylactic</b> acid. In addition to safety, this dermal filler was assessed when used to correct volume deformities caused by lipoatrophy in subjects who are human immunodeficiency virus positive. Thirty male subjects participated and were treated as follows: seven in two sessions, eight in three sessions, 14 in four sessions, and one in five sessions. Each treatment session was separated by approximately 20 days as per the manufacturer's instructions. The follow-up phase consisted of four observation periods over two years from the last injection. The primary efficacy endpoint was measurement of correction of human immunodeficiency virus highly active antiretroviral therapy induced facial lipoatrophy. Using a multipoint scale of facial divergence, correction was measured as a percentage of correction (diversion correction percentage) from baseline. A secondary endpoint was safety based upon the incidence and type of adverse events experienced. All 30 patients completed the active treatment phase with 100 percent (N= 30) undergoing at least two treatments at Days 1 and 20 after entry into study. Seventy-four percent (n= 23) underwent a third treatment at Day 60, and 50 percent (n= 15) received a fourth treatment at Day 80. A single subject received a fifth treatment at Day 100. There were no serious adverse events and no adverse events noted during the study period. Histology through skin biopsy (2 mm punch) was performed on 10 subjects, and all subjects had dermal skin thickness measured with ultrasound. Histology demonstrated a foreign body reaction with multinucleated giant cells with phagocytized lactate crystals. New collagen formation was demonstrated. United States measurements of dermal skin thickness increase ranged from 0. 22 cm to 0. 37 cm. All subjects were rated for expected injection events to include erythema, edema, ecchymosis, and hematoma. This dermal collagen stimulator containing <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and <b>polylactic</b> acid represents a tangible alternative in therapeutic and aesthetic medicine. More than four years of clinical trials have demonstrated that this dermal collagen stimulator helps to improve the exterior quality of the skin while restoring lost facial volumes.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} use of nifedipine {{is limited by}} the rapidity of the onset of its action and its short biological half-life. In order to produce a form devoid of these disadvantages we made nanoparticles of nifedipine from three different polymers, poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), <b>polylactic</b> and <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (1 [*]:[*] 1) copolymers (PLAGA), and Eudragit RL/RS (Eudragit). Nifedipine in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) solution was used as a control. The average diameters of the nanoparticles ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 21 [*]μm; the encapsulation ratio was 82 % to 88 %. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the initial rapid fall in systolic arterial blood pressure following oral administration of nifedipine in PEG solution (from 193 ± 3 to 102 ± 2 [*]mmHg) was not seen following administration of the same dose in Eudragit nanoparticles (from 189 ± 2 to 156 ± 2 [*]mmHg); with PCL and PLAGA nanoparticles the initial fall in blood pressure was significantly reduced (nadirs PCL 124 ± 2 and PLAGA 113 ± 2 [*]mmHg). Ten hours following administration, blood pressure in rats administered the nifedipine/PEG preparation had returned to normal (183 ± 3 [*]mmHg) whereas that of animals given nifedipine in nanoparticles (PCL 170 ± 3, PLAGA 168 ± 2, Eudragit 160 ± 3 [*]mmHg) was still significantly reduced. All of the nanoparticle dosage forms decreased Cmax and increased Tmax and the mean residence time (MRT) values. Relative bioavailability was significantly increased with Eudragit nanoparticles compared to the nifedipine/PEG solution. There was an inverse linear correlation between the fall in blood pressure and plasma nifedipine concentration with all preparations.

40|$|Background: Functionalized {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) are one promising {{tool for}} detecting specific molecular targets and combine molecular biology and nanotechnology aiming at modern imaging. We aimed at ligand-directed delivery with a suitable target-biomarker to detect early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Promising targets are galectins (Gal), {{due to their}} strong expression in and on PDAC-cells and occurrence at early stages in cancer precursor lesions, but not in adjacent normal tissues. Results: Molecular probes (10 - 29 AA long peptides) derived from human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were selected as binding partners to galectins. Affinity constants between the synthesized t-PA peptides and Gal were determined by microscale thermophoresis. The 29 AA-long t-PA-peptide- 1 with a lactose-functionalized serine revealed the strongest binding properties to Gal- 1 which was 25 -fold higher {{in comparison with the}} native t-PA protein and showed additional strong binding to Gal- 3 and Gal- 4, both also over-expressed in PDAC. t-PA-peptide- 1 was selected as vector moiety and linked covalently onto the surface of biodegradable iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In particular, CAN-doped maghemite NPs (CAN-Mag), promising as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were selected as magnetic core and coated with different biocompatible polymers, such as chitosan (CAN-Mag-Chitosan NPs) or <b>polylactic</b> co <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (PLGA) obtaining polymeric nanoparticles (CAN-Mag@PNPs), already approved for drug delivery applications. The binding efficacy of t-PA-vectorized NPs determined by exposure to different pancreatic cell lines was up to 90 %, as assessed by flow cytometry. The in vivo targeting and imaging efficacy of the vectorized NPs were evaluated by applying murine pancreatic tumor models and assessed by 1. 5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The t-PA-vectorized NPs as well as the protease-activated NPs with outer shell decoration (CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep 1 Lac) showed clearly detectable drop of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor staining-intensity indicating a considerable uptake of the injected NPs. Post mortem NP deposition in tumors and organs was confirmed by Fe staining of histopathology tissue sections.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between the immune and nervous systems {{play an important role}} in immune and inflammatory conditions. Substance P (SP), the unidecapeptide RPKPQQFFGLM-NH 2, is known to upregulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α. We report here that 5 (Acetylamino) 4 oxo- 6 -phenyl- 2 -hexenoic acid methyl ester (AOPHA-Me) and 4 phenyl 3 butenoic acid (PBA), two anti-inflammatory compounds developed in our laboratory, reduce SP stimulated TNF-α expression in RAW 264. 7 macrophages. We also show that AOPHA Me and PBA both inhibit SP stimulated phosphorylation of JNK and p 38 MAPK. Furthermore, molecular modeling studies indicate that both AOPHA Me and PBA dock at the ATP binding site of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1) with predicted docking energies of - 7. 0 kcal/mol and 5. 9 kcal/mol, respectively; this binding overlaps with that of staurosporine, a known inhibitor of ASK 1. Taken together, these findings support the conclusion that AOPHA Me and PBA inhibition of TNF-α expression in SP-stimulated RAW 264. 7 macrophages is a consequence of the inhibition JNK and p 38 MAPK phosphorylation. We have previously shown that AOPHA-Me and PBA inhibit the amidative bioactivation of SP, which also would be expected to decrease formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is conceivable that this dual action of inhibiting amidation and MAPK phosphorylation may be of some advantage in enhancing the anti-inflammatory activity of a therapeutic molecule. We also encapsulated AOPHA-Me separately in polyketal and <b>poly(lactic</b> co <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid)</b> microparticles. The in-vitro release profiles of AOPHA-Me from these particles were characterized. We have also shown that AOPHA-Me, when encapsulated in PCADK microparticles, is an effective treatment for edema induced by adjuvant arthritis in rats.

Increasing amounts of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> led to increases in blend density, viscosity and surface tension {{as compared to the}} 90 wt% formic acid that is currently used at DWPF. These increases are small, however, and are not expected to present any difficulties in terms of processing. The effect of sulfur impurities in technical grade <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> was studied for its impact on DWPF glass quality. While the <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> specification allows for more sulfate than the current formic acid specification, the ultimate impact is expected to be on the order of 0. 03 wt% sulfur in glass. Note that lower sulfur content <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> could likely be procured at some increased cost if deemed necessary. A paper study on the effects of radiation on <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> was performed. The analysis indicates that substitution of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> for formic acid would not increase the radiolytic production rate of H{sub 2 } and cause an adverse effect in the SRAT or SME process. It has been cited that <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions that are depleted of O{sub 2 } when subjected to large radiation doses produced considerable quantities of a non-diffusive polymeric material. Considering a constant air purge is maintained in the SRAT and the solution is continuously mixed, oxygen depletion seems unlikely, however, if this polymer is formed in the SRAT solution, the rheology of the solution may be affected and pumping of the solution may be hindered. However, an irradiation test with a simulated SRAT product supernate containing <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> in an oxygen depleted atmosphere found no evidence of polymerization...|$|R

40|$|Background: Frictional dermal {{melanosis}} is aesthetically displeasing. Various modalities {{ranging from}} depigmenting agents to lasers {{have been tried}} but {{it continues to be}} a difficult problem to treat. Objective: To study and compare the efficacy of 15 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 50 % <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> in the treatment of frictional melanosis of the forearm. Materials and Methods: 40 patients of frictional melanosis of the forearm were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups A and B. Pre-peel priming was carried out with 12 % <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and sunscreen for 2 weeks. Group A was treated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA- 15 %) peel and Group B with <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (GA- 50 %) peel. Four peels were done one every 15 days. Clinical photographs were taken to assess the response. Response to therapy was evaluated by both objective and subjective methods. The patients were followed up for 3 months after the last peel to note any relapse. Results: Both TCA and <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> peels were effective in frictional melanosis. TCA showed better response compared to <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> {{at the end of the}} treatment, both by subjective and objective methods. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). No permanent side effects were seen in any of the treated patients and the improvement was sustained without any relapse at 3 months. Conclusion: Chemical peeling with both tricholoroacetic acid (15 %) and <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (50 %) is safe and effective for the treatment of frictional dermal melanosis. Tricholoroacetic acid was found to be marginally superior to <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Seventy percent <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> {{solutions}} are being commonly used as superficial chemical peeling agents. The pH of these solutions ranges from 0. 08 to 2. 75. The histologic {{effects of these}} various pH solutions on human skin have not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The histologic effects of several commercially available <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions at various pHs were examined. METHODS: Test areas of seven <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions were applied to facial skin of two patients. The skin was not prepped for a peel prior to {{the application of the}} acid. The solution was left in place for 30 minutes, then neutralized. After 48 hours, a 2 -mm punch biopsy was performed and examined histologically. RESULTS: The peeling solutions with a pH below 2 demonstrated the potential to induce crusting and necrosis, which was not seen with the partially neutralized solutions with a pH above 2. The higher concentration acids (70 %) created more tissue damage than the lower concentration (50 %) when comparing solutions with free acid. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that chemical peeling with a 70 % free <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> creates more tissue damage than a free <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> When using a 70 % <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solution, the lower pH products (below pH 2) create more necrosis than the partially neutralized products with a pH above 2. At this time {{there is no evidence that}} creating necrosis leads to a more favorable result of the peel. Therefore, the use of partially neutralized <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions seems prudent, since they have a better safety profile than low pH solutions, which contain only free glycolic aci...|$|R

40|$|<b>Glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is being}} {{evaluated}} {{as an alternative}} for formic and nitric acid in the DWPF flowsheet. Demonstration testing and modeling for this new flowsheet has shown that <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and glycolate has a potential to remain in certain streams generated during {{the production of the}} nuclear waste glass. A literature review was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> on the corrosion of the materials of construction for the DWPF facility as well as facilities downstream which may have residual <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and glycolates present. The literature data was limited to solutions containing principally <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> The reported corrosion rates and degradation characteristics have shown the following for the materials of construction.  For C 276 alloy, the primary material of construction for the CPC vessels, corrosion rates of either 2 or 20 mpy were reported up to a temperature of 93 C.  For the austenitic stainless steels, 304 L and 316 L, variable rates were reported over a range of temperatures, varying from 2 mpy up to 200 mpy (at 100 C).  For 690, G 30, Allcorr, Ultimet and Stellite alloys no data were available.  For relevant polymers where data are available, the data suggests that exposure to <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> is not detrimental. The literature data had limited application to the DWPF process since only the storage and feed vessels, pumps and piping used to handle the <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> are directly covered by the available data. These components are either 304 L or 316 L alloys for which the literature data is inconsistent (See Bullet 2 above). Corrosion rates in pure <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions also are not representative of the DWPF process streams. This stream is complex and contains aggressive species, i. e. chlorides, sulfates, mercury, as well as antifoaming agents which cumulatively have an unknown effect on the corrosion rates of the materials of construction. Therefore, testing is recommended to investigate any synergistic effects of the aggressive species and to verify the performance of materials in the key process vessels as well as downstream vessels and processes such as the evaporator where heating is occurring. The following testing would provide data for establishing the viability of these components.  Electrochemical testing - evaluate the corrosion rate and susceptibility to localized corrosion within the SRAT, SME, OGCT, Quencher and Evaporator. Testing would be conducted at operational temperatures in simulants with ranges of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid,</b> iron, chloride, sulfate, mercury, and antifoaming agents.  Hot-wall testing – evaluate the corrosion under heat transfer conditions to simulate those for heating coils and evaporator coil surfaces. Testing would be at nominal chemistries with concentration of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid,</b> chloride, sulfate and mercury at high expected concentrations. Some tests would be performed with antifoaming agents.  Melter coupon testing – evaluate the performance of alloy 690 in melter feeds containing <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> This testing would be conducted as part of the melter flammability testing.  Polymer testing – evaluate changes in polymer properties in immersion testing with DWPF simulants to provide product-specific data for service life evaluation and analyze the Hansen solubility parameters for relevant polymers in <b>glycolic</b> vs. formic <b>acid.</b> During this literature review process, the difficulties associated with measuring the liquid level in formic acid tanks were revealed. A test is recommended to resolve this issue prior to the introduction of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> into the DWPF. This testing would evaluate the feasibility of using ultrasonic inspection techniques to determine liquid level and other desirable attributes of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> in DWPF storage tanks and related equipment...|$|R
