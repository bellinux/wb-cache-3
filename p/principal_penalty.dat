40|$|This study {{examined}} the risk of re-offending of those who received an intensive correction order, relative to those who received periodic detention and suspended sentences with supervision. Method: Details of offenders’ demographic and offence characteristics, prior convictions and penalties received, and re-offences were extracted from the Re-offending Database maintained by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. Using propensity score modelling, offenders who received an ICO as a <b>principal</b> <b>penalty</b> in a NSW court between 1 October 2010 and 30 September 2012 were matched to two comparable groups of offenders who received periodic detention between 1 October 2007 and 30 September 2009 and suspended sentences with supervision between 1 October 2010 and 30 September 2012. A supplementary comparison with those who received suspended sentences with supervision included matching on Level of Service Inventory - Revised (LSI-R) assessment scores, in addition to demographic and offending characteristics. Time to first re-offence was estimated using the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard rate function and compared between groups using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: An offender on an ICO had 33 per cent less risk of re-offending than an offender on periodic detention (HR= 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval (0. 55, 0. 83), p<. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} in re-offending between those who received ICOs and supervised suspended sentences after taking into account LSI-R assessment scores. Conclusion: There is some evidence to suggest that ICOs are more effective than periodic detention in terms of re-offending rates. However, future evaluations should include more detailed offender, treatment and program participation information in order to better understand any observed differences between comparison groups...|$|E

40|$|We study a principal's {{choice to}} {{centralize}} or delegate decisions to an agent when delegation {{can be used}} to encourage the agent to communicate potential problems. We find that the principal may choose centralization either to exercise better control over the agent's actions or to provide stronger incentives. Delegation emerges in equilibrium only if the costs of effort to acquire information for both the principal and the agent are sufficiently high. We find that increases in the <b>principal's</b> <b>penalties</b> for an incorrect decision may increase the principal's expected payoff, owing to optimal organizational responses. In addition, catastrophic risk, the risk of incorrectly accepting a defective audit (or product), may be greater under centralization than under delegation. Furthermore, catastrophic risk can be increased by well-intentioned legislative efforts to decrease such risk by, for example, increasing the agent's penalties for failing to take a corrective action, because the organizational structure may change...|$|R
40|$|The modern Dutch sanctioning system {{started to}} develop as from 1886 with the {{introduction}} of the Wetboek van Strafrecht (Dutch Penal Code). With its primary focus on imprisonment and fines, this Code only included three <b>principal</b> <b>penalties.</b> However, it has undergone a statutory evolution, both in scope of potential sanctions and in objectives of criminal punishment. In the last two decades, the role of sanctioning has increasingly become a political tool used in advocating societal protection. This has resulted in the introduction of new sanctions. Next to this, efficiency has become an independent factor in the establishment of new sanction modalities. It was, among other, {{one of the main reasons}} to introduce a sanctioning power for the public prosecution and break with the traditional sentencing monopoly of the courts. The introduction of an array of alternatives to imprisonment and fines has resulted in a much diminished prison population, which is also credited in part, for the overall reduction in crime. While changes in the Dutch Penal Code can be generally regarded as a positive development, the necessity in recognizing the separation of state powers and preserving a balance in the sanctioning system must be respected...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} those found guilty of breaching an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) in NSW in 2013 and the <b>principal</b> <b>penalties</b> they received. Method: BOCSAR’s Criminal Courts database provided information regarding the demographic characteristics of, and penalties imposed on, a cohort of 3, 154 offenders found guilty in NSW in 2013 of breaching an ADVO as their principal offence. BOCSAR’s Re-offending Database provided data regarding the number of proven court appearances in the preceding five years for a cohort of 5, 023 persons with a court appearance in 2013 involving at least one proven breach ADVO. Results: Of 3, 154 persons who were found guilty of breaching an ADVO as their principal offence, most were male (87. 7 %) and entered a guilty plea (84. 6 %). About one in five (22. 5 %) received a bond without supervision (average length= 14 months) as their principal penalty; 17. 8 per cent were fined (average amount=$ 432); 15. 7 per cent received a bond with supervision (average length= 16 months) and 12. 4 per cent were given a custodial sentence (average length= 4 months). Of 5, 023 persons with a court appearance in 2013 involving at least one proven breach ADVO offence, 22. 2 per cent had no proven court appearances in the preceding five years; 53. 3 per cent of offenders {{had at least one}} prior proven violent offence (the main categories were assault and stalking); and 28. 7 per cent of offenders had at least one prior proven breach ADVO offence...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} hidden-action principal-agent model where the agent has referencedependent preferences. The loss-averse agent {{considers}} the base wage as reference point, and bonuses and/or penalties as gains and losses, respectively. When choosing optimal payments, the principal strategically sets the base wage, {{knowing that this}} determines the agent's reference point. We consider two variants of the model. In a first variant, the agent's reservation utility is not reference-dependent. We show that it is always optimal in this case for the principal to employ bonuses. In a second variant, the reservation utility is reference-dependent and the <b>principal</b> may use <b>penalties...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Ministry of Home Affairs Decree No. 23/2006 {{sets out}} {{a policy of}} full cost {{recovery}} through tariff revenues for water utilities. The decree prescribes an increasing-block water tariff with a first subsidized tariff block for a consumption of up to 10 cubic meters per household, and a break-even tariff for higher consumption. Commercial and industrial users can be charged higher tariffs with higher blocks at the full-cost tariff. However, in reality, few utilities recover their costs. According to a 2005 study by the Department of Public Works, most PDAMs faced financial problems. Only about a third increased tariffs between 1998 and 2005. One third of utilities had foreign debt, whose value in local currency increased substantially due to the devaluation of the rupeeh in the 1998 financial crisis. Many PDAMs defaulted on loans they had received from the Ministry of Finance. As of 2009 renegotiation of these loans (<b>principal,</b> interest and <b>penalties)</b> was still underway, thus cutting off the utilities from new government loans. According to the Asian Development Bank, in Jakarta the average tariff in 2001 (average of residential and commercial users) was US$ 0.29/m3, compared to production costs estimated at only US$ 0.11/m3. 98% of revenues billed were collected. According to these figures, at least the Jakarta utility managed to recover its costs. Since then tariffs have been increased several times and, according to the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities, reached US$ 0.77/m3.|$|R
40|$|Self-assembly {{and packing}} of colloids and micro or nano scale {{particles}} {{has become a}} subject of great interest due to widespread advancement of micro-scale technologies. In this thesis, several numerical analyses are performed to study the packing or self-assembly of micro or nano sized particles under dry or wet condition. Part one of the thesis is concerned with DEM simulation of micro-sized cohesive granular particles using two history dependent contact models. The simulation results are presented using porosity, coordination number, RDF and force distribution. It was observed that the particles with Gaussian distribution always have the lowest packing density while the mono-sized particles normally have the highest packing density. For cohesive particles, size distributions result in the same tendency of packing density but has much less variation with particle size. There is no significant effect of cohesion on coordination number but particle size and size distribution do influence the result. The differences in porosity, coordination number, RDF and magnitude of mean net force between the two models used are not substantial which show {{that any of the}} models can be used for simulation of particle packing. However, the Gran-Hooke-History model is found to be more efficient than the Modified Gran-Hertz-History model. In the second part self-assembly of micro-sized particles induced by evaporation is numerically investigated. The problem involves interaction between solid and fluid as well as interaction between fluids. The problem also involves phase change. A coupled CFD-DEM method is used to simulate the multiphase system. In the simulation liquid water film evaporates and leaves the particles at the container alone. Interesting patterns are seen to emerge as the liquid water film evaporates. The resulting packing structure analyzed in terms of the range of coordination number and radial distribution function also indicate the self-assembly of the particles. In the third part of the thesis low velocity SPH method developed by Seo et al., is used to simulate the cyclic packing of deformable two dimensional disks and study their packing behavior. The results obtained show that the average coordination number varies with packing fraction during jamming by conforming to the isostatic conjecture. Stress relaxation is seen to occur after several compression cycles which is marked by a decrease in coordination number and global pressure. Force distribution shows similar exponential behavior as the average force on the system is increased. The SPH method is also adapted to include the elasto-plastic behavior of materials. In future, the present work can be extended to include the contact friction of the particles. A method to achieve this is also shown by applying virtual work <b>principal</b> and <b>penalty</b> method...|$|R
40|$|Penalized {{regression}} {{methods are}} becoming increasingly popular in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identifying genetic markers associated with disease. However, standard penalized methods such as the LASSO do {{not take into account}} the possible linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers. We propose a novel penalized approach for GWAS using a dense set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The proposed method uses the minimax concave penalty (MCP) for marker selection and incorporates linkage disequilibrium (LD) information by penalizing the difference of the genetic effects at adjacent SNPs with high correlation. A coordinate descent algorithm is derived to implement the proposed method. This algorithm is efficient and stable in dealing with a large number of SNPs. A multi-split method is used to calculate the p-values of the selected SNPs for assessing their significance. We refer to the proposed penalty function as the smoothed MCP (SMCP) and the proposed approach as the SMCP method. Performance of the proposed SMCP method and its comparison with a LASSO approach are evaluated through simulation studies, which demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate in selecting associated SNPs. Its applicability to real data is illustrated using data from a GWAS on rheumatoid arthritis. Based on the idea of SMCP, we propose a new penalized method for group variable selection in GWAS with respect to the correlation between adjacent groups. The proposed method uses the group LASSO for encouraging group sparsity and a quadratic difference for adjacent group smoothing. We call it smoothed group LASSO, or SGL for short. Canonical correlations between two adjacent groups of SNPS are used as the weights in the quadratic difference <b>penalty.</b> <b>Principal</b> components are used to reduced dimensionality locally within groups. We derive a group coordinate descent algorithm for computing the solution path of the SGL. Simulation studies are used to evaluate the finite sample performance of the SGL and group LASSO. We also demonstrate its applicability on rheumatoid arthritis data...|$|R
