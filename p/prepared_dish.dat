6000|$|Meanwhile, in the {{adjoining}} room Giles was presiding in a half-unconscious state. He could not get over the initial failures in his scheme for advancing his suit, and hence {{he did not know}} that he was eating mouthfuls of bread and nothing else, and continually snuffing the two candles next him till he had reduced them to mere glimmers drowned in their own grease. Creedle now appeared with a specially <b>prepared</b> <b>dish,</b> which he served by elevating the little three-legged pot that contained it, and tilting the contents into a dish, exclaiming, simultaneously, [...] "Draw back, gentlemen and ladies, please!" ...|$|E
60|$|That men of {{the stamp}} of Goethe and Schiller should have found such a book of delicious feast, {{naturally}} makes the disparaging critic pause. In truth, we can easily see how it was. Like {{all the rest of}} Diderot's work, it breaks roughly in upon that starved formalism which had for long lain so heavily both on art and life. Its hardihood, its very license, its contempt of conventions, its presentation of common people and coarse passions and rough lives, all made it a dissolvent of the thin, dry, and frigid rules which tyrannised over the world, and interposed between the artist or the thinker and the real existence of man on the earth. When we think of what European literature was, it ceases to be wonderful that Goethe should have been unable for six whole hours to tear himself away from a book that so few men to-day, save under some compulsion, could persuade themselves to read through. On great wholesome minds the grossness left no stain, and the interest of Diderot's singularities worked as a stimulus to a happier originality in men of more disciplined endowments. And let us add, of more poetic endowments. It is the lack of poetry in Jacques that makes its irony so heavy to us. We only willingly suffer those to take us down into the depths who can also raise us on the wings of a beautiful fancy. Even Rabelais has his poetic moments, as in the picture of Cupid self-disarmed before the industrious serenity of the Muses. A single lovely image, like Sterne's figure of the recording angel, reconciles us to many a miry page. But in Jacques le Fataliste, Diderot never raises his eye for an instant to the blue æther, his ear catches no harmony of awe, of hope, nor even of a noble despair. With a kind of clumsy jubilancy he holds us fast in the ways and language of thick and clogged sense. The fatrasie of old France has its place in literature, but it can never be restored in ages when a host of moral anxieties have laid siege to men's souls. The uncommon is always welcome to the lover of art, but it must justify itself. Jacques has the quality of the uncommon; it is a curiously <b>prepared</b> <b>dish,</b> as Goethe said; but it lacks the pinch of salt and the handful of herbs with sharp diffusive flavour.|$|E

50|$|Many farms grew cabbage, {{cucumbers}}, potatoes, garlic, carrots, beans, beets, turnips, radishes, and pumpkins. In {{summer and}} autumn, {{a great deal}} of fruit were eaten fresh.

50|$|Several {{different}} types of ribs are available, depending on the section of rib cage from which they are cut. Variation in {{the thickness of the}} meat and bone, as well as levels of fat in each cut, can alter the flavor and texture of the <b>prepared</b> <b>dish.</b> The inner surface of the rib cage is covered by a layer of connective tissue (pleura) that is difficult to cook tender; it is usually removed before marinating or cooking.|$|E
50|$|Various {{commercial}} preparations {{of chicken}} and dumplings are available, including canned and frozen {{versions of the}} <b>prepared</b> <b>dish.</b> Frozen raw dumplings, typically very flat strips about 1x4 inches, can be cooked in any broth. The consistency of the <b>prepared</b> <b>dish,</b> whether homemade or purchased, varies from a thin soup to a very thick casserole-like consistency, easily eaten with a fork. Thicker preparations are made by boiling the dumplings longer and/or adding flour or another thickening agent directly to the broth. Flour tortillas or canned biscuits, rolled thin on a floured surface, cut into strips, are a quick and easy substitute for homemade dough. Butter may {{be added to the}} recipe for added richness.Since chicken meat would become dry and tough if it is boiled long enough to cook the dumplings and thicken the broth, the chicken or parts are removed from the broth before adding the dumplings. While the dumplings are cooking, the meat is separated from the bones. When the dumplings are done and the broth seasoned and thickened, the chicken is returned to the broth. The dish is then ready to be served, but may be kept on low heat so as to not further cook the chicken.|$|E
50|$|It is {{typically}} made of two interlocking pots, made {{of either the}} traditional ceramic, or metal (steel, aluminium or copper). The first, which is the larger one, holds water or soup used to produce steam. The second, the smaller pot, {{which is designed to}} be placed on top of the first, has a lid, and perforated floor, so that it holds the couscous in place while allowing the steam enter and seep through the grains. Once the couscous is steam-cooked, the lower pot may be used to simmer and complete its cooking, in order to serve the <b>prepared</b> <b>dish.</b>|$|E

50|$|Dum {{means to}} 'breathe in' and pukht to 'cook'. Dum Pukht cooking uses a round, heavy-bottomed pot, preferably a clay pot handi, in which food is tightly sealed and cooked over a slow fire. There {{are two main}} aspects to this style of cooking; bhunao and dum, or 'roasting' and 'maturing' of a <b>prepared</b> <b>dish.</b> In this style of cuisine, herbs and spices play an {{important}} role. The process of slow roasting gently persuades each to release maximum flavor. The sealing of {{the lid of the}} handi with dough achieves maturing. Cooking slowly in its juices, the food retains all its natural aromas and becomes imbued with the richness of flavors that distinguishes the dish.|$|E

40|$|South Africa {{embarked}} on mandatory vitamin and mineral fortification of wheat flour and maize meal in 2003 {{as part of}} a multi-faceted approach to alleviate malnutrition. However, it was reported, in 2008, that vitamin A deficiency increased despite the mandatory fortification programme. This motivates an investigation into the absorption of vitamin A as fortificant in the maize meal. Relative absorption, in chickens as the biological model, was determined by evaluating growth and vitamin A status. The weight, cumulative feed intake and liver retinol stores of chickens on different diets were measured over a 6 week period. The fortified white maize meal diet was able to maintain the vitamin A status of the chickens. Poor absorption of the fortificant vitamin A is therefore not a constraint in combating vitamin A deficiency. It is in therefore also important to focus on the level of fortification delivered when consumed as a traditional <b>prepared</b> <b>dish.</b> In the traditional diet, maize porridge is often consumed with only a relish. The total fat content of the traditional meal is very low, lacking absorption enhancers. National Research Foundationhtt[p://www. elsevier. com/locate/foodchemhb 201...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the dietary components which are likely to contribute to osteoporosis in postmenopausal Saudi women. In the present study, 36 osteoporotic postmenopausal and 25 healthy postmenopausal women as cases and controls respectively were selected from Armed Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study has designed to collect the data about the general characteristics (age, marital status, education, number of pregnancies, activity level, income and housing), anthropometric measurements, medical history and dietary intake by using both the methods (24 h recall, food frequency questionnaire). Serum samples were analyzed for calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and Para Thyroid Hormone (PTH) and they were correlated with Bone Mineral Density (BMD). Food intake items were correlated with hip, neck and spin BMD. In results, cases found significantly older than controls and had history of bone fractures. Cases were consumed significantly less dietary calcium than controls. Serum parameters did not show any significant differences. However significant correlation was found between serum level of PTH and calcium with BMD of spine and right neck femur respectively. Banana and Mataziz (locally <b>prepared</b> <b>dish</b> with vegetables) showed positive correlation with hip BMD. A negative significant correlation was found between Arabian coffee and right neck femur BMD. In conclusion, Saudi women require encouragement to consume adequate amounts of calcium, fruits and vegetables in combination with maintaining a daily physical activity and space in child birth. king Saud Universit...|$|E
