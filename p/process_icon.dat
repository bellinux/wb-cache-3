40|$|The {{study was}} carried out {{as a part of}} the iSPACE project and its aim was to assist in the scope of {{fulfilling}} specific human thermal comfort needs in the frame of an individual aircraft cabin seat. A detailed simulation study of individualized ventilation schemes in aircraft cabin seats was performed with the use of CFD methods. The ventilation schemes were selected based on a previously conducted parametric numerical study of personalised ventilation inlets of various sizes and locations in the aircraft suite. These selected schemes were then applied to business class seats and first class suites, with the boundary conditions based on physical measurements taken during actual subject testing. The study was was performed in an aircraft lining section, comprising of actual human subjects, passive manikins and some empty ’control’ seats. The simulation study was conducted using an open source based CFD <b>process</b> (<b>ICON</b> FOAMpro) and a proprietary software (STAR CCM+). The results were validated against probe measurements from the subject testing and evaluated in order to illustrate the thermal conditions achieved by the individualized ventilation scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{environmental}} and price issues of current energy crisis, scientists and technologists around the globe are intensively searching for new environmentally less-impact form of clean energy that will reduce the high dependency on fossil fuel. Particularly hydrogen can be produced from biomass via thermochemical processes including pyrolysis and gasification due to the economic advantage and can be further enhanced through in-situ carbon dioxide removal using calcium oxide. This work focuses on the synthesis {{and development of the}} flowsheet for the enhanced biomass gasification <b>process</b> in PETRONAS’s <b>iCON</b> <b>process</b> simulation software. This hydrogen prediction model is conducted at operating temperature between 600 to 1000 o C at atmospheric pressure. Effects of temperature, steam-to-biomass ratio and adsorbent-to-biomass ratio were studied and 0. 85 mol fraction of hydrogen is predicted in the product gas. Comparisons of the results are also made with experimental data from literature. The preliminary economic potential of developed system is RM 12. 57 x 10 6 which equivalent to USD 3. 77 x 10 6 annually shows economic viability of this process.

40|$|International audienceReduplication {{is widely}} attested in human languages, {{especially}} in the southern hemisphere. This distribution, often complementary with plural markings, {{is also found in}} languages spoken in China, which show a correlation between plural marking and reduplication/classifiers: if reduplication and clas-sifiers are found extensively, then plural marking is not developed, and is sensitive to the semantic feature [+human]. The more plural marking is developed, such as in Altaic languages, the less this semantic feature is required. The more a language possesses a developed plural-marking morphology, the less it needs reduplication and classifiers. Subjectivity {{plays a key role in}} reduplicated adjectives.

30|$|However, the {{convergence}} <b>process</b> of <b>ICON</b> is time-consuming. The huge computational demand {{has become a}} major problem for the application of ICON. The traditional solution to cope with the high computational cost has been the use of supercomputers and large computer clusters (Fernández et al. 2004; Fernández 2008), but such hardware is expensive and can also be difficult to use. Graphics processing units (GPU) (Lindholm et al. 2008) can be the attractive alternative solution in terms of price and performance. In this work, we developed the parallel strategies of ICON and implemented a GPU version of ICON, named ICON-GPU. Experimental results based on a Tesla K 20 c GPU card showed that ICON-GPU exhibits the same accuracy and a significant acceleration in comparison with the CPU version of ICON (ICON-CPU).|$|R

40|$|A visual {{programming}} facility is described {{which is based}} on a visual rule formalism. It permits programmers to specify the behaviors of agents in the class of program objects in the Agentsheets system of Repenning. The resulting agents can be used in designing simulations for two-dimensional cellular worlds such as in automobile traffic flow situations, video games, and cellular automata studies. The programming facility, called "Agent Builder," is integrated into the Agentsheets system (providing a substitute for the nonvisual AgenTalk editor) {{in such a way that}} agent programming becomes a <b>process</b> of arranging <b>icons</b> in a worksheet, using a special gallery of icons.

40|$|High-level {{programming}} language features simplify software development by eliminating many low-level programming concerns and by providing programmers with useful abstractions to simplify description {{and analysis of}} their programs. This dissertation discusses briefly some of {{the special needs of}} structural pattern-matching programs that must execute in real time and suggests language features to support these needs. These language features are implemented in an experimental version of the Icon {{programming language}} and examples of how these language features can be used are presented. This dissertation also presents and discusses the implementation of these language mechanisms, including the implementation of a new algorithm for garbage collecting linked data structures and strings in real time. One of the new language features is a stream data type, which allows programmers to perform pattern matching directly on sequences of data values produced by external sources, without requiring explicit read operations to bring the data into memory before analyzing it. Other new language features provide the ability to create and manipulate concurrent <b>Icon</b> <b>processes,</b> between which the stream data type serves as the principal mechanism for interprocess communication. Stream and concurrent process manipulation mechanisms integrate naturally {{with each other and with}} the existing mechanisms of the Icon programming language. Sequential Icon programs are, for the most part, unaffected by the new language capabilities...|$|R
30|$|To {{enhance the}} {{applicability}} of Study 2 to real-life interactions with mobile touch devices, four features of the stimuli were changed compared to Study 1. First, {{the presentation of the}} search screen was adjusted to resemble a typical smartphone. The screen showed a picture of a black iPhone 6 in its original size (13.8 [*]×[*] 6.7  cm) {{in the middle of a}} white screen. All icons depicted on the smartphone’s white background had a size of 1  ×[*] 1  cm with an inter-icon gap of 4  mm as in iOS 10. Participants sat in front of the device, which was lying horizontally on a desk. The second adaption of the first experiment was the experimental task, which was redesigned to further approximate a real-life scenario. In everyday life, icons may be distributed on a number of screens. Thus, when searching through a screen, the icon can either be on the currently visible screen or the user has to swipe in order to look for the icon on a different screen. Therefore, we always presented two screens, each with 24 icons. Navigating between the screens was possible with a swipe movement. The target icon was always present on one of the two screens. The probability of the icon being on the first or second screen was held equal. A further aspect in which this experiment differed from the previous one was the total number of icons. In order to increase the variability of the icons and to be able to use 48 differing icons during each trial, the total number of icons was increased from 26 (Study 1) to 60 (Study 2). Similar to Study 1, all icons were transformed into a flat design and colored with the 20 colors previously described. This resulted in a total of 1200 colored icons (60 icons[*]×[*] 20 colors). Again, overall luminance and percentage of colored area were not controlled. In contrast to Study 1, each icon was given a name (such as “e-mail”, “puzzle”, “local traffic”, “food delivery service”, etc.) to include a dimension of functionality. A pre-study was conducted in which icons with easily distinguishable symbols were matched to application names. During this <b>process,</b> most <b>icons</b> from Study 1 were replaced by new ones.|$|R
40|$|Public {{participation}} within {{urban planning}} {{is one of}} the key issues for planning a sustainable city. In recent years, local authorities and citizen groups have enhanced citizen involvement in the planning process by building consensus and networks among stakeholders. Among all the methods for achieving such consensus and involvement, the author chose to focus upon a participatory mapping system which can visualize the status quo of city/community and represent the local knowledge explicitly on a map. The thesis focuses on two mapping systems implemented in Stockholm: Green Map System (GMS) and sociotope mapping. GMS has been developed as a citizen movement from N. Y. to the global level, whereas sociotope mapping has been established by the Stockholm planning office. The author participated in a Green Map (GM) project in Bagarmossen, Stockholm, as an action researcher, and a new tool for community evaluation (modified from the value rose by Arken) was created for improving the mapping process in GMS. The two mapping systems are compared within the thesis, with regard to the power relation behind a map, mapping <b>processes</b> and mapping <b>icons.</b> The research notes that each map is created through the process of the interpretation of power and communication among different stakeholders. Sociotope maps represent an area by interpreting the voices from local citizens, planners and decision makers. Upon the basis of the case study, GM is a bottom-up mapping approach which represents the voice of locales more directly than sociotope mapping. By extracting the advantages of the two systems, integration of the two is suggested through consideration of the network building of stakeholders.   Key words: public participation, urban green space, power, sociotope mapping, Green Map System (GMS) ...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{tests for}} {{detecting}} group A streptococci in throat swabs are often performed outside hospitals or commercial laboratories by individuals {{with little or}} no technical training. We compared the abilities of nurses and technologists to perform and interpret three commercial kits (Directigen 1 - 2 - 3, ICON Strep A, and Culturette Brand 10 -Minute Strep A ID) in three hospital satellite locations (the emergency department, a walk-in emergency clinic, and a general pediatric clinic). When the three tests were compared with culture, the sensitivities of the tests as performed by nurses and technologists, respectively, were 39 versus 44 % for Directigen, 55 versus 51 % for Culturette, and 72 versus 39 % for ICON. A significant difference in sensitivity was found only with ICON tests. This result was largely explained by the tendency of technologists to test moist swabs, while nurses generally <b>processed</b> dry swabs; <b>ICON</b> test sensitivity was significantly greater with dry swabs. The specificities of Directigen and ICON tests performed by nurses and technologists were high (97 to 100 %). The difference in the specificities of the Culturette test as determined from results obtained by nurses and technologists (80 versus 98 %) was due to the tendency of one nurse to overinterpret the latex agglutination reaction. Analysis of the accuracies of the tests during practice periods compared with the accuracies of the tests during the study periods revealed statistically significant improvement in test performance. We conclude that these tests are specific but not sensitive when performed by nurses and technologists in satellite laboratories. With one exception, nurses and technologists performed the tests with comparable accuracy after brief training periods...|$|R
40|$|The first picture postcards of Micronesia were {{produced}} for the German colonies. Starting in 1898, cards existed for the Marshall Islands, soon followed by cards for Pohnpei, Yap, Palau and the Marianas. In total three main series can be identified: generic lithographed cards with reproductions of drawing or paintings, early photographic cards with undi-vided backs and white {{space on the}} image side for messages, and full-face image cards. The motifs on the early cards are scenic and ethnographic, while those on {{the second and third}} series predominately reproduce symbols of German colo-nial power and achievement. Cards that are exploitative of women (along the lines of ‘dusky maidens’), which were so popular in Samoa, are very rare in the German Micronesian setting. In modern marketing, visual imagery is a pow-erful component to attract the attention and imagination of potential visitors. There is a perpetual cycle of reinforcement, where post-cards and other imagery—today travel bro-chures, in the past textual descriptions or paint-ings/etchings — provide a representation of key attractions which already have or are in the <b>process</b> of attaining <b>icon</b> status; these induce tourists to visit these sites and then to reinforce the icon status by replicating the messages through postcards, taking their own photos, textual descriptions (in travelogues and today as blogs on the world wide web). This paper will be concerned with the rep-resentation of Micronesia on postcards pub-lished during the German colonial period (1886 – 1914). So far, only little work has been carried out on the imagery of Micronesia in general and on the imagery of the colonial periods in particu-lar.

50|$|The episode {{took place}} in 1169 when Andrei Bogolyubsky, Prince of Vladimir (on the Kliazma), besieged the city. His protégé in Novgorod, Prince Sviatoslav Rostislavich, had left Novgorod in 1167 upon {{the death of his}} father (Grand Prince Rostislav Mstislavich, who had also backed his reign in Novgorod). When the new Kievan grand prince, Mstislav Iziaslavich, sent his son, Roman, to be prince of Novgorod, Andrei fought to return Sviatoslav to the Novgorodian throne, sending his army to besiege Novgorod and force them to drive out Roman and take back Sviatoslav. During the siege, Archbishop Ilya of Novgorod, ordered that the Icon of the Mother of God of the Sign (ru: Bogomater Znamenie or Богоматер Знамение) be brought from the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilin Street on the eastern edge of the city, across the great bridge {{spanning}} the Volkhov River, and into the Detinets to be venerated in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom and displayed from the Detinets walls give the Novgorodians courage. According to the legend, when the deacon went to the church, he (miraculously) could not lift the icon and went back to report this to the archbishop, who went himself over the bridge to the church and <b>processed</b> with the <b>icon</b> back to the Detinets. the icon was then displayed on the walls and, according to the tale, struck by a Suzdalian arrow, at which time, according to the legend, it wept. The legend went on to say that through the intercessions of the Mother of God and of Archbishop Ilya, and several other saints (most notably Boris and Gleb and St. George, all depicted in the icons of the battle leading the Novgorodian army out against the Suzdalians), the Novgorodians were able to defeat the Suzdalians, after which Prince Andrei withdrew back to Suzdalia.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} is the nexus of Greek and Latin texts that feature Mark Antony. Cicero’s Philippics and Plutarch’s Life of Antony are the key components of this corpus, but this dissertation also encompasses writings about Antony by authors ranging from Propertius to Cassius Dio and covers the reception of this material in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Each chapter uses a metabiographical approach to examine a particular stylized persona that these authors project onto Antony. Chapter 1 investigates why authors invest Mark Antony with the attributes of a stage actor with a frequency rivaled only by similar treatments of later emperors like Caligula and Nero. Chapters 2 and 3 analyze the representation of Antony as a tyrant in Latin-language authors and Greek-language authors, respectively. Chapter 4 delineates the different ways that authors conceive of Antony’s love for Cleopatra {{as a type of}} madness. Chapter 5 uses Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar as a test case for applying the metabiographical methodology to a post-classical literary text and focuses on Shakespeare’s innovative deployment of Antony as a paragon of eloquence. By analyzing the manifestations these personae in different authors, I uncover new ways of understanding why competing portrayals of Antony take shape across time and across genre, and I map out the evolution of the idea of Mark Antony as it is manufactured over time in literature. I argue that the distortion of Antony that takes place in our sources is less an artifact of his rivals’ propaganda than a product of the historio-biographical process itself. I show how recurring biographical motifs exhibit subtle variations from author to author that signal alignments with particular rhetorical traditions, highlight key themes, or encode commentary upon the authors’ own cultural milieux. The principal contribution my project makes to our understanding of Greco-Roman literature is to demonstrate how Mark Antony is exploited as a malleable cultural touchstone. Recent work in metabiography has illuminated how Julius Caesar and Cleopatra perform this role as well, but our understanding of the <b>processes</b> that produced <b>icons</b> like these remains incomplete without a comparable study of Mark Antony. This dissertation fills this gap...|$|R
