For instance, the words [...] "evaluation", [...] "industrial action", and [...] "chemical armaments" [...] become [...] "evalwazzjoni", [...] "azzjoni industrjali", and [...] "armamenti kimiċi" [...] in Maltese, while the Italian terms are valutazione, vertenza sindacale, and armi chimiche respectively.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, flour milling and other {{industries}} in Georgetown were declining, {{in part due}} to the fact that the canals and other waterways continually silted up. [...] Nathaniel Michler and S.T. Abert led efforts to dredge the channels and remove rocks around the Georgetown harbor, though these were temporary solutions and Congress showed little interest in the issue. [...] An 1890 flood and expansion of the railroads brought destitution to the C Canal, and [...] Georgetown's waterfront became more industrialized, with narrow alleys, warehouses, and apartment dwellings which lacked plumbing or electricity. Shipping trade vanished between the Civil War and World War I. As a result, many older homes were <b>preserved</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>unchanged.</b>|$|E

40|$|All the {{substance}} of the Earth and other terrestrial planets once existed in the form of interstellar grains and gas. A major aspect of solar system formation (and undoubtedly of star formation generally) is the complex series of processes that converted infalling interstellar grains into planets. A cryptic record of these processes is preserved in certain samples of planetary materials, such as chondritic meteorites, that were <b>preserved</b> in a <b>relatively</b> <b>unchanged</b> form since the beginning. It is to be expected that some of these primitive materials might contain or even consist of preserved presolar interstellar grains. The identification and study of such grains, the ancestors of our planetary system, is a matter of intense interest. Types of primitive material accessible or potentially accessible, and component of or relationship to presolar interstellar grains are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{painters of}} Kamasan, Bali, Indonesia, have a precise schema for the paintings they produce. They {{live in a}} close community, which seems to outsiders to be peaceful and cohesive. Painting technique has been taught by parents to children, and <b>preserved</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>unchanged</b> for centuries. What can be learned by an artist from another culture, about Balinese technique and lifestyle, that could be of use to painting and educational practise? As an artist/educator who had, to some degree, learned to abhor ritual, became bored easily with repetition, and saw self-expression as {{the main reason for}} art production, I was personally challenged by going to Kamasan and working with a painting family there. Throughout the process of working in Bali, and reflecting on ritual, my philosophy has changed. This thesis describes some of my experiences as a student in Bali. Based on my subsequent reflections upon return to Canada proposes that increased acceptance of ritual may be beneficial for art education practise...|$|E
