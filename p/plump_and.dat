5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos. Drunken Barnaby is a {{scene of}} a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career. The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.|$|E
5|$|Embedded in the {{calcareous}} skeleton are numerous microscopic polyps. They are connected internally {{by a system}} of canals and are concealed behind pores in the skeleton, the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylzooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also extrude the coenosteum, the calcareous material of which the skeleton is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return benefit from a protective environment in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} {{information on how}} to grow Wollemi Pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.|$|E
500|$|Corpses swell as gases from {{decomposition}} {{accumulate in}} the torso {{and the increased}} pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look [...] "plump", [...] "well-fed", and [...] "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the Arnold Paole case, an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> healthy {{than she had ever}} looked in life. The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.|$|E

On one occasion, during a National Dock Strike, the Archbishop of Canterbury composed a prayer hoping for its prompt end. Helena arrived at the church, examined her service sheet, and in a voice described by her daughter as [...] "the penetrating royal family whisper, which carried farther than any megaphone", remarked: [...] "That prayer won't settle any strike."

500|$|Chabas {{began work}} on September Morn in mid-1910 at Talloires {{on the shores of}} Lake Annecy in Haute-Savoie, some [...] {{south-east}} of Paris. The model, whom he never identified but referred to as [...] "Marthe", was well known to his family. Owing to the financial situation of the sixteen-year-old's family, [...] "Marthe" [...] had to work to support her mother. On the first day of painting, [...] "Marthe" [...] entered the morning water and instinctively recoiled at its chilliness. Chabas approved of this pose, saying that it was [...] "perfect". Over the course of two summers he worked on the painting, half an hour every morning. The work was completed on a September morning in 1911, giving the painting its name. In 1935, responding to claims that [...] "Marthe" [...] was living in poverty, Chabas explained that she had continued posing for him until she was 28, when she married a rich industrialist, and that she was now aged 41, <b>plump,</b> <b>and</b> had three children.|$|E
500|$|From birth, Beatrice {{became a}} favoured child. The elder {{favourite}} daughter of Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, {{was about to}} take up residence in Germany with her new husband, Frederick ("Fritz") of Prussia. At the same time, the newly arrived Beatrice showed promise. Albert wrote to Augusta, Fritz's mother, that [...] "Baby practises her scales like a good prima donna before a performance and has a good voice!" [...] Although Queen Victoria was known to dislike most babies, she liked Beatrice, whom she considered attractive. This provided Beatrice with an advantage over her elder siblings. Queen Victoria once remarked that Beatrice was [...] "a pretty, <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> flourishing child... with fine large blue eyes, [...] pretty little mouth and very fine skin". Her long, golden hair was the focus of paintings commissioned by Queen Victoria, who enjoyed giving Beatrice her bath, in marked contrast to her bathing preferences for her other children. Beatrice showed intelligence, which further endeared her to the Prince Consort, who was amused by her childhood precociousness.|$|E

500|$|Bumblebees are {{varied in}} appearance, but are {{generally}} <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> densely furry. Compared to honeybees they are larger and stouter-bodied. Many species have broad bands of colour, the patterns helping to distinguish different species. Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers, some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube. Compared to a honeybee, a bumblebee has a broader {{body and a}} more rounded tip to the abdomen. Bumblebees have fewer stripes (or none), and usually have {{part of the body}} covered in black fur, while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen. Sizes are very variable even within species; the largest British species, B. terrestris, has queens up to [...] long, males up to [...] long, and workers between [...] long. The largest bumblebee species in the world is B. dahlbomii of Chile, up to about [...] long, and described as [...] "flying mice" [...] and [...] "a monstrous fluffy ginger beast".|$|E

The cap surface is dry, slightly [...] (covered {{with a layer}} of fine hairs), and a deep and bright orange-yellow color, with older specimens fading to more yellow in age; the extreme margins of the cap are a paler yellow, and typically curve downward in young specimens. Fruit bodies can reach a height of [...] The hymenophore (the spore-bearing surface) is initially smooth and without wrinkles, but gradually develops channels or ridges, and what appear to be very shallow gills that are vein-like, and less than 1mm wide. The color is pale yellow, and is continuous with the surface of the stem. The stem is rather <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> stout, [...] long and [...] thick, more or less cylindrical, tapering downwards towards the base. Internally, the stems are either stuffed (filled with cotton-like mycelia) or solid. Rarely, fruit bodies may be clumped together with stems joined at the base; in these cases there are usually no more than three fused stems. The flesh is solid to partly hollow (sometimes due to insect larvae), with a pale yellow color; it is [...] thick.|$|E

2500|$|The {{characters}} in Bly's novels often dispense with the typical romance novel stereotypes, with the novels featuring female characters who are <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> even a hero who annulled a marriage because of impotence.

2500|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{usually is}} combined with the [...] "goddess" [...] explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with [...] "birthing stones". There is folkloric evidence of {{at least some of}} the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour. Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in Oxford at the church of St Michael at the North Gate has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day. This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility. Others are <b>plump</b> <b>and</b> are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as [...] at Whittlesford). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at Devizes, who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos. Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.|$|E

Though Field carried out his duties ably and conscientiously he {{does not appear to have}} been able to keep himself clear from the petty squabbles and jealousies of a small settlement. An echo of this may be found in the description of Field by John Dunmore Lang as a [...] "weak silly man who fancied himself a poet born". Sir Thomas Brisbane, writing to Earl Bathurst in January 1824, stated that Field [...] "had embraced every opportunity of falsely and foully slandering me and my government". But Brisbane could be irascible if he thought his honour or dignity was touched, and his first ground of complaint appears to have been that [...] "during his first two years in the colony, Field had never once entered Government House". However, word was already on the way to Brisbane that Field had been recalled, and Lamb, writing at the end of 1824, mentions that [...] "Barron Field is come home from Sydney.
