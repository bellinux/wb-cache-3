40|$|Objectives: To assess {{effects of}} swine {{respiratory}} disease (SRD) on nursery pig responses during gas euthanasia and to compare responses to carbon dioxide (CO 2) and argon (Ar) gas euthanasia {{in terms of}} efficacy and welfare. Materials and methods: Fifty-four pigs identified for euthanasia were classified as having SRD or euthanized for other reasons (OT). These pigs were distributed among three treatments: <b>prefill</b> CO 2 (P-CO 2), gradual fill CO 2 (G-CO 2), and <b>prefill</b> Ar (P-Ar). Behavioral and physiological indicators of efficacy and welfare were assessed directly and from video. Modified atmosphere CO 2 and O 2 concentrations (...|$|R

The wine is commonly administered via a chalice, but many congregations use individual cups. These may be either <b>prefilled</b> or filled from the chalice during the distribution of the Eucharist. Some ELCA congregations make grape juice available for children and those who are abstaining from alcohol and some will accommodate those with an allergy to wheat or grapes.|$|E

40|$|Influential {{theories}} of brain-viscera interactions propose {{a central role}} for interoception in basic motivational and affective feeling states. Recent neuroimaging studies have underlined the insula, anterior cingulate, and ventral prefrontal cortices as the neural correlates of interoception. However, the relationships between these distributed brain regions remain unclear. In this study, we used spatial independent component analysis (ICA) and functional network connectivity (FNC) approaches to investigate time course correlations across the brain regions during visceral interoception. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in thirteen healthy females who underwent viscerosensory stimulation of bladder as a representative internal organ at different <b>prefill</b> levels, i. e., no <b>prefill,</b> low <b>prefill</b> (100 ml saline), and high <b>prefill</b> (individually adapted to the sensations of persistent strong desire to void), and with different infusion temperatures, i. e., body warm (∼ 37 °C) or ice cold (4 - 8 °C) saline solution. During Increased distention pressure on the viscera, the insula, striatum, anterior cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdalo-hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellar components showed increased activation. A second group of components encompassing the insula and anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices and temporal-parietal junction showed increased activity with innocuous temperature stimulation of bladder mucosa. Significant differences in the FNC {{were found between the}} insula and amygdalo-hippocampus, the insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and temporal-parietal junction as the distention pressure on the viscera increased. These results provide new insight into the supraspinal processing of visceral interoception originating from an internal organ.

40|$|Abstract—In most {{embedded}} {{and general}} purpose archi-tectures, stack data and non-stack data is cached together, meaning that writing to or loading from the stack may expel non-stack {{data from the}} data cache. Manipulation of the stack has a different memory access pattern than that of non-stack data, showing higher temporal and spatial locality. We propose caching stack and non-stack data separately and develop four different stack caches that allow this separation without requiring compiler support. These are the simple, window, and <b>prefilling</b> with and without tag stack caches. The performance of the stack cache architectures was evaluated using the SimpleScalar toolset where the window and <b>prefilling</b> stack cache without tag resulted in an execution speedup of up to 3. 5 % for the MiBench benchmarks, executed on an out-of-order processor with the ARM instruction set.

40|$|Ad libitum mixing, an {{application}} of the method of adjustment in food research, was investigated and evaluated {{for the purpose of}} taste memory research. The difference between ascending and descending runs in mixing was studied using a wide range of <b>prefill</b> concentrations lower and higher than standard. The effect of training was studied by comparing subjects with two or 10 replications in the first session where a standard was present as a reference. Results showing higher reproduced concentrations after a 25 h time interval than those produced immediately are consistent with earlier results from within-subject designs. Thus, the difference in recall performance did not depend on the design of the study. No difference between ascending and descending runs in the mixing was observed, thus the <b>prefill</b> concentrations did not affect the reproduction of a given standard. There {{was no significant difference between}} produced concentrations after two and 10 replications, although a non-significant trend towards improved performance following 10 replications was observed after the 25 h time interval...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} and {{the shape of a}} liquid meniscus in a wedge with opening angle 2 ϕ which is exposed to a vapor phase. By applying a suitable effective interface model, at liquid-vapor coexistence and at a temperature T_ϕ we find a filling transition at which the height of the meniscus becomes macroscopically large while the planar walls of the wedge far away from its center remain nonwet up to the wetting transition occurring at T_w>T_ϕ. Depending on the fluid and the substrate potential the filling transition can be either continuous or discontinuous. In the latter case it is accompanied by a <b>prefilling</b> line extending into the vapor phase of the bulk phase diagram and describing a transition from a small to a large, but finite, meniscus height. The filling and the <b>prefilling</b> transitions correspond to nonanalyticities in the surface and line contributions to the free energy of the fluid, respectively.

30|$|Tank A {{is filled}} with liquid ammonia, and tank B {{is filled with}} {{nitrogen}} gas. The purpose of this arrangement is to purge nitrogen gas in tank B, in preparation for filling with liquid ammonia.

The liquefied ammonia is repeatedly directed to tank A from the compressor discharge via pipelines 2 – 5.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{asynchronous}} cluster video server architecture, {{which is quite}} different from synchronous video server architecture in various aspects such as striping policy, placement policy, and server scheduling algorithm.

The result is exciting compared with synchronous server scheduling algorithm. It requires fewer client buffers and server buffers, consumes less system response time and can be scalable.
