Underwood helped ensure the {{election}} of President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), who promised to appoint Underwood as Secretary of State. However, before Walker is sworn in, Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) announces that the <b>president</b> <b>will</b> not honor the agreement and will instead nominate Senator Michael Kern. Furious at Walker's betrayal, Underwood and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern.

5|$|Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye {{return to}} the United States where {{they set up a}} base of {{operations}} in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as the premier U.S. special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the <b>President</b> <b>will</b> be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the U.S. Secret Service's Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} vote, Parliament demanded {{a number of}} {{concessions}} {{as part of a}} future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's <b>President</b> <b>will</b> attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-lead international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} {{makes no}} mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate <b>President</b> <b>will</b> be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E

5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the <b>President</b> <b>will</b> {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
5|$|Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, {{discovering}} that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One. Stark saves some surviving {{passengers and crew}} but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice <b>President</b> <b>will</b> become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian. After the battle, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit {{as a sign of}} his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing he will always be Iron Man.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May further {{amendments}} to the Turkish constitution were officially passed by parliament, 376 to 1. According to the amendments, general elections {{will be carried out}} every four years rather than five. The <b>president</b> <b>will</b> now serve a maximum of two five-year terms instead of an unrestricted number of seven-year terms.

40|$|University {{presidents in}} China are {{appointed}} by and {{accountable to the}} government. Thus, presidents' career concerns may influence their admission policies. Office-seeking <b>presidents</b> <b>will</b> choose a more equitable admission policy when central government decides their career prospects, while locally connected <b>presidents</b> <b>will</b> allocate more slots to their local community to secure financial support from local government. This paper examines the effects of university presidents' career concerns on their local admission policies using a panel dataset containing the admission information and presidents' personal characteristics of 80 Chinese elite universities. I find that presidents allocate more admission slots to local provinces when the additional benefit from further political advancement is smaller, or {{when they are not}} on promotion probation so that their performance has a smaller effect on their career prospects, or when they have stronger connections to the local government.

25|$|In May 2007, the Parliament of Kazakhstan {{approved}} {{a constitutional amendment}} which would allow Nazarbayev to seek re-election {{as many times as}} he wishes.

After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, the <b>President</b> <b>will</b> be accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential 21-gun salute is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the Singapore Artillery. It is customary that the President speaks to {{some members of the}} Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by.
