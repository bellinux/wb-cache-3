50|$|The {{place is}} {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of particular types of World War II structures, including a power house, <b>propeller</b> <b>maintenance</b> workshop, electro plating workshop, cantilever hangars, torpedo maintenance and torpedo war head stores.|$|E
50|$|The Engine Repair Section, located {{north of}} the GES, {{contains}} concrete floor surfaces for six workshops including a number of Bellman hangars. From south to north the six ERS workshop slabs are identified as: Receipt and Despatch Shop, Engine Inspection and Dismantling Shop, Stripping and Cleaning Shop, Blacksmith Shop with Retort Furnace, Final Assembly Shop, and <b>Propeller</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Shop. Two other ERS workshop floor surfaces, including an engine running shed with steel tie down bolts, are located {{on the west side}} of the Gregory Developmental Road.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEnergy {{efficiency}} {{improvements in}} the shipping industry are being driven by economics, compliance and customer requirements. Whilst various technological and operation improvements are known and available, with many being demonstrated to be cost effective and with savings reported in the industry, their take {{up in the world}} fleet remains low. This low take-up can be considered due to many different barriers, as explored in various research studies. However the aim of this paper is first to understand how these barriers are created by considering how ship operations function day-to-day within the context of mainstream business practice. A holistic view of operations is required and is presented in this paper, including consideration of business focus areas in parallel with the functions of technical, operational and commercial stakeholders. With this laid-out, gaps within existing operations are discussed in relation to areas for practical improvements. From here, non-prescriptive mechanisms to enable a desired future are proposed; including the integration of mandates, processes and systems. Case studies are given throughout the paper using hull and <b>propeller</b> <b>maintenance</b> as a recurring example of a typical decision making processes and best practices...|$|E
5000|$|From 2005 to 2006, Eznis {{pilots were}} trained and type rated at Ansett Training Center in Australia, {{followed}} by line training supervised by former Japan Air Commuter captains. Qantas provided emergency {{training for the}} cabin crew while Saab Aircraft AB provided maintenance type rating training for maintenance staff. Crew attended CRM training by Boeing and dangerous goods training by IATA. GE and Hamilton provided engine and <b>propeller</b> line <b>maintenance</b> training for Eznis technicians. Eznis has full insurance coverage on its aircraft, spare parts and liabilities provided by AON in London. Eznis employs approximately 200 staff.|$|R

Meanwhile, Tenix LADS Corporation that undertook hydrographic projects for international {{oil and gas exploration}} companies and seismic survey organisations was sold to Dutch multinational Fugro six months later.|$|R
2500|$|The Pratt & Whitney R-2800-5 engines were reliable, but the Curtiss {{electric}} pitch change {{mechanism in}} the <b>propellers</b> required impeccable <b>maintenance,</b> not always attainable in the field. Human error and some {{failures of the}} mechanism occasionally placed the propeller blades in flat pitch resulting in an overspeeding propeller, sometimes known as a [...] "runaway prop". Due to its sound {{and the possibility that}} the propeller blades could disintegrate, this situation was particularly frightening for aircrews. More challenging was a loss of power in one engine during takeoff. These and other malfunctions, as well as human error, claimed a number of aircraft and the commanding officer of the 22nd Bombardment Group, Colonel Mark Lewis.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} pressure being placed on the marine industry to address ship emissions, regulations to govern the fuel efficiency and efficient operation of ships {{in the form of the}} Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) (IMO, 2014) and Energy Efficiency Operation Index (EEOI) (IMO, 2009 a) have recently come into force. These have been introduced alongside regulations concerning specific emissions requirements (UNFCCC). Attention has therefore been turned to all aspects of ship design and operation which have impact on their efficiency. In turn, this paper focuses on the effects of biofouling on propeller surfaces highlighting the benefits of reducing biofouling. This subject was the focus of a recently completed EU-Funded FP 7 Project entitled FOUL-X-SPEL (2011). This paper investigates the detrimental impacts of biofouling on the performance of a real ship propeller using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Initially, the CFD approach used in this study was validated through CFD open-water tests of a propeller. A previously-developed CFD approach for approximating the surface roughness that results from biofouling has then been applied in order to predict the effects on propeller efficiency. The roughness effects of a typical coating and different fouling conditions on the propeller performance were therefore predicted for various advance coefficients Results indicated negative effects of biofouling on the propeller efficiency and the importance of the mitigation of such effects, supporting the importance of informing the industry about the impacts such that they are able to make informed decisions regarding regular <b>propeller</b> <b>maintenance</b> and cleanin...|$|E
