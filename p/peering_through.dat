5|$|Finn {{wakes up}} to {{discover}} that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) is now his wife {{and he is now}} the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to hint that reality is not what it seems. Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. <b>Peering</b> <b>through</b> a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} {{documented}} by droppings and tracks, {{pictures of the}} Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. On 24 April 2007, {{it was announced that}} cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino. The night-time footage showed the rhino eating, <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> jungle foliage, and sniffing the film equipment. The World Wildlife Fund, which took the video, has used it in efforts to convince local governments to turn the area into a rhino conservation zone. Monitoring has continued; 50 new cameras have been set up, and in February 2010, {{what appeared to be a}} pregnant rhino was filmed.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the scene}} {{depicting}} a New York woman being {{dropped to her}} apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped. When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> the keyhole of {{a closed door}} on what it {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited over the threshold {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of the Palestinian cause, but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot of the Israelis to oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians.|$|E
500|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, {{a review}} {{included in the}} book A Guide to Apocalyptic Cinema, author Charles P. Mitchell called the film [...] "bizarre" [...] and gave it two stars. Similarly, in a 1978 issue of the magazine Cue, viewers were warned [...] "don't watch it." [...] In the 1986 Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies by Phil Hardy and Denis Gifford, the film is accused of using the science fiction clichés of flying saucers and atomic bombs. Gyan Prakash, in his book Noir Urbanisms: Dystopic Images of the Modern City, called the film [...] "charming." [...] The film was noted for its misleading characterization of astronomers, with one author observing that it advanced the cinematic portrayal of astronomers as scientists in lab coats <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> an enormous telescope.|$|E

500|$|Scully and Bonsaint {{drive to}} the Turner home. Scully, <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> the windows, discovers Melissa {{attempting}} to {{set fire to the}} house, with her, her daughter and Chinga all trapped inside. Bonsaint breaks down the nailed door as Melissa runs to a closet and grabs hold of a hammer which she, against her will, turns upon herself. Thinking quickly, Scully grabs the Chinga doll and throws it inside a microwave oven in the kitchen. As the doll melts, Melissa drops the hammer and regains her senses. Returning to the office on Monday, Scully downplays any excitement or involvement regarding the case, insisting that she was only relaxing on her vacation. [...] In the final scene, a fisherman is seen pulling up a lobster trap, and in it is the burned doll, which comes back to life.|$|E
500|$|After the war Beric {{became a}} clerk in the Gents clock factory. The family lived in a terraced house on Lead Street in the centre of Leicester, an area that was {{demolished}} in the mid-1950s {{as part of the}} city's slum clearance. When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the council estates the post-war Labour government built. [...] "To say we were skint," [...] he wrote in 1993, [...] "is like saying it is a little chilly at the North Pole." [...] He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> windows. His mother never explained that it was about the rent; she just told Icke to hide. He wrote in 2003 that he still gets a fright when someone knocks on the door.|$|E
500|$|As a boy, {{inventor}} George Escol Sellers knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's {{father was}} {{partner in a}} firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. [...] In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. [...] He recalled in 1812 <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> a window to see cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work {{at the end of}} the day. [...] Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent planchet on the press, and struck it for him. [...] Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot, and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and then he could spend it on candy.|$|E

500|$|You Only Live Twice was {{published}} in the UK on 16 March 1964, by Jonathan Cape and cost sixteen shillings. There were 62,000 pre-orders for the book, a significant increase over the 42,000 advance orders for the hardback first edition of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Richard Chopping, cover artist for The Spy Who Loved Me, was engaged for the design. On 17 July 1963, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape had written to Chopping about the artwork, saying: [...] "I have had a talk with Ian about the ideas for the ingredients of this design. He is very much in favour of the toad... but with a suitable array of oriental embellishrangment, i.e. toad plus Japanese flower arrangements, which he thinks should be sitting in a suitable piece of Japanese pottery, perhaps ornamented with a dragon motif. If you could manage a pink dragonfly sitting on the flowers, and perhaps just one epicanthic eye <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> them he thinks that will be just splendid!" [...] Chopping's fee rose to 300 guineas for the cover, a rise from the 250 guineas he received for The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} Nancy Drew {{books were}} published as dark blue hardcovers with the titles stamped in orange lettering with dark blue outlines {{and no other}} images on the cover. [...] They went through several changes in early years: leaving the orange lettering with no outline and adding an orange silhouette of Nancy <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> a magnifying glass; then changing to a lighter blue board with dark blue lettering and silhouette; then changing {{the position of the}} title and silhouette on the front with black lettering and a more [...] "modern" [...] silhouette. Nancy Drew is depicted as an independent-minded 16-year-old who has already completed her high school education (16 was the minimum age for graduation at the time); the series also occurs over time, as she is 18 by the early 1940s. Apparently affluent (her father is a successful lawyer), she maintains an active social, volunteer, and sleuthing schedule, as well as participating in athletics and the arts, but is never shown as working for a living or acquiring job skills. Nancy is affected neither by the Great Depression—although many of the characters in her early cases need assistance as they are poverty-stricken—nor by World War II. Nancy lives with her lawyer father, Carson Drew, and their housekeeper, Mrs. Hannah Gruen. Some critics prefer the Nancy of these volumes, largely written by Mildred Benson. Benson is credited with [...] "... a feisty spirit into Nancy's character." [...] The original Nancy Drew is sometimes claimed [...] "to be a lot like [...] herself– confident, competent, and totally independent, quite unlike the cardboard character that [...] Stratemeyer had outlined." ...|$|E

This ident lasted until September 1995, {{when a new}} ident that featured the new corporate logo was released. The logo also saw {{the return of the}} fada on RTÉ's [...] "E" [...] in a stylistic manner. The ident started with a misty background, with the new RTÉ logo <b>peering</b> <b>through,</b> eventually fading into the station's name. At the beginning, the St. Brigid's Cross was left out, but it was restored to the screens after viewers complained.|$|E

2500|$|On [...] "Something in the Way of Things (In Town)", Amiri Baraka {{performs}} {{a poem about}} how the spirit of death and decay permeates African-American urban experiences. Set to a fusion of several African-American music influences, his poem observes [...] "something {{in the way of}} our selves" [...] and uses unusual imagery such as death [...] "riding on top of the car <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> the windshield" [...] and a [...] "Negro squinting at us through the cage" [...] with a smile [...] "that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks".|$|E
2500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Ellen von Unwerth, with {{additional}} photos by Mario Testino. The cover depicts Jackson lowering her head amidst a crimson backdrop, symbolizing remorse. [...] "Janet" [...] is faintly embossed in a pixelated block formation. Jackson stated, [...] "The shot we {{used on the}} cover shows me just looking down, and that's what the album was about, looking inward". MTV News regarded the artwork as iconic and an influence on various artists. Its internal artwork depicts Jackson's piercings and tattoos, also displaying her hands tied in bondage and latex attire, exhibiting fetishism. A particular photo of Jackson wearing a latex ensemble with her nipple piercing <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> an opening gained notoriety for its explicit nature. The photo also shows Jackson pricking her body with an ice pick.|$|E
2500|$|Vietnam War veteran Larry Hama {{contacted}} fellow vet Doug Murray in 1984 {{about doing}} a Vietnam War series for his black-and-white magazine, Savage Tales. Hama teamed Murray up with artist Michael Golden {{and together they}} created The 5th of the 1st, which was well received. In 1986, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter approached Hama with a mock-up of a comic book cover that was, as Hama remembers, [...] "a color copy of the artwork from a G.I. Joe cover, one that showed an Infantryman in camo face paint <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> dense jungle foliage. A logo had been pasted over the art that read: THE 'NAM." [...] Shooter told Hama {{to come up with}} a book to go along with the cover and produce it. Hama suggested that Murray put together a proposal for a regular comic book about the Vietnam War.|$|E

2500|$|Her memoir, The Private Life of a Country House (1912–1939), recounts her {{childhood}} years at Pilgrims Hall, and forms {{a detailed account}} of upper-middle-class family life in a small English country house with servants before the Second World War. It first came out in 1980 and has since been reissued five times; the 2011 edition is associated with the National Trust. The Sunday Times describes it as a [...] "minor classic", and a review of the first edition states [...] "The charm of this book is that so many of the details of everyday life come alive and the more ordinary, prosaic things take on their true importance ... Reading it is rather like <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> the windows of a long-forgotten doll's house." [...] Her recollections have been quoted by several recent texts; Pamela Sambrook writes that Lewis is [...] "particularly successful at retrieving the memory of domestic trivia." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{he commented}} that the {{doughnuts}} were growing stale, Maud indifferently responded that because he had purchased them, he was obligated to finish them. [...] Frank, unwilling to eat the moldy doughnuts, buried the rest in the backyard. However, Maud, <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> the window, noticed his actions and immediately scooped them out. [...] "Dust off" [...] them, she gave one to Frank. [...] Annoyed, Frank told her he no longer wanted to eat the doughnuts because they were [...] "not fit to eat and you know it". [...] Maud rejoined that {{because he did not}} confer with her prior to buying the doughnuts, he had to eat them. [...] However, she told him, [...] "I'll let you off this time if you promise never again to buy any food unless I ask you to get it." [...] Frank consented, and the incident [...] "taught him a lesson he never forgot: that ... around the house she was the boss".|$|E
2500|$|When {{photographic}} curator Maya Benton {{began to}} catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the International Center of Photography, she noticed that, {{in his book}} A Vanished World, Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were {{not supported by the}} material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> a metal door; on the opposite page a small boy points with his finger to his eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: [...] "The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935-1938." [...] At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: [...] "The pogromshchiki" [...] (pogrom lynch mob) [...] "are coming. But the iron door was no protection." [...] Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book [...] "almost certainly did not happen".|$|E
