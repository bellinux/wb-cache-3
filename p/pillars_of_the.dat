5|$|Despite being {{separate}} legal entities, the ECSC, EEC and Euratom initially {{shared the}} Common Assembly and the European Court of Justice, although the Councils and the High Authority/Commissions remained separate. To avoid duplication, the Merger Treaty merged these separate {{bodies of the}} ECSC and Euratom with the EEC.

5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Stephen and {{his reign}} have been {{occasionally}} used in historical fiction. Stephen {{and his supporters}} appear in Ellis Peters' historical detective series Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters' depiction of Stephen's reign is an essentially local narrative, focused on the town of Shrewsbury and its environs. Peters paints Stephen as a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler, despite his execution of the Shrewsbury defenders after the taking {{of the city in}} 1138. In contrast, Stephen is depicted unsympathetically in both Ken Follett's historical novel The <b>Pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth and the TV mini-series adapted from it.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dome of the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E

5|$|The Rudra Mahalaya Temple, {{also known}} as Rudramal, is a ruined temple complex at Siddhpur in the Patan {{district}} of Gujarat, India. Its construction was started in 943 AD by Mularaja and completed in 1140 AD by Jayasimha Siddharaja, the rulers of the Chaulukya dynasty. The temple was destroyed by Alauddin Khalji, and later Ahmed Shah I (1410–44) desecrated and substantially demolished this temple, and also converted part of it into the congregational mosque (Jami Masjid) of the city. Two torans (porches) and four <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former central structure still stand along with {{western part of the}} complex used as a congregational mosque.|$|E
5|$|The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periazhwar in eleven hymns and Thirumangai Azhwar in {{thirteen}} hymns. The temple {{is classified}} as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Some of the ancient Sanskrit books consider the temple as a uthamakshetram, meaning the place that gives the best to its devotees. The sculptures on the <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple reveal the earliest practice of Krishna worship in Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried {{over from the}} European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.|$|E

5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple.|$|E
5|$|Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a {{successful}} London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing {{as a vehicle for}} moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, Bathurst {{has played}} a fictional prime {{minister}} in the BBC sitcom My Dad's the Prime Minister, Mark Thatcher in the fact-based drama Coup! and a man whose daughter goes missing in the ITV thriller The Stepfather.

5|$|The Metro {{has been}} {{promoted}} {{as an integral part}} of community infrastructure, and community artwork depicting the local way of life has been put on display at stations. Students of local art colleges have also designed decorative murals at Metro stations, while <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viaduct on some elevated sections have been decorated with mosaic murals created by local schoolchildren. The Metro station at INA Colony has a gallery showcasing artwork and handicrafts from across India, while all stations on the Central Secretariat– Qutub Minar section of the Yellow Line have panels installed on the monumental architectural heritage of Delhi. The Nobel Memorial Wall at Rajiv Chowk has portraits of the seven Nobel Laureates from India: Rabindranath Tagore, CV Raman, Hargobind Khorana, Mother Teresa, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Amartya Sen and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and provide details about their contribution to society and a panel each on Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses {{and a high}} exchange rate for the United States dollar. The surplus was increased by taxes levied during de la Rúa's presidency and the devaluation which occurred during the Duhalde administration. Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine industrial base, public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by foreign companies. His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor. However, despite of the financial prosperity, {{there was no significant}} {{decrease in the number of}} people living in poverty, which was 8 to 10 million people, or almost 25% of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} walls {{around the}} temple enclose all the eight shrines and {{six of the}} seven water bodies associated with the temple. Besides the main shrine for Pundarikakshan and Pangayavalli, the temple has shrines for Azhwars, Garuda, Ramanujar and Uyyakondar. The seven water bodies are Divya Theertham, Kanda Kshree Theertham, Theertham, Chakkara Theertham, Pushkala Theertham, Padma Theertham and Varaaha Manikarnika Theertham. The vimanam (structure over the santum) is called Vimalaakkruthi Vimaanam. There are various sculptural depictions of Krishna on the <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple, in the most notable {{of which he is}} depicted dancing on a pot. He is seen dancing in Swastika posture with his bun like hair-do, ornaments and anklet. In another sculpture, he is seen slaying the demon Bhagasura. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned the Krishna paintings on the exterior walls of the shrine of Pundarikakshan; they have clear Telugu language labels. Paintings with some of the popular themes from the epic Ramayana were also commissioned by the Nayak kings in the temple.|$|E
50|$|Chillon {{was made}} popular by Lord Byron, {{who wrote the}} poem <b>The</b> Prisoner <b>Of</b> Chillon (1816) about François de Bonivard. Byron also carved his name on a <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dungeon.|$|R
