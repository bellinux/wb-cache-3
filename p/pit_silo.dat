The <b>silo</b> <b>pit,</b> as it has been termed, has been a favorite way of storing grain from time immemorial in all oriental lands. In Turkey and Persia, usurers used to buy up wheat or barley when comparatively cheap, and store it in hidden pits against seasons of dearth.

They worshipped a mother goddess associated with fertility and another headless deity, who was probably connected with the welfare of children. They believed in life after death, and therefore interred the dead inside the house under the floor. Children were buried in two urns that were joined mouth-to-mouth and set horizontally in the pit, while adults were placed in a supine position with the head towards the North.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} baled silages {{produced}} in Ireland have identified considerable filamentous fungal contamination. Many of these fungi are toxigenic, {{capable of producing}} secondary metabolites, namely mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are potentially detrimental to livestock health and some can pose a risk to consumers of animal products. Baled (n= 20) and pit (n= 18) silages from a sample of farms (n= 38) in Co. Meath were examined to assess the occurrence of mycotoxins and ascertain whether sampling position within the <b>pit</b> <b>silos</b> (feed face vs. 3 m behind the feed face) {{has an effect on}} mycotoxin content or other chemical compositional variables. Of the 20 mycotoxins assayed, baled silages contained [mean of positive values (no. of values in mean) ] mycotoxin concentrations (μg/kg dry matter) of beauvericin 36 (2), enniatin (enn.) A 9. 3 (3), enn. A 1 54 (8), enn. B 351 (9), enn. B 1 136 (10), mycophenolic acid (MPA) 11, 157 (8) and roquefortine C (Roq. C) 1037 (8) and pit silages contained beauvericin 25 (2) enn. A 1 18 (2), enn. B 194 (9), enn. B 1 57 (3), MPA 287 (6), Roq. C 3649 (6) and zearalenone 76 (1). There was no difference (P> 0. 05) observed in the mycotoxin concentrations between baled and pit silages, and 11 of the 20 mycotoxins assayed were below the limits of detection. The position of sampling had no effect on the mycotoxin concentration detected in pit silages. It is concluded that mycotoxin concentrations detected in these pit and baled silages in Co. Meath did not exceed EU regulation or guidance limits, and that similar chemical composition and mycotoxin concentration values occurred at the pit silage feed face and 3 m behind this feed face. peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|R

40|$|Three hazards, {{organic dust}} toxic {{syndrome}} (ODTS), confined spaces, and power take offs (PTOs) associated with farm machinery were discussed. ODTS {{is a little}} known respiratory illness that occurs following exposure to heavy concentrations of organic dusts contaminated with microorganisms. Because its symptoms, including general weakness, headache, chills, body aches, and cough, are similar {{to other forms of}} respiratory illness, it is often misdiagnosed and treated. Other common clinical characteristics of the illness included impaired pulmonary function, increase of white blood cells, and absence of antibodies typically associated with certain allergic lung disease, including farmer's lung with which it is most often confused. The risk of developing this illness can be reduced by being aware of the adverse effects of breathing organic dust when shoveling or moving organic materials such as oats, wood chips, composted leaves, and silage. Other risk reducing measures included: informing one's doctor of recent dust exposure when seeking treatment for respiratory illness, carefully harvesting and storing agricultural products to reduce spoilage, using automated or mechanized equipment to move decayed materials, using source containment, local exhaust ventilation, and wet methods of dust suppression, and using NIOSH approved respirators when exposure to organic dust cannot be avoided. Confined space hazards {{come in the form of}} manure <b>pits,</b> <b>silos,</b> vats, wells and digesters in the agricultural industry and present a multitude of risks including oxygen deficiency, flammable atmospheres, toxic gases, solvents, and mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic energy. Farm machinery presents the hazard of entanglement. A recent study reported that at least 346 farm workers aged 16 or older died from entanglement injuries between 1980 and 1989. Almost 10, 000 nonfatal entanglement injuries occurred between 1982 and 1986, 864 resulting in amputation, all caused by the use of inadequately guarded machinery and failure to follow proper safety precautions. Incidents of entanglement can be prevented by placing retrofit guards on farm equipment, disengaging the PTO, and turning off the tractor ignition before performing maintenance. DHHS publication; no.

40|$|In {{the prehistoric}} and {{historical}} archaeology of Western Europe {{there are plenty}} of examples of underground features, pits, interpreted as subterranean or underground granaries. In the south-west of the Iberian Peninsula, the idea of pits as storage spaces for grain has been very widespread {{since the end of the}} 19 th century, allowing for the interpretation of the countless underground features known, both within enclosed areas and in unenclosed pit sites, dating from the IV and III millennia BC (Neolithic and Copper Age), as silos. Some observers have gone beyond that: the notion of <b>pit</b> as <b>silo</b> has often been the starting point for scientific postulates arguing an intensification of agricultural activities and cultural complexity in the southern Iberian Copper Age. Therefore, the way archaeologists position themselves as regards this issue has considerable implications at the level of historical interpretation, beyond the simple attribution of functions to archaeological structures. In this paper we will challenge some of these ideas by reviewing the south-western Iberian Neolithic and Chalcolithic evidence and critically discussing the potential of south-western Iberian pits to be used for grain storage, as well as the scale of this activity...|$|R

The study was based on a literature survey of recent storage innovations, visits to countries in the SADC region and replies to questionnaires sent to agriculture ministries and other organisations to ascertain the extent to which improved procedures were being promoted and adopted. The reasons for storage, and the factors which may affect the choice of a particular storage system, are noted. The construction, uses, cost and efficiency of the six main storage methods (drying/storage crib, basket, metal tank, mud block/brick <b>silo,</b> <b>pit</b> and grain bag) are compared and contrasted; some suggestions for improvements are included. The problems with high-yielding, improved varieties of maize are assessed with reference to their retention on the farm.

40|$|In the {{background}} of the late-Holocene landscape of the Southern Valli Grandi Veronesi (VGVM) and nearby Bonifica Padana, an area that stretches between rivers Adige and Po and which is drained by the river Tartaro, was taken into consideration the position of a long embankment that ran through the territories of the two large moated sites of the middle and recent Bronze Age, Fondo Paviani (FP) to east, and Castello del Tartaro (CdT) to west. The location of this particular embankment called SAM (from italian southern embanked road), more than ten km long, and arranged parallel to the Tartaro old riparian belt, since long time attracted scholars as a witness of an old territorial organization, probably related to spatial distribution of cultivated or pasture by the communities who lived in the two large villages, bounded by massive ditch and bank systems. On the basis of recent acquisitions of new DEM and LIDAR sources and aimed field investigations, then merged into geo-chronological and chrono-typological analysis in the laboratory, was developed a research addressed the chrono-stratigraphic, cultural-evolutionary and functional scan of the SAM construct. For this purpose, the archaeological, stratigraphic and chronological record have been reviewed from a series of very significant off-sites, with stratigraphic columns documenting paleo-environmental and archaeological-functional reconstructions. They allowed to established the obvious links between the infrastructure of the ditches of the SAM embankment and the network of secondary rural ditches that seemed to drain and distribute waters in the parceled fields next to the large contemporary sites. In Ponte Moro off-site we captured the chrono-stratigraphic position of SAM embankment through the dating of two peat samples undertaken immediately before and after the stratigraphic position of the embankment. The datings have yielded an earliest date for the construction (MBA-RBA) and a later date of the abandonment of the earthen structure (RBA-FBA). In the Fosso Sarego off-site the stratigraphy documented the composition and the morphology of the embankment and its lateral ditches. These were connected with the neighboring ditches and drains, and especially with the droveway, a road of service for herding that crossed the cultivated area of the CdT near-site, to reach meadows and pastures of wetlands placed within the perifluvial r. Tartaro strechtes. On the sections and on open-area excavations at the Fosso Fazzion off-site were found the remains of anthropic surfaces, connected with the use of <b>pits</b> and <b>silos</b> well placed next to small sites (farms), corresponding to the first evidence of a stable-occupation of land, dating back to the transition between the EBA and MBA. In the Stanghelle off-site were detected morphologies of long pairs of rural ditches filled by manure from the nearby village and dated to a horizon of between EBA and MBA, similarly to Fazzion off-site. Finally at the near-site the so-called hydraulic- node of CdT, an open-area investigated at the intersection of drains protruding from the moat of the SE corral, ceramic fragments in situ dating to RBA were recovered, attesting the connections with irrigation ditches around small enclosed fields. The comparison of these datings, the relative chronology and stratigraphic relationships established between SAM, channels, ditches, and agrarian drains revealed the possibility of achieving a first definition of land organization in two agrarian-settlement phases for the two major CdT and FP sites. The archaeobotanist contribution from a first set of pollen analysis carried out from Ponte Moro samples, allowed to specify the important role of grass-grazing percent in relation of cultivated land and woodland, the latter testified by an higher percent of AP compared to the average of Emilian data. The chronological contribution from finds proposed here, concerned the analysis of a complete sample of ceramic material recovered from a intrasite excavation by F. Zorzi made around the mid of the last century and documented in a dissertation by Zanetti (1970 - 71). It allowed {{for the first time to}} present aspects of material culture (pottery facies), belonging to the first large RBA settlement of CdT, surrounded by the embanked. On these basis was initiated a revision of the stratigraphic position of the two samples for 14 C dating collected in the 90 ’s of the last century from the great embankment of CdT, both related to MBA/RBA. In the light of the analysis of the above mentioned ceramics, it was possible to discriminate a phase of MBA 3 nucleated site without bounding embankment, but probably with a moat, from the later phase of RBA with massive embankment and surrounded by multiple ditches. Finally, the juxtaposition of the two systems separated from the earthen bank of the SAM, first meadows and pastures, latter fields delimited by long ditches (maybe opened fields) and others small and closed, it has given rise to an important result directed to the definition of socio-political organisation which regulated this fundamental transect in the MBA-RBA for the economy and polity of VGVM near the sites of CDT and FP. The construction of the SAM embankment, erected to preserve the balanced distribution of lands allocated to support the two major sites, could therefore be reviewed as an expression of a huge collective work, continuously maintained, presumably demanded by the elite-polity of VGVM, to prevent the formation of peatlands. These, due to the rise of water table for paleoidrographic reasons, tended to invade the cultivated fields. This engineering earthwork had to play an important role for regulation and control for the drain and irrigation network made of main and secondary ditches extending to the nearby fields, before dissipating in the lower land of marginal pasture-wet meadows, next to fluvial woodland...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe open-air {{settlement}} of Limon-Raspail {{has been discovered}} in March 2005. It has been subject to a rescue excavation during spring 2005. This excavation was conducted {{under the direction of}} Jessie Cauliez and was headed by the Service Régional de l'Archéologie de Provence-Alpes-Côted'Azur. The site of Limon-Raspail is localized on a small hill at 350 m height and covers a surface of almost 15 000 square meters. The site dominates the Mormoiron depression in the south and the one of Bédoin in the north. The excavation carried out on a surface of 250 square meters has allowed discovery of a settlement organized around thirty-five pits. It is assigned to the Final Neolithic and dated to a time span of between 2880 and 2580 cal BC at most. This interval is based on six radiocarbon AMS dates made from faunal remains and charcoal all stemming from distinct features. Multiple occupations are possible as some of the pits overlap. As a matter of fact, with this in mind, the homogeneity of the pottery and lithic assemblages as well as the uniformity of all the radiocarbon measurements indicate that the different phases of pit digging have occurred within a rather short time span and that the site of Limon-Raspail is consistent from the chronological and cultural viewpoint. These pit features mirror an area of activities related to a dwelling. As a matter of fact, a group of rather deep pits with narrow shape was unearthed in the excavated sector. A form of <b>silo</b> <b>pit,</b> they may be destined for storage purposes. Associated with these storage features, fire places are also discovered, for example shallow pits or depressions as well as hearth structures. Large amounts of daub and unbaked clay found on the site are used for multiple purposes (artefacts, hearth features, sealing of storage features, rendering of the bottom). The importance of daub remains discovered in the pits suggests the presence of earth architecture: the large size of the identified fragments and the important dimensions of wattle imprints on those fragments at least testify to the presence of important elevations of settlement walls. This monographic paper presents an exhaustive description of all artefacts (pottery, lithics, ornaments, bone industry, axe blades, grinding tools) and construction remains discovered at Limon-Raspail. In addition, the pottery and the axe blades have been part of an advanced petrographical analysis. Furthermore, the results of the use wear analysis of the lithic industry are published here. Finally, the determination of the faunal remains allows detailed conclusion on the adopted food economy during the Final Neolithic occupation of the site. At Limon-Raspail, the artefacts can hardly be compared to the current assemblages, representing three main cultural groups invoked since almost thirty years {{in the construction of the}} chronological and cultural framework in this area of Southeastern France: the Fraischamp, the North Vaucluse and the Rhône-Ouvèze group. Yet, the site of Limon-Raspail is neighbouring the eponymous sites of these three groups. On the other hand, the location of the settlement, at the northern margins of Province adjacent to the central Rhone valley enables us to make broader comparison with the Drôme region (Allan and Les Bruyères groups), with the Saône-Rhône axis (groups of Lüscherz and Clairvaux) and with the Piedmont in Italy (Mont Viso group). The central Rhone valley thus appears to be at the crossroads of interaction processes connecting the different groups of Southern France to those of more eastern and northern regions. Established in a buffer zone, the site of Limon-Raspail is the only representative of the mecanisms that contribute to the development of multipolar margin groups and to the junction of the different cultural flows that structure the Final Neolithic. À Bédoin dans le Vaucluse, la fouille de sauvetage urgent du Limon- Raspail dirigée par J. Cauliez en 2005 a livré, sur une surface de 250 m 2, une trentaine d'aménagements creusés révélant l'existence d'un habitat relativement bien préservé et implanté en position privilégiée à près de 350 m d'altitude. Le site est daté du Néolithique final, entre 2880 et 2580 av. J. -C. Cette trentaine de structures en creux offre la vision d'une zone d'activités, là où se concentrent des foyers et des aménagements liés à la conservation, tous réutilisés comme dépotoirs. Voisin de sites éponymes à l'origine de l'identification de trois des quatre principales cultures du Néolithique final du sud-est de la France - les groupes Rhône-Ouvèze, de Fraischamp et du Nord-Vaucluse -, le gisement du Limon-Raspail ne s'accorde pas, sur le plan chronoculturel, avec l'un ou l'autre de ces ensembles. L'originalité du site peut s'expliquer par sa localisation dans une zone tampon. Il est à la limite nord des aires d'extension reconnues pour les groupes provençaux. Il s'inscrit également dans des flux de circulations alimentés par le Piémont italien; il pourrait être enfin en liaison avec des groupes de régions plus septentrionales, tels que ceux de l'axe Saône- Rhône, dont les influences seraient perceptibles, au Néolithique final, jusque dans la moyenne vallée du Rhône...|$|R
