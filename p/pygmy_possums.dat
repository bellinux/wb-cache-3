25|$|The {{national}} park covers almost both the Oâ€™Hares and Stokes Creek catchments. It contains significant biodiversity and ecosystems {{as well as}} Aboriginal culturally significant sites. It has high conservation significance within the region, especially due to the low disturbance within the park and limited public access. The landscape varies from gorges and waterfalls to upland swamps to sandstone woodland, rainforests, and eastern gully forests. The residents of the park include koalas, wallabies, wallaroos, platypuses, potoroos, <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> and many more animal species.|$|E
500|$|A {{great many}} bird {{species have been}} {{observed}} visiting this species. A 1982 study in the New England National Park in North-eastern New South Wales found that a large influx of Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris (eastern spinebill) coincided with the start of local B.spinulosas flowering. In the Blackdown Tableland, Lichenostomus leucotis (white-eared honeyeater) and Lichenostomus melanops (yellow-tufted honeyeater) as well as <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> visit B.spinulosa. Brown antechinus, sugar glider, and bush rat are also known to visit flowers. [...] Additional species seen in The Banksia Atlas survey include Phylidonyris nigra (white-cheeked honeyeater), Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera (crescent honeyeater), Meliphaga lewinii (Lewin's honeyeater), Lichmera indistincta (brown honeyeater), Manorina melanocephala (noisy miner), Philemon corniculatus (noisy friarbird), Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird) and Eopsaltria australis (eastern yellow robin).|$|E
2500|$|Banksias {{are heavy}} {{producers}} of nectar, making them {{an important source}} of food for nectivorous animals, including honeyeaters and small mammals such as rodents, antechinus, honey possums, <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums,</b> gliders and bats. [...] Many of these animals play a role in pollination of Banksia. Various studies have shown mammals and birds to be important pollinators. In 1978 Carpenter observed that some banksias had a stronger odour at night, possibly to attract nocturnal mammal pollinators. Other associated fauna include the larvae of moths (such as the Dryandra Moth) and weevils, which burrow into the [...] "cones" [...] to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and birds such as cockatoos, who break off the [...] "cones" [...] to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.|$|E
50|$|The western <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Cercartetus concinnus), {{also known}} as the southwestern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> or the mundarda, is a small {{marsupial}} found in Australia. Genetic studies indicate its closest relative is probably the eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> from which its ancestors diverged around eight million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Banksia <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Possum,</b> {{formerly}} Banksia Austraflora <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Possum,</b> {{and also}} {{known by its}} extended cultivar name Banksia serrata <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Possum,</b> is a registered Banksia cultivar. It is a sprawling, very low growing coastal form of Banksia serrata (Saw Banksia), with very small leaves and small inflorescences.|$|R
50|$|The Tasmanian <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Cercartetus lepidus), {{also known}} as the little <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> is the world's {{smallest}} possum. It was first described by Oldfield Thomas in 1888, after he identified that a museum specimen labelled as an eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> in fact represented a species then unknown to science. The holotype resides in the British Museum of Natural History.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> and {{eighteen}} {{species of}} reptile inhabit the park.|$|E
5000|$|Mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> have {{an annual}} {{reproductive}} cycle. Although females are polyestrous, {{the need for}} sufficient fat reserves during hibernation limits females to one litter per year. In order to ensure adequate fat reserves, female mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> will synchronize reproduction for the spring months, when Bogong moths are abundant. The breeding season typically occurs during the Austral spring months of October and November. During this time, males migrate to the higher elevation nesting sites of females to mate. Mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> then have an internal gestation period of 14-16 days after which the altricial young will enter the forward-facing pouch of the female. A female mountain pygmy possum has four teats, and a litter is usually three to four offspring. The young remain in the pouch for approximately 3 weeks, after which they remain at the nest for another 3-4 weeks. The offspring are then weaned at around 9-10 weeks. The mating system that occurs in Burramys parvus is resource defense polygyny. A philopatric group of females typically share a nest space within deep boulder crevices. The nest sites are generally areas of high densities of migrating Bogong moths. Shortly after mating season, females will drive the male <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> from the nest. The male mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> {{do not participate in}} parental care. Additionally, juvenile males are driven from the nest shortly after weaning. [...] As noted in all species of Burramyids, mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> become sexually mature by one year of age.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{threats to}} the {{mountain}} pygmy possum populations include habitat destruction and fragmentation, climate change, predation by feral cats and red foxes, and {{threats to the}} Bogong moth. The construction of ski resorts in the alpine regions in which the mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> inhabit {{has been one of}} the greatest factors attributed to population decline. At Mount Higginbotham, a major road constructed to the Mount Hotham ski resort prevented male mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> from migrating to the female nesting sites during the breeding season. This physical barrier was noted to markedly increase winter mortality in the Mount Higginbotham population. In response to this, an underground tunnel was constructed which provided male <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> with an alternative migratory route.|$|E

50|$|Research {{has also}} {{extended}} {{to identify the}} threats impacting {{the survival of the}} Bogong moth. This moth species is the preferred food source of mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums.</b> Their arrival during the spring months acts as a seasonal indicator signalling the end of hibernation for the possums. In addition, Bogong moths are rich in protein and fat and they provide mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> with the necessary energy reserves to sustain the seven month hibernation period.|$|E
50|$|Mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> are nocturnal creatures, {{preferring to}} sleep {{during the day}} and forage at night. While all other members of the family Burramyidae are arboreal, the {{mountain}} pygmy possum is a terrestrial species. The preferred habitat of these <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> is within deep boulderfields in alpine regions of Southern Australia. The females tend to stay in familial groups of up to 10 related individuals. Females also tend to be relatively sedentary and exhibit high nest site fidelity.|$|E
50|$|Male {{mountain}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums,</b> on {{the other}} hand, tend to be solitary, leaving nesting sites as juveniles to take residence in lower elevations of the mountain ranges. For this reason, male mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> generally suffer higher mortality than females as the boulderfields appear to offer some protection from predation. Burramys parvus is noted {{to be the only}} small mammal in Australia that hibernates seasonally for long periods of time. All other members of Burramyidae are capable of opportunistic hibernation.|$|E

You need a guide to Australian mammals. Peter Menkhorst and Frank Knight have given us what will undoubtedly become the field guide of choice for anyone interested in Australian mammals...|$|R
50|$|Mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> {{prefer to}} feed on Bogong moths which make up {{about a third of}} their diet. This moth species (Agrotis infusa) migrates to the high alpine {{mountain}}ous regions during the spring and summer months. During these months, mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> utilize Bogong moths as their principal food source. In the autumn months, Bogong moths depart from the mountain ranges and mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> must supplement their diets with fruits and seeds. Burramys parvis species will supplement their diet with the mountain plum pine from the fruit-bearing conifer Podocarpus lawrencei as well as seeds from the snow beard-heaths Leucopogon spp. and blackberry Rubus spp. Upon finding food, the mountain pygmy possum will first smell the food source before picking it up with its incisors. It will then transfer the item to its forelimbs so that it may manipulate the food and tear off pieces of flesh.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife has {{implemented}} captive {{breeding programmes}} under {{the support and}} guidance of Linda Broome and her colleagues. In addition, Zoos Victoria has also {{become involved in the}} effort to sustain the remaining populations of mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums.</b> The Zoos Victoria started a captive breeding programme for B. parvus in 2007 in the Healesville Sanctuary. The programme currently cares for a population of 45 mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums.</b> Their overall goal is to down-list the mountain pygmy possum to a lower-threat category on the IUCN Redlist.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{change is}} another {{serious threat to}} the {{mountain}} pygmy possum. Burramys parvus is the only Australian mammal which is completely restricted to the alpine regions. The species is well adapted to the seasonal availability of Bogong moths and other food resources. Although data from New South Wales and Victoria are still pending, preliminary models suggest that reduced survival of mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> can be related to declining snow cover and shorter winters. Studies conducted at Kosciuszko National Park revealed that the period of snow cover was diminished by an average of 10 days and snow melt occurred approximately 15 days earlier. Linda Broome and her group of researchers determined that, while hibernation sites appeared well insulated despite lack of snow, snow cover provides additional protection to the mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> during the coldest months. This added layer of insulation is believed to promote prolonged torpor and decrease waking intervals which can deplete energy stores and decrease possum survival. As a suggested solution to this environmental disturbance, Broome and her colleagues proposed moving the remaining populations of mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> from their alpine habitats to lower elevation temperate rainforests. This solution is based on previous husbandry efforts, which showed that mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> did not require a period of hibernation at environmental temperatures above 12 ËšC.|$|E
5000|$|Rosenberg's goanna (Varanus rosenbergi), eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Cercartetus nanus), and the {{squirrel}} glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) are species listed as vulnerable which inhabit the park.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> {{was first}} {{discovered in the}} fossil record in 1895 when {{a portion of the}} jaw and skull bones were found in the Wombeyan Caves in central New South Wales. At the time, the species was believed to be extinct. It was not until 1966 that a living individual was found at a ski resort at Mount Hotham in Victoria. Since that time, the mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> has been located in three isolated, genetically distinct populations in the alpine regions of southern Australia.|$|R
50|$|Burramys is a genus of {{the family}} Burramyidae, and is {{represented}} by one living and 3 extinct (fossil) species. It {{is one of two}} genera of <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> the other being Cercartetus.|$|R

50|$|Phalangeriformes are quadrupedal diprotodont {{marsupials}} {{with long}} tails. The smallest species, indeed the smallest diprotodont marsupial, is the Tasmanian <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> {{with an adult}} head-body length of 70 mm and a weight of 10 g. The largest are the two species of bear cuscus which may exceed 7 kg. Phalangeriformes species are typically nocturnal and at least partially arboreal. They inhabit most vegetated habitats, and several species have adjusted well to urban settings. Diets range from generalist herbivores or omnivores (the common brushtail possum) to specialist browsers of eucalyptus (greater glider), insectivores (mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum)</b> and nectar-feeders (honey possum).|$|R
