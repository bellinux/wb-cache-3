40|$|The {{realization}} of NextGen capabilities will require rapid deployment of revised airline cockpit <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> the pre-requisite training and proficiency checks.

The tools capture the <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> tasks to be trained in a formal model that is stored in a data-base.

The Royal Malaysian Navy refit <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> strategies which are based on the Royal Navy's procedures, are currently facing increasing drawbacks and the delay of ships in refit often goes beyond the acceptable period of thirty days.
