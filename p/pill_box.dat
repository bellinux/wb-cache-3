5|$|In 1913 the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act {{was passed}} by Parliament and Pembroke College took the {{opportunity}} to place Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. The undulating Inner Court was levelled up to its present form as part of the Commissioner's maintenance works. During the Second World War, Framlingham was an important defensive location for British forces; at least one concrete <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> was built near to the castle as part of the plans to counter any German invasion, and Nissen huts were erected and a lorry park created in the Bailey.|$|E
25|$|The {{system had}} {{multiple}} radars during the different phases including the <b>Pill</b> <b>Box</b> and Hen House early warning systems, and the Dog House and Cat House target acquisitioning systems. The A-35 with radar {{was designed by}} Chief Designer K. B. Kisunko.|$|E
25|$|Radar {{systems were}} tested with Duna-3 single {{direction}} search radar and the Dunay-3U omni-direction 360-degree search radar, designed by V. P. Sosulnikov and A. N. Musatov, respectively. A more advanced system of radars were included, the Don-2N System; {{consisting of the}} 6000km long-range early warning systems, (NATO code names <b>Pill</b> <b>Box</b> and Hen House), and the 2800km short-range target acquisition radars (NATO codenames Dog House and Cat House).|$|E

25|$|The {{battalion}} then {{participated in}} the attack on St. Marc, and although subjected to exceptionally heavy 88mm fire, {{found it necessary to}} move to positions fully visible to the Germans so they could place direct fire on German installations. Two platoons entered the city of Brest on 11 September, following closely on the heels of advancing infantry. During the engagement, they received intense sniper fire. Gun crews knocked out a <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> and several enemy observation posts during the day.|$|E
25|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{is presented}} as having been modernised, following the installation of electric power and an Aga cooker in the scullery, although the main kitchen still has the typical coal fired black range. Lino flooring allowed quicker cleaning times, while a radio set allowed the family to keep up to date with war time news. An office next to the kitchen would have served as both the administration centre for the war time farm, and as a local Home Guard office. Outside the farmhouse is an improvised Home Guard <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> fashioned from half an egg ended steam boiler, relocated from its original position near Durham.|$|E
2500|$|Black, gold-veined onyx {{is used in}} the Darling Street foyer, {{the ceiling}} of which is over 15 metres high and {{finished}} with gold leaf, laid by Italian workmen. The view of the glass window over the door to the banking hall (above) shows the iconic ziggurat shape of the building etched into the glass. Visitors must climb 17 steps {{to gain access to the}} banking hall, and towards the top they are met by the original [...] "pill box" [...] where security staff can observe who (and what) is entering and leaving the building. On either side of the <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> are the entrances to the main lifts [...] two on the left and two on the right (there are two [...] "staff" [...] lifts and one [...] "service" [...] lift elsewhere in the building).|$|E

25|$|Less {{than six}} months later, {{he was killed in}} action leading a scout-sniper platoon in the attack on Betio Island during the assault on Tarawa. During the two-day assault, 1stLt Hawkins led attacks on <b>pill</b> <b>boxes</b> and installations, {{personally}} initiated an assault on a hostile position fortified by five enemy machine guns, refused to withdraw after being seriously wounded and destroyed three more <b>pill</b> <b>boxes</b> before he was mortally wounded on November 21, 1943. For his actions above and beyond the call of duty, 1st Lt Hawkins posthumously received the Medal of Honor.|$|R
50|$|In 1940, some 13-pounders {{were brought}} out of store {{for use as}} {{emergency}} anti-tank guns, mounted in <b>pill</b> <b>boxes,</b> for the home defence of Britain against possible German invasion.|$|R

60|$|Trembling with excitement, {{she brushed}} lightly the white lids of Avery's eyes. Avery stirred and opened them. Janet guiltily thrust her <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> behind her.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Matilda was {{laughing}} a little--as {{she always did}} when Randall came. It was a habit with her, hanging over {{from the early days}} of Randall's courtship. Janet went on into their room to tell Avery. And lo, Avery was lying asleep on her bed, tired out from her busy day. Janet, after one glance, flew to her chest. She took out her <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> and opened it, a little fearfully. The toad ointment was there, dark and unpleasant enough to view. Janet tiptoed breathlessly to the bed and gingerly scraped the tip of her finger in the ointment.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II; Limpert Bay's defences formed {{part of the}} Western Command's coast [...] "crust" [...] defences for the Vale of Glamorgan. Defences {{included}} anti-tank cubes, <b>pill</b> <b>boxes,</b> and an anti-tank ditch.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh--I just--wanted a walk--this lovely day," [...] said Janet miserably. She {{felt that}} she was telling an untruth and this hurt her horribly--especially when it was to Randall. This was what came of truck with witches--you were led into {{falsehood}} and deception straightaway. Again Janet was tempted to drop Granny's <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> into the depths of Burnley Pond--and again she decided not to because she saw Randall Burnley's deep-set, blue-grey eyes, that could look tender or sorrowful or passionate or whimsical as he willed, and thought how they would look when he found Avery did not love him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I sees it all afore {{me every}} time I shuts my eyes. Lordy, sir, you wouldn't hardly believe how clear it is to me. There's our line from the {{paregoric}} bottle right along to the snuff box. D'ye see? Well, then, the <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> is for Hougoumont on the right--where we was--and Norah's thimble for La Haye Sainte. There it is, all right, sir; and here were our guns, and here behind the reserves and the Belgians. Ach, them Belgians!" [...] He spat furiously into the fire. [...] "Then here's the French, where my pipe lies; and over here, where I put my baccy pouch, was the Proosians a-comin' up on our left flank. Jimini, {{but it was a}} glad sight to see the smoke of their guns!" ...|$|E
60|$|Having got her ointment, {{the next}} thing was {{to make use of}} it. This was not so easy--because, in the first place, it must not be done when there was any danger of Avery's seeing some other than Randall first--and it must be done without Avery's knowing it. The two {{problems}} combined were almost too much for Janet. She bided her chance like a watchful cat--but it did not come. Two weeks went by and it had not come. Janet was getting very desperate. The wedding day was only a week away. The bride's cake was made and the turkeys fattened. The invitations were sent out. Janet's own bridesmaid dress was ready. And still the little <b>pill</b> <b>box</b> in the till of Janet's blue chest was unopened. She had never even opened it, lest virtue escape.|$|E
