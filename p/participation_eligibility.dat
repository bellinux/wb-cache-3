Restrictive eligibility criteria can protect manufacturer and operator from liability for injury, since no guest could sustain injury without exposure to the ride. However, new forms of liability have emerged, through litigation under general human rights codes or specific regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This paper describes and compares two approaches to more specifically determining <b>participation</b> <b>eligibility</b> for guests with disabilities and health conditions: the medical approach and the human factors engineering approach. Although many conditions are manifest in a range of severities, the medical approach will either impose the most restrictive eligibility on all guests with the same disability type, or require park personnel to make diagnostic determinations outside their expertise, and requires compilation of data about every disability and condition. The human factors engineering approach identifies functions to be performed by the guest to fulfill the ride experience. Clear description of functions and risks will enable guests to determine whether they are able to safely ride, in consultation with their own advisors. The approach to determining eligibility affects not only whether a particular guest can ride, but also operational practices that affect guests’ relationship with the park...|$|E

However, there are significant implementation obstacles to accessing the world's forest carbon sequestration potential. The timing of regional <b>participation</b> and <b>eligibility</b> of sequestration activities are issues. The existing forest carbon supply estimates have made optimistic assumptions about immediate, comprehensive, and global access. They have also assumed no interactions between activities and regions, and over time. We use a global forest and land use model to evaluate these assumptions with more realistic forest carbon policy pathways. We find that an afforestation only policy is fundamentally flawed, accelerated deforestation may be unavoidable, and a delayed comprehensive program could reduce, but not eliminate, near-term accelerated deforestation and eventually produce sequestration equivalent to idealized policies – but with a different sequestration mix than previously estimated by others and thereby different forests. We also find that afforestation and avoided deforestation increase the cost of one another. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{the context}} of battling the aftereffects of severe {{economic}} downturns like the Great Recession, however, this perspective may be inappropriate. Compared with hiring credits targeting the disadvantaged, more explicit counter-recessionary hiring credits could be more effective. And although the official end date of the Great Recession is now well behind us, and labor markets are recovering, there are continuing problems of long durations of unemployment, 3 and research points to specific difficulties of the long-term unemployed in finding new jobs (Kroft et al., 2013). A broader hiring credit focused on the unemployed or {{those who have been}} out of the labor force may avoid the problem of stigma, because with high unemployment rates and low <b>participation</b> rates, <b>eligibility</b> for a hiring credit based on current unemployment or non-participation may not send employers much of a bad signal. Kroft et al. (2013) provide evidence consistent with this idea. In particular, they find evidence that employers pay attention to labor market conditions in interpreting unemployment as a negative signal. While employers are less likely to call back those unemployed for a longer spell, the stigmatizing effect of a long unemployment spell is weaker in a slacker labor market. Conversely, of course, the effectiveness of such credits in helping the long-term unemployed as the labor market tightens could decline, as stigma concerns associated with long-term unemployment strengthen.|$|R

One source of determining the accuracy of the SIPP income reports is to benchmark survey estimates to independent aggregate estimates such as the National Income and Products Accounts (NIPA), Social Security Administration (SSA) records, and tax return data. Some studies using these benchmarks suggest hat nationally weighted SIPP survey income estimates are consistently below income amounts from benchmark aggregates. Moore, Stinson and Welniak (1997) present a review of income measurement error studies and make several observations regarding income measurement i the SIPP.

The contribution to total hours worked by people of working age of women aged 45 to 64 years has increased from just over 6 per cent in 1979 to almost 15 per cent in 2009. Moreover, their contribution increased relative to other age groups, with their share of total hours worked by women of working age rising from 21 per cent to 38 per cent. These trends reflect greater societal acceptance of women in the workforce, increased education levels of women and greater diversity of household living arrangements. Increasing involvement of mature aged women in the workforce is also related to greater diversity in working arrangements, including growth in part time employment and increased workplace flexibility. In summary, the survey evidence of mature aged women’s reasons for retiring and the international evidence of <b>participation</b> rates and <b>eligibility</b> ages for pensions suggest that changing age pension eligibility requirements will be factors for consideration by some mature aged women when deciding to retire. But the extent to which such changes will increase the overall participation rate of mature aged women is uncertain. Many other factors also affect the decision of mature aged women to retire. They include sufficient workplace flexibility to allow working hours to be tailored to individual preferences, whether their partner is working, whether they have caring responsibilities and their own health status...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In September 2015, Nigeria {{was removed}} from the list of polio-endemic {{countries}} after more than 12 months had passed since the detection of last wild poliovirus case in the country on 24 July 2014. We are presenting here a report of two polio seroprevalence surveys conducted in September 2013 and October 2014, respectively, in the Kano state of northern Nigeria. METHODS: Health facility based seroprevalence surveys were undertaken at Murtala Mohammad Specialist Hospital, Kano. Parents or guardians of children aged 6 - 9 months, 36 - 47 months, 5 - 9 years and 10 - 14 years in 2013 and 6 - 9 months and 19 - 22 months (corresponding to 6 - 9 months range at the time of 2013 survey) in 2014 presenting to the outpatient department, were approached for <b>participation,</b> screened for <b>eligibility</b> and asked to provide informed consent. A questionnaire was administered and a blood sample collected for polio neutralization assay. RESULTS: Among subjects aged 6 - 9 months in the 2013 survey, seroprevalence was 58 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 51 - 66 %) to poliovirus type 1, 42 % (95 % CI 34 - 50 %) to poliovirus type 2, and 52 % (95 % CI 44 - 60 %) to poliovirus type 3. Among children 36 - 47 months and older, seroprevalence was 85 % or higher for all three serotypes. In 2014, seroprevalence in 6 - 9 month infants was 72 % (95 % CI 65 - 79 %) for type 1, 59 % (95 % CI 52 - 66 %) for type 2, and 65 % (95 % CI 57 - 72 %) for type 3 and in 19 - 22 months, 80 % (95 % CI 74 - 85 %), 57 % (49 - 63 %) and 78 % (71 - 83 %) respectively. Seroprevalence was positively associated with history of increasing oral poliovirus vaccine doses. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant improvement in seroprevalence in 2014 over the 2013 levels indicating a positive impact of recent programmatic interventions. However the continued low seroprevalence in 6 - 9 month age is a concern and calls for improved immunization efforts to sustain the polio-free Nigeria...|$|R

This work presents preliminary results of recruitment in the first Portuguese National Health Examination Survey (INSEF) comparing participants and non participants. INSEF is a cross-sectional prevalence study targeting 4200 individuals aged 25 – 74 years, living in Portugal for more than 12 months, non-institutionalized and able to follow an interview in Portuguese. Fieldwork started in February 2015 and to date 9 / 49 examination sites are completed. Selected individuals received an invitation letter and later were contacted by phone to schedule the appointment. Individuals were then classified in participants, refusals and of unknown <b>eligibility.</b> <b>Participation</b> rates were calculated according to European Health Examination Survey guidelines. Reasons for refusals were recorded and non participant’s characteristics analysed. Chi square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare participants and non participants regarding age, sex, education level, marital status, smoking, use of medication and of healthcare services. 1467 of the 2161 selected individuals were successfully contacted. Overall participation rate was 42 %(n = 882), ranging between 27 – 54 % by examination site. 49 % of the 512 refusals accepted {{to respond to a}} short questionnaire for non participants. The main reasons for non participation were lack of time (27. 6 %) and professional reasons (22. 4 %). No significant differences were found {{for the majority of the}} analysed variables. Participants were found to be more frequently users of medication (p < 0. 001) and to have between 45 – 54 years old (p = 0. 023). To date the planed participation rate of 40 % was successfully achieved at national level. Results obtained showed the need to implement strategies to engage in participation specific target groups. To mitigate selection bias adjustment of sampling weights for non response should be done.
