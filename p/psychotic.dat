5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. <b>Psychotic</b> symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief <b>psychotic</b> disorder, and various conditions may be classed as <b>psychotic</b> disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside <b>psychotic</b> symptoms. If the <b>psychotic</b> symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E

5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce <b>psychotic</b> schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like <b>psychotic</b> symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
40|$|A psychoticism {{questionnaire}} was designed constituting 110 questions framed {{on the basis}} of the following constructs: desocialization, paranoia, thought disorder, depression, perceptual disturbance, superstitions and mania. In the initial tryout, it was administered to 40 <b>psychotics,</b> 40 neurotics and 40 normals and 40 items inadequately discriminating between <b>psychotics</b> and normals/neurotics were deleted. The revised {{questionnaire was}} administered, in second tryout, to 50 <b>psychotics,</b> 50 neurotics and 50 normals. The results were again subjected to item analysis and 10 more items were deleted as they could not discriminate significantly between neurotics and <b>psychotics</b> or where they discriminated between normals and neurotics. Kuder-Richardson formula 20 was used for reliability and criterion validity was assessed by comparing the three diagnositic groups with one another. Both these were satisfactory. Thus a psychoticism questionnaire of 60 items was constructed...|$|R
40|$|A psychoticism {{questionnaire}} in Hindi {{consisting of}} 60 items was standardised by administering it to 100 <b>psychotics</b> (schizophrenics and manic-depressives), 100 neurotics, 100 psychiatrically normal relatives of <b>psychotics</b> and 100 normals. The mean psychoticism score (P-score) of <b>psychotics,</b> neurotics, relatives and normals were 30. 69, 13. 63, 13. 85 and 8. 83 respectively, {{were significantly different}} from one another except for the difference between neurotics and relatives. The scores in each diagnostic group were normally distributed. Reliability as measured by Kuder-Richardson formula, split half, and test-retest methods gave coefficients between. 62 and. 88. Criterion validity as measured by comparing the diagnostic groups according to proportion of subjects in top, middle and bottom thirds; concurrent validity as assessed by correlating the P-score with scores obtained on PEN scale and on Paranoid and Depression sub-scales of Personality Traits Inventory nad cross-validity studied by comparing our scores on <b>psychotics</b> with those obtained at three other centres in India were satisfactory. The questionnaire could well discriminate between <b>psychotics</b> and non-psychotics, and a satisfactory cut-off point has been suggested for this...|$|R

5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing <b>psychotic</b> syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. <b>Psychotic</b> symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

40|$|The authors revised Assertion Inventory (Murayama et al., 1989). The {{new version}} {{consists}} of Restriction Scale and Assertion-Aggression Scale. Restriction Scale, which has 30 items, measures {{the degree of}} restriction in assertive behaviors. Assertion-Aggression Scale has 35 items. It is for the measurement of the manner of assertive behaviors. Low Assertion?Aggression scores indicate the aggressive manner. The new inventory was administered to 498 people (ages 15 - 30 years). They were divided into 4 groups; normals, delinquents, neurotics, and <b>psychotics.</b> The mean Restriction scores of neurotics and <b>psychotics</b> were {{higher than those of}} normals and delinquents.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} <b>psychotic</b> symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other <b>psychotic</b> disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

5|$|Mild {{impairment}} {{of attention and}} concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible (including <b>psychotic</b> states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication.

In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E

With <b>psychotics,</b> Fromm-Reichmann sees in stereotypies a compromise between a tendency to express certain (tender or hostile) object impulses and the tendency to repress these impulses for fear of rebuff.

5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against <b>psychotic</b> behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E

Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a <b>psychotic</b> killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E
