500|$|After {{the fall}} of the Wall, {{criminal}} investigations into border killings were launched by the Investigating Agency for Governmental and Party Crimes (ZERV) and the Berlin public prosecutor's office. Each of these institutions used different criteria to count deaths. In 2000, the ZERV compared data from the central registration office in Salzgitter with findings in GDR archives and made a total of 122 cases of targeted killing by GDR state organs at the border to West-Berlin. This list was a <b>pre-inquiry</b> for the prosecution departments of Berlin and Neuruppin, which in turn gave attention to legal processing. The Salzgitter registry recorded incidents in which [...] "suspicion of a criminal act was justified", while the Arbeitsgruppe 13 August, which also manages the house at Checkpoint Charlie and is run by the artist Alexandra Hildebrandt, widow of the founder Rainer Hildebrandt, counted [...] "all victims who died in connection with flight and/or the border regime", including deaths by accidents or drowning, or deaths of border soldiers and policemen in suicides or firearms accidents. [...] This gave them the figure of 235 deaths compared to the significantly lower number of 78 according to the Salzgitter registry.|$|E
50|$|After the 2015 Canadian federal election, the Liberal Government upheld their {{campaign}} promise and announced {{the initiation of}} a national inquiry on December 9, 2015. The Canadian government had <b>pre-inquiry</b> meetings {{with a variety of}} people including families, front-line workers, the provinces and Indigenous organizations from December 2015 through February 2016, in order to determine how the inquiry will be structured. The mandate of the inquiry and the length of time of the inquiry were published August 3, 2016. The estimated cost is $53.8 million. In addition, the government announced $16.17 million over four years to create family information liaison units in each province and territory.|$|E
40|$|THE INSPECTOR: We will {{commence}} the Public Inquiry {{into the}} Annaghmore Road/Bellshill Road Castledawson this morning. I {{want to say}} good morning everyone and welcome today. For {{those of you who}} have been to the <b>pre-inquiry</b> meeting on 2 nd September you will have heard most of what I have to say, what I said then I have to repeat today. However, I have some additional points that I wish to make now that we have reached the Inquiry itself. As a matter of introduction for those who are not aware, I am Eileen Brady and I have been appointed as the lead inspector responsible for conducting the Public Inquiry into the published Vesting Order concerning proposals to acquire lands for the construction of a junction to connect the Annaghmore and Bellshill Roads at Castledawson to proposed A 6 Toome to Castledawson Dual Carriageway. I have a background in law as a qualified barrister. I presently am part-time chair of the Exceptional Circumstances Body, appeal body. I chair a Professional Regulatory Conduct Committee and have acted as Assistant Electora...|$|E
30|$|The Teacher Inquiry Rubric (TIR) is a four-level rubric {{assessing}} teacher {{proficiency in}} guiding {{students to develop}} necessary skills in science questioning, investigating, explaining, communicating, and applying science knowledge to a new situation (Nugent et al. 2011). Within {{each of the six}} constructs, there are four levels: “pre-inquiry,” “developing inquiry,” “proficient inquiry,” and “exemplary inquiry.” For a validity check, only the evaluation of communicating construct was compared with the CDAT coding results. Cory’s level of communication by TIR rubrics was rated as level 3 by the two coaches. The coaches also pointed out the teacher used guiding questions and helped students understand the data. Ben’s communication level rated by TIR is level 1.5 (between <b>pre-inquiry</b> and developing inquiry) that is consistent with CDAT coding results (Fig.  5) with extremely limited numbers of reasoning components and simple IRE discourse patterns. The coaches also made a note that the teacher provided most of the questions, and students’ responses were very limited. However, Ann’s communication level by TIR was assessed as level 1 that is not consistent with the CDAT coding results (Fig.  4). Again, this result shows that CDAT coding does not provide information about the quality of teacher questions and students’ answers, but rather CDAT describes the patterns.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study adds to {{a growing}} body of {{research}} around inquiry-based instruction with the use of mobile devices in STEM classrooms. Through the social constructivist paradigm, descriptive research was conducted with the intent of gaining an understanding of the influence a mobile device (iPad) has on the quantity and quality of inquiry-based instruction in a STEM learning environment within a science classroom. A purposeful selection of sixth, seventh, and eighth grade science classrooms were observed in a single-gender middle school currently seeking STEM certification in an urban school district. Participants in this study included three science teachers who are currently teaching in a middle school, seeking STEM program certification and are working to implement inquiry based strategies in their classrooms to increase STEM literacy. The measure of inquiry-based instruction was conducted through the Electronic Quality of Inquiry Protocol (EQUIP). EQUIP was designed to provide a framework for evaluating the quality and quantity of inquiry-based instruction in science and math classrooms. This qualitative case study includes demographic information, classroom observations to measure the quality and quantity of inquiry instruction, and teacher and student narratives. The intent was to assess inquiry-based instruction in the STEM learning environment. Through 25 classroom observations of sixth, seventh, and eight grade science classrooms, findings for this study showed promising results around the use of a mobile device on the quantity and quality of inquiry-based instruction in a STEM learning environment. The study presented an operable definition around inquiry-based instruction. These strategies were the central focus for the study. Inquiry practices identified to have been facilitated around the use of the iPad in a STEM learning environment were examining sources of information, planning investigations, and communicating results. According to the EQUIP rubric, which scores inquiry instruction on a continuum that includes the following levels: <b>Pre-Inquiry,</b> Developing Inquiry, Proficient Inquiry and Exemplary Inquiry. The quality and quantity of inquiry instruction identified in this study occurred at Developing Inquiry. This study concluded that a mobile device (iPad) could aid in the use and implementation of inquiry instruction. However, it also became clear that simply introducing a mobile device to instruction didn’t ensure that high levels of inquiry based instruction were taking place...|$|E
