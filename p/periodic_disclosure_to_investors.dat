40|$|In this paper, I {{explore the}} {{mechanics}} of social disclosure in Canada. In section II, I review {{the extent to which}} Canadian companies have been reporting social information. In section III, I canvass the degree <b>to</b> which such <b>disclosure</b> is actually required under securities law vis-a`-vis the continuous disclosure obligation that requires public companies to provide <b>periodic</b> and timely <b>disclosure</b> <b>to</b> <b>investors.</b> I focus on three of the key components of <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> - quarterly/annual financial statements, the management discussion and analysis and, most importantly, the annual information form. Although many firms are underreporting, it is clear that a sufficient legal basis exists <b>to</b> compel the <b>disclosure</b> of material social information. However, various weaknesses limit the potential of existing provisions and arguably facilitate corporate opacity. As such, in section IV I provide a set of recommendations that I hope will serve to enhance the social disclosure landscape...|$|R

40|$|Provisions in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 {{have made}} it much easier for firms <b>to</b> avoid federal <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> obligations, but these {{provisions}} were enacted based upon a virtually nonexistent legislative record and upended rules established only after careful consideration almost fifty years earlier.

Building on this historical and economic understanding of <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> regulation, I identify a flaw in the underlying structure of the rules currently used to determine when firms must make <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosures.</b> <b>To</b> rectify this structural problem, I conclude that firms with a market capitalization of less than $ 35 million or fewer than one hundred beneficial shareholders should be granted an automatic exemption from <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements. All other firms should be provided a choice between: (1) complying with federal <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> obligations, or (2) implementing measures that would mitigate the need for <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> regulation, such as severely restricting the tradability of the firm’s shares or committing to an acceptable alternative disclosure regime...|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} that the {{transition}} between private- and public-company status could be less bumpy if we unify the public-private dividing line under the Securities Act and Exchange Act. The insight builds on Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s thought experiment where Congress first enacted the Exchange Act. My proposed public-private standard would take the company-registration model to its logical conclusion. The customary path to public-company status is through an IPO, typically with simultaneous listing of the shares on an exchange.

However, operational risk does not mediate the flow-performance relationship, suggesting that investors either lack this information, or they do not regard it as material.

40|$|Crowdfunding is a {{term used}} in many {{different}} contexts. The conversation surrounding crowdfunding encompasses diverse considerations and interests. In its broadest sense, crowdfunding is a technological fundraising medium for businesses, projects, or charitable causes. Instead of dealing with a financial institution or specific angel investors or venture capital funds, crowdfunded start-ups try to raise money from a worldwide 2 ̆ 2 crowd. 2 ̆ 2 Some crowdfunding campaigns solicit donations and pre-orders, such as Kickstarter or Gofundme. Others sell securities. This Comment will only address the rules that apply to crowdfunding campaigns which offer securities. Securities laws have two prime directives. First, companies can only offer and sell securities in a registered offering or in an offering that satisfies the requirements of an exemption from registration. Second, these businesses must not misstate material facts or omit material facts if the omission would make its other <b>disclosures</b> misleading <b>to</b> <b>investors.</b> Primarily, the JOBS Act and other crowdfunding laws focus on the first prime directive. They create exemptions from registration that allow businesses to crowdfund, utilize general solicitation and, in some cases, offer and sell securities <b>to</b> non-accredited <b>investors.</b> These new exemptions present exciting and important changes that democratize the capital raising process by allowing new subsets of businesses to communicate with a broader investor base than ever before. This Comment will briefly discuss these updated exemptions with a particular focus on Title II of the JOBS Act and the related SEC Rule 506 (c), as well as Title IV of the JOBS Act and what some call Regulation A+. Both Rule 506 (c) and Regulation A+ are revolutionary because they change who may talk <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> and the technologies {{that may be used}} to reach them. The primary focus of this Comment is to discuss these securities laws 2 ̆ 7 requirements for <b>disclosures</b> <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> in light of the brave new world crowdfunding offers.

These challenges require such new issuers to comply with traditional securities disclosure rules when they are talking to a less sophisticated crowd of investors than ever before utilizing new technological platforms that are constantly evolving. This Comment discusses how and why an issuer taking advantage of these updated exemptions might inadvertently violate securities disclosure laws when the speaker changes, the audience changes, or the disclosure platform changes, and how to avoid potential traps these changes create when paired with newly available disclosure platforms...|$|R
