[...] He bases this conclusion on three premises:First, discounted bundles are commonly offered by firms having no market power whatsoever, and therefore no special suspicion should arise when dominant firms offer them. Second, the common offering of bundles is due to numerous efficiency advantages {{from the point of}} view of producers and consumers. Third—and the reason that above-cost bundles should not be just presumptively lawful but per se lawful—fact finders are not able reliably to distinguish between efficient bundles and those whose anticompetitive effects outweigh efficiency. Discounted bundles are an area in which the medical profession's oath [...] "first do no harm" [...] is fully applicable.

At the onset of the crisis, there was high market supply, high prices, and available credit for both the producer and consumer. The U.S. government continued to instill inflationary policy following World War I. By June 1920, crop prices averaged 31 percent above 1919 and 121 percent above prewar prices of 1913. Also, farm land prices rose 40 percent from 1913 to 1920. Crops of 1920 cost more to produce than any other year. Eventually, a <b>price</b> <b>break</b> began in July 1920 which squeezed farmers between both decreasing agricultural prices and steady industrial prices[...] Examples of decreasing agriculture prices include: By 1933, Cotton was only 5.5 cents per pound, corn was down 19.4 cents per bushel, and hogs declined to $2.94 instead of their respective 1909-1914 average prices of 12.4 cents per pound, to 83.6 cents per bushel, and $7.24 per hog. Furthermore, a region of the great plains was hit by an extreme drought which added to the agricultural difficulties of the time.|$|E

In fuzzy environments, {{the availability of}} the quantity discount makes the analysis of the associated model more complex. The proposed analysis method is based on ranking fuzzy number and optimization theory. By applying the Yager ranking method, the fuzzy total cost functions with different unit purchasing costs are transformed into convex piecewise nonlinear functions. To effectively and efficiently find the optimal inventory policy, the proofs of two properties regarding the relative position between the <b>price</b> <b>break</b> and minimums of these nonlinear functions are proposed. The closed-form solutions to the optimal order quantities are also derived. Four cases of a numerical example are solved to demonstrate the validity of the proposed analysis method. It is clear that the proposed methodology is applicable to further cases with different types of quantity discounts and other more complicated cases. More importantly, managerial implications are also provided for decision-makers' references. Fuzzy sets Inventory Incremental discounts Newsboy problem Single-period problem...|$|E
40|$|A "manufacturer" {{supplies}} a "staple" {{product to}} {{a large number of}} "retailers" having very different sales volumes. Many models have considered how the "manufacturer" should design a quantity-discount (QD) scheme to induce the retailers to order in larger batch sizes. Our models differ from most existing ones in three aspects. First, we consider situations with a much larger number of retailers. Second, our manufacturer does not need to coordinate her replenishment cycles with those of the retailers. Third, besides "QD" schemes, we also consider "handling-charge reduction" ("HCR") schemes (i. e., a retailer pays a lower handling charge if his order is sufficiently large). We develop models and solution procedures for designing QD and HCR schemes that maximize the manufacturer's expected gain. We consider schemes with one as well as two "price breaks" (i. e., order size(s) needed to qualify for a QD or HCR). Examples of noteworthy characteristics revealed by our analytical and numerical analyses are (i) an optimal QD scheme will have a high enough <b>price</b> <b>break</b> such that extremely few retailers will be big enough to get a "free" discount and (ii) an optimal HCR scheme produces practically the same magnitude of expected total gains as an optimal QD scheme. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{competition}} between two firms that service time sensitive customers. Customers choose firms {{based on the}} firms' prices, the firms' expected waiting and service times, and the firms' brands. The firms may choose diverse strategies: one could choose a high price, but serve customers quickly, whereas the other could choose a low price with slow service. We consider three "service supply chain" design configurations: the firms perform the service, the firms outsource the service to a contractor, or the firms outsource the service to their customers; i. e., customers become co-producers of the service. With the first, there exists only one Nash equilibrium in prices and capacities (processing rates) in which both firms have positive market share. If the firms' costs are identical, the firms adopt identical strategies. If one firm has a lower cost, then that firm serves customers more quickly and has a higher market share, even though it might have a higher price. The outsourcing configurations might raise the firms' costs: outsourcing to a contractor requires coordination and monitoring; customers agree to co-production only if they receive a <b>price</b> <b>break,</b> but customers might be less efficient than the firms. Nevertheless, even if either outsourcing configuration raises the firms' costs, we show that the firms may be strictly better off because outsourcing raises equilibrium prices. This benefit is particularly valuable in highly competitive markets. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} price {{markdown}} scheme in {{a supply chain}} that consists of a supplier, a contract manufacturer (CM), and a buyer (retailer). The buyer subcontracts {{the production of the}} final product to the CM. The CM buys the components from the supplier and charges the buyer a service fee for the final product produced. The price markdown is made possible by the supplier with the development of new manufacturing technologies that reduce the production cost for the sourced component. Consequently, the buyer adjusts the retail price in order to possibly stimulate stronger demand that may benefit both the supplier and the buyer. Under this scenario, we identify the optimal discount pricing strategies, capacity reservation, and the stocking policies for the supplier and the buyer. We also investigate the optimal inventory decision for the CM to cope with the price discount by considering both demand and delivery uncertainties. Our results suggest that higher production cost accelerates the effects of higher price sensitivity on lowering the optimal capacity and stocking policies in the supply chain. The effect of mean demand error on the optimal prices is relatively marginal compared with that from price sensitivity. We also found that increasing the standard deviation of the random demand does not necessarily increase the stocking level as one would predict. The results show that delivery uncertainty {{plays an important role in}} the inventory carried beyond the <b>price</b> <b>break.</b> We discuss potential extensions for future research.

Simulated gas turbine plant output from GT PRO has been validated against an existing gas turbine plant output.

Management {{of such an}} intra-supply chain system often {{would like to know}} the best production- shipment policy in order to minimize the total expected system costs. Schwarz (1973) studied a continuous review deterministic one- warehouse N-retailer inventory system with the objective of determining the optimal stocking policy to minimize the average system cost. Kim and Hwang (1988) examined a one supplier and multi-customer system with an incremental discount pricing schedule and single <b>price</b> <b>break.</b> For a single incremental discount system an algorithm is proposed for obtaining the optimal discount schedule. They also used numerical example to illustrate their algorithm for cases in which both the discount rate and the break point are unknown and either one is prescribed. Banerjee and Burton (1994) investigated the difference of coordinated and independent inventory replenishment policies for a vendor and multiple buyers system. A series of simulation experiments were conducted and the results indicated that classical lot sizing models do not adequately describe a situation where a single vendor produces and supplies a product to multiple industrial customers, buying in discrete lots. A common replenishment cycle-based, coordinated inventory control model is demonstrated to be superior to the independent optimization. Swenseth and Godfrey (2002) exhibited that the freight rate functions could be incorporated into inventory replenishment decisions without compromising the excellence of the decision nor will they increase unnecessary complexity to the decision process. Siajadi et al. (2006) considered a single-vendor multiple-buyer inventory model with a multiple- shipment policy. A methodology was proposed to derive the optimal shipment policy that minimizes the joint total relevant cost for both vendor and buyer(s) for such a joint economic lot size problem. Karabati and Sayin (2008) studied the coordination problem in a single-supplier multiple-buyer supply chain with quantity discounts. They modeled and discussed alternative efficiency of supplier–buyer costs sharing mechanisms, and proposed methods to design the associated discount schemes that take buyers’ expectations into account. Through numerical analysis of the coordination efficiency and allocation of the net savings of the proposed discount schemes, they showed that the supplier is able to coordinate the supply chain with high efficiency levels, and retain {{a significant portion of the}} net savings. Jha and Shanker (2013) examined a single-vendor multi-buyer integrated production-inventory model with controllable lead time and service level constraints. The demands from buyers are assumed to be independent normally distributed, and the lead time of every buyer can be reduced at an added crash cost. Inventory levels are reviewed by buyers using the continuous review policy, and the unsatisfied demand at the buyers is completely backordered. They developed a model considering service level constraint for each buyer and used a Lagrangian multiplier technique-based algorithm to derive the optimal production-inventory policy that minimizes the joint total expected cost of such a vendor-buyers system. Chiu et al. (2013) studied an intra-supply chain system in which a single production unit manufactures products to meet the demands of multiple regional sales offices and incorporates quality assurance into its production process. In their study, the considerations related to a product’s quality assurance include inspection of all units produced, rework of nonconforming items and failure in rework. A multi-shipment policy was used to synchronously deliver finished items to multiple locations in order to satisfy customer demands. An optimal production lot-size and shipment policy was determined for their proposed intra-supply chain system. Additional studies that addressed various aspects of quality assurance, multi- delivery, and multi-customers issues of vendor–buyer integrated systems can also be referred to (Khouja 2003; Benjaafar and Elhafsi 2006; Ervolina et al. 2009; Chiu and Chang 2014; Murugan and Selladurai 2014; Rodger 2014; Safaei 2014; Sana et al. 2014; Tseng et al. 2014; Wee et al. 2014).|$|E
