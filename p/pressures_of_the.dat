5|$|Galland himself flew on {{unauthorised}} interception {{flights to}} experience the combat <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilots, and witnessed USAAF bombers being escorted by large numbers of P-51 Mustangs. Nevertheless, on occasions the Sturmbock tactics worked. For example, on 7 July 1944 Eighth Air Force bombers belonging to the 492nd Bomb Group were intercepted unescorted. The entire squadron of 12 B-24s were shot down. The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to a Sturmbock attack.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E
5|$|Wright {{had been}} {{fond of the}} Greek islands since a sabbatical visit in 1964, before Pink Floyd were formed. He moved to Greece in 1984 after Zee, briefly {{retiring}} from music, and enjoyed sailing and yachting. In his later years, Wright lived in Le Rouret, France, and spent time on a yacht he owned in the Virgin Islands. He found sailing therapeutic, relieving him from the <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music business. He was also a keen collector of Persian rugs.|$|E

5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, he had only reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Plain remained and could not be solved by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind the}} Finnish Civil War was World War I; the Russian Empire {{collapsed}} under the <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, {{leading to the}} February and October Revolutions in 1917. The breakdown caused a large power vacuum and subsequent power struggle in Eastern Europe. The Grand Duchy of Finland, {{a part of the}} Russian Empire since 1809, became embroiled in the struggle for power. Geopolitically less important than the continental Moscow-Warsaw gateway, the northerly Finnish ground, isolated by the Baltic sea was a peaceful sidefront until early 1918. The war between the German Empire and Russia had indirect effects on the Finns. Since the end of 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of raw materials, industrial products, food and labor for the growing Imperial Russian capital Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), and World War I emphasized the role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the less marked northern section of the Estonian–Finnish gateway and buffer zone to and from Petrograd through the Narva area, the Gulf of Finland and the Karelian Isthmus.|$|E

25|$|Storm {{systems are}} {{accompanied}} by low atmospheric pressure, which causes more methane to escape from coal seams and sealed areas. In winter the air is drier and less dense and creates a drier mine environment. Such conditions {{have been known to}} contribute to past mine fires and explosions. Other factors affecting methane liberation include whether the mine ventilation system is exhausting (negative pressure) or blowing (positive pressure), and the operating <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fans.|$|E
25|$|This {{principle}} {{was applied}} as a pressure ratio of total ambient pressure {{and did not}} take into account the partial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> component gases of the breathing air. His experimental work on goats and observations of human divers appeared to support this assumption. However, in time, this was found to be inconsistent with incidence of decompression sickness and changes were made to the initial assumptions. This was later changed to a 1.58:1 ratio of nitrogen partial pressures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general case}} is that both laws are limit laws, and they apply at {{opposite}} ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composition range. <b>The</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> component in large excess, such as the solvent for a dilute solution, is proportional to its mole fraction, and <b>the</b> constant <b>of</b> proportionality is <b>the</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pure substance (Raoult's law). <b>The</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solute is also proportional to the solute's mole fraction, but <b>the</b> constant <b>of</b> proportionality is different and must be determined experimentally (Henry's law).

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6, the CO 2 content {{increased}} and the H 2 S content {{did not change}} much when <b>the</b> operating <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regenerator unit increased.

Due to <b>the</b> operating <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regenerator unit increasing almost proportionally with the reboiler load (Wen et al. 2007), the operating pressure should not be too high.

25|$|In 1939 Latvia ordered 39 Hawker Hurricane {{fighters from}} United Kingdom thus {{there was a}} need for {{monoplane}} pilots in Latvia. For this purpose Kārlis Irbītis designed the VEF I-17 among other trainer aircraft. Due to the start of Second World War in September 1939, the British Hawker Hurricanes never arrived in Latvia and this was an inducement for the Latvian Air force to encourage Latvian aircraft development instead. Due to the <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the I-17 prototype was accepted almost without testing and serial production was started.|$|E

25|$|After a {{pause for}} {{evaluation}} of procedures, the Army continued its use of reactors, operating the Mobile Low-Power Reactor (ML-1), which started full power operation on February 28, 1963, becoming the smallest nuclear power plant on record to do so. This design was eventually abandoned after corrosion problems. While the tests had shown that nuclear power was likely to have lower total costs, the financial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War caused the Army to favor lower initial costs and it stopped the development of its reactor program in 1965, although the existing reactors continued operating (MH-1A until 1977).|$|E

25|$|The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted {{sheet metal}} steel receiver, {{but due to}} the higher {{operating}} <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5.56×45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.|$|E
