40|$|Tandem {{thin-film}} silicon {{solar cells}} consist of an amorphous silicon top cell and a microcrystalline silicon bottom cell which are stacked and connected in series. To match the photocurrents {{of the top}} cell and the bottom cell, a proper light management is essential. To this end, intermediate reflectors are applied between the top and the bottom solar cells. State-of-the-art single-layer intermediate reflectors are made of low refractive index materials but show poor spectral selectivity and cause <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflection</b> losses in the external quantum efficiency of the bottom cell.

40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes what {{we believe}} is a new method to remove the {{contribution}} of parasitic reflections in {{the images of the}} laser optical feedback imaging (LOFI) technique. This simple method allows us to extend the LOFI technique to long-distance applications, as imaging through a fog or a smoke. The LOFI technique is an ultrasensitive imaging technique that is interesting for imaging objects through a scattering medium. However, the LOFI sensitivity can be dramatically limited by parasitic optical feedback occurring in the experimental setup. In previous papers [Appl. Opt. 48, 64 (2009), Opt. Lett. 37, 2514 (2012) ], we already have proposed methods to filter a parasitic optical feedback, but they are not well suited to metric working distances. This new method uses a Doppler frequency shift induced by the moving mirror used to scan the object to be imaged. Using this Doppler frequency shift, we can distinguish the photons reflected by the target and the parasitic photons reflected by the optical components in the experimental setup. In this paper, we demonstrated theoretically and experimentally the possibility to filter the <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflection</b> in LOFI images using the Doppler frequency shift. This method significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor 15 and we can obtain a shot noise limited image through a scattering medium of an object at 3 m from the detector...|$|E
40|$|Multijunction {{solar cells}} provide a route to further {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} solar cells. By stacking different band-gap materials, thermalization losses can be decreased. Maximizing the efficiency of series-connected multijunction solar cells gets complex as {{a variety of different}} layers is involved. The application of nano-scale textures which scatter and diffract the light in order to increase the light path and absorption. An advanced light management combining light trapping and spectral distribution is necessary to gain maximal output. In this work, light management in silicon-based multijunction solar cells by intermediate reflectors (IR) is studied. As soon as the thickness of absorber layers in multijunction devices is physically limited, IRs increase the light path in the sub cells and contribute to the matching of currents and power of the sub cells in series-connected multijunction solar cells. As each element added to a working device increases its complexity, the understanding of their interplay and underlying loss mechanisms is crucial to obtain an improvement of the device. Thin-film silicon tandem solar cells made of hydrogenated amorphous and microcrystalline silicon (also called 'micromorph') are chosen as model system for the analysis of the optics in silicon-based multijunction solar cells, as they are a well established industrially up-scalable technology and exhibit the important characteristics of other multijunction cell material systems: Thin-film layers, nano-structured surfaces, as well as physical limitations of thicknesses and a broad utilization of the solar spectrum. The combination of thin-film layer stack and nano-structured surfaces demands for a treatment of the solar cell as a nano-optical device. Motivated by the results of experimental studies, tandem solar cells are modeled by thin-film optics and rigorous optical simulations. An agreement between simulation to experimental results allows for an investigation and optimization of these devices. First, the optical losses induced by intermediate reflectors in tandem solar cells were studied. Therefore, tandem solar cells without and with micro-crystalline silicon oxide intermediate reflectors were fabricated on different aluminum -doped zinc oxide front contacts which had partially been treated to decrease absorption within the zinc oxide. Increased cell reflectance and parasitic absorption due to the IR were observed. The comparison to tandem solar cells on non-treated front contacts showed that in spite of the increased reflectance, parasitic absorption in the front contacts due to the IR is negligible. The results are supported by optical simulations of tandem solar cells with intermediate reflector which, additionally, allowed to quantify parasitic losses. Furthermore, it is shown that the decrease of the refractive index of the silicon oxide intermediate reflector results in a decrease of parasitic absorption and an increase of total tandem cell current if layer thicknesses are adapted. In this case, <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflection</b> of light by the IR out of the solar cell is determined to be the dominating optical loss mechanism. Second, the reflection losses were assigned to the low spectral selectivity of reflection of single layer IRs. Basing on this, a 1 D photonic crystal produced of conductive and low absorptive thin-film materials which are available in-situ in thin-film silicon solar cell production is designed for a flat layer stack. The influence of surface texture on the effectiveness of the multilayer IR is studied and it is shown that the IR functionality remains for a textured solar cell. A multilayer IR consisting of aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) and microcrystalline silicon oxide (μc-SiOx:H) layers was successfully integrated into a nano-textured thin-film silicon solar cell and decreases the bottom cell losses in comparison to other IRs while still increasing the top cell current density by ΔJsc,top = 1. 2 mA/cm 2. A further optimization of material choice and layer quantity shows that the potential of further increasing top cell enhancement and spectral selectivity by increasing the number of layers exists but that possible gains are low. Third, the top cell current increase was investigated in detail. Therefore, a new method to extract the angular distribution of light within a thin amorphous silicon film from rigorous optical simulations was developed and applied to a-Si:H cells on both, periodic gratings and randomly textured front structures. For photonic structures, absorption in the silicon film is assigned to the coupling of incident light to leaky waveguide modes by the grating. It is shown that in case of silicon films on randomly textured surfaces, these waveguide modes are present as well but broadened due to the superposition of a variety of distinct periods and heights. As a quantity for light trapping in thin films, the integrated scattering intensity $ISI$ could be established which describes the coupling to waveguide modes and correlates well to the absorption enhancement in a-Si:H film with different reflectors. Fourth, absorption and transmission enhancements are investigated on a variety of periodic and randomly textured substrates. In a broad experimental and simulation study, tandem solar cells on various substrates have been deposited and reproduced by rigorous optical simulations. An artificial modification of the substrate texture, revealed the font texture scattering distribution and the surface angles at the IR to be the decisive surface parameters to determine the effectiveness of the IR. A large dependence of the functionality of the IR on the angular intensity distribution in the top cell is observed. In particular, two different reflection modes of the IR are observed: In reflection mode (A) below the critical angle of total internal reflection, light propagates into the IR and the reflectance was dependent on interference of the incident light and light reflected at the back IR interface. The effectiveness of the IR on surface textures comprising low surface angles and low parallel wave vector transfer as APCVD SnO 2 or sputter-etched ZnO:Al textures can be well reproduced by a thin-film model applying the angular scattering distribution at the front side. If the critical angle is surpassed, light was totally internally reflected and tunnels through the IR as an evanescent wave. This reflection mode (B) results in large absorption enhancements for thick intermediate layers but is always connected to reflection losses. A spectral reflectance parameter SRP was introduced. It was used as a tool to analyze the influence of IR refractive index and thickness on the absorption enhancement and bottom cell transmission losses. The theory was successfully applied to understand the interplay of front side texture and IR reflectance on the relevant randomly textured surfaces. The study of the IR effectiveness on photonic structures emphasized the importance to examine the waveguide modes, which do not just increase top cell enhancement, but further induce <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflection</b> losses in the NIR range which are disadvantageous to the current of further bottom cells. The analysis reveals that these losses can be decreased by broadening the resonances as it is the case in randomly textured solar cells.

Using a circuit simulator, we are able to model mode conversion at the interface between straight and bent waveguides, <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflections</b> in multi-mode interference couplers (MMIs), interference between multiple modes, residual facet reflections, and reflections at junctions between components. Even though these effects are usually low in intensity, around - 20 dB to - 30 dB from the main signal level, they can still have a strong influence on the circuit performance. This is because the mentioned parasitic effects are coherent with the desired signal and interference between them is therefore a field effect. By analyzing three different circuits, and comparing the results to measurements, we show that these effects need to be carefully managed in order to ensure circuit performance. The circuits we investigate are a Fabry-Perot cavity, a Mach- Zehnder interferometric structure, and a Michelson interferometer.

However, known design approaches based on the generalized refraction and reflection laws do not allow realization of perfectly performing devices: there are always some <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflections</b> into undesired directions. In this paper we introduce and discuss a general approach to the synthesis of metasurfaces for full control of transmitted and reflected plane waves and show that perfect performance can be realized. The method is based on the use of an equivalent impedance matrix model which connects the tangential field components at the two sides on the metasurface. With this approach we are able to understand what physical properties of the metasurface are needed in order to perfectly realize the desired response. Furthermore, we determine the required polarizabilities of the metasurface unit cells and discuss suitable cell structures. It appears that only spatially dispersive metasurfaces allow realization of perfect refraction and reflection of incident plane waves into arbitrary directions. In particular, ideal refraction is possible only if the metasurface is bianisotropic (weak spatial dispersion), and ideal reflection without polarization transformation requires spatial dispersion with a specific, strongly non-local response to the fields.

Because of diffraction effects related to beam propagation along finite size optics, or <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflections</b> inside transmitting optics, a coherent crosstalk may occur between the beams {{and create a}} parasitic interference pattern superimposed on the genuine one. We developed an analytical approach to describe {{the impact of this}} effect on the observables of classical and nulling stellar interferometers. Considering classical interferometry, we show that differential phase and closure phase are both corrupted, depending on the crosstalk level and the residual piston between the beams. Considering typical specifications of piston correction of ground-based interferometers (≍ 100 nm), the detection of hot Jupiter-like planets by differential phase implies a tolerance on the parasitic flux to about 5 % of the incident intensity. Also, we show that the closure phase relation does not remove this parasitic contribution. The corresponding corrupted closure phase is not zero for an unresolved source, and depends on the residual piston. Considering nulling interferometry, we show that parasitic effects modify the transmission map level, depending on the crosstalk level and the phase shift between primary and secondary beams. In the extreme case of a pi-phase shift, the crosstalk effect implies a decrease of the final output signal-to-noise ratio.

A study led in the frame of the ArchinSolar project [2] has shown that architects are ready to integrate PV modules with enhanced aesthetic aspect, even though there was a 10 % loss in efficiency. The present study shows how new coloured filters can be used to enhance PV modules’ appearance while minimizing power loss, to achieve a better integration in the traditional urban or rural environment...|$|R
40|$|Room surface {{estimation}} is {{the process}} of estimating and characterizing the surfaces of a room from the measurement provided by an array of microphones. In any normal room, wavefront radiated by the source reaches the microphones after reflecting from the surfaces of the room. On performing the post processing on this recorded signal, {{depending on the type of}} source signal used; we obtain the unique signature of the room called the room impulse response (RIR). Historically room impulse responses have been used to calculate the acoustical parameters. These are generally used for objective evaluation of the rooms. Here is an effort to extract more information out of the RIR by understanding the physics of it. In this thesis the reflection from the surfaces is employed as useful information and methods to use this information are presented. The reflective information can be used in the determination of the reflection coefficient of the surface. The reflection coefficients of four common room materials are obtained from their respective impulse response at oblique incidence. The obtained reflection coefficients are studied for the classification of materials. The problem of estimating the room surface using the reflection coefficients has been approached in a systematic way, accounting for <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflections</b> and background noise. The room impulse response is obtained using the sine sweep signal transmitted through the speaker attached to one microphone array, and recorded by another microphone array. The recorded signal was used to identify possible surfaces using clustering on the obtained reflection coefficients. The classification so obtained is compared with the ground truth to calculate the performance and practicability. /Kir 1...|$|R
40|$|Nulling {{interferometry}} aims {{to detect}} faint objects close to bright stars. Its principle {{is to produce}} a destructive interference {{along the line of}} sight so that the stellar flux is rejected, while the flux of the off-axis source can be transmitted. In practice, various instrumental perturbations can degrade the nulling performance. Any imperfection in phase, amplitude or polarization produces a spurious flux that leaks to the interferometer output and corrupts the transmitted off-axis flux. One of these instrumental perturbations is the crosstalk phenomenon, which occurs because of multiple <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflections</b> inside transmitting optics, and/or diffraction effects related to beam propagation along finite size optics. It can include a crosstalk of a beam with itself, and a mutual crosstalk between different beams. This can create a parasitic interference pattern, which degrades the intrinsic transmission map - or intensity response - of the interferometer. In this context, we describe how this instrumental effect impairs the performance of a Bracewell interferometer. A simple formalism is developed to derive the corresponding modified intensity response of the interferometer, {{as a function of the}} two parameters of interest: the crosstalk level (or contamination rate) and the phase shift between the primary and secondary - parasitic - beams. We then apply our mathematical approach to a few scientific cases, both analytically and using the GENIESIM simulation software, adapted to handle coherent crosstalk. Our results show that a coherent crosstalk level of about 1 per cent implies a 20 per cent drop of the signal-to-noise ratio at most. Careful attention should thus be paid to reduce the crosstalk level inside an interferometric instrument and ensure an instrumental stability that provides the necessary sensitivity through calibration procedures.

40|$|A novel line of integrated-optic-based {{chemical}} sensors was developed. The sensors {{are based on}} modification of the optical cavity of a single-mode semiconductor distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. A sensitive layer changes its refractive index in presence of a specific chemical, thus changing the effective refractive index of the section and the optical length of the cavity. This results in laser frequency shift measured either directly or by heterodyne detection using a reference laser as the second source. It is shown that DBR-laser-based sensors can achieve in principle a much higher sensitivity than passive sensors, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers, due to the narrow linewidth of DBR lasers. The theory of DBR-laser-based sensors is described. It allows optimizing the sensitive section length and field confinement in the sensitive layer for the lowest detection limit. The optimum parameters depend on cavity losses and absorption of the sensitive material. Numerical modeling shows a wide acceptable range of sensitive section parameters for low-loss materials, while for higher-loss materials this range becomes much narrower. Narrow-linewidth DBR lasers are required for high sensitivity. In this respect, sol-gel waveguides with and without Bragg grating were incorporated in the DBR laser scheme. Single-mode operation of DBR lasers with sol-gel waveguide gratings was demonstrated for the first time, with 34 -dB side mode suppression and a short-term linewidth of 150 to 500 kHz. A 3 -section configuration with sol-gel waveguides and fiber grating showed 28 -dB side mode suppression and a short-term linewidth of 600 kHz. Chemical sensing was performed with fiber grating, sol-gel waveguide grating, and 3 -section DBR lasers. The first two types showed frequency shift of over 130 MHz {{in the presence of}} acetone vapors, and reversibility within experimental errors. The 3 -section scheme showed significant dispersion of response and lack of reversibility due to <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflections</b> and instability of the setup. The effect of reflections from facets on performance of this design was examined and found to reduce the maximum sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|New and {{efficient}} numerical modeling concepts and procedures based on Transmission Line Matrix and Finite Element {{methods have been}} developed for the analysis of generalized microwave and millimeter-wave structures. An algorithm, based on a vectorial Finite Element approach, has been developed to determine the dispersion characteristics, field distributions, pseudo-impedances and, losses of shielded transmission media of arbitrary cross-section. The structures analysed with this algorithm include dielectrically loaded ridged waveguides, bilateral finlines in rectangular and circular waveguide enclosures and ridged finlines. The major contributions to the literature are the estimation of losses of bilateral finlines in rectangular waveguide enclosures, the effect of substrate bending and mounting grooves on the dispersion characteristics, the study of finlines in circular waveguide enclosures, and, the analysis of a new modified finline structure called "Ridged Finline". New algorithms to apply the principles of Diakoptics to the TLM method for field partitioning in large structures have been developed. Diakoptics leads to considerable reduction in memory and CPU requirements for large structures since it allows numerical preprocessing of parts of a large electromagnetic structure which remain unchanged during an analysis and optimization procedure. A space interpolation technique based on the transverse field distribution of the propagation mode has been proposed for efficient field partitioning in single-mode structures. Frequency dispersive boundaries are represented in the time domain by their characteristic impulse response or numerical/discrete Green's function. This discrete Green's function has been named the "Johns matrix" in honour of the late P. B. Johns, pioneer of TLM and time domain Diakoptics. The <b>parasitic</b> <b>reflections</b> from the absorbing boundaries in 3 -D structures, due to the finite space and time discretization have been reduced to less than one percent by exponentially tapering the impulse response, or Johns Matrix, of frequency dispersive boundaries. This allows wideband S [...] parameter extraction of waveguide discontinuities and components from a single impulsive TLM simulation. This tapered impulse response has been named the "Tapered Johns Matrix"...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear tapered {{waveguide}} sections are often {{needed in the}} microwave/millimeter-wave system to connect the two waveguides of different radii. The presence of such a taper inevitably introduces unwanted <b>parasitic</b> modes and <b>reflections.</b> The modal matching technique is a powerful computer friendly method for analyzing horn antennas or nonlinear waveguides in which the actual profile {{is replaced by a}} series of uniform waveguide sections. The waveguides can have any cross section and can be propagating either cylindrical or spherical modes. The mode matching technique involves matching of the total modal field at each junction between uniform sections so that conservation of power is maintained. From this process, the amplitudes of the separate modes at the output of a junction have been deduced in term...|$|R
