5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted {{to look like}} another, it might have its cannon ports hidden by <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of rapid}} firing {{machine guns and}} long range breech loading {{artillery}} quickly led to camouflaging of vehicles and positions. Artillery pieces were soon painted in contrasting bold colours to obscure their outlines. Another early trend was building observation trees, made of steel with bark camouflage. Such trees became popular with the British and French armies in 1916. The observation tree was invented by French painter Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola, who led the French army's camouflage unit, {{the first of its}} kind in any army. He also invented <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> netting to hide machine gun positions, and this was quickly taken up for hiding equipment and gun positions from 1917, 7 million square yards being used by the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|Panoramas {{illustrated}} the tournament, using long strips of <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> wound round a tube and slowly unwound {{to give a}} view of the event. The venue was Edinburgh in 1839 or 1840.|$|E

25|$|Phyllis Yes, {{artist whose}} artistic media range from works on <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> to furniture, clothing, and jewelry. She {{is known for}} her works that “feminize” objects usually {{associated}} with a stereotypically male domain, such as machine guns, hard hats, and hammers. Among her best-known artworks are Paint Can with Brush.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, {{the number}} of awards was {{increased}} {{to a maximum of}} thirteen in order to incorporate radio. A separate panel of national newspaper radio critics was formed to choose recipients of the new award, a highly polished, white metal cylinder designed by Robert Costelloe. This was replaced in 1981 by a trophy comprising a <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> mounted on a stainless steel background, designed by Theo McNab.|$|E
25|$|Another {{technique}} {{is that of}} canvas collage, which is the application, typically with glue, of separately <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> patches {{to the surface of}} a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this {{technique is}} British artist John Walker in his paintings of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already {{an integral part of the}} mixed media works of such American artists as Conrad Marca-Relli and Jane Frank by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical Lee Krasner also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.|$|E

50|$|Molzan's {{paintings}} are often considered {{as more of}} a three-dimensional object than a two dimensional surfaces on the wall. Referred to as carrying a sculptural quality, Molzan's {{paintings are}} grounded within the practice of painting through the materials she uses, such as oil <b>paints,</b> <b>canvas,</b> linen, and canvas frame.|$|R
25|$|Behind the curtain, {{the actors}} were taking their {{positions}} {{in a box}} set representing an old boathouse {{on the bank of}} the Seine. This was constructed of <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> on a flimsy wooden frame and mainly blocked the backstage and flies from view. Kate Claxton, playing Louise, the blind orphan girl, along with actors J. B. Studley and H. S. Murdoch, had taken their places on stage within the box set and were waiting for the curtain to rise. Claxton was lying on a pallet of straw, looking up. Actors Mary Ann Farren and Claude Burroughs were waiting in the wings for their entry cues.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} 19th-century theatres, the Brooklyn Theatre's stage was a {{presentation}} platform, a prop factory and a warehouse. At {{the back of}} the stage was the painter's bridge, a walkway which ran the width of the stage and which could be raised or lowered as required for painting backdrops, or drops. These and borders, scenic elements painted on canvas and mounted on wooden frames, were installed in a rigging loft,known as a Fly System, a large wooden open frame equipped with the pulleys and tackle needed to raise or lower scenic elements. It was suspended high in the fly space or , the volume above the stage never seen by the audience. For a large production with many scene changes, the rigging loft could be heavily loaded with <b>painted</b> <b>canvas.</b> On the night of the fire, it contained drops and borders for The Two Orphans. and the scenery for Julius Caesar was stacked on the stage, awaiting pickup. This would have some bearing on the fire's outset, when stage manager Thorpe considered getting the hose, but was hampered by scenery.|$|E
500|$|Richard R. Flores {{analyzed}} the lost film and notes that Méliès' production was {{claimed to have}} been 10 minutes in length and that it could not make a significant depiction of the battle. The historical accuracy of the film was compromised to carry out the plot of the [...] "pretty girl, shy hero, and a villain". While Lieutenant Almeron Dickenson was a real person and his wife was present at the mission, her name was Suzanna. Suzanna Dickenson and her infant daughter survived the battle, but {{there is no evidence of}} a Mexican spy or a marriage attempt. Instead, Santa Anna sent Suzanna north to inform the victory of the Mexican forces to General Sam Houston. Flores cites Rony's labeling of Méliès' productions as a [...] "hybrid documentary and fantasy" [...] and notes that it was an early attempt at a historical documentary based on its attempt at a faithful setting. The uses the Mexicans' as a form of savages in Méliès cinematic motifs. Frank Thompson's analysis of the production notes states that William F. Haddock was delving into the archives to produce an accurate depiction of the Alamo at the studio because the Alamo itself was altered from the time of the battle. Thompson noted that despite the battle being within living memory the [...] "exact reproduction" [...] used a <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> backdrop and focused on an entirely fictional plot.|$|E

2500|$|Critic Charles Henry Meltzer, {{reviewing}} {{after the}} National Academy exhibition, described Men of the Docks as [...] "irritating ... yet full of talent" [...] owing to its [...] "deliberate carelessness" [...] {{in the drawing}} of the crowd, which he found to have character.

2500|$|Another {{expression}} of his {{preoccupation with the}} concept of space appears in works such as those exhibited in the series of works entitled “Area Drawings, Space Drawings, Abyss Drawings” (1981) in the Gimel Gallery, Jerusalem, and in the installation “Programmed Figure in Curved Space, or Painted Solution to Advance Problem no. 457617” (1981) in the Noemi Givon Gallery, Tel Aviv. [...] In this installation Cohen Gan built sophisticated geometric bodies in wooden frames covered in <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> that comprised an attempt to examine the conventions of Euclidean geometry as an {{expression of}} his occupation with the epistemology of art.|$|E
2500|$|Between 9 October 2009 until 16 January 2010, {{as part of}} Street Art Season at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Ali put on an {{exhibition}} called [...] "Breaking Down the Wall", which explored the themes of Freedom, Justice and Equality and included work on spray <b>painted</b> <b>canvas,</b> video projections and brand new aerosol art.

2500|$|Later {{she began}} making {{irregular}} holes [...] in the canvases ("apertures", as she called them: the earliest example is [...] "Winter Windows", 1966–1967), disclosing deeper layers of <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> underneath (so-called [...] "double canvases" [...] - and sometimes triple canvases), with painted-on [...] "false shadows", etc. - increasingly invoking the third dimension, creating tactile, sculptural effects while remaining within the {{convention of the}} framed, rectangular oil painting. The apertures also suggest a view {{into some sort of}} psychological interior, as though the second canvas - seen only partially, {{through the hole in the}} forward canvas - were some half-concealed secret, perhaps even another whole painting that we will never see.|$|E

2500|$|The {{value of}} a {{physical}} object to an [...] is sometimes held to be supervenient upon the physical properties of the object. [...] In aesthetics, the beauty of La Grande Jatte might supervene on the physical composition of the painting (the specific molecules {{that make up the}} painting), the artistic composition of the painting (in this case, dots), the figures and forms of the painted image, or the <b>painted</b> <b>canvas</b> as a whole. [...] In ethics, the goodness of an act of charity might supervene on the physical properties of the agent, the mental state of the agent (his or her intention), or the external state of affairs itself. [...] Similarly, the overall suffering caused by an earthquake might supervene on the spatio-temporal entities that constituted it, the deaths it caused, or the natural disaster itself. The claim that moral properties are supervenient upon non-moral properties is called moral supervenience.|$|E
