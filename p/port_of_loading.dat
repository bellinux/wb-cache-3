In 1998, the company acquired its first vessel, the multipurpose heavy-lift carrier MV Beluga Obsession. In 1999, the company built its first new vessel, the MV Werder Bremen. Beluga Shipping grew significantly during the following years. By May 2010, 69 multipurpose heavy-lift carriers were in service for the company, with crane capacities reaching 1,400 tons in tandem usage (P-series). The fleet further increased to 70 units by end of 2010.

30|$|Disorganized onboard {{container}} storage {{from multiple}} alliance ships is often {{mentioned as a}} primary impediment to port efficiency {{at the port of}} discharge.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{provisions}} of the Rotterdam Rules 2009 relating to the performing party in general and the maritime performing party in particular. Performing party means a person who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations under a contract of carriage with respect to the receipt, loading, handling, stowage, carriage, keeping, care, unloading or delivery of the goods, to the extent that such person acts, either directly or indirectly, at the carrier’s request or under the carrier’s supervision or control. Maritime performing party means a performing party who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations during the period between the arrival of goods at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> and their departure from the port of discharge of a ship.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of English, American, French, Canadian and Quebec law relative to the implied terms of voyage charterparties. It addresses specifically the implied terms in the general law of contract demonstrating the similarity between the Civil and Common law systems {{as well as the}} need to convert the implied terms into rules of law not subject to exclusion by agreement. The latter proposal is also supported by the doctrine of frustration which has evolved from the notion of implied terms into a principle of law. The thesis treats the implied undertakings of the shipowner which are to provide a seaworthy vessel, to go the the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> with reasonable despatch, to exercise reasonable care and to proceed without deviation. In addition, it studies the implied undertakings of the charterer being, essentially, the obligation to nominate a safe port and/or berth, and the undertaking not to ship dangerous goods. The thesis takes into account the impact of the transportation of goods under voyage charterparties upon the environment and suggests how this impact and its effects might be prevented by international law. Finally, it is submitted that because implied terms have been and are part of the fundamental legal structure of the voyage charterparty in both Common and Civil law, they should become express rules of international law, not subject to exclusion by contract...|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic Container Line, being a {{maritime}} carrier of goods, {{introduced a new}} transportation document, which needs some explanations and a juridical analysis. The new document consists of two seperate documents: in the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> the shipper of the goods receives a freight receipt, in which all particulars concerning the goods and its transport are duly given. The shipper has a choice: instead of such a freight receipt he may ask for a normal bill of lading. But the conditions of carriage are the same both according to the freight receipt as well as according to the bill of lading. There is only one major difference: the bill of lading may be delivered {{to the order of}} the shipper or to the bill of lading holder, whereas the freight receipt must bear the exact name of the consignee. In consequence the freight receipt is not a document which entitles its holder to dispose of the cargo. The freight receipt is delivered to the shipper and remains in his hands. The freight receipt is being drawn up by the carrier or his agent in the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> on a telex apparatus, which has a connection with the carrier's agent apparatus at the port of discharge. There, at the same time, a „notice of arrival" is being written by the telex receiver apparatus. This notice of arrival (of the cargo) is being delivered to the consignee, who with that document in hand may take delivery of the cargo. The whole terminology is a new one. Maritime law does not know a freight receipt (it knows merely a mate's receipt which has other functions) nor a notice of arrival of the cargo in form of a document of title. And therefore the legal status of these two documents, considered together as one document of transport, must be found. According to Polish civil law the two mentioned documents together may be identified with a freight bill, a document which is being met with in other branches of the transportation industry. The prefix „telex" should denote that the document is not transferred in its material form (as a piece of paper) but on„wires" with the aid of electronic apparatus. At the port of discharge the document is being drawn up once more. This facilitates enormously maritime trade if and when a bill of lading is not needed. And a bill of lading is not needed when the partners of the selling contract are in constant contact and have a full confidence that the contract will be fulfilled in the agreed manner and time. Such a situation may be found in relations between enterprises of socialist countries. Therefore the maritime telex freight bills could be successfully used in these countries.

40|$|Safe {{implementation}} of the decisions regarding the potential uncertainties in port loading operations requires the anticipation of all the aspects of loading. However, loading operations that are designed as new maritime projects {{have not always been}} supported by extensive practical experience. This paper discusses the case study of Punta Arenas loading terminal, reviewing potential issues related to building such a terminal and providing answers applicable to similar cases. When planning the construction of loading terminals at places exposed to harsh weather conditions, it is necessary to define economic and weather aspects. Building a loading terminal in Punta Arenas represents a demanding venture due to exceptionally hard weather conditions affecting the area. The quantitative uncertainties in loading operations can be presented by simulations. Probabilistic simulation is a process explicitly presenting the uncertainties by defining the information input as a distribution of probability of error. If the inputs describe an uncertain system, the forecast of future results is necessary. The results are obtained {{on the basis of the}} available information that represents the stated distribution. For the purpose of the probability simulation, the Monte Carlo method is often used, and has therefore been chosen for this research. The main results of the research shall be quantified as the probability of failure in the ship loading operation, with the focus on selected input systems, in the context of difficult weather conditions and unfavourable location of the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading.</b> These findings are highly useful to the decision-makers since the latter are able to use the simulation results as a backing for decisions related to the ship loading...|$|E
