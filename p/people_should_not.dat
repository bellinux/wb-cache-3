5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E
5|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} {{features}} jugate busts of Bibb, Alabama's first governor as a state, and the incumbent in 1919, Kilby. In so appearing, Kilby became the first living person depicted on a U.S. coin. Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, averred that the issuance was not controversial at the time, as the Act of May 16, 1866, that forbids the depiction of living people on currency was deemed to refer to paper money only, but Q. David Bowers wrote that the portrayal caused contemporary comment, for {{the position of the}} federal government (excepting some paper money issues of the 19th century) was that living <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> appear on U.S. money. A total of 22 stars flank the busts, symbolic of Alabama being the 22nd state; a message reinforced on those pieces bearing the inscription 2X2 in the obverse field. The X in that inscription alludes to the St. Andrew's cross on the flag of Alabama. The date, the names of the governors, and various other wordings appear towards the rim of the obverse.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{transsexualism}} {{has also}} {{been included in the}} American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With the DSM-5, transsexualism was removed as a diagnosis, and a diagnosis of gender dysphoria was created in its place. This change was made to reflect the consensus view by members of the APA that transsexuality is not in and of itself a disorder and that transsexual <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be stigmatized unnecessarily. By including a diagnosis for gender dysphoria, transsexual people are still able to access medical care through the process of transition.|$|E

Hitzfeld said that when he first left Bayern in 2004 he 'felt burnt out' and 'was a bit depressed', and 'it took me two years to recover.' He then had 'the best years at Bayern' on his return. He stated his views that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> get too excited about things, not get too down about things, and treat each situation individually.

This careful investigation of all 1,200 depositions created the belief that the term ‘atrocity’ should be directly connected with the German army, due to the army's extreme practice of militarism. This is confirmed by the German diaries, which showed the German account of the war crimes in Belgium was directly ordered by commanding army officers. In its final conclusion, the committee claimed that the militarism of the German army was the cause of the outrages in Belgium.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit {{priest in}} the US {{published}} “Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the L.G.B.T. Community Can Enter Into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion and Sensitivity.” This called on church leaders to show respect by using terms like “gay” and “L.G.B.T.,” instead of phrases like “afflicted with same-sex attraction.” He {{also argued that}} to expect a sinless lifestyle from gay Catholics, but not from any other group, {{is a form of}} “unjust discrimination” and that gay <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be fired for marrying a same-sex spouse.

He argues that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.|$|E
25|$|Whether Tobias had {{an affair}} with Claire is not certain; however, his {{infidelity}} is. Claire knows about an affair that Tobias had with a young woman, but she has never told Agnes about it. Claire only uses the information to taunt Tobias. Some critics have suggested that the young anonymous woman with whom Tobias had the affair was actually Claire. Despite all this, Tobias appears secure in his marriage with Agnes, even though they have not shared the same bed for many years. Their marriage seems to have become something of a habit. Tobias shows very little affection to his wife except in the way that he reinforces her thoughts, giving her assurances, for instance, that she, of all <b>people,</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> worry about going mad.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} {{attitudes toward the}} family have survived without being questioned.

That marriage requires a woman to move into her husband's family and to become a daughter-in-law as well as a wife is still largely accepted. The norm of patrilineal descent and the assumption that it is sons who bear the primary responsibility for their aged parents remain.
