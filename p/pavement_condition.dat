40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of future <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions</b> {{are essential for}} determining the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. The current methods for assessing <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions</b> involve either equipment measures or visual inspections. Equipment measures are not extensively implemented because of high cost; thus, subjective evaluations by road inspectors are often used as a replacement. Nevertheless, visual inspections could draw in errors and variations due to subjectivity and uncertainty. The present serviceability index (PSI), {{one of the most}} common indicators used to evaluate pavement performance, is incapable of transforming one's imprecise judgment into an exact number between 0 (the worst) and 5 (the best). Conventional regression cannot deal with visual inspection data that are linguistic or non-crisp. In contrast, fuzzy regression is capable of handling such fuzzy data. In this paper, <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions</b> are exemplified by five membership functions and estimated by using fuzzy regression to better account the uncertainties of the traditional method. Also, a similarity indicator is applied to measure the goodness of fit. A case study using pavement inspection data is presented to establish estimated fuzzy regression equations. The results demonstrate the capability of the model, which is able to assist road administration units to determine desirable repair actions regarding the predicted <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The profilometer records road geometry and condition while driving at highway speed. Results from Profilometry can be used to design an optimal geometric pavement repair, eliminating all long wave unevenness, roughness, erroneous cross slope magnitudes and undesired cross slope variance, with the least road grinding and paving efforts. The outcome is a surface with superior ride quality.|$|E
5000|$|The PASER {{scale is}} a 1-10 rating system for road <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> {{developed}} by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Transportation Information Center.

The PASER assessment method does not require measurements of individual distresses, and thus PASER ratings cannot be disaggregated into measurements of specific distress types. The advantage to this method is that roads may be assessed quickly, possibly even by [...] "windshield survey." [...] A primary disadvantage is that because PASER ratings cannot be disaggregated into component distress data, the metric cannot be used in mechanistic-empirical transportation asset management programs.|$|E
50|$|Pavement {{engineering}} is {{a branch of}} civil engineering that uses engineering techniques to design and maintain flexible (asphalt) and rigid (concrete) pavements. This includes streets and highways and involves knowledge of soils, hydraulics, and material properties. Pavement engineering involves new construction as well as rehabilitation and maintenance of existing pavements. Maintenance often involves using engineering judgment to make maintenance repairs with the highest long-term benefit and lowest cost. The <b>Pavement</b> <b>Condition</b> Index (PCI) {{is an example of}} an engineering approach applied to existing pavements. Another example is the use of a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) to non-destructively test existing pavements. Calculation of pavement layer strengths can be performed from the resulting deflection data. The two methods - empirical or mechanistic is used to determine pavement layer thicknesses.|$|E
40|$|The {{factors that}} {{influence}} the increase or decrease of silt loadings on paved roadways have not been fully quantitatively investigated. They were identified in this study based on the quarterly silt loading sampling data collected from 20 sites by the Clark County Department of Air Quality and Environmental Management in Southern Nevada for the period from 2000 to 2003. The silt-loading and associated data collected over these years at one sampling site may inherently possess site-specific characteristics that can be better incorporated by using panel data models. The factors that are identified as significant are the presence of curbs and gutters, shoulder type, <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{and the presence of}} construction activities in the vicinity of roadways. The presence of curbs and gutters, stabilized shoulders, and good <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions</b> would result in decreased silt loadings. Conversely, the presence of construction activities within the immediate vicinity of sampled areas would result in increases of silt loadings on the roadway surfaces. Based on the analysis of the results, it was recommended that constructing curbs, gutters and stabilized shoulders, preventing or reducing construction track-out from construction activity, and improving <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions</b> be the preferred control measures to reduce silt-loading on paved roadways...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce a multi-year pavement maintenance programming methodology that can explicitly account for uncertainty in pavement deterioration. This is accomplished with the development of a simulation-based genetic algorithm (GA) approach that is capable of planning the maintenance activities over a multi-year planning period. A stochastic simulation is used to simulate the uncertainty of future <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions</b> based on the calibrated deterioration model while GA is used to handle the combinatorial nature of the network-level pavement maintenance programming. The effects of the uncertainty of pavement deterioration on the maintenance program are investigated using a case study. The results show that programming the maintenance activities using only the expected <b>pavement</b> <b>conditions</b> is likely to underestimate the required maintenance budget and overestimate the performance of pavement network. ...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{effective}} {{maintenance of}} pavement sections requires timely preventive maintenance and planned rehabilitation treatments. Knowledge {{of the increase}} in condition due to application of treatment and the loss of condition after treatment are essential when deciding the maintenance and rehabilitation treatments. Any error in formulating these values can cause significant changes in recommendations provided. Many researchers have developed pavement performance prediction models; however, less research has been done on the impact of treatment actions on the condition of a pavement section after treatments. The objective of the research is to develop equations, using deterministic empirical method, that predict the increase in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> and rate of decrease in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> after treatment actions with respect to <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> just before the treatment. The equations are developed for different treatments and different functional class, and surface type combination to quantify the impact of the treatment for the use in pavement management system. These equations can be used to quantify the effects of different treatments for the use in pavement management system. Numerical illustration is presented using the data from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission-Pavement Management System software developed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) located in Oakland, California. A relation is observed between increase in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> and <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> just before treatment for different treatments and different functional class and surface type combination. Hence the equations to determine the trend in increase in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> for different treatments and different functional class and surface type combination are developed. For rate of decrease in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition,</b> due to large variability in the data the loss of <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> per year could not be related to <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> just before treatment. Hence the equations to determine the trend in loss in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> after treatment could not be developed. The developed equations can be efficiently used to predict increase in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> due to application of the treatment and the loss of <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> after treatment...|$|E
40|$|Transportation {{agencies}} use {{pavement management}} systems (PMSs) to make efficient decisions about allocating available {{resources to the}} maintenance, rehabilitation, and renewal of their roadway networks. One of the most costly parts of the PMS process is collecting <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data. The efficiency and reliability of decisions made based on PMSs depend upon the quality of this data. Thus, transportation agencies need to ensure that dollars invested in this data are well spent, and <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data has the level of quality necessary to meet PMS requirements. Therefore, assessing and {{improving the quality of}} pavement management data is a major challenge for both researchers and practitioners. This study advances the quality assessment of network-level <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data by answering the following questions: (a) How can we identify potential errors in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data used in PMSs? (b) How do multiple dimensions of error detection affect our ability to detect errors? (c) How does the accuracy of <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data impact predictions of future road network performance? And (d) How do we measure multiple quality dimensions of <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> datasets? First, this research devises and implements a computational method to identify potential errors in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data, integrating conventional statistical methods and heuristics. Second, the effect of considering multiple dimensions of error detection in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data was investigated. These dimensions are based on data properties, including time series trends in <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data, variability within uniform performance families, and the consistency between several performance indicators. Third, this research presents a quantitative assessment of the impact of data accuracy on the estimated remaining service life (RSL) of a roadway network as an overall measure of network health. Finally, it provides metrics for measuring data quality dimensions for <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> datasets. The developed technique was validated using <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> field data for a road network in Texas. The technique has the advantage of differentiating between extreme yet valid data points and potential errors. In addition, accounting for several properties of <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data to identify potential errors improves the results of this technique.

40|$|AbstractPavements {{are major}} assets of highway infrastructure. Maintenance and {{rehabilitation}} of these pavements {{to the desired}} level of serviceability {{is one of the}} challenging problems faced by pavement engineers and administration in the highway sector. The evaluation of pavement performance using <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> indicators is a basic component of any Pavement Management System. Various indicators like <b>Pavement</b> <b>Condition</b> Index (PCI), Present Serviceability Rating (PSR), Roughness Index (RI), etc. have been commonly used to assign a maintenance strategy for the existing pavements. The present paper is an effort in the similar direction, to develop a combined Overall <b>Pavement</b> <b>Condition</b> Index (OPCI) for the selected network of Noida urban roads. The study area consists of 10 urban road sections constituting 29. 92 km of Noida city. The methodology includes identification of urban road sections, pavement distress data collection, development of individual distress index and finally developing a combined OPCI for the network.

Pavement data collection and evaluation is one of the system's main components. <b>Pavement</b> <b>condition</b> included structural capacity, roughness, visual condition survey and skid resistance. Structural capacity data was determined using a Dynatest Falling Weight Defiectometer (FWD). Roughness measurements were collected using May's Ride Meter (MRM). Visual condition survey involved developing a distress evaluation form. The form included type, density and severity of the common type of distress found in the network. Skid resistance measurements were collected using Mu meter. The main objectives of this paper are to describe the procedures used to collect <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data and to evaluate the <b>pavement</b> <b>condition</b> data of the city main street network.
