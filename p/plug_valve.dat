50|$|It is also {{possible}} for a <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> {{to have more than}} two ports. In a 3-way <b>plug</b> <b>valve,</b> flow from one port could be directed to either the second or third port. A 3-way <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> could also be designed to shift flow between ports 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, and possibly even connect all three ports together. The flow-directing possibilities in multi-port plug valves are similar to the possibilities in corresponding multi-port ball valves or corresponding multi-port valves with a rotor. An additional possibility in plug valves is to have one port {{on one side of the}} <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> and two ports on the other side, with two diagonal and parallel fluid pathways inside the plug. In this case the plug can be rotated 180° to connect the port on the one side to either of the two ports on the other side.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are valves with {{cylindrical}} or conically tapered [...] "plugs" [...] {{which can}} be rotated inside the valve body to control flow through the <b>valve.</b> The <b>plugs</b> in <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> have one or more hollow passageways going sideways through the plug, so that fluid can flow through the <b>plug</b> when the <b>valve</b> is open. <b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are simple and often economical.|$|R

Serious operational problems are sometimes encountered with these valves during pump changeovers. Full equations of the dynamic behaviour of the <b>plug</b> check <b>valves</b> are derived and results are obtained for their performance in a typical power plant system.

Various vas-occlusive contraceptive methods have been researched for human-use, with interest in both reversible and irreversible methods, with the purpose of finding a suitable alternative to vasectomy and possible hormonal contraceptive treatments that are currently being researched. Potential methods include clips, <b>plugs,</b> <b>valves,</b> and other devices.|$|R
5000|$|When using Schlenk systems, {{including}} flasks, the use {{of grease}} is often necessary at stopcock valves and ground glass joints to provide a gas tight seal and prevent glass pieces from fusing. In contrast, teflon <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> may have a trace of oil as a lubricant but generally no grease. In the following text any [...] "connection" [...] {{is assumed to be}} rendered mostly air free through a series of vac-refill cycles.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common general type of <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> is a 2-port valve with two positions: open to allow flow, and shut (closed) to stop flow. Ports are {{openings in the}} valve body through which fluid can enter or leave. The plug {{in this kind of}} valve has one passageway going through it. The ports are typically at opposite ends of the body; therefore, the plug is rotated a fourth of a full turn to change from open to shut positions. This makes this kind of <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> a quarter-turn valve. There is often a mechanism limiting motion of the handle to a quarter turn, but not in glass stopcocks.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{are used}} to {{redirect}} flows through pipes. Two types of valves used in laboratory glassware are the stopcock valve and the threaded <b>plug</b> <b>valve.</b> These and other terms used below are defined in detail since they are bound to conflict with different sources.|$|E
50|$|Threaded {{plug valves}} are used {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> involves a plug with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a microvalve having a <b>valve</b> <b>plug,</b> connecting legs, anchors and actuators, allowing the <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> to move vertically to open or close the <b>valve.</b> The <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> can contain magnetic materials, and be operated by an actuator.

40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} annular valve seat that defines an annular valve orifice between {{the edges of}} the annular valve seat, an annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> sized to cover the valve orifice when the valve is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> on and off the annular valve seat. The use of an annular orifice reduces the characteristic distance between {{the edges of the}} valve seat. Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> and the annular valve seat for the valve to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug.</b> The use of a valve-plug holder that is under independent control to move the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> between its open and closed positions is important for achieving controllable fast operation of the valve...|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} Schlenk bombs {{can perform}} {{many of the}} functions of a standard Schlenk flask. Even when the opening is used to fit a bomb to a manifold, the plug can still be removed to add or remove material from the bomb. In some situations, however, Schlenk bombs are less convenient than standard Schlenk flasks: they lack an accessible ground glass joint to attach additional apparatus; the opening provided by <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be difficult to}} access with a spatula, and it can be much simpler to work with a septum designed to fit a ground glass joint than with a Teflon plug.|$|R
50|$|This {{pressure}} {{is transferred to}} the valve stem, which is connected to either the valve plug (see <b>plug</b> <b>valve),</b> butterfly valve etc. Larger forces are required in high pressure or high flow pipelines to allow the valve to overcome these forces, {{and allow it to}} move the valves moving parts to control the material flowing inside.|$|E
50|$|The proper {{construction}} of this claim {{was that it}} covered an automatic valve in combination with a contrivance consisting of a pinhole and pin, by which the valve may be raised from its seat, so as to leave the valve hole permanently open, or by which the valve may be rigidly closed upon its seat, making a closed or <b>plug</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|These operate by {{the varying}} {{viscosity}} of liquids and gases and {{are designed for}} situations, such as fire truck hoses, {{where there is a}} large flow and a large quantity of air to be vented rapidly. A conical <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> is spring-loaded. Flow around this valve acts against spring pressure. Flow of liquid is sufficient to hold the valve against the spring, flow of air is not.|$|E
50|$|A bonnet {{acts as a}} {{cover on}} the valve body. It is {{commonly}} semi-permanently screwed into the valve body or bolted onto it. During manufacture of the valve, the internal parts are put into the body and then the bonnet is attached to hold everything together inside. To access internal parts of a valve, a user would take off the bonnet, usually for maintenance. Many valves do not have bonnets; for example, <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> usually do not have bonnets. Many ball valves do not have bonnets since the valve body is put together in a different style, such as being screwed together at {{the middle of the}} valve body.|$|R
50|$|When {{the plug}} is conically tapered, the stem/handle is {{typically}} {{attached to the}} larger diameter end of the <b>plug.</b> <b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> usually do not have bonnets but often have {{the end of the}} plug with the handle exposed or mostly exposed to the outside. In such cases, there is usually not much of a stem. The stem and handle often come in one piece, often a simple, approximately L-shaped handle attached {{to the end of the}} plug. The other end of the plug is often exposed to the outside of the valve too, but with a mechanism that retains the plug in the body.|$|R
40|$|The term "valve " {{applies to}} a variety of devices for {{controlling}} the flow of liquid. Various valves allow for on-off control, modulation of the flow rate through the system, and prevention of back flow. They can also be used for pressure relief or as a safety device. In general, valves can vary from simple manual on-off devices to sophisticated control equipment which act as metering instruments and deliver predetermined amounts of water to the system.

No. 2005 lacked the Kylchap double chimney {{of the rest of}} the class, and No. 2006 had a different boiler design, with a longer combustion chamber, and firebox heating area and volume of 253 sq ft and [...] respectively with a Robinson superheater.

50|$|The first {{thermostats}} used {{a sealed}} capsule of an organic liquid with a boiling point {{just below the}} desired opening temperature. These capsules {{were made in the}} form of a cylindrical bellows. As the liquid boiled inside the capsule, the capsule bellows expanded, opening a sheet brass <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> within the thermostat. As these thermostats could fail in service, they were designed for easy replacement during servicing, usually by being mounted under the water outlet fitting at the top of the cylinder block. Conveniently this was also the hottest accessible part of the cooling circuit, giving a fast response when warming up.|$|E
5000|$|A Straus flask (often misspelled [...] "Strauss") is {{subclass}} of [...] "bomb" [...] flask {{originally developed}} by Kontes Glass Company, commonly used for storing dried and degassed solvents. Straus flasks are {{sometimes referred to}} as solvent bombs — a name which applies to any Schlenk bomb dedicated to storing solvent. Straus flasks are mainly differentiated from other [...] "bombs" [...] by their neck structure. Two necks emerge from a round bottom flask, one larger than the other. The larger neck ends in a ground glass joint and is permanently partitioned by blown glass from direct access to the flask. The smaller neck includes the threading required for a teflon plug to be screwed in perpendicular to the flask. The two necks are joined through a glass tube. The ground glass joint can be connected to a manifold directly or through an adapter and hosing. Once connected, the <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> can be partially opened to allow the solvent in the Straus flask to be vacuum transferred to other vessels. Or, once connected to the line, the neck can be placed under a positive pressure of inert gas and the <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> can be fully removed. This allows direct access to the flask through a narrow glass tube now protected by a curtain of inert gas. The solvent can then be transferred through cannula to another flask. In contrast, other bomb flask plugs are not necessarily ideally situated to protect the atmosphere of the flask from the external atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|For {{laboratory}} glassware, items {{sometimes have}} <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> with conically-tapered inserts called stopcocks (sometimes {{referred to as}} [...] "plugs" [...] by laypeople) with different bores. The valve bodies are usually made of glass, while the plugs are made of glass or Teflon. One also can find valves with Teflon spindle (for example one way valves or angled <b>valves)</b> When the <b>plug</b> is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When both <b>valve</b> body and <b>plug</b> are made of glass, a suitable grease (e.g. silicone grease or Ramsay grease) is usually used to give a good seal, {{as well as to}} prevent the valve from seizing and subsequently cracking.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "bomb" [...] flask is {{subclass}} of Schlenk flask {{which includes}} all flasks that {{have only one}} opening accessed by opening a Teflon <b>plug</b> <b>valve.</b> This design allows a Schlenk bomb to be sealed more completely than a standard Schlenk flask even if its septum or glass cap is wired on. Schlenk bombs include structurally sound shapes such as round bottoms and heavy walled tubes. Schlenk bombs are often used to conduct reactions at elevated pressures and temperatures as a closed system. In addition, all Schlenk bombs are designed to withstand the pressure differential created by the ante-chamber when pumping solvents into a glove box.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent to World War II, Duriron grew {{consistently}} in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, through {{product innovation}} and technical sales force expansion {{to serve the}} fast growing chemical process industries throughout the U.S., Canada and, in the later of those years, in Europe as well. New products included the first use of Teflon as a sealing substance in a patented special alloy non-lubricated <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> that quickly acquired a dominant position in the chemical valve business. A new heavy duty chemical pump with a patented reverse vane impeller did {{the same in the}} chemical pump business. The first all-Teflon-lined valve and pump were also successfully introduced. As a result, revenues grew from $5 million in 1950 to $125 million in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|The quick-opening [...] "pop" [...] valve was a {{solution}} to this. Their construction was simple: the existing circular <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> was changed to an inverted [...] "top hat" [...] shape, with an enlarged upper diameter. They fitted into a stepped seat of two matching diameters. When closed, the steam pressure acted only on the crown of the top hat, and was balanced by the spring force. Once the valve opened a little, steam could pass the lower seat and began {{to act on the}} larger brim. This greater area overwhelmed the spring force and the valve flew completely open with a [...] "pop". Escaping steam on this larger diameter also held the valve open until pressure had dropped below that at which it originally opened, providing hysteresis.|$|E
50|$|In 1855, John Ramsbottom, later {{locomotive}} {{superintendent of}} the LNWR, described {{a new form of}} safety valve intended to improve reliability and especially to be tamper-resistant. A pair of <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat. Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.|$|R
