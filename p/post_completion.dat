40|$|Abstract — <b>Post</b> <b>completion</b> {{error is}} the kind of human error which occurs when the main task is {{completed}} and there is a known (but not vital) final step which has to be done and that is forgotten or not performed. This paper aims to add to the research being done by conducting experiments imitating the real life door to door sales scenario, where salesmen use electronic devices to sign customers up to contract. The study aimed to examine the effect of a static cue button and a warning message and to find an answer to the hypothesis, “A <b>Post</b> <b>Completion</b> Warning message is more effective than a static cue button to reduce the <b>Post</b> <b>Completion</b> Errors. ” The experiment has three versions, version 1 being conducted using the simple prototype without a cue and warning, version 2 being conducted using the prototype having a cue, and version 3 being conducted using the prototype having a <b>post</b> <b>completion</b> warning message. The results from the experiment showed that a static cue button is useful to reduce human <b>post</b> <b>completion</b> errors; however, a <b>post</b> <b>completion</b> warning message is much more effective than static cue button in reducing <b>post</b> <b>completion</b> errors...|$|E

40|$|Background: The NMSF (2009) {{reported}} that 74 Trusts (40 %) in the UK lack expertise in delivering maternity based bereavement care. In response, 3 midwifery lecturers were issued {{with a small}} grant from NHS Scotland to devise and evaluate an interactive workbook intended to develop student midwives {{understanding of how to}} deliver high quality bereavement care. Aim: To develop a workbook called - an interactive workbook to shape bereavement care for midwives in clinical practice - and evaluate it for effectiveness at delivering learning objectives developed from the literature and from prior written lesson plans. Method: An evaluative audit was carried out using a scored questionnaire -Understanding Bereavement Evaluation Tool (UBET) - to gather data before and <b>post</b> workbook <b>completion.</b> The UBET was purposely designed to gather data about participants’ perceived level of learning before and <b>post</b> workbook <b>completion.</b> Participants were student midwives (n= 179) in their second/third year of study on a 3 year midwifery degree program at one of 3 universities. Findings: The mean pre-workbook UBET score equalled 16. 04 (SD = 3. 81) and post-intervention 26. 45 (SD = 2. 16). A significant main effect of observation point was observed (p < 0. 001), with post-intervention scores considerably higher than pre-intervention. Discussion: Findings demonstrate that the workbook is an effective method for teaching bereavement care to student midwives (it is available from the first author) ...|$|R
