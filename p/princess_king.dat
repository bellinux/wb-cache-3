Separated from his family and subjected to the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, the new ruler found comfort in Aspasia. Despite the opposition of his parents (exiled in Switzerland) and Venizelists (who wanted the king to marry a British <b>princess),</b> <b>King</b> Alexander I secretly married Aspasia on 17 November 1919. The public revelation of the wedding shortly after caused a huge scandal, and Aspasia temporarily left Greece. However, she was reunited with her husband {{after a few months}} of separation and was then allowed to return to Greece without receiving the title of Queen of the Hellenes. She became pregnant, but Alexander died on 25 October 1920, {{less than a year after}} their marriage.|$|E

Although many of these tales are replete with additions (or reductions) and may contain a certain measure of exaggeration as well as the expected variations that existed from one story teller to another, the value and the wisdom behind each story cannot be ignored.|$|R

50|$|Computer self-play {{studies show}} that a single pawn is enough to {{compensate}} the difference between queen and princess on an 8×8 board, and that on 10×8 boards princess plus pawn even have a light advantage over queen. This implies that the princess is worth approximately eight pawns. This appears somewhat surprising, as the value difference of the non-bishop-components (rook vs. knight) is closer to two pawns, implying an unusually large synergy between the bishop and knight move. Although princess versus rook is usually a draw, so is queen versus <b>princess.</b> <b>King</b> and princess versus king is a forced win for the side with the princess; checkmate can be forced within 17 moves. In comparison, the queen requires 10 moves and the rook requires 16.|$|E

5000|$|King Taejong Muyeol {{was born}} with the [...] "sacred bone" [...] rank of seonggol. His father, Kim Yongsu (金龍樹), was a son of Silla's 25th ruler, King Jinji. When King Jinji was overthrown, all royalty from his line, {{including}} Kim Yongsu, were deemed unfit to rule over the kingdom. However, as he Yongsu {{was one of the}} few remaining seonggols, and married a seonggol <b>princess</b> (<b>King</b> Jinpyeong's daughter Princess Cheonmyeong), their child, Kim Chunchu, became seonggol and thus had a claim to the throne. Kim Yongsu was a powerful figure in the government. However, he lost all of his power to Kim Baekban, the brother of the king. In order to survive, he had accepted to become a jingol, the rank that was right below seonggol. Therefore, he lost his chance of becoming the king, and so did his child, Kim Chunchu. Following the death of his aunt, Queen Seondeok, Chunchu was passed over in favor of Jindeok of Silla, the last verifiable seonggol. With her death, all the seonggols were dead, so somebody with the royal blood in the jinggol rank had to succeed the throne. Kim Alcheon (a.k.a. So Alcheon), who was then Sangdaedeung (highest post of government) of Silla was the original favorite to succeed the throne. His father was a seonggol, who married a jingol wife so that his son would not be a seonggol and suffer from the fight for the throne. However, Kim Yushin supported Kim Chunchu, and Alcheon eventually refused the throne and supported Chunchu's claim. As a result, Kim Chunchu succeeded the throne as King Muyeol.|$|E
50|$|Behaviorally, {{a knight}} was to regard himself towards a lady with a {{transcendence}} of premeditated thought—his virtue ingrained within his character. A chevalier was to conduct himself always graciously, bestowing upon her the utmost courtesy and attentiveness. He was to echo shades {{of this to}} all women, regardless of class, age, or status. Over time, the concept of chivalry {{and the notion of}} the courtly gentleman became synonymous with the ideal of how love and romance should exist between the sexes. Through the timeless popularization in art and literature of tales of knights and <b>princesses,</b> <b>kings</b> and queens, a formative and long standing (sub)consciousness helped to shape relationships between men and women.|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} based on the online {{database}} “Estonian Droodles” (available at [URL] containing 7, 200 droodles collected from 1963 up to the present), which includes a number of longer visual narrative riddles (about 430 text variants, 79 types, i. e. different droodles). The question component of the so-called ‘narrative droodles’, or ‘droodle tales’, is a verbally transmitted tale visualised by means of a pictorial image. The performer of a droodle sketches the image during narration and the story ends with a punch line question. Among narrative droodles there are variants built on a specific scene and plot, which may even resemble a miniature fairy tale. The extremely condensed plot centres on only one or two characters. For the purpose of distancing from reality, a <b>princess,</b> <b>king,</b> prince, witch, Little Red Riding Hood, etc. may be chosen as protagonists; the more popular characters are represented as the following character pairs — girl/boy, brother/sister, woman/man, grandmother/grandfather. The narrative droodles are not comparable to the majority of fairy tales in length, but the fast pace of modern life seems to favour the use of such illustrated narrative riddles. An analysis of the structural composition and function of narrative droodles of this type reveals the shared common features with the structure and function of fairy tales...|$|E

50|$|The Likay story {{repertoire}} {{ranges from}} historic incidents to well known folk tales larded with humorous anecdotes.

Their fates unfold in stories of love which usually involve overcoming obstacles, as well as in family dramas which always have a happy ending. Although the language and character of some of the figures are rude and barely represent appropriate decency, good and bad are sharply distinguished and the troupes leave the audience with a clear moral with the good always defeating the bad.|$|R
