The reactions of HBr with O 3, HBr with O 3 and formaldehyde with NO or NO 2 {{in the dark and}} upon irradiation, and the irradiations of Br 2 in the presence of formaldehyde and/or NO x were studied. The experiments {{were carried out}} in air at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature in a 5870 liter evacuable Teflon-coated chamber with quartz end windows and a xenon arc solar simulator light source. In-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to monitor most reactants and products. Most experiments used dry air, except for the HBr + O 3 runs with varying humidity. Ozone was found to react with HBr with an apparent rate constant of 4 x 10 - 19 cm 3 molec - 1 s - 1, with the data suggesting that HOBr is formed in the initial reaction, but that it reacts with HBr to form Br 2, with a rate constant of at least 3. 5 x 10 - 15 cm 3 molec - 1 s - 1. Humidity affected the HBr wall loss rate but did not affect the apparent O 3 + HBr rate constant, suggesting that the reaction of HBr with O 3 may not be surface dependent. In the presence of NO x the reactions of Br 2 or HBr caused consumption or transformations of NO and NO 2 and formation of varying amounts of BrNO and BrNO 2. Attempts to model the experiments in the presence of NO x were unsuccessful.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the UV-initiated electron transfer and dissociation fragment dynamics of selected n -alkyl bromides physisorbed on single crystals of GaAs. By systematically varying different chemical and structural parameters of the adsorbate/substrate system we explore a number of fundamental questions regarding the basic physics and chemistry of photochemical processes on surfaces. Monolayers of methyl, ethyl and <b>propyl</b> <b>bromide</b> were deposited on the (110), Ga-terminated (100) and As- terminated (100) surfaces of GaAs without thermal decomposition at 80 K. Substrate-mediated electron transfer to the molecule, induced by exposure to UV light at 193, 248 and 351 nm, causes C-Br bond cleavage. The electron transfer dynamics of this mechanism are examined {{as a function of}} wavelength and molecular complexity of the adsorbate to better understand the flow of energy and charge across the adsorbate/substrate interface. The photodynamics of the alkyl fragments are studied using mass-, energy- and angle-resolved time-of-flight measurements. The alkyl fragment dynamics are observed {{to be sensitive to the}} length of the hydrocarbon chain, the wavelength of the dissociating light and the structure and chemical composition of the surface. The photodynamics are discussed in terms of adsorbate orientation on the surface, energy partitioning, and radical-surface interactions. Differences in the methyl fragment dynamics from the GaAs(100) surfaces suggest site-specific adsorption of the molecule. Pre- and postirradiation thermal desorption studies were employed to investigate the photoreactions of the alkyl radicals and bromine fragments on all three surfaces.

40|$|Environmental chamber {{experiments}} and computer model calculations {{were conducted to}} assess the atmospheric ozone formation potentials of 1 -propyl and 1 -butyl bromides. The experiments consisted of blacklight irradiations, in a dual ~ 5000 -liter chamber, of simulated photochemical smog mixtures with and without propyl or butyl bromide added. They employed two different reactive organic gas surrogate mixtures to represent other organic pollutants in the atmosphere, and used different surrogate/NO x levels. The {{results indicated that the}} alkyl bromides cause accelerated rates of ozone formation once ozone formation begins in the higher NO x experiments, but have smaller effects on O 3 formation rates in lower NO x experiments, and cause ozone levels to peak and then decline in the later stages of the runs. A chemical mechanism was developed to represent the atmospheric reactions for these alkyl bromides, and the bromine atom, BrO x species, and bromine-containing carbonyl products they are predicted to form. This mechanism could simulate the results of the chamber experiments only if it is assumed that there is a rapid reaction between O 3 and HBr, forming HOBr, which photolyzes rapidly to form OH + Br. However, separate measurements in another chamber indicate that this reaction is relatively slow. This indicates that there is some unknown process which is occurring in our chamber experiments which has the same effect as a rapid O 3 + HBr reaction. The calculated ozone impacts of the bromides under atmospheric conditions were found to depend significantly on NO x conditions and whether the unknown process, represented by the rapid O 3 + HBr reaction, is assumed to occur in the atmosphere as it does in our chamber. <b>Propyl</b> <b>bromide</b> is calculated to be an ozone inhibitor or ha [...] ...|$|E

The potential application of such systems is limited, however, by inefficient current generation. Polymer-based protein engineering (PBPE) offers a unique method to tailor enzyme function through tunable modification of the enzyme surface with functional polymers. In this study, we report on the modification of glucose oxidase (GOX) with ferrocene-containing redox polymers to increase current generation efficiency in an enzyme-modified anode.

40|$|The {{development}} of enzymatic biosensors and enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) {{has been a}} significant area of research for decades. Enzymatic catalysis can provide for specific, reliable sensing of target analytes as well as the continuous generation of power from physiologically present fuels. However, the broad implementation of enzyme-based devices is still limited by low operational/storage stabilities and insufficient power densities. Approaches to improving upon these limitations have focused on the optimization of enzyme activity and electron transfer kinetics at enzyme-functionalized electrodes. Currently, such optimization can be performed through enzyme structural engineering, improvement of enzyme immobilization methodologies, and fabrication of advantageous electrode materials to enhance retained enzyme activity density at the electrode surface and electron transfer rates between enzymes and an electrode. In this work, varying electrode materials were studied to produce an increased understanding on the impacts of material properties on resulting biochemical, and electrochemical performances upon enzyme immobilization and an additional method of electroactive enzyme-based optimization was developed through the use of polymer-based protein engineering (PBPE). First, graphene/single-wall carbon nanotube cogels were studied as supports for membrane- and mediator-free EBFCs. The high available specific surface area and porosity of these materials allowed the rechargeable generation of a power density within one order of magnitude of the highest performing glucose-based EBFCs to date. Second, two additional carbon nanomaterial-based electrode materials were fabricated and examined as EBFC electrodes. Graphene-coated single-wall carbon nanotube gels and gold nanoparticle/multi-wall carbon nanotube-coated polyacrylonitrile fiber paddles were utilized as electroactive enzyme supports. The performance comparison of these three materials provided an increased understanding of the impact of material properties such as pore size, specific surface area and material surface curvature on enzyme biochemical and electrochemical characteristics upon immobilization. Third, PBPE techniques were applied to develop enzyme-redox polymer conjugates as a new platform for enzymatic biosensor and EBFC optimization. Poly(N-(3 -dimethyl(ferrocenyl) methylammonium <b>bromide)</b> <b>propyl</b> acrylamide) (pFcAc) was grown directly from the surface of glucose oxidase (GOX) through atom-transfer radical polymerization.

GOX-pFcAc conjugates were further examined as working catalysts in carbon paper-based enzymatic biosensors, which provided reliable and selective glucose sensitivities and allowed a systematic analysis of sources of instability in enzyme-polymer conjugate-based biosensors and EBFCs.
