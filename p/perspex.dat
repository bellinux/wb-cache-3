5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of Minogue in a white room {{dressed in a black}} swimsuit. She is then shown lying on top of a white {{platform}} with a python wrapped around her body. Scenes of Minogue and her three dancers walking a catwalk, posing for photographs and dancing are intercut throughout the music video. The video concludes with Minogue trapped inside a spinning <b>perspex</b> box.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked <b>perspex</b> nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} hoard {{have been on}} display almost {{continuously}} since the treasure was received at the British Museum. Some items were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at Ipswich Museum in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important items went on permanent display at the British Museum {{in a new and}} enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard, and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. Some items from the Hoxne Hoard were included in Treasure: Finding Our Past, a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A <b>perspex</b> reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes in which it was deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of the different types of items with sample items inside. It is now part of the permanent display in London, along with other items laid out more traditionally.|$|E
5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A <b>perspex</b> cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind <b>Perspex</b> sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E

25|$|Although the <b>perspex</b> screen {{mullions}} and transoms impaired {{the live}} audiences' view {{as well as}} external views of the arena on television, on numerous occasions {{it proved to be}} necessary. The floor flipper would send lighter robots (such as featherweights) out of the arena and straight into the <b>perspex</b> box. Furthermore, items from the drop zone were often unpredictable, most notably when Matilda obliterated a television screen with her flywheel sending shards of glass strewn across the arena.|$|E
25|$|The cockpit is {{immediately}} {{ahead of the}} wing leading-edge, enclosed with a lengthened <b>perspex</b> canopy, and the Skylark 4 was 80mm (4in) longer than its predecessor.|$|E
25|$|Crown Paints is in Darwen (500). DS Smith {{have the}} Hollins paper mill {{just south of}} {{junction}} 4 of the M65, off the A666 in Darwen, which is set to close. Across the M65 to the north Apeks make diving equipment at Blackamoor. Graham & Brown at Blackburn make fancy wallpaper, next to the Leeds & Liverpool Canal, and off the A6077 is CWV (Coloroll and Crown Wallpaper). Capita Group runs TV Licensing {{in the middle of}} the town. Lucite International has its main plant on the A666 in the north of the town centre, where it makes Lucite; this site, under ICI Acrylics, manufactured the <b>perspex</b> for wartime aircraft canopies from 1940, becoming Ineos Acrylics from 1999 until 2002 and the company is the world's largest manufacturer of methyl methacrylate (MMA); ICI Acrylics invented the process to make <b>perspex</b> in 1936; the granular form of <b>Perspex</b> was known by ICI as Leukon. Tensar International, invented and manufacture geogrids for construction, off the A6077 near junction 5 of the M65 in Blackburn near the B6231 roundabout; nearby is Castle Metals UK.|$|E
25|$|The Zoozoos {{were split}} in two parts - {{the body and the}} head. The body was made using a special {{material}} stuffed with foam in some places (notably around the stomach) while the head was created using a harder material called <b>Perspex.</b>|$|E
25|$|Housed in the Regional Resource Centre, the Open Store is {{accessible}} to visitors. Objects are housed on racks along one wall, while {{the bulk of}} items are in a rolling archive, with one set of shelves opened, with <b>perspex</b> across their fronts to permit viewing without touching.|$|E
25|$|Launched on June 7, 1955, {{it offered}} modern amenities, like private {{plumbing}} in passenger cabins and air-conditioning throughout the ship. It {{was designed to}} carry freight and passengers, with first, cabin and tourist class accommodations. A <b>perspex</b> statue of Aphrodite, Birth of Aphrodite, which was carved by Arthur Fleischmann stood in the Embarcation Hall.|$|E
25|$|On top of {{the tower}} is a red painted iron alloy lantern room capped with an iron alloy dome. It holds six panels, five clear glazed and one of red <b>perspex.</b> A hatch under the sill on the western face opens to the gallery. The gallery is wooden, {{hexagonal}} in form, with a pipe handrail, supported on metal struts.|$|E
25|$|Aerospace System Operators (ASOps or Scopies) were {{responsible}} for the tracking and identification of every flight - military and civil, that entered or left the UK Air Defence Region (UKADR). This was a labour-intensive task in the days before automatic initiation and tracking systems, but a big improvement on the plotting table and small <b>perspex</b> plaques with information written on them. The School of Fighter Control continued to teach plotting and writing backwards until 1990.|$|E
25|$|Radar became {{small enough}} to be carried on board aircraft, but the fragile feed horns and reflectors needed to be {{protected}} and streamlined from the airstream. Moulded radomes were constructed, using the <b>Perspex</b> acrylic plastic that was already in use for cockpit windows. This could be heated to soften it, then moulded or vacuum formed to shape. Other polymers developed at this time, notably Nylon, found uses in compact radio equipment as high-voltage insulators or dielectrics.|$|E
25|$|The Skeeter's crew of {{two were}} housed within an {{enclosed}} glazed <b>perspex</b> canopy, complete with removable doors. The {{design of the}} cabin had been heavily shaped by the requirement for the Skeeter to be suited to the air observation post (AOP) role that the type had been heavily marketed towards. The nose structure of the Skeeter bore {{the weight of the}} rotorcraft's equipment, payload, and crew in addition to the inertial forces present during manoeuvring and landing loads from the nose wheel. The light-alloy structure contained control access panels in the floor and a battery unit within the nose itself.|$|E
25|$|The typical Chairman Mao badges of the Cultural Revolution {{period were}} made from an {{aluminium}} base, either coloured gold or left silver, covered with a red plastic pattern, to produce a red and gold or a red and silver design. Other colours were also used sometimes, such as yellow for a field of sunflowers as a background to Mao. In addition to the typical aluminium and plastic badges, badges were also made in other materials, such as porcelain, bamboo, <b>perspex</b> and plastic, but these made up {{only a tiny fraction}} of the total number of badges produced.|$|E
25|$|On 2 January 1995, the stripe {{theme was}} modified; the pointed 'G' was larger {{on the blue}} stripe against a {{computer}} generated multicoloured background and the 'G' was created by filming a large <b>perspex</b> 'G' with motion control photography. This ident was used, {{from a variety of}} angles, until 7 November 1999, by which point additional idents based on surreal surroundings, such as a fish blowing a bubble with a G inside, which floated to the surface, or a camera zoom into the eye of a housewife to reveal the G in her eye, were introduced.|$|E
25|$|This ident was altered {{slightly}} on 1 September 1989 following the TVS management restructuring, {{so that the}} ident was against a gradient blue background and cut in to {{the rotation of the}} logo into the lettering. The caption was changed to 'Television' to reflect the stations technical name of TVS Television, and the music was altered slightly to be bolder. Against the blue background, the metallic lettering now has the appearance of glass or <b>perspex.</b> This ident was used by TVS until they went off air on 31 December 1992, when a special ident with the caption 'Thanks for Watching' was used to close the final TVS programme.|$|E
25|$|The flight {{began moving}} from Cairns to Bougainville in late October 1944, with its main party {{arriving}} {{on the island}} on 14 December 1944. Some operational flying was conducted in December, but all of No. 17 AOP Flight's aircraft had to be grounded on the 31st of the month as their fabric airframes had been damaged by the tropical conditions. The necessary repairs included replacing some of the Austers fabric sections and <b>perspex</b> windows, but the process of shipping these items to Bougainville proved slow. As a result, the unit was inactive until the first aircraft to be repaired returned to service on 1 February 1945. A detachment of No. 17 AOP Flight was established on 14 February at Cape Hoskins {{on the island of}} New Britain to support the Australian Army units engaged there; this detachment comprised two officers and eight airmen, and was subsequently equipped with de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In some styles or settings, such as {{country music}} clubs or churches, small venues, {{or when a}} live {{recording}} is being made, the drummer may use a transparent <b>perspex</b> or plexiglas drum screen (also known as a drum shield) to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit {{is known as a}} drum booth. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the audio engineer can have more control over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the PA system mix or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a way to reduce the overall volume of the band in the venue. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to or in place of clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see other performers, the record producer or the audio engineer well.|$|E
500|$|On top of {{the tower}} is a {{bluestone}} gallery and balcony with gunmetal railings. The gallery has a painted cast iron floor grate with a cast iron stair leading to the outdoor gallery. The lantern room is atop this gallery, made of metal and glass, encircled and protected by <b>perspex</b> and aluminium panels. It has a decorative iron catwalk encircling the glass to allow for cleaning. The lantern house is the original [...] Chance Bros. cast iron and copper lantern house, one of about 21 known to exist in Australia.|$|E
500|$|Syro was {{released}} on Warp on 19September 2014in Australia, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and Switzerland; 22September in the UK and various European countries, including Denmark and Netherlands; 23September in the US; and 24September in Japan. The album {{was released}} on triple LP, CD and various digital formats, including MP3, AAC, WAV and FLAC. A limited-edition box set version of Syro, featuring a bonus track debossed on <b>perspex</b> vinyl, was released through Bleep.com. Limited to 200pressings, interested users had to first enter a lottery, [...] "in the interest of fairness", to become eligible.|$|E
500|$|The firemen {{made their}} way up an {{enclosed}} staircase with Serial 502 behind them. Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared {{at the top of}} the stairs, blowing whistles and throwing bottles. Pengelly ordered the officers and firefighters to retreat. They were forced to run backwards down the unlit narrow staircase, fearful of tripping over the fire hoses, which had been flat before but were now full of water. PC Richard Coombes, armed with just a short truncheon, said the noise – [...] "Kill the pigs!" [...] – was deafening, and he could hardly see through the scratched <b>Perspex</b> visor on his helmet.|$|E
500|$|TWR {{developed}} a further six XJ220-S road cars, featuring one-piece carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer {{front and rear}} bodywork; the engine was tuned to [...] The XJ220-S models did away with the hidden headlamps of the original and instead opted for <b>perspex</b> covered lights. The S models were essentially road-going versions of the XJ220-C racer, {{and as a result}} featured a much simpler race-orientated interior with kevlar seats and the removal of the leather trim. Colin Goodwin, a writer for Autocar, tested an XJ220-S in June 1995 at Millbrook Proving Ground and set the lap record at an average speed of [...]|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of Black Sabbath, Gillan was {{required}} to learn their old repertoire, but had difficulty remembering the words. He eventually {{came up with a}} solution of writing the lyrics out on a <b>perspex</b> folder, and balancing it on a wedge monitor, turning the pages with his feet. Unfortunately, the dry ice on stage made it impossible to read the words, resulting the audience witnessing glimpses of him peering over the microphone to sing a few lines, then disappearing below the dry ice to read the next set. As well as material from Born Again, and older Sabbath numbers, the band regularly played Deep Purple's [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as an encore.|$|E
500|$|Tintin and Captain Haddock {{receive a}} phone call from their friend, the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, who informs them about a new spiritual leader whom she has begun following, Endaddine Akass, stating her {{intention}} to stay at his villa in Ischia. Later that day, Haddock enters the Fourcart Gallery in Brussels, where Jamaican avant-garde artist Ramó Nash convinces him to purchase one of his [...] "Alph-Art" [...] works, a <b>perspex</b> letter [...] "H". The gallery's owner, Henri Fourcart, arranges to meet Tintin, but is {{killed in a car accident}} while on his way to do so. Tintin begins to investigate, discovering that Fourcart's death was murder. Tintin and Haddock attend one of Akass' lectures; there, Tintin recognises Akass' voice, but is unsure why. Investigating further, he concludes that Akass was spying on Fourcart through a micro-transmitter hidden in a pendant worn by the latter's assistant, Martine Vandezande. Tintin soon faces a number of attacks designed to kill him, but survives both.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Lady Gaga {{announced}} plans to release a box set titled Born This Way: The Collection and a remix album titled [...] The box set was first released in Germany on November 18, 2011, and consisted of a 17-track version of Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way, the aforementioned remix album and a DVD release of the HBO concert special [...] Along with the collection, she also planned to release a coffee table book called Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson, containing pictures shot during The Monster Ball Tour. The album cover was released on October 21, 2011. The image shows Gaga wearing a dress made of slime by designer Bart Hess, a <b>Perspex</b> hat made by Charlie le Mindu, and heels by Alexander McQueen. Photographer Nick Knight shot the cover, and was initially one of the outtakes from the imagery shot for Born This Way, later re-touched and re-used as the box set's cover. New booklets were also provided alongside the regular ones and the whole case was in a digipak.|$|E
500|$|On 1 March, Diamandis {{unveiled}} the album artwork {{for the standard}} version of Electra Heart, which depicts a blonde Diamandis wearing several hair rollers. The singer later revealed {{that because of the}} dye, her hair started to fall out, so she got a boy's haircut and wore a wig. Becky Bain from Idolator complimented its [...] "retro film stock look" [...] and opined that it [...] "is just a snapshot from some 1970s exploitation movie", while Bradley Stern from MuuMuse jokingly referenced the album track [...] "Homewrecker" [...] when stating that she [...] "looks like a proper Suzy Homemaker! (Or should I say Suzy Homewrecker?)" [...] The artwork for the deluxe version features the same picture of Diamandis, although it is tinted purple. The track listing for the standard version was confirmed on 1 March, while the track listing for the deluxe version was announced on 5 March. A limited edition box set of Electra Heart contained the deluxe version of the record, four photo art cards, a ring, <b>perspex,</b> necklace, and pocket mirror.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{synthetic}} organic polymers are polyethylene (polythene), polypropylene, nylon, teflon (PTFE), polystyrene, polyesters, [...] polymethylmethacrylate (called <b>perspex</b> and plexiglas), and polyvinylchloride (PVC).|$|E
2500|$|Naturally {{occurring}} polymers such as cotton, starch {{and rubber}} were familiar materials {{for years before}} synthetic polymers such as polyethene and <b>perspex</b> appeared on the market.|$|E
2500|$|Although PMMA {{is often}} called simply [...] "acrylic", acrylic can also refer to other {{polymers}} or copolymers containing polyacrylonitrile. Notable trade names include Acrylite, Lucite, R-Cast, Plexiglas, Optix, <b>Perspex,</b> Oroglas, Altuglas, Cyrolite, and Sumipex.|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{his career}} Kubíček {{realised}} that the third dimension would render his work more complex and complete. <b>Perspex</b> seemed to him the ideal material for this purpose. Moreover, the layering of sheets in space allowed the viewer to see through objects, and multiple layers accentuated colors, proferring tones distinct from those available through the conventional mixing of acrylic paints. [...] "The essence of my geometric work is simplicity and comprehensiveness," [...] said Kubíček. “When I transform my sketches into artefacts made of wood, plastic and other materials, some elements of the construction will always remain hidden from the viewer's eye. <b>Perspex,</b> on the other hand, makes the construction transparent and legible, revealing details otherwise obfuscated by opaque materials." ...|$|E
2500|$|The MC-101 carried two pilots side by {{side with}} dual control. [...] There was no cabin but they were {{protected}} behind a large <b>perspex</b> screen with rounded vertical edges. [...] It flew {{for the first time on}} 11 November 1952. [...] Only one was built.|$|E
2500|$|Awaiting {{the arrival}} of a scanner, in the autumn of 1940 the AMRE had ordered the {{delivery}} of an aircraft with some sort of radio-transparent nose. The Indestructo Glass company proposed using [...] thick <b>Perspex,</b> while the AMRE team preferred a composite material of polystyrene fabric and Egyptian cotton bound with phenol formaldehyde resin (the glue used in Bakelite), or a similar paper-based resin composite. The <b>Perspex</b> solution was chosen, and in December 1940 Bristol Blenheim N3522, a night fighter adaptation of the Blenheim V, arrived at RAF Christchurch, the nearest suitable airfield. A number of attempts had to be made to successfully mount the nose to their test aircraft. It was not until the spring of 1941 that Indestructo delivered suitable radomes and the mounting issues were wholly solved.|$|E
2500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Rose design was that the turret was not fully enclosed. Previous designs had <b>perspex</b> around the gun position, but in the Rose turret there was no {{protective}} shielding immediately {{in front of the}} gunner. This feature reflected operational experience: many Lancaster gunners had cut away parts of their turret <b>perspex</b> in order to obtain a better view, a practice that had originated at RAF Gransden Lodge, and which was subsequently known as the [...] "Gransden Lodge modification". Testing of the Rose turret found that the open design reduced the temperature in the turret – which was typically very low – by only four degrees Celsius compared with a closed design. As well as improving the gunner's view, this feature also made it easier for him to bail out of the aircraft in an emergency.|$|E
