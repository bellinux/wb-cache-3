5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a <b>pathological</b> <b>examination</b> of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The {{adequacy}} of surgical resection {{is a major}} factor in determining the role of postoperative adjuvant therapy. In the presence of a positive margin on <b>pathological</b> <b>examination,</b> most radiation oncologists recommend radiation to the primary site, and concurrent chemotherapy. A negative margin {{is more likely to be}} treted with lower doses and a smaller treatment volume. Also the removal of a bulky tumour may allow reduced dosage to adjacent uninvolved pharyngeal structures and hence less effect on normal swallowing.|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} {{pathological}} diagnosis of general pancreatic disease, which {{is divided into}} three categories; solid lesions, cystic lesions and strictures of the pancreatic duct. <b>Pathological</b> <b>examinations</b> include cytology of the pancreatic juice, histological biopsy and histological examination of the resected specimen. These <b>pathological</b> <b>examinations</b> are performed before, during and after surgery. Therefore, pathological diagnosis of pancreatic disease {{plays an important role in}} the differential diagnosis between benign lesions and malignant lesions, grading of intraepithelial lesions in the pancreatic duct and staging of malignant tumors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMetastasis to the mandibular condyle is rare, {{and such}} lesions should be {{identified}} by both clinical and <b>pathological</b> <b>examinations.</b> We experienced a case of adenocarcinoma occurring in the right mandibular condyle. A 65 -year-old female with uterine cervical cancer showed condylar dysfunction. Imaging examinations revealed a tumor with bone destruction and a rapidly progressive course, while <b>pathological</b> <b>examinations</b> suggested metastasis originating from another site. Based on the clinical and pathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with condylar metastasis derived from the uterine cervix, {{in addition to a}} recurrence of uterine cervical cancer...|$|R

2500|$|Whether {{these victims}} were gladiators or noxii is unknown. Modern <b>pathological</b> <b>examination</b> {{confirms}} the probably fatal {{use of a}} mallet on some, {{but not all the}} gladiator skulls found in a gladiators' cemetery. Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as noxii, denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. [...] Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or familia is not known.|$|E
2500|$|Colposcopy ( [...] + skopos [...] "look at") is {{a medical}} {{diagnostic}} procedure to examine an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix and the tissues of the vagina and vulva. Many premalignant lesions and malignant lesions in these areas have discernible characteristics which can be detected through the examination. It is done using a colposcope, which provides an enlarged view of the areas, allowing the colposcopist to visually distinguish normal from abnormal appearing tissue and take directed biopsies for further <b>pathological</b> <b>examination.</b> The main goal of colposcopy is to prevent cervical cancer by detecting precancerous lesions early and treating them. The procedure {{was developed by the}} German physician Hans Hinselmann, with help from Eduard Wirths. The procedure involved female Jewish inmates from Auschwitz.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe report {{two cases}} of {{pulmonary}} sequestration infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) : Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus. Chest computed tomography showed pneumonic consolidation {{in the right}} lower lobe, which received a systemic blood supply from the descending aorta in both patients.

A {{review of the literature}} revealed only seven previous case reports of pulmonary sequestration infected with NTM, and no case with Mycobacterium abscessus has been reported...|$|R
30|$|Detection of {{mesothelioma}} at {{an early}} stage is often difficult, and differential diagnosis from other cancerous and non-cancerous diseases needs careful <b>pathological</b> <b>examinations</b> including an immunohistochemical staining with several kinds of antibody. The latent period after asbestos exposure is long, more than 30  years in an average, and a medical procedure to prevent the tumor development is currently unavailable. Many industrial countries have terminated to use asbestos, but emerging countries especially in Asia rather increase asbestos consumption due to their economic development (Lin et al. 2007).|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} great {{heterogeneity}} seen in lung cancers (especially those occurring among tobacco smokers), the considerable variability in diagnostic and sampling techniques used in medical practice, the high relative proportion of individuals with suspected GCCL who do not undergo complete surgical resection, and the near-universal lack of complete sectioning and <b>pathological</b> <b>examination</b> of resected tumor specimens prevent high levels of quantitative accuracy.|$|E
