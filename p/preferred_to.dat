40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to look on the learning styles of the teacher education students which served as basis in improving the teaching and learning process. Specifically, it described the students’ socio-demographic profile and their learning styles. The implications of learning styles to the instruction process were also given as well as some proposed strategies to improve the instruction process which is congruent to the learning styles of the students. This study was anchored on Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences which states that human beings have nine different kinds of intelligence that reflect different ways of interacting with the world. The types of intelligence that a person possesses (Gardner suggests most of us are strong in three types) indicates not only a persons capabilities, but also the manner or method in which they <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> learn and develop their strengths. Results of the study showed that majority of the respondents are 16 - 17 years old; belong to a family with Php 10, 000 and below monthly income; with 4 - 5 siblings in the family; parents are high school level or high school graduates; and fathers are engaged in farming while mothers are housewives. Learning styles of the students in terms of learning environment showed that majority <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> learn in a quiet environment; well lighted room; with cool temperature; sitting in soft chairs or pillows; and in informal setting. In terms of emotional preferences, majority are self motivated; <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> study lesson one at a time; <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> study without being reminded; and <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> be told exactly what and how to do things. In terms of social preferences, most <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> study and learn by pair. In terms of physiological preferences, most <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> learn by doing things; eating or munching while studying; <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> study in the morning; and with less break and movements. While in terms of psychological preferences, majority are analytic or they <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> learn sequentially and reflective or they take time to make decisions...|$|R
