Is there a proper, objective and balanced distribution of public funds among the Romanian counties? Does any county face disadvantage by the allocation of amount from certain state budget revenues? An unequal, irrational economic development within a country results in changing the equilibrium and influences the overall balance and the individuals of the state. Local budgets are highly dependent on the funds they receive from the central budget. Very few local communities contrive to generate sufficient revenues by their own. Balancing local budgets is a necessity, but the balancing procedure suffered many legislative changes.

40|$|The {{integration}} of forest inventory and mapping {{has emerged as}} a major issue for assessing forest attributes and multiple environmental functions. Associations between remotely sensed data and the biophysical attributes of forest vegetation (standing wood volume, biomass increment, etc.) can be exploited to estimate the attribute values for sampled and non-sampled pixels, thus producing maps for the entire region of interest. Among the available procedures, the k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) technique is becoming popular, even for practical applications. However, the k-NN estimates at the pixel level tend to average towards the population mean and to have suppressed variance, since large values are usually underestimated and small values overestimated. This tendency may be detrimental for k-NN applications in forest resource management planning and scenario analysis where the representation of the spatial variability of each attribute of interest across the surveyed territory is fundamental. The present paper proposes a procedure to tackle such an issue by modifying k-NN estimates via a post-processing <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> matching. The empirical distribution function of the population values is estimated from the sample of ground data by using the 0 -inflated beta distribution as the assisting model and the k-NN estimates are subsequently modified {{in such a way as}} to match the estimated distribution. The statistical properties of the distribution matching estimators for totals and averages are theoretically derived, while the performance of the distribution matching estimator at the pixel level are empirically evaluated by a simulation study.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a general methodology for detecting indirect per unit costs of multi-product firms. The methodology {{rests on the}} law of "no distortion" of the decision making process invoked by SCAPENS (1991). The game theory approach (SHUBIK (1962), HAMLEN, HAMLEN, TSCHIRHART (1980)) has previously exploited the idea of neutrality of joint cost allocation. It constrains the allocated costs to be conditional to the decision making process of the firm (DEMSKI, FELTHAM (1976)). We admit here that the aim is the maximization of the profit. We use the law of "no distortion" to derive a cost allocation procedure that is neutral. It says that under a fixed decision objective the optimal action is the same whatever the joint cost is allocated or not. When the main objective of the firm is to optimize its profit, the condition of "no distorsion" of the profit maximization processis the following one. The proportionality of the allocated costs and the proportionality fot the marginal costs must be the same for all pairs of products. The only cost allocation method that replies on this understanding {{presents a}}s a <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> in proportion to the cost volume elasticities. This procedure involves that allocated costs reflect marginal costs. Moreover, it explicitly takes into account the impact of economies of scale. We show that the dependence between allocated costs, marginal costs and economies of scale, is intrinsic to the problem of the joint cost allocation. Therefore, this last one becomes truly relevant only when the joint cost fonction is not homogenous. The law of "no distortion" is very general since the rusulting neutral allocation rule is closely dependent upon the assumptions concerning the profit function. Thus, the methodology extends without difficulties to more sophisticated cases. For example, we could use the information contained in the complexity of the production process (may be expressed in terms of activity centers). One also could extend the analysis to the case where the economic environment is uncertain, risky and intertempora...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of products and}} merchandises {{can be done in}} various modes. The mode aimed by this study is the "integrated" distribution. It brings together a manufacturer and merchants who are linked by contract. The object of the latter is to oblige the merchants to buy, exclusively or not, the manufacturer's goods for reselling on their behalf. This resale is organized by the manufacturer who dictates to them the obligations concerning the sale and the maintenance of the goods. Those obligations engender contractual relationships on a regular basis between the parties which are essential for the commercial survival of the resalers. In fact, the latter put their enterprise of distribution at the manufacturer's disposal. Thus, the parties adhere to a same <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> because the manufacturer can follow his goods from the production to the consumption stage. The preliminary chapter of this thesis specifies and elaborates the terminology in Quebec Law on the usual terms relative to those contracts. This was rendered necessary because of the influence of American terminology on the subject. This work naturally led to an historic overview of the contracts of integrated distribution in five major juridical systems: United States, England, Canada, France and Quebec. The first chapter's purpose is to establish a classification of those contracts which are proteiforms. To this end, we used two types of criterion of classification, namely the economical criteria and the juridical criteria. The economical criteria will study the economic activity aimed by those contracts and the form of economic concentration which they represent. Our juridical criteria will analyse the clause of exclusivity and the clause of control. Having thus established the criteria of classification, we will then, in a second chapter, examine the obligational content of the contracts of integrated distribution. These can be divided in two main categories according to whether they possess or not a clause of territoriality. Contracts that do not have a clause of territoriality can be divided between those which have or do not have the exclusivity of supply...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this article is to improve {{modeling}} of solar irradiance through the analysis of measurement data on the ground in the intertropical zone. For this, we identify, using information criteria, the probabilistic distributions introduced in two models of synthetic solar irradiance generation.

Our study confirms, for example, that the Gaussian classical distribution is not suitable for modeling solar irradiance, and we propose other more suitable statistical laws instead. The value <b>of</b> the identification <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>distribution</b> laws presented in this article is that it ensures the production of solar irradiance data comparable in their statistical content to the measured data.

Methods A validated questionnaire was sent to the work addresses of all nursing and midwifery staff in a medium-sized general acute hospital in Australia. A total of 190 nurses and midwives returned completed questionnaires for the analyses.
