40|$|Policing is power. <b>Police</b> <b>authority</b> {{relies on}} {{transactions}} or relationships {{of power and}} influence. The nature of that authority depends on, and takes its form from specific environments of opportunity. Opportunity is, in turn, designated by the aspirations for such relationships, and structures and processes at work towards their regulation. <b>Police</b> <b>authority</b> can be confirmed either legitimately or illegitimately, depending on its context. Essential to the operation of <b>police</b> <b>authority</b> are the 2 ̆ 2 boundaries of permission 2 ̆ 2 which designate the dominion of police power. A principal regulator of <b>police</b> <b>authority,</b> and therefore an important mechanism whereby boundaries of permission are determined, is accountability. Requirements for accountability may determine whether <b>police</b> <b>authority</b> is perceived as legitimate or otherwise. For instance, if the democratisation of policing is nominated by a community as a pre-condition for the legitimisation of its authority, then participatory processes of accountability may be required in confirmation of <b>police</b> <b>authority...</b>|$|R
5|$|Following {{the success}} of François les bas-bleus, Messager received, and accepted, {{simultaneous}} invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an operetta for the Folies-Dramatiques.
