5|$|In a {{study done}} by Statistics Canada's General Social Survey of 10,000 households, the average man spent under {{two hours a day}} dealing with {{childcare}} and house work while women on average spent a little more than three. This study highlights the unequal distribution of labor between partners. Of the people surveyed, under fifteen percent of the couples agreed on doing around the same amount of work in the house. About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> who were surveyed.|$|E

25|$|Women have {{increasingly}} {{moved out of}} unpaid domestic work and into the paid formal and informal labor markets. Many female workers are in Chile's informal sector because national competition for jobs has {{increased the number of}} low-skill jobs. In 1998, 44.8 percent of working-aged women in Chile worked in the informal sector while only 32.9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> worked informally.|$|E
25|$|Bessarabia was {{the most}} {{backward}} of the western provinces of the Russian Empire. In 1897, literacy was just 15.4% for the whole Bessarabia, with only 6% of ethnically Moldavians being literate, the main reason behind this being that Russian was the only language of instruction. As of 1920, an estimated ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> and one percent of women were able to read and write.|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} of early medieval cemeteries in Moravia shows that 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> and 60 {{percent of women}} died before reaching the age of 40. More than 40 percent of the graves contained the remains of children aged one to twelve. However, the cemeteries also document rich nutrition and advanced health care.

25|$|If {{cancer is}} suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy a {{urologist}} or radiologist obtains tissue {{samples from the}} prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six {{on each side of}} the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization. Antibiotics should be used to prevent complications like fever, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. Fifty-five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> report discomfort during prostate biopsy.|$|E
25|$|Although Malagasy {{women have}} {{increasingly}} begun to use contraceptives, both oral and injected, those used are not enough; only 1.5 {{percent of women}} use implanted contraceptives. The abortion rate is estimated at 1 in 10, with 24 percent of women having undergone an abortion. Fifteen percent of married women wishing to use contraceptives {{have no access to}} family planning initiatives. In the majority of cases a woman's husband entirely or partially decides what actions should be taken. There is a minority opinion (held by 9 percent of women and 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men)</b> that a husband may beat his wife if she refuses sex.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reported}} that roughly 2 million dogs are slaughtered and consumed {{every year in}} South Korea. In recent years the number of dog meat has gone down as more people have been adopting dogs as pets. Dog restaurants are also closing down, with reports saying the country’s 1,500 dog meat restaurants have almost halved in recent years. A poll conducted by Gallup Korea in 2015 showed that only 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> in their 20s consumed dog meat, compared to half of those in their 50s and 60s. However, there are still approximately 17,000 dog farms operating across the country, often in inhumane conditions.|$|E

25|$|Statistical data {{proves that}} the {{majority}} of women work in the service and domestic sectors while men work in the production sector. According to data from the 1940s, gender equality existed neither in the domain of work nor in the area of politics in the kibbutzim of the time. For instance, in 1948, in eight kibbutzim of the Ihud, a kibbutz federation with a pragmatic socialist orientation, 78.3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the women worked in services (services for adults, child care, education) as compared with 16.7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>men.</b> That same year, 15.2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the women worked in production as distinct from 58.2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>men.</b> The situation was the same in political life.|$|R

25|$|Evidence {{points to}} the {{negative}} impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, {{and are more likely to}} be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.|$|E
25|$|An {{update on}} the above study; it employs the same methodology, has a larger sample (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E

500|$|Over 4,569,000 {{adults and}} 167,000 {{children}} in North Korea {{are believed to}} consume tobacco daily. It is estimated by the World Lung Foundation and American Cancer Society's The Tobacco Atlas (2014 data) that 45% of men, 2.5% of women, nearly 16% of boys and <1% of girls (aged <15) are daily smokers, with the average smoker (data is likely skewed towards males due to the higher prevalence of smoking in this group) smoking an average of 609 cigarettes per person per year. World Health Organization (WHO) data is roughly comparable, with 44% of men classified as smokers (only 33% are classed as [...] "daily smokers"), whilst North Korean anti-smoking authorities put the figure even higher, saying that some 54 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> are smokers.|$|E
