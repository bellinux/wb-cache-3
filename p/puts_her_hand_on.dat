5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge.|$|E
25|$|One day he {{suddenly}} finds {{the energy to}} get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E

6000|$|MARTHA--I know; but, after all, {{your work}} is yours, not mine. I have been only a helper, a good comrade, too, I hope, but--somehow--outside of it all. Do you {{remember}} {{two years ago when}} we were camped in Yunnan, among the aboriginal tribes? It was one night there when we were lying out in our sleeping-bags up in the mountains along the Tibetan frontier. I couldn't sleep. Suddenly I felt oh, so tired--utterly alone--out of harmony with you--with the earth under me. I became horribly despondent--like an outcast who suddenly realizes the whole world is alien. And all the wandering about the world, and all the romance and excitement I'd enjoyed in it, appeared an aimless, futile business, chasing around in a circle in an effort to avoid touching reality. Forgive me, Curt. I meant myself, not you, of course. Oh, it was horrible, I tell you, to feel that way. I tried to laugh at myself, to fight it off, but it stayed and grew worse. It seemed as if I were the only creature alive--who was not alive. And all at once the picture came of a tribeswoman who stood looking at us in a little mountain village as we rode by. She was nursing her child. Her eyes were so curiously sure of herself. She was horribly ugly, poor woman, and yet--as the picture came back to me--I appeared to myself the ugly one while she was beautiful. And I thought of our children who had died--and such a longing for another child came to me that I began sobbing. You were asleep. You didn't hear. [She pauses--then proceeds slowly.] And when we came back here--to have a home at last, I was so happy because I saw my chance of fulfillment--before it was too late. [In a gentle, pleading voice.] Now can you understand, dear? [She <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his arm.] ...|$|E
