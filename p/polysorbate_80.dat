40|$|Emulsion is {{a mixture}} of two {{immiscible}} substances. For the emulsion, we have two types which are Oil-in water emulsions (O/W) and Water –in-oil emulsions (W/O). Diesel fuel emulsions are blended mixtures of diesel fuel, water, emulsifying agents and other additives, that reduce particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions, {{as a result of the}} added water. Addition of water to the emulsified fuel also reduces the energy content of the fuel, with corresponding reductions in fuel economy and engine power. Emulsified diesel fuel has been the subject of several studies, and for comparative purposes in several others. This emulsified diesel fuel is a combination of diesel fuel with 20 % water by weight, and an "additive package" for stabilizing the fuel-water emulsion. To mixed diesel with water we should add surfactants. The surfactants that we used are Sorbitan monoolate, NF,(Span <b>80),</b> <b>Polysorbate</b> 60,NF,(Tween 60), <b>Polysorbate</b> 80,NF,(Tween <b>80),</b> Triton X- 100.

40|$|Purpose. The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} fluorescent molecular rotors (DCVJ and CCVJ), which are mainly sensitive to viscosity, for the characterization of polysorbate-containing IgG formulations and compare them to the polarity-sensitive dyes ANS, Bis-ANS and Nile Red. Methods. IgG formulations with <b>polysorbate</b> 20 or <b>80</b> were stressed below the aggregation temperature and analyzed by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and by HP-SEC with UV and fluorescent dye detection (Bis-ANS and CCVJ). Furthermore, commercial protein preparations of therapeutic proteins (Enbrel® 50 mg, Humira® 40 mg and MabThera® 100 mg) were aggregated accordingly and analyzed with CCVJ fluorescence and HP-SEC. Results. Contrarily to (Bis-) ANS and Nile Red, the molecular rotors DCVJ and CCVJ showed low background fluorescence in polysorbate-containing buffers. Time-resolved fluorescence experiments confirmed the steady-state fluorescence data. Both DCVJ and CCVJ showed enhanced fluorescence intensity for aggregated IgG formulations and were suitable for the characterization of polysorbatecontaining IgG formulations in steady-state fluorescence and HP-SEC with dye detection (CCVJ). CCVJ was capable of detecting thermally induced aggregation in the commercial polysorbate-containing products Enbrel® 50 mg, Humira® 40 mg and MabThera® 100 mg. Conclusion. Fluorescent molecular rotors are suitable probes to detect aggregation in polysorbatecontaining IgG formulations.

40|$|Due to the {{essential}} demands for novel anti-tuberculosis treatments for global tuberculosis control, this research investigated the antimycobacterial activity of Hypericum perforatum herb (commonly known as St. John’s wort, SJW), including a SJW methanol extract, purified major bioactive constituents of SJW: hypericin (Hpn), pseudohypericin (Phn) and hyperforin (Hfn). The SJW acidified methanol extract showed bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium JLS at 0. 05 mg/ml culture. Purified compounds were tested at similar concentrations {{contained in the}} SJW methanol extract treatment. Among three purified bioactive compounds, only Hfn was bactericidal at 12 μg/ml. The other two compounds Phn and Hpn were not inhibitory or bactericidal at concentrations corresponding to the SJW methanol extract treatments. The <b>Polysorbate</b> surfactant Tween <b>80,</b> which is commonly added to the mycobacterial cultures to prevent cell clumping, {{was found to have}} inhibitory effects on the antimycobacterial activities of SJW extract and hyperforin. The addition of Tween 80 (0. 05 % v/v) increased the minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC) of SJW methanol extract from 0. 05 to 0. 33 mg /ml and from 12 to 80 μg/ml for Hfn. This inhibitory effect of Tween 80 on SJW is opposite to the effect of Tween 80 on the antimycobacterial activity of rifampin and isoniazid. These observations are also in conflict with the existing permeability barrier hypothesis. A hypothesis that hyperforin molecules were sequestered in the core of Tween 80 micelles was given out to explain the repression effect of Tween 80 on hyperforin activity. The effectiveness of Tween 60, Tween 40 and Tween 20 on SJW activity was also tested. Tween 60 and Tween 40 showed the similar dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SJW extract activity with Tween 80, while the inhibitory effect of Tween 20 is much weaker. A preliminary test was performed to detect the activity of SJW acidified MeOH extract and hyperforin on M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv strain. Results showed the MIC was 0. 67 mg SJW extract/ml and 200 μg Hfn /ml. In all, M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv stain is not that sensitive to SJW and hyperforin as other non-pathogenic strains tested in the present and previous studies...|$|R
2500|$|A {{significant}} amount of {{research in this area}} has been spent exploring methods of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of antineoplastic drugs to tumors in the central nervous system. For example, radiolabeled polyethylene glycol coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres targeted and accumulated in a rat gliosarcoma. However, this method is not yet ready for clinical trials, due to the accumulation of the nanospheres in surrounding healthy tissue. Another, more promising approach, is the coating of polyalkylcyanoacrylate or poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles with <b>polysorbate</b> <b>80</b> or poloxamer 188. [...] Due to this coating the particles [...] adsorb apolipoproteins E or A-1 from the blood and [...] thus interact with the LRP1 or with the scavenger receptor followed by transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier into the brain. These particles loaded with doxorubicin for the treatment of glioblastomas are presently in Clinical Phase I. Recently, a novel class of multifunctional nanoparticles known as magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) has been discovered for externally controlled targeted delivery and release of drug(s) across BBB as well as wireless stimulation of cells deep in the brain. This approach depends more on the field control and less on the cellular microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo (on mice) experiments to prove the feasibility of using MENs to release a drug across BBB on demand and wirelessly stimulate the brain have been conducted by the research group of Prof. Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU).|$|E
