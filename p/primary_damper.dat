40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to conduct {{preliminary}} modelling and analysis of primary vertical dampers in railway vehicle suspension systems to support {{the development of a}} low cost condition monitoring system. Currently damper maintenance is calendar based, but with implementation of a continuous condition monitoring system, the damper’s health status will be known and hence it will become possible for maintenance intervals to be extended. This in-turn will reduce costly downtime and increase vehicle availability. Of particular interest are the failure modes of primary vertical dampers, and the determination of sensor type and placement within the damper to support the wider future plans to develop a complete condition monitoring solution. The simulation and analysis work to support the derivation of sensor type and placement will be achieved with the aid of computational fluid dynamics modelling (CFD). The research questions are established, followed by an overview of railway vehicles and the functions of their suspension systems, including primary and secondary dampers. A literature review of existing research in the field of condition monitoring of rail vehicle dampers and the use of computational fluid dynamic modelling in analysis of dampers is then conducted. <b>Primary</b> <b>damper</b> failure modes are identified and the most prominent modes established using existing data provided by Unipart Rail Ltd. A brief overview of computational fluid dynamic methods is conducted, followed by a selection of approach. A fluid dynamic model is created and compared with an existing damper. It is proposed that {{it may be possible to}} detect the majority of failure modes, with effective processing of data provided by an appropriate sensor. The results of the fluid dynamic modelling show that sensors are best placed on the top and bottom of the piston head or within the compression and extension chambers of the damper. A pressure sensor with a measuring range corresponding to the CFD is also suggested (between 25 Pa and 117, 000 Pa). Further work is suggested, which consists of further CFD modelling and employing vehicle dynamics simulation techniques to further characterise the operating environment of the damper. This information could then be further employed to specify an advanced testing regime, which would explore the degradation modes of the damper in more detail and ultimately lead to the development of failure mode algorithms for integration within a remote condition monitoring architecture for remaining life predictions...|$|E

We show that the classical viscous damping valid on scales larger than the collision mean free path (∼ 10 8 cm) is unimportant for magnetically dominated or low beta plasmas and the <b>primary</b> <b>damping</b> mechanism is the collisionless damping by the background particles. We show that the damping rate is proportional to the total random momentum density of the particles. For solar flare conditions this means that in most flares, except the very large ones, the damping is dominated by thermal background electrons. For large flares one requires acceleration of essentially all background electrons into a nonthermal distribution so that the accelerated electrons can be important in the damping of the waves. In general, damping by thermal protons is negligible compared to that of electrons except for quasi-perpendicular propagating waves. Damping due to nonthermal protons is also negligible compared to nonthermal electrons in most flares which are electron dominated, except for rare proton dominated flares with strong nuclear gamma-ray line emission. Thus for common flares collisionless damping by background thermal electrons is the <b>primary</b> <b>damping</b> mechanism. Using the rate for this process we determine the critical scale (or wave vector kc) below which (i. e. for k> kc) the damping becomes important and the spectrum of the turbulence steepens.

In the new setup, the absorber consists of a mass spring and damper, and is attached such that it separates the primary system from the fixed support. White noise excitation is assumed and the objective function is the mean square value of the primary system response function. For given damping and mass ratios of the system, the optimal stiffness and damping ratios of the absorber are determined. The optimal parameters are obtained in an analytical closed form when the primary system is undamped, and calculated numerically for <b>damped</b> <b>primary</b> systems. It is shown that an optimal mass ratio exists, unlike the case of classical absorbers where performance increases with increasing absorber mass.

40|$|We use a {{combination}} of analytical theory, numerical simulation, and data analysis to study the propagation of acoustic waves along coronal loops. We show that the intensity perturbation of a wave depends on a number of factors, including dissipation of the wave energy, pressure and temperature gradients in the loop atmosphere, work action between the wave and a flow, and the sensitivity properties of the observing instrument. In particular, the scale length of the intensity perturbation varies directly with the dissipation scale length (i. e., damping length) and the scale lengths of pressure, temperature, and velocity. We simulate wave propagation in three different equilibrium loop models and find that dissipation and pressure and temperature stratification are the most important effects in the low corona where the waves are most easily detected. Velocity effects are small, and cross-sectional area variations play no direct role for lines-of-sight that are normal to the loop axis. The intensity perturbation scale lengths in our simulations agree very well with the scale lengths we measure in a sample of loops observed by TRACE. The median observed value is 4. 35 × 10 9 cm. In some cases the intensity perturbation increases with height, which is likely an indication of a temperature inversion in the loop (i. e., temperature that decreases with height). Our most important conclusion is that thermal conduction, the <b>primary</b> <b>damping</b> mechanism, is accurately described by classical transport theory. There is no need to invoke anomalous processes to explain the observations. ...|$|R

The primary system consists of a mass, viscous damping and a cubic stiffness provided by a soft helical spring, over which is mounted a cantilever beam with a PZT patch actuator actively controlled to attenuate harmonic and resonant excitation forces. With the PZT actuator on the cantilever beam absorber, cemented {{to the base of the}} beam, the auto-parametric vibration absorber is made active, thus enabling the possibility to control the effective stiffness and damping associated to the passive absorber and, as a consequence, the implementation of an active vibration control scheme able to preserve, as possible, the autoparametric interaction as well as to compensate varying excitation frequencies and parametric uncertainty. This active vibration absorber employs feedback information from a high resolution optical encoder on the primary Duffing system and an accelerometer on the tip beam absorber, a strain gage on the base of the beam, feedforward information from the excitation force and on-line computations from the nonlinear approximate frequency response, parameterized in terms of a proportional gain provided by a voltage input to the PZT actuator, thus modifying the closed-loop dynamic stiffness and providing a mechanism to asymptotically track an optimal, robust and stable attenuation solution on the primary Du-ffing system.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} optimal design {{solution is}} presented for piecewise-linear vibration isolation systems. First, primary suspension optimum parameters are established, {{followed by an}} investigation of jump-avoidance conditions for the secondary suspension. Within the no-jump zones, an optimal design solution is then obtained for the secondary system and overall results are discussed. Averaging method is employed to obtain an implicit function for frequency response of a bilinear system under steady-state conditions. This function is examined for jump-avoidance and a condition is derived which when met ensures that the undesirable phenomenon of &# 039;jump&# 039; does not occur and the system response is functional and unique. Optimal stiffness and damping parameters for the primary suspension are extracted from a recently established work for passive linear vibration systems. For each point of the primary suspension optimal curve, jump-free zones are identified. Iterating this process, a boundary surface between no-jump (unique response) and jump (multiple-response) areas is established. Keeping optimal parameters for the primary suspension system fixed, the secondary suspension stiffness and damping parameters are varied inside the no-jump zones to explore optimum solutions for the secondary. The root mean square (RMS) of the absolute acceleration is minimized against the RMS of the relative displacement (η). It is observed {{that there is a}} certain band of parameters defined by <b>primary</b> <b>damping,</b> within which a valid frequency response can be obtained. An optimum numerical solution is sought within this band of parameters. Optimal solution curves are achieved for the secondary suspension.

40|$|The {{concept of}} active {{technology}} in rail vehicles {{has been studied}} theoretically and experimentally for several decades and has now reached the stage of implementation. Active Lateral Suspension (ALS) is the active technology that leads the development in active secondary suspensions if carbody tilting is disregarded. Active suspension systems may have an influence on running safety of the vehicle. The requirements to fulfil are related to forces between wheel and rail. The safety must be assured by the manufacturer by a safety assessment, which must {{be sent to the}} authorities before entering service. An important part of the assessment is to show that the active system, under all conditions, is part of a vehicle that runs safely on the track. The passive components {{in the vicinity of the}} active system have an important role in assuring that even a defective active system fulfils the required safety. This master thesis aims to set requirements on the passive suspension components for the failed ALS. The study has been conducted by varying various parameters of the vehicle with different running conditions and failure cases. The study highlights that the secondary lateral bumpstop is the most important parameter for the vehicle safety. With soft bumpstop (low stiffness) the vehicle runs within safe limits for all studied conditions, and the effect of varying other parameters, running conditions and failure cases, is marginal. For somewhat higher stiffness (medium bumpstop), the effect of other parameters plays a critical role in ensuring safe run. For hard bumpstop, the track shift forces are above the limit values, independently of the passive component settings. High vertical forces have been observed for certain cases with medium bumpstop, due to primary vertical bumpstop contact, which can be prevented by increasing the <b>primary</b> vertical <b>damping</b> or by increasing the vertical play. Reduction in track shift forces has been observed with the increase of <b>primary</b> vertical <b>damping.</b> The reason for the effect is not known and is proposed for further study...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{vibration}} absorbers and dampers {{are used}} to reduce the vibration responses of mechanical systems. A dynamic vibration absorber reduces vibrations of a primary system over a desired frequency range by absorbing the energy through responding with opposite phase {{to that of the}} force acting on the <b>primary</b> system. A <b>damper,</b> on the other hand, is a device used for reducing the magnitude of a shock or vibration by energy dissipation methods. The latter is extensively used in automotive engines to reduce torsional oscillations and in aircraft landing gears to damp out shimmy oscillations. This thesis aims to study and understand an optimally tuned viscous torsional vibration damper which is a combination of a dynamic vibration absorber and <b>damper.</b> The <b>primary</b> system whose vibration is to be suppressed, along with the optimally tuned viscous torsional vibration damper, will form a two-degree-of-freedom system which will be studied for its dynamic behaviour.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem for}} the application of a tuned vibration absorber is to minimize the response of a structural system, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration or to maximize the energy dissipated by tuned vibration absorber. The development of explicit optimal absorber parameters is challenging for a clamped structural system since the fixed points no longer exist in the frequency response curve. This paper aims at deriving a set of simple design formula of tuned vibration absorber with nonlinear viscous damping based on the frequency tuning for harmonic load for a damped structural system under white noise excitation. The vibration absorbers being considered include tuned mass damper (TMD) and liquid column vibration absorber (LCVA). Simple approximate expression for the standard deviation velocity response of tuned vibration absorber for <b>damped</b> <b>primary</b> structure is also derived in this study to facilitate the estimation of the damping coefficient of TMD with nonlinear viscous damping and the head loss coefficient of LCVA. The derived results indicate that the higher the structural inherent damping the smaller the supplementary damping provided by a tuned vibration absorber. Furthermore, the optimal damping of tuned vibration absorber is shown to be independent of structural damping when it is tuned using the frequency tuning for harmonic load. Finally, the derived closed form expressions are demonstrated to be capable of predicting the optimal parameters of tuned vibration absorbers with sufficient accuracy for preliminary design of tuned vibration absorbers with nonlinear viscous damping for a <b>damped</b> <b>primary</b> structure.

30|$|The laboratory-calibrated load-stress {{transitive}} relation {{differs from the}} real load-stress {{transitive relation}}. This difference {{is caused by the}} difference between the constraints on the road and those on the laboratory bench, even if the laboratory bench installs the bogie, including spring, axle box, rod, anti-yaw bracket, and other related accessories, according to actual operating conditions. The most significant influencing factors are rigidity matching and gap issues. Different constraint stiffness values and contact gaps in the same direction may offset or increase the stress caused by different loads. Another cause for such a difference is the effect of the changing wheel-rail contact point on the arm of force. Therefore, from a statistical perspective, the optimized load-stress transitive relation is more reasonable than that calibrated by laboratory bench. The stress calculated by the optimized transfer coefficient still exhibits a certain degree of deviation from the measured signal. Such deviation is mainly caused by partial loads. For example, <b>primary</b> vertical <b>damper</b> loads and secondary horizontal damper loads are not measured in this test. Another reason is that elastic vibration phenomenon exists in the local structure (e.g., motor bracket). Overall, load and stress exhibit a linear relationship under the operating conditions.|$|R

In this paper, closed-form generalized solutions for computing seismic active earth thrust and its distribution on nonvertical rigid retaining walls with fully submerged backfill are proposed using the modified pseudodynamic approach. The seismic analysis of retaining walls was carried out with a planar rupture surface in viscoelastic submerged backfill. The proposed modified pseudodynamic analysis satisfied the zero-stress-boundary condition on a free surface and considered the standing shear and <b>primary</b> waves, soil <b>damping,</b> amplification in the backfill, and an excess pore-pressure ratio in the backfill. A detailed parametric study was performed to {{gain an understanding of}} the effects of different parameters, including the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient, excess pore-water-pressure ratio, period of lateral shaking, damping ratio, wall inclination, and soil-friction and wall-friction angles. A comparison of the present study results and the existing analytical and experimental studies resulted in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{models of}} airflow output and power {{consumption}} were developed for series and parallel fan powered variable air volume terminal units at typical design pressure conditions. A testing procedure and experimental setup {{were developed to}} test sets of terminal units from three different manufacturers. Each set consisted of two series and two parallel units, each with 8 in. (203 mm) and 12 in. (304 mm) primary air inlets, {{for a total of}} four units in each set. Generalized models were developed for the series and parallel units, with coefficients varying by size and manufacturer. Statistical modeling utilized SAS software (2002). Fan power and airflow data were collected at downstream static pressures over a range from 0. 1 to 0. 5 in. w. g. (25 to 125 Pa) for the parallel terminal units. Downstream static pressure was held constant at 0. 25 in. w. g. (62 Pa) for the series units. Upstream static pressures of all variable air volume (VAV) terminal units ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 0 in. w. g. (25 to 498 Pa). Data were collected at four different <b>primary</b> air <b>damper</b> positions. Data were also collected at four different terminal unit fan speeds, controlled by a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR). The models utilized the RMS voltage entering the terminal unit fan, the 'rake' sensor velocity pressure, and the downstream static pressure. In addition to the terminal unit airflow and power models, a model was developed to quantify air leakage in parallel terminal units, when the unit fan was off. In all but two of the VAV terminal units, the resulting models of airflow and power had R 2 values greater than 0. 90. In the two exceptions, there appeared to be manufacturing defects: either excessive air leakage or a faulty SCR that limited the effectiveness of the airflow and power models to capture the variation in the data...|$|R
40|$|A design {{method is}} {{proposed}} to suppress stationary random vibration in flexible structures using a hybrid vibration absorber (HVA). While the traditional vibration absorber can damp down the vibration mainly at the pre-tuned mode of the <b>primary</b> structure, active <b>damping</b> {{is generated by}} the proposed HVA to damp down all resonant modes of interest of the vibrating structure and the spatial average mean square motion of the vibrating structure can be minimized. Only one absorber and one feedback signal are required to achieve global vibration suppression of a flexible structure under stationary random excitation. A special pole-placement controller is designed such that all vibration modes of the flexible structures become critically damped. It is proved analytically that the proposed HVA damps the vibration of the entire structure instead of just the attachment point of the absorber. The proposed optimized HVA is tested on a beam structure and it shows a superior performance on global suppression of broadband vibration in comparison to other published designs of passive and hybrid vibration absorbers.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} development of techniques for determining optimum parameters of passive dampers and vibration absorbers, {{but most of}} the existing studies are limited to the case of an undamped primary structure. This paper aims to develop a first order approximation of the optimal liquid column vibration absorber (LCVA) parameters for suppressing the displacement response of a damped structure under white noise induced ground acceleration. The optimum parameters of a LCVA for the case of an undamped primary structure subjected to white noise induced ground acceleration are first derived and the results are then extended to the case where some damping exists in the primary structure by using a perturbation technique. The accuracy of the derived formulas is then verified through a comparison with the results obtained from numerical methods as well as the results of other studies found in the literature. Finally, a direct approach for determining the optimal head loss coefficient is presented in this study. It is demonstrated that the closed-form approach is capable of predicting the optimal liquid column vibration absorber parameters with reasonable accuracy for <b>damped</b> <b>primary</b> structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{attaching}} {{dynamic vibration absorber}} (DVA) to a discrete multi-degree-of-freedom or continuous structure has been outlined in many papers and monographs. An impact damping system can overcome some limitations by impact as the damping medium and impact mass interaction as the damping mechanism. The paper contemplates the provision of DVA with the several of the impact masses. Such originally designed absorbers reduce vibration selectively in maximum vibration mode without introducing vibration in other modes. An impact damper is a passive control device which {{takes the form of}} a freely moving mass, constrained by stops attached to the structure under control, i. e. the <b>primary</b> structure. The <b>damping</b> results from the exchange of momentum during impacts between the mass and the stops as the structure vibrates. The paper contemplates the provision of the impact multi-mass DVA’s with masses collisions for additional damping. For some cases of DVA optimization such a design seems more effective than conventional multi-mass DVA with independent mass moving. A technique is developed to give the optimal DVA’s for the elimination of excessive vibration in harmonic stochastic and impact loaded systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel passive {{vibration}} control configuration, namely the tuned mass-damper-inerter (TMDI), introduced as a generalization {{of the classical}} tuned mass-damper (TMD), to suppress the oscillatory motion of stochastically support excited mechanical cascaded (chain-like) systems. The TMDI {{takes advantage of the}} "mass amplification effect" of the inerter, a two-terminal flywheel device developing resisting forces proportional to the relative acceleration of its terminals, to achieve enhanced performance compared to the classical TMD. Specifically, it is analytically shown that optimally designed TMDI outperforms the classical TMD in minimizing the displacement variance of undamped single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) white-noise excited primary structures. For this particular case, optimal TMDI parameters are derived in closed-form as functions of the TMD mass and the inerter constant. Furthermore, pertinent numerical data are furnished, derived by means of a numerical optimization procedure, for a 3 -DOF classically <b>damped</b> <b>primary</b> structure base excited by stationary colored noise, which exemplify the effectiveness of the TMDI over the classical TMD to suppress the fundamental mode of vibration for MDOF structures. It is concluded that the incorporation of the inerter in the proposed TMDI configuration can either replace part of the TMD vibrating mass to achieve lightweight passive vibration control solutions, or improve the performance of the classical TMD for a given TMD mass...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To analyse the {{contribution}} of certain social, familial, prenatal, perinatal, and developmental background factors in the pathogenesis of deficits in attention, motor control, and perception (DAMP).  METHODS—A population based case-control study was carried out with 113 children aged 6 years, 62 diagnosed with DAMP and 51 controls without DAMP. The children's health and medical records were studied and their history with regard to background factors was taken at {{an interview with the}} mother using a standardised schedule. Familial factors, possible non-optimal factors during pregnancy (including smoking), developmental factors (including early language development), and medical and psychosocial data were scored in accordance with the reduced optimality method.  RESULTS—Low socioeconomic class was common in the group with DAMP. Familial language disorder and familial motor clumsiness were found at higher rates in the DAMP group. Neuropathogenic risk factors in utero were also more common in the children with DAMP. Maternal smoking during pregnancy appeared to be an important risk factor. Language problems were present in two thirds of the children with DAMP. Sleep problems and gastrointestinal disorders, but not atopy or otitis media, were significantly more common in the DAMP group.  CONCLUSIONS—Prenatal familial and neuropathogenic risk factors {{contribute to the development of}} <b>DAMP.</b> <b>Primary</b> prevention, such as improved maternal health care and early detection or treatment, or both, of associated language problems appear to be essential. ...|$|R
