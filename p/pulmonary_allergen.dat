40|$|Various {{acute and}} chronic {{inflammatory}} stimuli {{increase the number}} and activity of pulmonary mucus-producing goblet cells, and goblet cell hyperplasia and excess mucus production {{are central to the}} pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary diseases. However, {{little is known about the}} transcriptional programs that regulate goblet cell differentiation. Here, we show that SAM-pointed domain-containing Ets-like factor (SPDEF) controls a transcriptional program critical for pulmonary goblet cell differentiation in mice. Initial cell-lineage-tracing analysis identified nonciliated secretory epithelial cells, known as Clara cells, as the progenitors of goblet cells induced by <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo expression of SPDEF in Clara cells caused rapid and reversible goblet cell differentiation in the absence of cell proliferation. This was associated with enhanced expression of genes regulating goblet cell differentiation and protein glycosylation, including forkhead box A 3 (Foxa 3), anterior gradient 2 (Agr 2), and glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 3, mucin type (Gcnt 3). Consistent with these findings, levels of SPDEF and FOXA 3 were increased in mouse goblet cells after sensitization with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergen,</b> and the proteins were colocalized in goblet cells lining the airways of patients with chronic lung diseases. Deletion of the mouse Spdef gene resulted in the absence of goblet cells in tracheal/laryngeal submucosal glands and in the conducting airway epithelium after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure in vivo. These data show that SPDEF plays a critical role in regulating a transcriptional network mediating the goblet cell differentiation and mucus hyperproduction associated with chronic pulmonary disorders. ...|$|E
40|$|Activin-A is a {{pleiotropic}} cytokine that {{participates in}} developmental, inflammatory, and tissue repair processes. Still, {{its effects on}} T helper (Th) cell–mediated immunity, critical for allergic and autoimmune diseases, are elusive. We provide evidence that endogenously produced activin-A suppresses antigen-specific Th 2 responses and protects against airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic airway disease in mice. Importantly, we reveal that activin-A exerts suppressive function through induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells that suppress Th 2 responses in vitro and upon transfer in vivo. In fact, activin-A also suppresses Th 1 -driven responses, pointing to a broader immunoregulatory function. Blockade of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β 1 reverses activin-A–induced suppression. Remarkably, transfer of activin-A–induced antigen-specific regulatory T cells confers protection against allergic airway disease. This beneficial effect is associated with dramatically decreased maturation of draining lymph node dendritic cells. Therapeutic administration of recombinant activin-A during <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergen</b> challenge suppresses Th 2 responses and protects from allergic disease. Finally, we demonstrate that immune cells infiltrating the lungs from individuals with active allergic asthma, and thus nonregulated inflammatory response, exhibit significantly decreased expression of activin-A's responsive elements. Our results uncover activin-A as a novel suppressive factor for Th immunity and a critical controller of allergic airway disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{histological}} {{identification of}} increased eosinophils in the gastrointestinal tract occurs in numerous clinical disorders; however, {{there is a}} limited understanding of the mechanisms regulating eosinophil trafficking into this mucosal surface. The results presented in this study characterize the processes regulating eosinophil homing into the gastrointestinal tract at baseline. Eosinophils {{were found to be}} present in the lamina propria of 19 -day-old embryos and germ-free adult mice at concentrations comparable to those present in non–germ-free adult mice. Furthermore, eosinophil gastrointestinal levels were not altered by increasing circulating eosinophils after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergen</b> challenge. Gastrointestinal eosinophil levels were partially reduced in mice deficient in recombinase activating gene- 1 (RAG- 1), IL- 5, or the β common chain (βc), but these reductions paralleled reductions in circulating eosinophils. In contrast, mice deficient in eotaxin had a marked reduction in gastrointestinal eosinophils but normal levels of eosinophils in the hematopoietic compartments. Furthermore, eotaxin was important for regulating eosinophil levels, even in the presence of high levels of IL- 5. These investigations demonstrate eosinophil homing into the gastrointestinal tract during embryonic development occurring independently of viable intestinal flora. Furthermore, eotaxin is identified as the primary regulator of eosinophil gastrointestinal homing under homeostatic states, and may therefore have a fundamental role in innate immune responses...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Testing the {{validity}} of our model of immunologically mediated asthma in mice, developed with toluene diisocyanate, using trimellitic anhydride (TMA), a known respiratory sensitizer and 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (DNCB), a known dermal sensitizer. Methods: On day 1, BALB/C mice received the chemical (20 µl/ear, TMA 5 % and DNCB 0. 2 %) or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) on each ear. On day 7 they received a dermal boost with the same concentration of the chemical (20 µl/ear). On day 10, the mice were intranasally challenged with the chemical (TMA 1 % or DNCB 0. 02 %, 10 µl/nostril) or vehicle. Lung function was monitored by whole body plethysmography for 40 min after challenge. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed 24 h after challenge by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and histology. TNF-a and MIP- 2 were measured in BAL. Immunological parameters included total IgE serum levels, lymphocyte populations in auricular (AurLN) and superficial cervical lymph nodes (CervLN), IL- 4 and IFN-g levels in supernatants of LN cells with or without concanavalin A (ConA) stimulation. Results: Mice sensitized with TMA, boosted with TMA or vehicle and challenged with TMA experienced markedly increased Penh immediately after the intranasal challenge. DNCB treated mice did not show any ventilatory changes after intranasal challenge. 24 h after challenge a neutrophil influx (5 - 10 %) and increase of MIP- 2 and TNF-a levels were found in BAL in both TMA and DNCB treated mice. AurLN cells of mice treated with TMA or DNCB showed an increase in CD 19 + B-cells. An increased level of IL- 4 and IFN-g was found in supernatants of ConA stimulated AurLN and CervLN cells of TMA or DNCB treated mice. Serum total IgE was increased in TMA treated mice only. Conclusion: Both compounds induced a mixed Th 1 -Th 2 response, but only TMA induced a pulmonary immunological respons. These results confirm that the model we developed is potentially suitable to specifically screen for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergens.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background Asthma is a {{clinically}} heterogeneous disease {{caused by}} a complex interaction between genetic susceptibility and diverse environmental factors. In common with other complex diseases {{the lack of a}} standardized scheme to evaluate the phenotypic variability poses challenges in identifying the contribution of genes and environments to disease expression. Objective To determine the minimum number of sets of features required to characterize subjects with asthma which will be useful in identifying important genetic and environmental contributors. Methods Probands aged 7 - 35 years with physician diagnosed asthma and symptomatic siblings were identified in 1022 nuclear families from 11 centres in six countries forming the Genetics of Asthma International Network. Factor analysis was used to identify distinct phenotypes from questionnaire, clinical, and laboratory data, including baseline <b>pulmonary</b> function, <b>allergen</b> skin prick test (SPT). Results Five distinct factors were identified:(1) baseline pulmonary function measures [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) ], (2) specific allergen sensitization by SPT, (3) self-reported allergies, (4) symptoms characteristic of rhinitis and (5) symptoms characteristic of asthma. Replication in symptomatic siblings was consistent with shared genetic and/or environmental effects, and was robust across age groups, gender, and centres. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0. 719 to 0. 983 suggesting acceptable internal scale consistencies. Derived scales were correlated with serum IgE, methacholine PC 20, age and asthma severity (interrupted sleep). IgE correlated with all three atopy-related factors, the strongest with the SPT factor whereas severity only correlated with baseline lung function, and with symptoms characteristic of rhinitis and of asthma. Conclusion In children and adolescents with established asthma, five distinct sets of correlated patient characteristics appear to represent important aspects of the disease. Factor scores as quantitative traits may be better phenotypes in epidemiological and genetic analyses than those categories derived from {{the presence or absence of}} combinations of +ve SPTs and/or elevated IgE...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{expression}} of 5 -lipoxygenase (5 LO) in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) {{has been observed}} in disease states such as <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension and <b>allergen</b> challenge. To understand the function of endothelial 5 LO, we examined the {{expression of}} this enzyme in normally cultured human PAECs and its characteristics when overexpressed. A small amount of 5 LO message and protein was detected by reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting in PAECs. Sequencing of the RT-PCR products that overlapped the entire coding region of 5 LO mRNA indicated that the sequence of PAEC 5 LO was identical with that of leucocyte 5 LO. Incubation of the PAECs with A 23187 and arachidonic acid led to a small production of 5 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5 -HETE) (46 - 98 pmol/ 4 x 10 (6) cells) but no leukotrienes. Overexpression of 5 LO in PAECs by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer revealed that the enzyme was localized in the nucleus. Incubation of the transduced cells with A 23187 (5 microM) caused the production of both 5 LO products and downstream leukotrienes. The proportions of the produced leukotriene A(4) (LTA(4)) hydrolates (sum of 6 -trans-LTB(4) and 12 -epi- 6 -trans-LTB(4)), LTB(4) and cysteinyl leukotriene were approx. 17 : 14 : 10. cGMP production in the 5 LO-transduced PAECs was decreased by 33 +/- 14 % on stimulation with A 23187. These results show that cultured PAECs express a minimal amount of 5 LO, which can generate some 5 -HETE, but not leukotrienes. However, increased expression of 5 LO in PAECs {{can lead to the}} production of all downstream leukotrienes, which could potentially cause endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary vasculature...|$|R
40|$|Complement {{component}} 5 (C 5) {{has been}} described as either promoting or protecting against airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in experimental allergic asthma, suggesting pleomorphic effects of C 5. Here we report that local pharmacological targeting of the C 5 a receptor (C 5 aR) prior to initial allergen sensitization in murine models of inhalation tolerance or allergic asthma resulted in either induction or marked enhancement of Th 2 -polarized immune responses, airway inflammation, and AHR. Importantly, C 5 aR-deficient mice exhibited a similar, increased allergic phenotype. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>allergen</b> exposure in C 5 aR-targeted mice resulted in increased sensitization and accumulation of CD 4 +CD 69 + T cells associated with a marked increase in pulmonary myeloid, but not plasmacytoid, DC numbers. Pulmonary DCs from C 5 aR-targeted mice produced large amounts of CC chemokine ligand 17 (CCL 17) and CCL 22 ex vivo, suggesting a negative impact of C 5 aR signaling on pulmonary homing of Th 2 cells. In contrast, C 5 aR targeting in sensitized mice led to suppressed airway inflammation and AHR but was still associated with enhanced production of Th 2 effector cytokines. These data suggest a dual role for C 5 a in allergic asthma, i. e., protection from the development of maladaptive type 2 immune responses during allergen sensitization at the DC/T cell interface but enhancement of airway inflammation and AHR in an established inflammatory environment...|$|E
40|$|Chronic airway disorders, {{including}} chronic obstructive {{pulmonary disease}} (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and asthma, {{are associated with}} persistent pulmonary inflammation and goblet cell metaplasia and contribute to significant morbidity andmortality world-wide. While the molecular pathogenesis of these disorders is actively studied, little is known regarding the transcriptional con-trol of goblet cell differentiation andmucus hyperproduction. Herein, we demonstrated that <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergen</b> sensitization induces expression of FOXM 1 transcription factor in airway epithelial and inflammatory cells. Conditional deletion of the Foxm 1 gene from either airway epithelium or myeloid inflammatory cells decreased goblet cell metaplasia, reduced lung inflam-mation, and decreased airway resistance in response to house dust mite allergen (HDM). FOXM 1 induced goblet cell metaplasia andMuc 5 AC expression through the transcriptional activation of Spdef. FOXM 1 deletion reduced expression of CCL 11, CCL 24, and the chemokine receptors CCR 2 and CX 3 CR 1, resulting in decreased recruitment of eosinophils andmacrophages to the lung. Deletion of FOXM 1 from dendritic cells impaired the uptake of HDM antigens and decreased cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) and costimulatory molecule CD 86, decreasing production of Th 2 cytokines by activated T cells. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of FOXM 1 by ARF peptide prevented HDM-mediated pulmonary re-sponses. FOXM 1 regulates genes critical for allergen-induced lung inflammation and goblet cell metaplasia. Asthma {{is one of the most}} common chronic respiratory dis-eases, affecting approximately 300 million individuals world-wide and representing a significant and growing cause of morbid...|$|E
40|$|Airway hyperresponsiveness and airway {{inflammation}} are {{hallmarks of}} allergic asthma, {{the etiology of}} which is crucially linked {{to the presence of}} Th 2 cytokines. A role for the complement anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a in allergic asthma was suggested, as deficiencies of the C 3 a receptor (C 3 aR) and of complement factor C 5 modulate airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, and Th 2 cytokine levels. However, such models do not allow differentiation of effects on the sensitization phase and the effector phase of the allergic response, respectively. In this study, we determined the role of the anaphylatoxins on the effector phase of asthma by pharmacological targeting of the anaphylatoxin receptors. C 3 aR and C 5 a receptor (C 5 aR) signaling was blocked using the nonpeptidic C 3 aR antagonist SB 290157 and the neutralizing C 5 aR mAb 20 / 70 in a murine model of Aspergillus fumigatus extract induced pulmonary allergy. Airway hyperresponsiveness was substantially improved after C 5 aR blockade but not after C 3 aR blockade. Airway inflammation was significantly reduced in mice treated with the C 3 aR antagonist or the anti-C 5 aR mAb, as demonstrated by reduced numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Of note, C 5 aR but not C 3 aR inhibition reduced lymphocyte numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Cytokine levels of IL- 5 and IL- 13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were not altered by C 3 aR or C 5 aR blockade. However, blockade of both anaphylatoxin receptors markedly reduced IL- 4 levels. These data suggest an important and exclusive role for C 5 aR signaling on the development of airway hyperresponsiveness during <b>pulmonary</b> <b>allergen</b> challenge, whereas both anaphylatoxins contribute to airway inflammation and IL- 4 production...|$|E
40|$|Allergic non-asthmatic (ANA) adults {{experience}} {{upper airway}} symptoms of allergic disease such as rhinorrhea, congestion and sneezing without symptoms of asthma. The {{aim of this}} study was to utilize PET-CT functional imaging to determine whether allergen challenge elicits a pulmonary response in ANA subjects or whether their allergic disease is truly isolated to the upper airways. In 6 ANA subjects, bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed at baseline and 24 h after instillation of an allergen and a diluent in separate lung lobes. After instillation (10 h), functional imaging was performed to quantify and compare regional perfusion, ventilation, fractional gas content (Fgas), and glucose uptake rate (Ki) between the baseline, diluent and allergen lobes. BAL cell counts were also compared. In ANA subjects, compared to the baseline and diluent lobes, perfusion and ventilation were significantly lower in the allergen lobe (median [inter-quartile range], baseline vs. diluent vs. allergen: Mean-normalized perfusion; 0. 87 [0. 85 - 0. 97] vs. 0. 90 [0. 86 - 0. 98] vs. 0. 59 [0. 55 - 0. 67]; p< 0. 05. Mean-normalized ventilation 0. 89 [0. 88 - 0. 98] vs. 0. 95 [0. 89 - 1. 02] vs. 0. 63 [0. 52 - 0. 67], p< 0. 05). In contrast, no significant differences were found in Fgas between baseline, diluent and allergen lobes or in Ki. Total cell counts, eosinophil and neutrophil cell counts (cells/ml BAL) were significantly greater in the allergen lobe compared to the baseline lobe (all P< 0. 05).

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is {{a widely}} used monomer of {{polycarbonate}} plastics and epoxide resin implicated in asthma pathogenesis when exposure occurs to the developing fetus. Widespread exposure to BPA is evident by detectable levels present in 93 % of the United States population. This project tested the hypothesis that exposure to environmentally relevant levels of BPA enhances pro-inflammatory mediator release from mast cells, a key cell type involved {{in the development of}} atopic asthma, and leads to worsened adulthood pulmonary inflammation after perinatal exposure in an allergen-induced rodent model of asthma. Pro-inflammatory mediator release was examined using bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) following in vitro or in vivo BPA exposure. Exposure to environmentally relevant levels of BPA (1 - 1000 nM) in vitro increased BMMC histamine (p< 0. 030) and cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) (p< 0. 029) release – a response that was not inhibited by estrogen receptor antagonism, but was inhibited by blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling (p< 0. 003) or by chelating extracellular calcium ions (p< 0. 037). Perinatal BPA exposure through maternal diet in mice with mixed C 57 BL/ 6 and C 3 H/HeJ backgrounds increased the release of CysLTs (p< 0. 036), TNF-a (p< 0. 019), prostaglandin D 2 (p= 0. 009), and IL- 13 (p= 0. 001) and decreased global DNA methylation. The influence of BPA exposure on pulmonary inflammation and allergic sensitivity was tested using an ovalbumin sensitization and airway challenge model in BALB/c mice exposed to BPA during in utero and early postnatal development through the maternal diet. At 12 -weeks-old, BPA-exposed offspring displayed increased sera anti-OVA IgE levels (p< 0. 038) and production of IL- 13 (p< 0. 028) and IFN-g (p< 0. 0001) from OVA-stimulated splenocytes, indicating enhanced <b>allergen</b> sensitization. However, <b>pulmonary</b> inflammation, as assessed by total and differential leukocyte counts, cytokines, and histopathological scoring, was either not different or reduced in mice exposed to BPA. In this work, exposure to environmentally relevant levels of BPA in vitro and in vivo resulted in upregulated release of pro-inflammatory mediators from mast cells and enhanced allergen sensitization. However, BPA exposure did not worsen <b>pulmonary</b> inflammation following <b>allergen</b> challenge. Based on these results, minimizing BPA exposures during the perinatal period may be an important means of reducing the risk of asthma and other allergic diseases later in life...|$|R
