5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} produce [...] "cycling dryers". These store a cold {{mass that}} cools {{the air when}} the compressor is OFF. When the refrigeration compressor runs, the large mass takes much longer to cool, so the compressor runs longer, and stays OFF longer. These units operate at lower dew points, typically in the 35-40 °F range. When selected with the optional [...] "cold coalescing filter", these units can deliver compressed air with lower dew points. Non-cycling dryers use a hot gas by <b>pass</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent the dryer from icing up.|$|R

40|$|The IBM System 4 Solar Energy System is {{described}} and evaluated. The system {{was designed to}} provide 35 percent of the space heating and 63 percent of the domestic hot water preheating for a single family residence located within the United States. The system consists of 259 square feet of flat plate air collectors, a rock thermal storage containing 5 1 / 2 ton of rock, heat exchangers, blowers, a 52 gallon preheat tank, controls, and associated plumbing. In general, {{the performance of the}} system did not meet design expectations, since the overall design solar fraction was 48 percent and the measured value was 32 percent. Although the measured space heating solar fraction at 32 percent did agree favorably with the design space heating solar fraction at 35 percent, the hot water measured solar fraction at 33 percent did not agree favorably with the design hot water solar fraction of 63 percent. In particular collector array air leakage, dust covered collectors, abnormal hot water demand, and the preheat tank by <b>pass</b> <b>valve</b> problem are main reasons for the lower performance...|$|R
50|$|Cone valves or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle {{is in line with}} the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A cone valve consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug cock. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot <b>pass.</b> <b>Valves</b> of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the {{upstream}} check <b>valve</b> <b>passing,</b> the differential pressure (higher supply pressure compared with the lower chamber pressure) causes any flow to occur only in one direction.

50|$|Internal {{factors to}} {{consider}} for subsea valves {{are related to}} the type of flow material (what <b>passes</b> through the <b>valve</b> apparatus). Typically in subsea environments, the flows will either be liquid or gas based but due to location of the operation, the flow can contain a significant amount of sand and debris. This can present internal structural challenges.|$|R
50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid to <b>pass</b> through the <b>valve.</b> Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control flow. Valves most commonly have 2 ports, but may {{have as many}} as 20. The valve is almost always connected at its ports to pipes or other components. Connection methods include threadings, compression fittings, glue, cement, flanges, or welding.|$|R
50|$|The press uses an {{external}} hydraulic pump {{to drive a}} piston within a larger cylinder that contains the liquid sample. The highly pressurized sample is then squeezed past a needle valve.

The major components of a French press are made of stainless steel to prevent sample contamination.|$|R
50|$|A rotary {{compression}} pump works in cycles. Over each cycle a volume is created {{in contact with}} the chamber where pressure is to be lowered. By random motion, molecules from the vacuum chamber pass into the volume created by the pump. This volume is then cut off from the chamber and compressed in contact with a one way valve. If the volume is compressed enough some of the molecules will <b>pass</b> through the <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{consequence}} of the spiral valve constricting the lumen of the ileum is that sharks cannot pass large hard objects (such as bones) through their lower intestine. Such objects rather remain in the stomach until sufficiently broken down for <b>passing</b> through the <b>valve</b> region, or are regurgitated. Consequently, shark stomachs often contain items of interest that enable one to determine what the animals feed on, as well as non-food items ingested during a feeding frenzy.|$|R
50|$|The gyros were {{connected}} to air valves on an associated supply line. This lowered or raised the pressure {{on one side of}} a servo piston, the other side being attached to the original supply without <b>passing</b> through the <b>valve.</b> Any precession of the gyros, due to movement of the aircraft, caused the pistons to move due to the differential pressure. This motion was smoothed by an oil-filled dashpot, one {{for each of the three}} servos.|$|R
50|$|Rubber boot-style gas-loaded {{relief valves}} operate by using {{nitrogen}} pressure loaded {{on the outside}} diameter of a rubber boot that is covering the flow path through the relief valve. As long as the process pressure is below the nitrogen pressure, the valve is closed. As soon as the process pressure raises above the nitrogen pressure, the product in the line forces the rubber boot away from the barrier and allows product to <b>pass</b> through the <b>valve.</b> When the process pressure decreases below the nitrogen pressure, the valve goes closed again.|$|R
40|$|Congress <b>passed</b> {{the safety}} <b>valve</b> to {{mitigate}} the disparate and often harsh sentences mandatory minimums impose on low-level drug defendants. But judicial interpretation continues to impose disparate sentences. In 2014, in United States v. Acevedo-Fitz, the Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its position in an ongoing circuit split regarding the safety valve. The safety valve requires defendants to meet five criteria, the fifth—sometimes called {{the heart of the}} safety valve—requires defendants provide complete truthful disclosure to prosecutors prior to sentencing. Judges interpret this requirement as imposing a burden on defendants to prove they met all five criteria without requiring the government to prove a defendant failed to provide complete truthful disclosure. The circuit split regards whether a defendant may lie before telling the truth and still qualify for the safety valve. The Seventh Circuit holds one lie precludes safety valve relief. It imposes an additional restriction, essentially adding a prerequisite that defendants substantially assist prosecutors. However, Congress <b>passed</b> the safety <b>valve</b> because the substantial assistance provision failed to assist low-level defendants, and the plain language of the safety valve imposes no requirements that the truthful disclosure assist the government. This reading frustrates Congressional intent, as many other circuits recognize. To comport with Congressional intent, the Seventh Circuit should utilize a plain-language reading of the statute, and not superimpose a substantial assistance prerequisite on the fifth element of the safety valve...|$|R
50|$|Each {{displacer}} unit {{contains a}} rubber spring, and damping {{is achieved by}} the displaced fluid <b>passing</b> through rubber <b>valves.</b> The displaced fluid passes to the displacer of the paired wheel, thus providing a dynamic interaction between front and rear wheels. When a front wheel encounters a bump fluid is transferred to the corresponding rear displacer then lowers the rear wheel, hence lifting the rear, minimising pitch associated with the bump. Naturally the reverse occurs when it is a rear wheel that encounters a bump. This effect is particularly good on small cars as their shorter wheelbases are more affected by pitching.|$|R

In this paper we propose to present the dependence between valve’s diameter and its type, patient’s homodynamic characteristics and its physical activity.

In contrast, when the plate has a negative voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are not attracted to it and no current flows through the tube (unlike the filament, the plate does not emit electrons).

30|$|According to the {{previous}} case reports [5, 6], one may consider that placement of a PAC may be difficult in patients with history of tricuspid ring annuloplasty.

Although we could encounter only four cases during the observation period, we could reconfirm that the placement was significantly difficult compared with the control. Finally, we could place the catheter under X-ray fluoroscopic photographing system. Since the tricuspid ring clearly appears in the X-ray system, it is a helpful maker to facilitate the catheter to <b>pass</b> the tricuspid <b>valve.</b> Thus, we guess that we should not hesitate to prepare the X-ray system in advance.

50|$|It is most {{commonly}} used to help remove air from a pneumothorax. The valve is usually designed as a rubber sleeve within a plastic case where the rubber sleeve is arranged so that when air <b>passes</b> through the <b>valve</b> one way the sleeve opens and lets the air through.

This construction enables it {{to act as a}} one-way valve allowing air (or fluid) to flow only one way along the drainage tube. The end of the drainage tube is placed inside the patient's chest cavity, within the air or fluid to be drained. The flutter valve is placed in the appropriate orientation (most packages are designed so the valve can only be connected in the appropriate orientation) and the pneumothorax is thus evacuated from the patient's chest.|$|R
