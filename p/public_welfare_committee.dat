5|$|At {{the end of}} 1968, Kennedy {{had joined}} the new Committee for National Health Insurance at the {{invitation}} of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther. In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee</b> and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance. Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Kennedy {{lost his}} {{position}} as Senate Majority Whip when he lost the support of several members and was defeated by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, 31–24. He would later tell Byrd that the defeat was a blessing, as it allowed him {{to focus more on}} issues and committee work, where his best strengths lay and where he could exert influence independently from the Democratic party apparatus, and began a decade as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee</b> rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E

25|$|With most Republicans lukewarm about Beeson {{and some}} {{actually}} thinking of abstaining or voting against him, Eisenhower began lobbying conservative Southern Democrats {{to support the}} nomination. On January 29, Senators H. Alexander Smith (chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare) and Barry Goldwater then publicly questioned the truthfulness of Beeson's January 20 response about the newspaper article. The newspaper, the San Jose Mercury, said it stood by its story. Beeson then made the surprising request on January 30 to speak again before the Senate Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee.</b> The request was granted. Democratic Senator James E. Murray said Beeson's integrity had been called into question, and all six Democrats on the Senate Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee</b> said that new revelations that Farmer and Beeson had a pre-existing relationship indicated Beeson would not be independent of Farmer's influence. But during a six-hour hearing on February 2, Beeson admitted that the newspaper article was correct. When directly {{asked if he had}} submitted a letter of resignation, he said he had not but had given an oral resignation. He then admitted that he had not stopped making contributions to his company's pension plan, and implied he was really on a leave of absence. He also reversed his January 22 testimony and said Farmer had not recommended him to Eisenhower at all. His revelations led to an adjournment so that Paul L. Davies, president of Food Machinery & Chemical Corporation, could be brought in to testify.|$|E
25|$|With {{his party}} in the majority, Hartley served as the {{chairman}} of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 80th United States Congress. Along with United States Senator Robert A. Taft who was Chairman of the Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee,</b> the next year he introduced legislation to curb what he felt were the worst of labor's excesses. The resultant Taft-Hartley Act was a major revision of the 1935 Wagner Act (officially known as the National Labor Relations Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by the post-war Congress. The act placed limits on labor tactics such as the secondary boycott, and gave each state the option to enact right-to-work laws if it so chose (24 states have done so). This provision, known as Section 14 (b), {{was one of the most}} controversial of the entire act.|$|E
500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means I may never be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency is not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee.</b> [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
50|$|Kligman {{became a}} target for {{investigation}} by the FDA in 1965 since his research program was so large: he was studying a high “number of investigational new drugs” and was contracted by 33 different companies. In July of 1966, the FDA banned Kligman from conducting drug testing at Holmesburg Prison, due to discrepancies in record keeping, and not following the conditions set out by the FDA for the testing of investigative drugs. However, Kligman’s ability to conduct experiments was reinstated {{less than a month}} after the initial ban. Experimentation at Holmesburg Prison was forcibly ended by the prison’s board of trustees after the Senate Labor and <b>Public</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Committee’s</b> health subcommittee hearing on human experimentation in 1974.|$|R

[...] When Republicans {{took control of the}} Senate in 1981, Laxalt became chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Regulatory Reform Subcommittee, and the Appropriations Committee's State, Justice and Commerce Subcommittee. In 1986, while serving on the Judiciary Committee, Laxalt played a key behind-the-scenes role in securing the committee's approval of President Reagan's nomination of William Rehnquist for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. [...] Negotiating principally with Senators Ted Kennedy and Joe Biden, Laxalt was able to strike a deal that allowed the committee to vote on the nomination. [...] Rehnquist was subsequently approved by the full Senate by an overwhelming margin.|$|E
