40|$|OBJECTIVES: Modular {{junctions}} are {{ubiquitous in}} contemporary hip arthroplasty. The head-trunnion junction is {{implicated in the}} failure of large diameter metal-on-metal (MoM) hips which are the currently the topic of one the largest legal actions {{in the history of}} orthopaedics (estimated costs are stated to exceed $ 4 billion). Several factors are known to influence the strength of these press-fit modular connections. However, the influence of different head sizes has not previously been investigated. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish whether the choice of head size influences the initial strength of the trunnion-head connection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ti- 6 Al- 4 V trunnions (n = 60) and two different sizes of cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) heads (28 mm and 36 mm; 30 of each size) were used in the study. Three different levels of assembly force were considered: 4 kN; 5 kN; and 6 kN (n = 10 each). The strength of the <b>press-fit</b> <b>connection</b> was subsequently evaluated by measuring the pull-off force required to break the connection. The statistical differences in pull-off force were examined using a Kruskal-Wallis test and two-sample Mann-Whitney U test. Finite element and analytical models were developed to understand the reasons for the experimentally observed differences. RESULTS: 36 mm diameter heads had significantly lower pull-off forces than 28 mm heads when impacted at 4 kN and 5 kN (p < 0. 001; p < 0. 001), but not at 6 kN (p = 0. 21). Mean pull-off forces at 4 kN and 5 kN impaction forces were approximately 20 % larger for 28 mm heads compared with 36 mm heads. Finite element and analytical models demonstrate that the differences in pull-off strength can be explained by differences in structural rigidity and the resulting interface pressures. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that 36 mm Co-Cr heads have up to 20 % lower pull-off connection strength compared with 28 mm heads for equivalent assembly forces. This effect is likely to play a role in the high failure rates of large diameter MoM hips...|$|E

40|$|For decades, tin-lead {{has been}} used as the primary surface finish for {{compliant}} pins and plated through holes (PTH) of printed circuit board (PCB) in <b>press-fit</b> <b>connections.</b> Therefore, most test results on press-fit performance are focused on the tin-lead finishes for the connections. Due to the discontinuation of the use of lead in electric and electronic components, the trend of using lead-free manufacturing for PCB’s and connectors is being vigorously pursued by the industry. The present study is intended to evaluate <b>press-fit</b> <b>connections</b> using various lead-free finishes on compliant pins and PTH’s and then compare to tin-lead finish. The lead-free finishes for the compliant pins are plated with matte and bright pure tin, and the lead-free finishes for the PTH’s are electroplated Au, OSP, and immersion tin, Au, and Ag finishes. In the design of experiments (DOE) of the current study, single pin tests were used to obtain the DOE outputs of insertion and retention forces for eye-of-the-needle (EON) compliant pins in PTH’s. For all three EON finishes (two pure tin and one tin-lead), the DOE results show that finished PTH size is the most important factor to determine the insertion force. The insertion force is a strong inverted linear function of finished PTH size (i. e., a larger force is required for a smaller finished PTH size). The impact from pin installation/repair cycle is the second factor behind the finished PTH size. The finishes of EON and PTH are only minor factors for the insertion force. In contrast to the insertion force, the retention force is rather flat regarding the finished PTH size. The DOE results also indicate the EON finish is ranked as the number one factor to affec...|$|R
50|$|Additional to the {{traditional}} screw contacts the electrical connection between the module {{and other parts of}} the power electronic system can also be achieved by pin contacts (soldered onto a PCB), press-fit contacts pressed into PCB vias, spring contacts that inherently press on contact areas of a PCB or by pure pressure contact where corrosion-proof surface areas are directly pressed together.Press-fit pins achieve a very high reliability and ease the mounting process without the need for soldering. Compared to <b>press-fit</b> <b>connections,</b> spring contacts have the benefit of allowing easy and non-destructive removal of the connection several times, as for inspection or replacement of an module, for instance. Both contact types have rather limited current-carrying capability due to their comparatively low cross-sectional area and small contact surface. Therefore, modules often contain multiple pins or springs for each of the electrical power connections.|$|R
40|$|The use of large-volume {{injections}} via a loop-type interface in GC-cryotrapping-FT-IR {{has been}} studied. n-Alkanes and {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) were used as test compounds. When using 100 -μl injections the analyte detectability was enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude compared with conventional split/splitless injections. For the alkanes, the absolute detection limits were nearly independent of the injected volume and the mode of injection. With the PAHs a water background (due to <b>press-fit</b> <b>connections</b> and six-port valves) somewhat disturbed the GC-FT-IR chromatograms and the spectra of the PAHs. This detracts from the system performance. Still, upon going from split/splitless injections to 100 - 200 μl injections, analyte detectability was increased {{by a factor of}} 30 - 500. The repeatability of the total 100 -μl GC-cryotrapping-FT-IR procedure was satisfactory. The potential of the set-up was demonstrated by determining PAHs in river water at the 0. 5 μg/l level by means of 'micro' liquid-liquid extraction and 100 -μl GC-cryotrapping-FT-IR. The FT-IR spectra obtained matched well with those of standard libraries...|$|R
