5000|$|From the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>task</b> {{scenarios}} envisaged, the EU Military Staff {{generated the}} [...] "Helsinki Headline Catalogue" [...] which specifies which capabilities are required {{in each of}} 144 capability areas. In November 2000, the European Union held a Capabilities Commitment Conference in Brussels, which elicited commitments for over 100,000 (existing) troops that were declared available for {{what became known as}} the Helsinki Force Catalogue. A year later, a Capabilities Improvement Conference was held during which further military forces and 5,000 police were added to the catalogue.|$|R

This provision constitutes the integration of a part of the “WEU acquis” into the framework of the European Union, even though there is no institutional integration between the two organizations or legal interweave between their constituents treaties. The decision-making mechanism for Petersberg operations must be considered in relation to the new CFSP set of acts and it involves considerable interplay between the European Council, the Council and the WEU Council of Ministers. Several problems might arise from the different voting systems of these institutions and a specific question is posed by the more restricted composition of the WEU with respect to the EU, namely the five EU member States which are not fully-fledged WEU members. The development of an EU crisis management capability could have several positive consequences, both on an inter-European level and externally...|$|R

5000|$|The European Union {{incorporated}} the same <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks</b> within its domain with the Amsterdam Treaty. The treaty signalled the progressive framing {{of a common}} security and defence policy based on the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks.</b> In 1998, traditional British reluctance to such a plan changed into endorsement after a bilateral declaration of French President Jacques Chirac and the British Prime Minister Tony Blair in St. Malo, where they stated that [...] "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises".|$|E
50|$|In June 1992, the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks</b> {{were set}} out, {{defining}} which potential missions {{that could be}} assumed by the Western European Union in the new post-Cold War situation. Consequently, the identification of forces needed to carry out such missions was required.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, the Western European Union {{adopted the}} <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks,</b> {{designed}} {{to cope with}} the possible destabilising of Eastern Europe.

5000|$|The <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks,</b> {{declared}} by the WEU in 1992, {{were incorporated}} in 1997 into the Treaty of Amsterdam of the EU, forming {{the basis of}} the Common Security and Defence Policy which frames a common policy to deal with humanitarian and rescue, peacekeeping and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks,</b> which {{outline the}} duties of the ERRF, have been {{expanded}} from humanitarian, rescue, and peacekeeping and peacemaking to include 'joint disarmament operation', 'military advice and assistance tasks' and 'post-conflict stabilisation'.

50|$|In 1997, {{during the}} European summit in Amsterdam, the tasks were {{incorporated}} in the Treaty on European Union. Both the WEU and the EU are empowered to enforce the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks,</b> but with {{the transfer of the}} most important WEU assets to the EU in 1999, this distinction is mostly artificial. The 2004 creation of the European Defence Agency made the WEU obsolete, and the WEU was abolished in 2011.|$|E
50|$|Under this plan, the European Union pledged itself {{during the}} Helsinki summit {{to be able}} to deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks</b> (as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty), {{including}} the most demanding, in operations up to corps level (up to 15 brigades or 50,000-60,000 persons) to be capable of intervening in any crisis that could occur in an area where European interests are affected. The aim was to make those forces self-reliant, deployable within 60 days and over 4,000 km, and sustainable in the field for a year. This means the force would actually have to number around 180,000 troops so as to provide rotating replacements for the initial forces. The <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks</b> include humanitarian and rescue tasks; peacekeeping tasks; and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. EU-led forces assembled in response to a crisis would last only {{for the duration of the}} crisis and it would be up to the member states themselves to decide whether, when and how to contribute troops.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 France and Germany {{started a}} politico-military {{initiative}} to “prepare {{the establishment of}} a European Air Transport Command”. The conclusions from the meeting of the European Council in Helsinki the same year, mentions the expressed will of the Union's member states to develop collective goals for rapid capability, including in the area of strategic transport. This was to be achieved voluntarily, to better co-ordinate national and international efforts for the carrying-out of the full range of so-called <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|E
50|$|European Rapid Operational Force (Eurofor) was a {{multinational}} rapid reaction force composed of forces from four {{states of the}} European Union: Italy, France, Portugal and Spain. It had a permanent staff capable of commanding operations, involving commitments of up to a Light Division in size. Eurofor was formed in May 1995 in Lisbon, and was answerable to the Western European Union (WEU) directly. It was tasked with performing <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks,</b> including humanitarian, peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions. With the merger of several WEU elements into the European Union, Eurofor had by and large {{become part of the}} Common Security and Defence Policy. It was eventually transformed into an EU Battlegroup and on standby from 1 July until 31 December 2011. On 2 July 2012, Eurofor was dissolved.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks</b> are the {{military}} tasks of a humanitarian, disarming, peacekeeping and peacemaking nature that the European Union (EU) {{is and the}} Western European Union (WEU) was empowered to do. They were defined in the Petersberg Declaration during a ministerial summit of the Council of the WEU on 19 June 1992 at Hotel Petersberg, near Bonn in Germany. There, the member states agreed to deploy their troops and resources from across the whole spectrum of {{the military}} {{under the authority of}} the WEU. As a part of the partial merger of the WEU with the European Union, these tasks became part of the European Security and Defence Policy, and were central to strengthening the European Union's second pillar, the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E

In December 1998, French and British leaders {{declared that the}} European Union (EU) must develop the capacity for autonomous military action to respond to international crises. In December 1999, EU leaders meeting in Helsinki established the Headline Goal-defined as the autonomous ability to deploy 60, 000 troops in 60 days for an operation lasting {{as long as one}} year to conduct the "Petersberg Tasks" of humanitarian intervention, peacekeeping, and peacemaking. The deadline for the operational capability of the Headline Goal is December 2003. Although in December 2001 the EU declared that it had "some" operational capability, it remains unable to conduct certain <b>Petersberg</b> <b>Tasks,</b> especially "upper" level missions such as peacemaking on the model of NATO's Kosovo intervention. Despite the current military force structures of EU member states, significant capability shortfalls, and stagnant or declining defense budgets in most EU countries, it appears that the EU will be able to conduct lower-level <b>Petersberg</b> <b>Tasks</b> in permissive environments by December 2003. However, capabilities needed for upper level tasks, such as strategic airlift, will take several years to develop and acquire-far beyond the deadline of December 2003.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes the "updated Petersberg tasks" {{included in the}} draft treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union. The original <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks</b> called for forces capable of humanitarian and rescue missions, peacekeeping operations and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. The updated tasks add conflict prevention, joint disarmament, military advice and assistance, post-conflict stabilization, and support to third countries in combating terrorism. The thesis focuses on the requirements of these tasks and {{the capabilities of the}} European Union's civilian agencies and military forces to execute them. It explores the meaning of the new missions, their specific capability requirements, and the prospects for the European Union to meet these requirements. It concludes that the European Union is currently capable of undertaking the missions that require mostly civilian tools or medium-level military forces for their conduct. The European Union does not at present have the relevant capabilities for the missions that demand more advanced military forces. Major, Hellenic Arm...|$|E
40|$|This article {{identifies}} previously ignored {{determinants of}} {{public support for the}} European Union's security and defence ambitions. In contrast to public opinion vis-à-vis the EU in general, the literature on attitudes towards a putative European army or the existing Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) suggests that the explanatory power of sociodemographic and economic variables is weak, and focuses instead on national identity as the main determinant of one's support. This article explores the possible impact of strategic culture, and argues that preferences vis-à-vis the EU's security and defence ambitions are formed in part through pre-existing social representations of security. To test this proposition, ‘national’ strategic cultures are disaggregated and a typology is produced that contains four strategic postures: pacifism, traditionalism, humanitarianism and globalism. Applying regression analysis on individual-level Eurobarometer survey data, it is found that strategic postures help explain both the general level of support for CSDP and support for specific <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{project has}} {{examined}} the question of; “how has the Lisbon Treaty changed the way the EU is able to apply force” through a breaking down of key concepts and categories inspecting EU’s role in or use of power, peacekeeping and global actorness in relation to how the Lisbon Treaty has changed the EU’s relation to these. The project has utilized leading authors {{on the field of}} EU studies to as a theoretical framework grounding the analysis in the conceptions of these authors. The project concludes that the innovations of the Lisbon Treaty has empowered a militarisation of the EU in its peacekeeping effort, but has not changed the Headline Goals of the EU foreign policy as reflected in the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>Tasks.</b> This implies that the Lisbon Treaty might not have changed the EU’s normative power, and further fuels the debate of whether the EU is or still is not a global actor...|$|E
40|$|How can {{we explain}} that small states {{are able to}} {{influence}} decisions over the EU's external policy? The aim {{of this article is}} to explain why small states are able to influence decisions in the EU's foreign and security policy with a detailed analysis of the Swedish-Finnish initiative on including crisis management in the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997. The article investigates the explanatory power of two hypotheses derived respectively from the assumptions of an intergovernmentalist and a deliberative approach. The empirical material shows that inclusion of the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks</b> can neither be assessed by exclusive reference to the cost - benefit calculation of the fixed interests to France, Germany and the UK, nor with reference to intense preferences for Sweden and Finland or possible threats of veto. There is a better fit between the empirical data and the expectations derived from the deliberative perspective. In cases of small state influence in the EU's external policy, we therefore need to test the possibility of arguing as a mode of interaction. intergovernmentalism; CFSP/ESDP; Amsterdam Treaty; intergovernmental conferences; Sweden; Finland...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedA changed security environment {{after the end}} of the Cold War forced Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden to reassess their security policy. New threats and challenges such as international terrorism, WMD, organized crime, the greater disparity of wealth and increased migration have replaced traditional military threats. Larger non-military concerns like peacekeeping operations, hu-manitarian support, and support to civil authorities have replaced territorial defense. All of which require international cooperation. Following a comprehensive security strategy, Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden aim to defend their territory, protect their population, and fostering international peace and security. Austria and Sweden focus on the integration and solidarity with the Euro-pean Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Switzerland retains its perpetual neutrality, but has shown increased international cooperation. Austria and Sweden model their Armed Forces after the EU <b>Petersberg</b> <b>Tasks</b> and have small peacetime organizations with a professional cadre and annual conscripts. The Swiss Armed Forces XXI focus on territorial defense and are organized in accordance with universal conscription and wartime organization policies. Traditional political, social, and economic aspects hinder Switzerland from following a straightforward strategy toward solidarity and fundamental change in its Armed Forces. Switzerland's new security policy and its Armed Forces XXI do not fully meet the requirements to fight new threats and challenges together with the international community.

40|$|The European Security and Defence Policy or ESDP is {{considered}} a major element of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, {{the second of the}} three so-called ?pillars? of the European Union (EU). The ESDP was initiated by provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty (1997) which stipulated the progressive framing of a common security and defense policy that could deal with humanitarian and rescue, peacekeeping, peacemaking and combat forces crisis management tasks, called the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks.</b> When the Cologne European Council in June 1999 appointed Javier Solana as the High representative of the CFSP they also declared that ?the EU must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO?. The total spent by the 25 EU nations on defense is approximately ? 160 billion. On July 12, 2004 details of an EU defense agency were finalized. The 80 person agency will be headed by Javier Solana. It will provide political guidance to ensure greater efficiency in EU members? military spending, liasing closely with NATO in the process. This project will focus primarily upon the actual military capabilities of EU member states, and whether or not their contributions will be able to meet the goals embodied in Headline Goal 2010, and, if not, whether this will be a serious or a minor state of affairs to the ESDP and the EU as a whole...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are {{two major}} players in post-Cold War crisis management. With {{dissimilar}} strengths and weaknesses and a somewhat different focus, the two organizations tackle conflicts and crises around the world. Based on insights from expert interviews with EU and NATO officials, the following questions are addressed: How effective has EU-NATO cooperation in crisis management been so far, and how will or should EU-NATO relations develop in the future? In recent years, the cooperation between these two largely overlapping institutions has become difficult and was at times blocked. I argue that effective EU-NATO cooperation is obstructed by differences at the very top. Quarrels between NATO member Turkey and EU member Cyprus limit the scope of political dialogue. The resulting lack of consultation and coordination impedes cooperation at the military-strategic and operational levels and entails the risk of unnecessary duplication in capability development. The presentation and analysis of five future scenarios for EU-NATO cooperation leads {{to the conclusion that}} the EU should develop an independent Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), capable of providing security and stability in the region and of performing the whole spectrum of the <b>Petersberg</b> <b>tasks,</b> including high-intensity conflicts. A strengthened CSDP would benefit NATO in terms of additional European capabilities and the US with regard to increased burden sharing. However, it certainly will take some time until this vision materializes. Meanwhile, the EU and NATO should gradually increase the efficiency of what resembles an ad hoc division of labor in crisis management...|$|E
