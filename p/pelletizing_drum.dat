40|$|Fly ash is {{produced}} by all coal-fired utilities, {{and it must be}} removed from the plant exhaust gases, collected, and disposed of. While much work has been done in the past to utilize fly ash rather than disposing of it, we nevertheless do not find widespread examples of successful industrial utilization. This is because past work has tended to find uses only for high-quality, easily-utilized fly ashes, which account for less than 25 % of the fly ash that {{is produced}}. The main factor which makes fly ashes unusable is a high unburned carbon content. In this project, physical separation technologies are being used to remove this carbon, and to convert these unusable fly ashes into usable products. The main application being studied for the processed fly ash is as a binder for inorganic materials, such as iron-ore pellets. The project began in the current quarter. Work has concentrated on obtaining samples of all of the materials to be used (fly ash, and magnetite ore). Also, several batches of magnetite pellets were made in the research laboratories of a commercial producer of iron-ore pellets, using conventional binders. These pellets were then tested to provide a baseline for comparison with the future work to be done with fly-ash as a binder. A laboratory-scale <b>pelletizing</b> <b>drum</b> was also provided by the iron ore pellet producer, which was transported to the MTU research labs so that test pellets could be made on-site...|$|E
40|$|TiZir Titanium & Iron {{produces}} high titania slag {{and high}} purity pig iron from ilmenite in Tyssedal. The ilmenite is pelletized before smelting. Bentonite {{is added to}} the ilmenite concentrate as a binder to give the pellets strength and durability. Bentonite consists mainly of silica and alumina, which are considered as impurities in the high titania slag production. The use of organic binder has therefore been suggested as a substitute for bentonite. This work has focused on developing knowledge on the pelletization process and investigating various organic binders. Two methods of agglomeration, pelletization and briquetting, have been used in this work. Three batches of pellets have been made using a laboratory scale <b>pelletizing</b> <b>drum.</b> Two organic binders, Peridur 300 and Peridur 330, have been tested and compared to pellets made with bentonite and without binder. Seven batches of briquettes have been made using a cylindrical mold and a piston. Three organic binders, Peridur 300, calcium lignosulfonate and a nano cellulose fibre have been tested and compared to briquettes made with bentonite and without binder. The characterization included drop number test (pellets only), compression strength and thermal treatment. Briquettes were employed because using pellets yielded large deviations in the results. These deviations were believed to stem from the varying geometry of the pellets and were substantially mitigated by the use of cylindrical briquettes. It was found that Peridur 300 is a potential alternative to bentonite. The findings from thermal treatment suggest that above 500 degrees celcius sintering takes over as the dominating binding mechanism. For green strength, increasing binder viscosity has a positive effect...|$|E
40|$|Testing was {{performed}} to determine actual damage to drums when dropped from higher than currently stacked elevations. The drum configurations {{were the same as}} they are placed in storage; single drums and four drums banded to a pallet. Maximum drop weights were selected based on successful preliminary tests. Material was lost from each of the single drum tests while only a small amount of material was lost from one of the <b>pelletized</b> <b>drums.</b> The test results are presented in this report. This report also provides recommendations for further testing to determine the appropriate drum weight which can be stored on a fourth tier...|$|R
