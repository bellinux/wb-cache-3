5000|$|Yitzhak Rabin said in {{a speech}} to the Knesset on 5 October 1995, at the time of the {{ratification}} of the Oslo II Interim Agreement: [...] "The Palestinian Authority has not up until now honoured its commitment to change the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Covenant</b> ... I view these changes as a supreme test of the Palestinian Authority's willingness and ability, and the changes required will be an important and serious touchstone vis-à-vis the continued implementation of the agreement as a whole".|$|E

50|$|The <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> or <b>Palestinian</b> National Charter (الميثاق الوطني الفلسطيني; transliterated: al-Mithaq al-Watani al-Filastini) is the {{covenant}} or charter of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

5000|$|As {{reported}} by The New York Times, in 1988 Yasser Arafat {{declared that the}} Palestinians accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which would guarantee [...] "the right to exist in peace and security for all". In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that [...] "the PLO affirms that those articles of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Covenant</b> which deny Israel's right to exist, and {{the provisions of the}} Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin {{insisted on}} {{changes to the}} Charter {{as part of the}} Oslo Accords.

The decision was adopted by a vote of: 504 in favor, 54 against, and 14 abstentions. The official English translation used by Israel, the PLO and the United States reads: ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{reported}} by the Financial Times, in 1988 Yasser Arafat declared that the Palestinians had accepted Israel's right to exist. In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that [...] "the PLO affirms that those articles of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Covenant</b> which deny Israel's right to exist, and {{the provisions of the}} Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid." [...] In 2009 Prime Minister Ehud Olmert demanded the Palestinian Authority's acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, which the Palestinian Authority rejected. The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalising the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, with a penalty of up to a year in prison.|$|E
50|$|Before the Six-Day War, the {{movement}} for an independent Palestine received a boost in 1964 when the Palestine Liberation Organization was established. Its goal, {{as stated in the}} <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> was to create a Palestinian state in the whole British Mandate, a statement which nullified Israel's right to exist.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ideology}} of the PLO was formulated in the founding year 1964 in the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant.</b> The document is a combative anti-Zionist statement dedicated to the [...] "restoration of the Palestinian homeland". It has no reference to religion. In 1968, the Charter {{was replaced by a}} comprehensively revised version.|$|R
5000|$|A secular Arab state (as {{described}} in the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> before the cancellation of the relevant clauses in 1998). Accordingly, only those [...] "Jews who had normally resided in Palestine {{until the beginning of}} the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians", which excludes at least 90% of the Jewish population of Israel.|$|R
40|$|Leviticus 26 {{consists}} of parenetic revelation given at Sinai {{on the threshold}} of Israel’s wilderness wanderings. The pericope’s relevance is best understood {{in the light of the}} apparent tension that the promulgation of the Mosaic Covenant had created with the Abrahamic Covenant. After three disturbing apostasies at Sinai, Leviticus 26 explains the relationship between the two covenants and reemphasizes the exclusive lordship of Yahweh. Although Leviticus 26 antedates Paul’s teaching in Galatians 3 : 17 by fifteen centuries, the same truth is proclaimed: “the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise. ” 1 The respective emphases of both covenants were advanced by the blessings and curses of Leviticus 26. While the blessings were relevant to the Abrahamic Covenant’s promises regarding land and blessing, the cursings represented a five-stage process of Mosaic Covenant vengeance. 2 The purpose of the cursings was to produce confession of guilt, humility, and restitution — elements that may be seen as anticipating either the Deuteronomic (or <b>Palestinian)</b> <b>Covenant</b> or the New Covenant. 3 Restitution involved th...|$|E
5000|$|Formally, the {{resolution}} {{adopted by the}} council consisted of two simple clauses. The first declared that the council [...] "decides to amend the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> by canceling clauses which contradict the letters exchanged between the P.L.O. and the Israeli Government." [...] The second ordered a new charter to be drafted within six months.|$|R
5000|$|Article 24 of the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> of 1964, which {{established}} the Palestine Liberation Organization, stated: [...] "This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip {{or in the}} Himmah Area" [...] (i.e. {{the areas of the}} former Mandate Palestine controlled by Jordan, Egypt and Syria, respectively).|$|R
500|$|The {{region of}} Palestine is the eponym for the Palestinian {{people and the}} culture of Palestine, both of which are defined as {{relating}} to the whole historical region, usually defined as the localities within the border of Mandatory Palestine. The 1968 <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> described Palestine as the [...] "homeland of the Arab Palestinian people", with [...] "the boundaries it had during the British Mandate".|$|R
5000|$|The first PNC, {{composed}} of 422 representatives, met in Jerusalem in May 1964 and adopted the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> (also called <b>Palestinian</b> National Charter). It also established the PLO {{as the political}} expression of the Palestinian people and elected Ahmad Al-Shuqeiry as the first chairman of the PLO Executive Committee. At the conference were representatives from Palestinian communities in Jordan, West Bank, the Gaza strip, Syria, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Egypt, Qatar, Libya, and Algeria.|$|R
50|$|Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat {{signed the}} Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 28 September 1995, in Washington. The {{agreement}} allowed the PLO leadership {{to relocate to}} the occupied territories and granted autonomy to the Palestinians with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians promised to abstain from use of terror and changed the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant,</b> which had called for the expulsion of all Jews who migrated after 1917 {{and the elimination of}} Israel.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the signing}} of the Oslo Accords, the PNC met in Gaza in April 1996 and voted 504 to 54 to void parts of the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> that denied Israel's right to exist, but the charter itself has not been {{formally}} changed or re-drafted. One of its most prominent members, the Palestinian-American scholar and activist Edward Said, left the PNC because he believed that the Oslo Accords sold short the right of Palestinian refugees {{to return to their homes}} in pre-1967 Israel and would not lead to a lasting peace.|$|R
25|$|Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat {{signed the}} Israeli–Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 28 September 1995 in Washington. The {{agreement}} was witnessed by President Bill Clinton {{on behalf of}} the United States and by Russia, Egypt, Norway and the European Union, and incorporates and supersedes the previous agreements, marking the conclusion of the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy to the Palestinians with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians promised to abstain from use of terror and changed the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant,</b> which had called for the expulsion of all Jews who migrated after 1917 and the elimination of Israel.|$|R
5000|$|Reportedly, an {{internal}} PLO document from the Research and Thought Department of Fatah stated that changing the Covenant {{would have been}} [...] "suicide for the PLO" [...] and continued: The text of the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> remains as it was and no changes whatsoever were made to it. This has caused it to be frozen, not annulled. The drafting of the new National Covenant will {{take into account the}} extent of Israeli fulfillment of its previous and coming obligations... evil and corrupt acts are expected from the Israeli side... The fact that the PNC did not hold a special session to make changes and amendments in the text of the National Covenant at this stage... was done to defend the new Covenant from being influenced by the current Israeli dictatorship.|$|R
5000|$|Today, some Palestinians {{think that}} an {{equitable}} arrangement for all involved parties requires dialogue with Israelis {{and the international}} community. The PLO has officially accepted the right of Israel to exist within the pre-1967 armistice lines. However, some PLO representatives, including Yasser Arafat, have also declared at times that they saw these statements as politically necessary steps. Some observers interpret this to mean that they view the two-state solution as a stepping stone to a more integrated long-term solution. Others, particularly some Israelis, claim that these statements betray a hidden agenda and worldview where the peace process with Israel is only a temporary measure {{in support of the}} ultimate Palestinian goal, which is the destruction of the state of Israel, and presumably the eviction of its Jewish citizens. They point {{to the fact that the}} PLO never updated its formal statement of policy, the <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Covenant</b> to reflect their recognition of the State of Israel and that it still calls for the destruction of Israel; however the U.S. Embassy in Israel is on record confirming that [...] "On April 24, 1996, the Palestinian National Council (PNC) amended the charter by canceling the articles inconsistent with its commitments to Israel". Still, belief in an existential threat from the PLO causes alarm among much of the Israeli public.|$|R
