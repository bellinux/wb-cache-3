5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, <b>plausibility,</b> morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all fragments of an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its <b>plausibility</b> was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E

30|$|The {{marginalization}} of {{the right-hand side}} of this relation is the model evidence, which serves as a likelihood function for a higher level of Bayes’s rule. The corresponding posteriors are the model <b>plausibilities</b> of (72). We remark that the notion of model <b>plausibilities</b> is an extension of the idea of Bayes factors prevalent in statistic literature (see e.g. [12] for discussion of the ideas) and was introduced {{to the best of our}} knowledge in [18]. The development of algorithms involving Bayesian <b>plausibilities</b> to study model selection in CG models of complex atomic system is discussed in [3, 20].|$|R

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} <b>plausibility,</b> the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah is a {{carnivorous}} plant of the pitfall trap variety. It {{is famous for}} occasionally trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of drowned rats found in N. rajah pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the <b>plausibility</b> of this record when they managed to observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah. In 2011, {{the discovery of a}} drowned mountain treeshrew (Tupaia montana) in a N.rajah pitcher was reported.|$|E
5|$|One {{point of}} {{criticism}} {{is that the}} film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself {{was believed to be}} in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video. This problem raised questions about the <b>plausibility</b> of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We propose axiomatizing some {{stochastic}} games, in {{a continuous}} state space setting, using continuous belief functions, resp. <b>plausibilities,</b> instead of measures. Then, stochastic games are just variations on continuous Markov chains. We argue that drawing at random along a belief function {{is the same as}} letting the probabilistic player P play first, then letting the non-deterministic player C play demonically. The same holds for an angelic C, using <b>plausibilities</b> instead. We then define a simple modal logic, and characterize simulation in terms of formulae of this logic. Finally, we show that (discounted) payoffs are defined and unique, where in the demonic case, P maximizes payoff, while C minimizes it. ...|$|R

5|$|The American defence {{researcher}} Charles Smith identified different {{dimensions of}} Russian military deception. He divided it into multiple types – optical, thermal, radar, radio, sound/silence; multiple environments – aquatic, space, atmosphere – each involving active or passive measures; and organizational aspects – mobility, level, and organization. The levels are the conventional military ones, strategic, operational, and tactical, while organization {{refers to the}} military branch concerned. Finally, Smith identified principles – <b>plausibility,</b> continuity through peace and war, variety, and persistent aggressive activity; and contributing factors, namely technological capability and political strategy.|$|E
5|$|The Girl Reporter is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows two sweethearts, May and Will, who are reporters for the Daily Wave newspaper. Will leaves the newspaper {{to work as a}} secretary to Blake, the commissioner of public works. Blake takes a bribe and blames Will and fires him. May sets out to clear his name and becomes Blake's new secretary. May investigates and clears Will's name while proving Blake's corruption. The film was released on August 16, 1910 and saw a wide national release. The film received mixed responses from critics who liked the acting, but found issues with the staging and the <b>plausibility</b> of the plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|A Dainty Politician is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on corruption political activity during a political convention in which a corrupt politician is running for re-election to the United States Congress. The votes are tallied and the challenger ties with the corrupt Congressman Casey, but a third candidate holds the balance of power. Casey bribes the third candidate to retire in his favor, but the plot is uncovered and the two are ejected from the convention by a reporter {{who falls in love}} with challenger's daughter. The film was released on August 23, 1910, and saw a wide national release. Little is known of the actual production, but it received mixed reaction for the <b>plausibility</b> of its plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

30|$|A general {{framework}} for deriving a posteriori estimates of modeling error in coarse–grained models of key observables in atomistic systems is presented. Such estimates provide a new tool for model validation analysis. The connection of error estimates with relative information entropy of observables and model predictions is explained for so-called misspecified models.

50|$|Dempster-Shafer {{theory is}} a {{generalization}} of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability.
