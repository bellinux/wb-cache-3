40|$|Play is an {{important}} part of early learning and development. It is central in the Early Years Foundation Stage, with exploration and imagination included as specific learning goals (Department for Education, 2014). Humour and <b>pretending</b> are two forms of play which have the potential to encourage exploration and imagination. Humour, at its most basic, involves enjoying something done wrong, e. g., putting a sock on one’s hand (Hoicka & Gattis, 2008; Hoicka, Jutsum, & Gattis, 2008). In contrast, <b>pretending</b> involves something technically wrong, but right in one’s imagination (Nichols & Stich, 2003). For instance, one could imagine the sock is a mitten.
