Materials and Methods: A total of 800 one-day-old male Arbor Acres Plus broiler chickens were randomly allocated into four groups for 5 weeks. Na-butyrate was supplemented at dosages of 1 kg/ton for starter diet, 0. 5 kg/ton for grower diet, and 0. 25 kg/ton for finisher diet (presence or absence). Birds of groups 1 and 2 were inoculated by crop gavages with 4 × 108 CFU/ml/bird of Clostridium perfringens in phosphate buffered saline for 4 successive days, from 14 to 17 days of age to produce NE. Results: Addition of Na-butyrate, encapsulated in <b>palm</b> <b>fat,</b> to ration of experimentally infected broilers with NE resulted in increased final body weight, at 35 days of age, reduced total feed consumption, improved feed conversion ratio, reduced cumulative mortality, and increased production number. There were increased intestinal diameter, intestinal length, and significantly increased the weight of bursa of Fabricius(BF) with higher hemagglutination inhibition titers against Newcastle disease (ND) vaccination versus untreated infected and untreated negative control birds. The results showed increased expression levels of alpha-toxin and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase in the bursa tissues of broilers infected with C. perfringens. However, the expression levels of these genes in broilers treated with Na-butyrate were similar to the non-infected control group. Supplementation of broilers with Na-butyrate increased the expression level of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and decreased the DNA fragmentation induced by C. perfringens. Conclusion: Na-butyrate significantly improved chicken broiler body weights, increased relative weights of BF, increased antibody titers against ND vaccination, numerically lowered mortality due to C. perfringens infection, increased the expression level of IGF- 1, and decreased the DNA fragmentation induced by C. perfringens.

40|$|<b>Palm</b> <b>fat</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fats in food industry. The main role of <b>palm</b> <b>fat</b> is to develop the desired texture of food products. Fat blends were developed to find the most appropriate mixture fitting the technological needs. In our work palm mid fraction (PMF) was mixed with anhydrous milk fat (AMF), goose fat (G), and lard (L) in a 1 : 1 ratio. Anhydrous milk fat represents fat consisting of a wide range of fatty acids. Goose fat is a soft, easily melting fat, and lard is characterized as animal fat with wide melting temperature interval. The measurements aimed to establish the miscibility of the fats and the effect of animal fats on the melting-solidification profile of palm mid fraction. SFC vs temperature curves, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) melting thermograms describe the melting profile of the samples. Isotherm crystallization by SFC vs time curves and DSC cooling thermograms were measured to characterize the solidification of pure fats and the blends. Since the SFC curves did not show crosspoints we concluded that fats blended in a 1 : 1 ratio were miscible. Anhydrous milk fat strongly modified the properties of palm mid fraction, the blend became similar to anhydrous milk fat. Goose fat had no strong modification effect on palm mid fraction and could be considered as a softening agent. The effect of lard was complex: melting and solidification behaviour of the blend differed from the characteristics of both parent fats...|$|E

The results of the present studies show that up to 45 % FFA in a crude palm oil - palm destilled fatty acids blend are permisable without detrimental effect on broiler performance when that blend was included at a 6 % rate in starler diets. Besides, better results are obtained when a fat of high FFA content and /or low IJFA: SFA is fed after the first week of age and not in day-old broilers. The use of fats of high FFA content is feasible but a previous determination of its ME content is necessary before formulation of the feed. Due to the difficulties involved in the determination of ME by conventional methods, an alternative procedure is to calculate such values through the use of prediction equations.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work was to {{manufacture}} water-filled microcomposites using a high pressure encapsulation process, PGSS (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions), and to characterize the products by different analytical methods. A special interest was laid {{on the distribution of}} water (core material) within the composites. The utilised shell materials are <b>Palm</b> <b>fat</b> and hydrogenated Castor oil. Before the PGSS encapsulation, the phase behaviour and fluid dynamic properties of the fats in presence of supercritical carbon dioxide were investigated (melting behaviour, solubility, viscosity and density). The obtained composites have tailor made properties like bulk density, particle size, morphology and water content. Another important property is the water distribution inside the pulverous composite and it was studied using two different methods: TD-NMR and DSC. The composites exhibit three types of water: water between the particles, entrapped or bound water...|$|E

A row of cylindrical columns supports an overhang {{over the}} front porch at center. Several tall brick chimneys can be seen sticking out of the terracotta tile roof. The front lawn of he school is neatly trimmed. Several tall trees, including two <b>fat</b> <b>palm</b> trees, can be seen at right, while high bushes are visible at left.

40|$|The {{influence}} of oil-soluble surface-active components on {{the interactions between}} fine sugar particles dispersed in different triglyceride oils has been investigated at a range of volume fractions. Four techniques were applied: rheology. sedimentation, light microscopy and adsorption. Eight different types of food oil were used: sunflower oil, soybean oil, milk <b>fat,</b> lauric <b>fat</b> (<b>palm</b> kernel oil), cocoa butter, pure stearin, pure olein, and a combined fats mixture. Low concentration additions of the emulsifiers, soya lecithin (phosphatidylcholine), polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) or monoolein, were used to alter the interactions between the hydrophilic sugar particles. In a dispersion of 70 wt...|$|R
40|$|The Foundation {{recommends}} {{guidelines that}} encourage the inclusion {{the following four}} food groups in the daily diet: • Animal foods: meat, poultry, fish, eggs and whole milk products • Grains and legumes: whole grain baked goods and breakfast porridges, beans • Fruits and Vegetables: preferably fresh or frozen • Beneficial Fats and Oils: unrefined saturated and monounsaturated fats including butter and other animal <b>fats,</b> <b>palm</b> oil and coconut oil, olive oil and peanut oil The emphasis of the guidelines should be on food quality, not on contrived macronutrient ratios. The guidelines should include warnings to avoid refined foods such as sugar, high fructose corn syrup, white flour, industrially processed vegetable oils, trans fats and artificial flavorings. The Food Pyramid concept should be scraped...|$|R
