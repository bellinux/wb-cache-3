5|$|The {{new point}} {{system for the}} general {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E

The government therefore continued to intervene heavily in foreign-exchange marketing (buying or selling dollars), even after the 1973 decision, to allow the yen to float.|$|E

25|$|Larsen {{mentions}} {{ways that}} a business could change its operations {{in order to}} fight {{the negative effects of}} social loafing. For one, research has shown that if each employee has their performance individually measured, they will put in more effort than if it was not measured. Another person interested in the idea of social loafing is Kenneth Price, from The University of Texas. Price conducted a social loafing experiment in order to examine whether two key factors that he suspected {{played a role in the}} way social loafing arose in work groups. These two factors were dispensability and fairness. The experiment that he conducted involved 514 people that were divided into 144 teams that were set to meet for fourteen weeks. The projects assigned to these <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> complex and called for diverse skills from many different individuals in order to be fully completed. The experiments findings did in fact corroborate Price's suspicions in the two factors of dispensability and fairness.|$|E
25|$|Lu Kang {{was already}} {{known for being}} virtuous and diligent at a young age. He was {{nominated}} by Wu Commandery's Administrator, Li Su (李肅), as a xiaolian (civil service candidate), and was appointed as a minor officer in Wu Commandery. After Li Su was executed for committing some offence(s), Lu Kang collected Li's body, brought back to Li's home in Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡) for burial, and mourned Li's death. Zang Min (臧旻), the Inspector of Yang Province, nominated him as a maocai (茂才), so Lu Kang was appointed as the Prefect (令) of Gaocheng County (高成縣; around present-day Yanshan County, Hebei). Gaocheng County was very remote and its security was poor. Every household in the county was armed with bows and arrows. When the previous Prefects entered office, they made the locals build and repair the city walls. After arriving in Gaocheng County, Lu Kang freed the labourers and governed the county so well that the <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> pleased with him and even criminal activity ceased in the county. The commandery office reported Lu Kang's achievements to the Han imperial court. In 178, {{during the reign of}} Emperor Ling, Lu Kang was promoted to serve as the Administrator (太守) of Wuling Commandery (武陵郡; around present-day Changde, Hunan). Later, he was reassigned to be the Administrator of Guiyang (桂陽; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) and Le'an (樂安; around present-day Zibo, Shandong) commanderies. He governed his jurisdictions well.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, {{emerged in}} part as a {{reaction}} against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition". The leading Britpop bands, [...] "Blur and Oasis exist as reactionary forces to [...] eternal downcast glare." [...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} former {{poet laureate}} Robert Pinsky as himself. Pinsky {{was chosen to}} guest star because the writers wanted an intellectual reference for Lisa, [...] and because they knew that Pinsky was {{a fan of the}} show, having read an article of The Time in which Pinsky stated that he [...] "admired the writing" [...] of The Simpsons. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Pinsky stated that he flew to the Simpsons recording studios in Los Angeles on September 10, 2001, and, following the September 11 attacks, was [...] "stranded" [...] there for four days, since no planes were flying following the attacks. Pinsky enjoyed his stay however; [...] "Ian [...] and The Simpsons <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> nice to me," [...] he said. [...] "... One of the things they did for me is they invited me to a table-read of another episode Thursday the 13th I remember everybody laughed like hell It felt really good. People just went to work and everybody laughed a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1975, the 48-year old Davis {{embarked}} on a three-week tour of Japan; between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his [...] "magnificent and energetic" [...] band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra: [...] "Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent." [...] Throughout the tour, he had been sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and effects pedals because of {{the pain in his}} legs, he would go down on his knees to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of Heineken beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka. [...] "The Japanese <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. [...] "They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hangshing said, [...] "And {{we found}} that the stories, the customs and {{practices}} of the Israeli <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> similar to ours. So we thought that we must be one of the lost tribes." [...] After making contact with Israelis, they began to study normative Judaism and established several synagogues. Hundreds of Mizo-Kuki-Chin emigrated to Israel. They were required to formally convert to be accepted as Jews, because their history was not documented. Also, given their long migration and intermarriage, they had lost the maternal ancestry of Jews.|$|E
2500|$|During a 2004 interview, Ehrlich {{answered}} {{questions about the}} predictions he made in The Population Bomb.

[...] Ehrlich also stated that 600 million <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> hungry, billions were under-nourished, and that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct.

2500|$|WaterPartners {{contracted}} with Emory University in 2006 to systematically assess {{a random sample}} of projects completed over the last ten years. Few NGOs have conducted systematic studies of the sustainability of their water supply projects. This study represents a significant step towards quantifying results and identifying opportunities for improvement. Results indicated that the systems continued to deliver water at levels demanded by users, <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> satisfied with the new services, and that systems were making positive impacts in users’ daily lives. Challenges identified in the evaluation include dissociation of the local water committees with the local partner organization, [...] "relaxation of system maintenance, financial instability of water committees, poor water quantity in the dry summer months, and contamination and deforestation at the source." ...|$|E
2500|$|The outlook {{was truly}} discouraging, and was {{literally}} [...] "a day of small things;" [...] the <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> friendly, but shy, and seemed afraid to attend preaching. During {{the following year}} Loughridge built a large, hewed-log house, and at the urgent request of some people living at a distance they received eight or ten children, boys and girls, {{to live with them}} to attend school; this {{was the beginning of the}} system of manual labor boarding schools, which proved to be the most effectual means of civilizing and Christianizing the Indian youth. Gradually, the number of boarding scholars was increased until the Mission had forty; and when the people becoming more interested in religious exercises they attended preaching more regularly and a number of them became converted, and in about two years Loughridge had the pleasure of organizing a church.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi's mother Indira Gandhi, {{was assassinated}} by her Sikh bodyguards, {{which led to}} violent riots against Sikhs. At a Boat Club rally 19 days after the assassination, Gandhi said, [...] "Some riots {{took place in the}} country {{following}} the murder of Indiraji. We know the <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> angry and for a few days it seemed that India had been shaken. But, when a mighty tree falls, it is only natural that the earth around it does shake a little". According to Verinder Grover, the statement made by Gandhi was a [...] "virtual justification" [...] of the riots. Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar wrote, [...] "Did it constitute an incitement to mass murder?" [...] He also criticised Gandhi for his reluctance to bring the army from Meerut to handle the mob.|$|E
