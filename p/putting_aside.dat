The Act of Uniformity 1662, a law {{requiring}} even greater adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required, forced Puritan ministers to leave the Church. Though some presbyterians continued to desire to be readmitted to the established church, restrictions on worship for non-conformists led to presbyterians <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.|$|E
5|$|President Kennedy's {{assassination}} in November 1963 led {{to calls}} to honor {{him with a}} place {{on one of the}} circulating coins, and the Kennedy half dollar was authorized by Congress on December 30. When 26 million of the new coins were issued on March 24, 1964, they were immediately hoarded, both by investors and by those wanting a memento of Kennedy, and the situation did not ease as more coins were produced. One-third of the record-breaking 202.5 million ounces of silver used in coinage in 1964 thus became coins that did not circulate. Congress allowed the Mint to continue to strike 1964-dated pieces into 1965, hoping to make them not worth <b>putting</b> <b>aside.</b>|$|E

5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1529, Cranmer stayed with {{relatives}} in Waltham Holy Cross to avoid an outbreak of the plague in Cambridge. Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and Edward Foxe, joined him. The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe. Henry showed much interest in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him this plan. It is not known whether the king or his new Lord Chancellor, Thomas More, explicitly approved the plan. Eventually it was implemented and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather opinions from the universities. Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the Collectanea Satis Copiosa ("The Sufficiently Abundant Collections") and The Determinations, historical and theological support for {{the argument that the}} king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm.|$|E

25|$|Unger’s {{critique}} of Marginalism begins with Walras’ equilibrium theory, which attempted {{to achieve a}} certainty of economic analysis by <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market {{has been shown to}} be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.|$|E

25|$|Many in Germany reacted {{negatively}} to {{the persecution of}} the Huguenots, disabusing the Protestant princes {{of the idea that}} Louis XIV was their ally against the intolerant practices of the Catholic Habsburgs. The Elector of Brandenburg answered the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by promulgating the Edict of Potsdam, and invited the fleeing Huguenots to Brandenburg. But there were motivations other than religious adherence that disabused him (and other German Princes) of his allegiance to France. Louis XIV had pretensions in the Palatinate in the name of his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte, threatening further annexations of the Rhineland. Thus Frederick-William, spurning his French subsidies, ended his alliance with France and reached agreements with William of Orange, the Emperor, and, temporarily <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> his differences over Pomerania, with King Charles XI of Sweden.|$|E

She falls onto a keyboard, interrupting the firing sequence of MEDUSA, and causing it to malfunction. Valentine and Hester, briefly <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> their differences, try to take Katherine to Tom to get help, but she dies before they can. Hester leaves with Tom in the airship, while Valentine chooses to stay behind in London. MEDUSA finally misfires, obliterating most of the city.

25|$|By 1991 the UWA {{began working}} {{together}} with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL, formerly EMLL), <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> {{the issues that}} let to the split in the 1970s. As a result, El Canek began working regularly for CMLL as well beginning in 1991. In 1993 CMLL held a tournament to crown the first ever CMLL World Tag Team Champions and held a CMLL/UWA tournament the stretched out over several weeks. El Canek was teamed up with Dr. Wagner Jr. for the tournament and the team defeated Los Brazos (Brazo de Oro and Brazo de Plata) in the first round, Atlantis and El Dandy {{in the second round}} and finally Apolo Dantés and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to earn a spot in the finale against Vampiro Canadiense and Pierroth Jr.. The finale too place over three shows, with a best-two-out-of-three match stipulation. Canek and Wagner Jr. won the first match on March 19, while Vampiro and Pierroth Jr. won the second match on March 21. The final match took place on March 26, 1993 and saw El Canek and Dr. Wagner Jr. win the fall and thus become the first ever CMLL World Tag Team Champions. The duo had successful title defenses against the teams of El Dandy and Pierroth Jr. as well as El Texano and Silver King. In November, 1994 El Canek stops working for CMLL, forcing CMLL to vacate the championship that he still held with Dr. Wagner Jr. at that point in time.|$|E

It appears that Coenwulf's family were powerful, {{but they were not}} of recent Mercian royal lineage. A letter written by Alcuin to the people of Kent in 797 laments that [...] "scarcely anyone is found now of the old stock of kings". Eardwulf of Northumbria had, like Coenwulf, gained his throne in 796, so Alcuin's meaning is not clear, but it may be that he intended it as a slur on Eardwulf or Coenwulf or on both. Alcuin certainly held negative views of Coenwulf, regarding him as a tyrant and criticizing him for <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> one wife and taking another. Alcuin wrote to a Mercian nobleman to ask him to greet Coenwulf peaceably [...] "if it is possible to do so", implying uncertainty about Coenwulf's policy towards the Carolingians.|$|E

In October 1945 she went to Germany to report on how the destroyed German education system could best be reactivated. She was astonished by the speed with which, five months after its defeat, the country's schools and universities were reopening. Other trips included visits to Gibraltar, Malta and Czechoslovakia. In November 1945 she chaired an international conference in London that led to the establishment, a year later, of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). In one of her final speeches in parliament, on 22 November 1946, she emphasised that UNESCO stood for [...] "standards of value... <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> the idea that only practical things matter".

500|$|In the 1880s, {{despite the}} return of gold to {{commerce}} nationwide with the resumption of specie payments {{at the end of}} 1878, few three-dollar pieces were coined. [...] There was a small speculative boom by the public in <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> three-dollar pieces; nevertheless, thousands remained at the Philadelphia Mint. [...] Few were sent to banks; the coins sold for a small premium when banks had some or when they were purchased from exchange brokers. [...] The coins' main use was as gifts, or in jewelry. [...] The pieces were struck only at Philadelphia after the 1870-S rarity, and early numismatist S.H.Chapman noted of the 1879 through 1889 issues, [...] "of the later years of the$3, large numbers were remelted at the Philadelphia Mint." [...] The Mint apparently favored certain Philadelphia dealers in the distribution of the gold dollar, but the three-dollar piece could be obtained without a premium at the cashier's window of the Philadelphia Mint. Large numbers of the 1879 three-dollar piece (mintage 3,000for circulation), 1880 (1,000), and 1881 (500) were hoarded by early coin collector and dealer Thomas L.Elder, who asked bank tellers to look out for them. [...] Elder could not have obtained them directly from the Mint at the time of issue as he was still a child in 1880, and did not begin collecting coins until 1887.|$|E
