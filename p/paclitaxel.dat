5|$|SLCO1B3 {{has been}} {{identified}} as the human hepatic uptake transporter for amatoxins; moreover, substrates and inhibitors of that protein—among others rifampicin, penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, <b>paclitaxel,</b> ciclosporin and prednisolone—may be useful for the treatment of human amatoxin poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, <b>paclitaxel,</b> vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, <b>paclitaxel,</b> docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|Robert A. Holton, a {{professor}} of chemistry at Florida State, developed the first total synthesis of the anti-cancer drug <b>paclitaxel,</b> which had previously been obtainable only from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. Florida State University signed a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb to license this and future patents. In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of <b>paclitaxel</b> (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, <b>paclitaxel</b> (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug <b>Paclitaxel</b> is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and <b>paclitaxel</b> can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes <b>paclitaxel</b> and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel {{differs from}} <b>paclitaxel</b> at two {{positions}} in its chemical structure. It has a hydroxyl functional group on carbon 10, whereas <b>paclitaxel</b> has an acetate ester, and a tert-butyl carbamate ester {{exists on the}} phenylpropionate side chain instead of the benzamide in <b>paclitaxel.</b> The carbon 10 functional group change causes docetaxel to be more water-soluble than <b>paclitaxel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Albumin-bound <b>paclitaxel</b> (trade name Abraxane, {{also called}} nab-paclitaxel) is an {{alternative}} formulation where <b>paclitaxel</b> is bound to albumin nano-particles. Much of the clinical toxicity of <b>paclitaxel</b> {{is associated with the}} solvent Cremophor EL in which it is dissolved for delivery.|$|E
25|$|Recently the {{presence}} of taxanes including <b>paclitaxel,</b> 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, <b>paclitaxel</b> C, and 7-epipaclitaxel in the shells and leaves of hazel plants has been reported. The finding of these compounds in shells, which are considered discarded material and are mass-produced by many food industries, is of interest for the future availability of <b>paclitaxel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} <b>paclitaxel</b> to inhibit spindle {{function}} is generally attributed to its suppression of microtubule dynamics, but {{recent studies have}} demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block mitosis. At the higher therapeutic concentrations, <b>paclitaxel</b> appears to suppress microtubule detachment from centrosomes, a process normally activated during mitosis. <b>Paclitaxel</b> binds to beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{approaches}} to <b>paclitaxel</b> production {{led to the}} development of docetaxel. Docetaxel has a similar set of clinical uses to <b>paclitaxel</b> and is marketed under the name of Taxotere.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel and <b>paclitaxel</b> have {{comparable}} efficacy metastatic {{breast cancer}} but <b>paclitaxel</b> has less severe side effects. Additionally, {{it has been}} noted that docetaxel is prone to cellular drug resistance via {{a variety of different}} mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paclitaxel</b> total {{synthesis}} {{in organic}} chemistry {{is a major}} ongoing research effort in the total synthesis of <b>paclitaxel</b> (Taxol). This diterpenoid is an important drug {{in the treatment of}} cancer but, also expensive because the compound is harvested from a scarce resource, namely the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Not only is the synthetic reproduction of the compound itself of great commercial and scientific importance, but it also opens the way to <b>paclitaxel</b> derivatives not found in nature but with greater potential.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commercial}} semisynthesis (by {{the company}} Natural Pharmaceuticals) {{relies on the}} isolation {{of a group of}} <b>paclitaxel</b> derivatives isolated from primary ornamental taxanes. These derivatives have the same skeleton as <b>paclitaxel</b> except for the organic residue R of the terminal tail amide group which can be phenyl, or propyl or pentyl (among others) whereas in <b>paclitaxel</b> it is an explicit phenyl group. The semisynthesis consists of conversion of the amide group to an amine with Schwartz's reagent through an imine followed by acidic workup and a benzoylation.|$|E
25|$|Bristol-Myers Squibb {{manufactures}} <b>paclitaxel</b> using Penicillium raistrickii {{and plant}} cell fermentation (PCF).|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone {{is given}} prior to {{beginning}} <b>paclitaxel</b> treatment to mitigate {{some of the}} side effects.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel {{is of the}} {{chemotherapy}} drug class; taxane, and is a semi-synthetic analogue of <b>paclitaxel</b> (Taxol), {{an extract}} from the bark of the rare Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Due to scarcity of <b>paclitaxel,</b> extensive research was carried out leading to the formulation of docetaxel – an esterified product of 10-deacetyl baccatin III, which is extracted from the renewable and more readily available leaves of the European yew tree.|$|E
25|$|Intraperitoneal {{chemotherapy}} {{has also}} been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and <b>paclitaxel</b> have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched. Cisplatin and <b>paclitaxel</b> are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: irinotecan combined with cisplatin.|$|E
25|$|GRN1005, an LRP-directed {{conjugate}} of <b>paclitaxel,</b> was {{in phase}} II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{nomenclature}} for <b>paclitaxel</b> {{is structured}} on a tetracyclic 17-carbon (heptadecane) skeleton. There are {{a total of}} 11 stereocenters. The active stereoisomer is (−)-paclitaxel (shown here).|$|E
25|$|If {{the tumor}} is {{determined}} to be platinum-resistant, vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) {{or some combination of}} <b>paclitaxel,</b> gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin may be used as a second-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paclitaxel</b> is {{approved}} in the UK for ovarian, breast and lung, bladder, prostate, melanoma, esophageal, {{and other types}} of solid tumor cancers as well as Kaposi's sarcoma.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in {{ovarian cancer}} {{typically}} consists of platins, {{a group of}} platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include <b>paclitaxel,</b> cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either <b>paclitaxel</b> or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with <b>paclitaxel.</b> Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin {{in that it is}} less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} {{reported}} a case wherein 2 courses of adjuvant therapy with cisplatin and <b>paclitaxel,</b> followed by oral gefitinib, were used after complete resection. The patient {{had had no}} recurrence 34 months later.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} in NICE guidance of June 2001 {{that it should}} be used for nonsmall cell lung cancer in patients unsuitable for curative treatment, and in first-line and second-line treatment of ovarian cancer. In September 2001, NICE recommended <b>paclitaxel</b> should be available for the treatment of advanced breast cancer after the failure of anthracyclic chemotherapy, but that its first-line use should be limited to clinical trials. In September 2006, NICE recommended <b>paclitaxel</b> should not be used in the adjuvant treatment of early node-positive breast cancer. In 2005, its use in the United States for the treatment of breast, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancers was approved by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, <b>paclitaxel,</b> pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, <b>paclitaxel,</b> phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 {{in vitro}} multi-drug {{resistant}} mouse tumor cells {{were treated with}} <b>paclitaxel</b> encased in exosomes. Doses 98% less than common dosing had the same effect. Also, dye-marked exosomes were able to mark tumor cells, potentially aiding in diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Annual sales {{peaked in}} 2000, {{reaching}} US$1.6 billion; <b>paclitaxel</b> {{is now available}} in generic form. In October 2007 it was approved by Drug controller General of India {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer and launched by collaboration with Biocon.|$|E
25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or <b>paclitaxel.</b> Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with <b>paclitaxel</b> for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or platins.|$|E
25|$|The cancer-fighting taxane {{class of}} drugs (<b>paclitaxel</b> (taxol) and docetaxel) block dynamic {{instability}} by stabilizing GDP-bound tubulin in the microtubule. Thus, even when hydrolysis of GTP reaches {{the tip of}} the microtubule, there is no depolymerization and the microtubule does not shrink back.|$|E
25|$|The <b>paclitaxel</b> {{molecule}} {{consists of}} a tetracyclic core called baccatin III and an amide tail. The core rings are conveniently called (from left to right) ring A (a cyclohexene), ring B (a cyclooctane), ring C (a cyclohexane) and ring D (an oxetane).|$|E
25|$|Oncologists {{are already}} individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure.
