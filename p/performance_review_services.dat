40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{examining}} if the management, the managers and the employees {{have a different}} point of view regarding the purpose and the expectations of a <b>performance</b> <b>review.</b> Additionally it is an assignment from the Swedish company Flexlink AB with the purpose of constructing a new template for their <b>performance</b> <b>reviews.</b> The assumption is that if you manage to create one template for <b>performance</b> <b>reviews</b> that meets the expectations at all levels of the organization, it will contribute to create a meaningful <b>performance</b> <b>review.</b> We decided to study this from an organizational cultural perspective, since the organizational culture plays a significant part in <b>performance</b> <b>reviews.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>reviews</b> are systematic conversations between employees and managers related to planning, information exchange and developing the relationship. Previous research indicates that if employees are satisfied with their <b>performance</b> <b>reviews,</b> they prone to be more satisfied with their work situation and have a higher organizational commitment. The study was done through interviews with three participants from the management team, five managers at various levels as well as five employees, all from Flexlink. The questions concerned their perception of the purpose and expectations for the <b>performance</b> <b>reviews</b> in general and also their perception of the existing template. The responses were then analyzed using previous research about <b>performance</b> <b>reviews</b> and theories of organizational culture. The management concluded that the purpose of a <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> is to reconcile the company's development with the individual´s, and to ensure the organizational competence needs. Employees believe that the purpose of a <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> is to discuss their work situation. Both the management's and the employee´s expectations of the <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> are that it will provide valuable feedback for both sides which indicate a low degree of power distance from an organizational culture perspective. The managers believe that the purpose is to reconcile the past year and plan for the future year. They are expecting an open and honest discussion with potential for constructive criticism, which also supports the indication of a low degree of power distance. With the basis in the analysis of the interviews and previous research on the subject a new template was constructed...|$|R

40|$|A <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> {{program is}} a {{management}} tool for enhancing the performance of employees. Such systems have been widely adopted by {{both private and public}} organisations during the last decade. Management writers strongly advocate the involvement of senior managers in <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> programs. In order to investigate the extent to which senior managers within public hospitals in New South Wales are presently involved in such programs, a survey was conducted. The aims of the survey were: to determine the number of senior hospital managers currently participating in a <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> program; to investigate the methodologies being used within hospitals to evaluate the performance of senior managers; to examine the reasons why hospitals with a formal <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> program in place had implemented that system; and to ascertain the reasons why some hospitals had failed to establish a formal <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> system for senior managers. The most frequently used methodology employed was based on the management-by-objectives model. The findings indicate that further education of those who influence the management of hospitals regarding the benefits of involving senior executives in <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> programs is necessary. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{precipitated by}} the {{observation}} that {{little is known about}} <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> activity in this country despite the introduction of a <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> system being proffered as one solution to the statutory value for money requirement. However, the research was not undertaken merely to fill an information vacuum. Delineating what lessons can be learned from current operations should assist local authorities embarking on the introduction of review systems in the future, particularly the `new' authorities emerging from Local Government Review and most notably in Scotland, where the statutory responsibility for ensuring value for money arrangements are in place, falls to the unitary authorities becoming operational on the 1 st April 1996. Additionally, <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> may provide the framework in which policy achievements can be demonstrated, thus strengthening local government by reinforcing its policy role. This latter characteristicis likely to become critical if the trend towards enabling and decentralisation continues within the local government sector. An investigation of <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> was thus undertaken with postal questionnaires issued to chief executives and council leaders and a series of case studies, being used to accumulate research evidence. The findings are far-reaching and encompass the scale of review activity, the types of review system being utilised, attitudes to <b>performance</b> <b>review,</b> and establishing, operating and sustaining review systems. Insight was also gained about performance issues in authorities which had not implemented review processes. The operation of <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> is associated with significant benefits in many local authorities and there are useful lessons to be learned from these experiences as well as from those councils in which <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> has been less successful. These lessons are delineated within this thesis along with a set of good practice recommendations...|$|R

40|$|TV program <b>review</b> <b>services,</b> {{especially}} drama <b>review</b> <b>services,</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular video on demand services on the Web. In this paper, we propose a novel video abstraction model for a <b>review</b> <b>service</b> of story-oriented video such as dramas. In a drama <b>review</b> <b>service,</b> viewers want to understand the story in a short time and service providers want to provide video abstracts at minimum cost. The proposed model enables the automatic creation of a video abstract that still allows viewers to understand the overall story of the source video. Also, the model has a flexible structure so that the duration of an abstract can be adjusted depending on the requirements given by viewers. We get clues for human understanding of a story from scenario writing rules and editorial techniques which are popularly used in the process of video producing. We have implemented the proposed model and successfully applied it to several TV dramas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the past}} 50 years {{there has been}} a {{substantial}} increase in the volume of published research and in the number of authors per scientific publication. There is also significant pressure exerted on researchers to produce publications. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to survey corresponding authors in published medical journals to determine their opinion on publication impact in relation to <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> and promotion. Methods Cross-sectional survey of corresponding authors of original research articles published in June 2007 among 72 medical journals. Measurement outcomes included the number of publications, number of authors, authorship order and journal impact factor in relation to <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> and promotion. Results Of 687 surveys, 478 were analyzed (response rate 69. 6 %). Corresponding authors self-reported that number of publications (78. 7 %), journal impact factor (67. 8 %) and being the first author (75. 9 %) were most influential for their annual <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> and assessment. Only 17. 6 % of authors reported that the number of authors on a manuscript was important criteria for <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> and assessment. A higher percentage of Asian authors reported that the number of authors was key to <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> and promotion (41. 4 % versus 7. 8 to 22. 2 %). compared to authors from other countries. Conclusions The number of publications, authorship order and journal impact factor were important factors for <b>performance</b> <b>reviews</b> and promotion at academic and non-academic institutes. The number of authors was not identified as important criteria. These factors may be contributing to the increase in the number of authors per publication. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Clinical {{competency}} committees (CCCs) are {{now required}} in graduate medical education. This study examined how residency programs understand and operationalize this mandate for resident <b>performance</b> <b>review.</b> Method In 2013, the investigators conducted semistructured interviews with 34 residency program directors at five public institutions in California, asking about each institution's CCCs and resident <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> processes. They used conventional content analysis to identify major themes from the verbatim interview transcripts. Results The purpose of resident <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> at all institutions was oriented {{toward one of}} two paradigms: a problem identification model, which predominated; or a developmental model. The problem identification model, which focused on identifying and addressing performance concerns, used performance data such as red-flag alerts and informal information shared with program directors to identify struggling residents. In the developmental model, the timely acquisition and synthesis of data to inform each resident's developmental trajectory was challenging. Participants highly valued CCC members' expertise as educators to corroborate the identification of struggling residents and to enhance credibility of the committee's outcomes. Training in applying the milestones to the CCC's work was minimal. Participants were highly committed to <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> and perceived the current process as adequate for struggling residents but potentially not for others. Conclusions Institutions orient resident <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> toward problem identification; a developmental approach is uncommon. Clarifying the purpose of resident <b>performance</b> <b>review</b> and employing efficient information systems that synthesize performance data and engage residents and faculty in purposeful feedback discussions could enable the meaningful implementation of milestones-based assessment...|$|R
