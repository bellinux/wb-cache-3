50|$|Danaus dorippus was {{formerly}} {{regarded as a}} subspecies of Danaus chrysippus, the <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> or African monarch. It is now regarded as a distinct species. It appears (from analysis of mtDNA sequences, which are only inherited from the mother) that the dorippus tiger {{is the product of}} an ancient lineage of Danaus hybridizing with <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> females. As the <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> is known to be parasitized at least occasionally by Spiroplasma bacteria which selectively kill off male hosts, a subsequent scarcity of <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> males might have led to this hybridization and the evolution of the dorippus tiger. From the color pattern of this species, it can be assumed that the ancient lineage had no black apex on the forewings, as this character is still absent in D. dorippus.|$|E

50|$|Fish {{species such}} as the yellow perch, {{northern}} pike {{and a variety of}} smaller non-game fish species thrive in the abundant ponds and waterways, providing a major source of food for many of the migratory bird species. The leopard frog, Great <b>Plains</b> toad, <b>tiger</b> salamander and prairie rattlesnake all have been documented as common in the district. The refuge allows fishing and hunting in limited areas and in season.|$|R
50|$|Head coach Terry Bowden led the 1993 team to {{a perfect}} season {{in his first year}} on the <b>Plains.</b> The <b>Tigers</b> were the only undefeated team in major college football, however were banned from playing on {{television}} or post-season games due to NCAA violations. Rival Alabama was sent to the SEC Championship Game as the substitute representative of the Western Division. Auburn finished ranked fourth in the nation by the Associated Press. However, Auburn was on NCAA probation in 1993 and ineligible for post season play.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{primarily}} {{to the fact that}} it was used so extensively by the British Army, the [...]577/450 Martini-Henry was also very popular among hunters all over the world for many years.

The cartridge has fallen out of use in recent years because of the difficulty involved in obtaining ammunition. However, the [...]577/450 Martini-Henry is still used occasionally by hunters, especially in the former British colonies, and is a great choice for hunting medium and large game.|$|R

50|$|So {{many large}} animals would have {{supported}} {{a large population}} of predators as well. Indian wolves, dholes, striped hyenas, Asiatic cheetahs and Asiatic lions would have hunted large game on the open <b>plains,</b> while Bengal <b>tigers</b> and leopards would stalk prey in the surrounding woods and sloth bears hunt for termites {{in both of these}} areas. In the Ganges there were large concentrations of gharial, mugger crocodile and river dolphin controlling fish stocks and the occasional migrating herd crossing the river.|$|R

50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> can be {{considered}} the archetypal danaine of India. Accordingly, this species has been studied in greater detail than other members of its subfamily occurring in India.|$|E
25|$|Human development, mostly agriculture, has {{replaced}} {{nearly all of}} the original natural vegetation of the Ganges basin. More than 95% of the upper Gangetic Plain has been degraded or converted to agriculture or urban areas. Only one large block of relatively intact habitat remains, running along the Himalayan foothills and including Rajaji National Park, Jim Corbett National Park, and Dudhwa National Park. As recently as the 16th and 17th centuries the upper Gangetic Plain harboured impressive populations of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), Bengal tigers (Panthera t. tigris), Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), gaurs (Bos gaurus), barasinghas (Rucervus duvaucelii), sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) and Indian lions (Panthera leo persica). In the 21st century there are few large wild animals, mostly deer, wild boars, wildcats, and small numbers of Indian wolves, golden jackals, and red and Bengal foxes. Bengal tigers survive only in the Sundarbans area of the Ganges Delta. The Sundarbands freshwater swamp ecoregion, however, is nearly extinct. Threatened mammals in the upper Gangetic <b>Plain</b> include the <b>tiger,</b> elephant, sloth bear, and four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis).|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> extends from Africa and {{southern}} Europe, eastwards via Sri Lanka, India, and Myanmar to China, Java and Sulawesi. It is a very common species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> is {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} first butterflies to be used in art. A 3500-year-old Egyptian fresco in Luxor features the oldest illustration of this species.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} {{possibly}} {{a close relative}} to the similarly colored soldier butterfly (or tropic queen; Danaus eresimus); in any case, it is not close to the <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> (Danaus chrysippus) as was long believed. There are seven subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Danaus chrysippus, {{also known}} as the <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> or African monarch, is a {{medium-sized}} butterfly widespread in Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Danainae (milkweed butterflies) subfamily of the brush-footed butterfly family, Nymphalidae. Its colouration is mimicked by multiple species.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the many}} {{interesting}} butterfly specimens in the area are: blue Mormon, common Jezebel, common Mormon, common mime, plum Judy, common wanderer, crimson rose, lime butterfly, <b>plain</b> <b>tiger,</b> southern birdwing and tailed jay.

5000|$|Danaus genutia, {{the common}} tiger, {{is one of}} the common {{butterflies}} of India.

The butterfly is also called striped tiger in India to differentiate it from the equally common <b>plain</b> <b>tiger,</b> Danaus chrysippus.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> perches on the upperside of a leaf and, curling its abdomen {{around the}} edge, lays an egg on the underside. Only one egg is laid per leaf to avoid {{overcrowding}} of the caterpillars. The egg is silvery white, shiny, tall, bullet-shaped with an apical point and ribbed sides.|$|E
50|$|While it is {{a strong}} flier, it never flies rapidly or high. It has {{stronger}} and faster strokes than the <b>plain</b> <b>tiger.</b> The butterfly ranges forth in search of its host and nectar plants. It visits gardens where it nectars on the flowers of Adelocaryum, Cosmos, Celosia, Lantana, Zinnia, and similar flowers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{butterfly}} {{also has}} a tough, leathery skin to survive such occasional attacks. When attacked it fakes death and oozes nauseating liquid which makes it smell and taste terrible. This encourages the predator to release the butterfly quickly. The <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> thus {{has the ability to}} recover [...] "miraculously" [...] from predator attacks that would kill most other butterflies.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the titles}} {{on the two}} EPs seem to have some link with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Most are obscure, but the <b>plain</b> <b>tiger</b> is a common Asian {{butterfly}} and the lyrics to [...] "Melonella" [...] (on Echoes In A Shallow Bay) are simply a recounting of various Lepidopteric family names such as Hesperiidae and Papilionidae.|$|E
50|$|In Batesian mimicry, an aposematic {{inedible}} {{model has}} an edible mimic.
