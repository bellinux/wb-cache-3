25|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> is {{beneficial}} to those exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Since light {{can reach the}} eyes from the sides, full-coverage eye protection is usually warranted {{if there is an}} increased risk of exposure, as in high-altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher-than-ordinary levels of UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} was conducted to investigate recent articles about ocular trauma. Eye injuries may be divided into blunt and penetrating types. Males are more affected than females. Evaluation of eye injuries should start with visual acuity and continue with prompt referral to an ophthalmologist as indicated. DESIGN: Medlines search/American Academy of Ophthalmology. RESULTS: Ocular trauma is a frequent reason for emergency room visits. Most injuries stem from sports, recreation, military, occupational, or automotive.

5000|$|Diethylaluminum {{chloride}} is {{very difficult}} to handle. Diethylaluminum chloride is extremely flammable, and thus must be kept away from sparks, flames, or any source of ignition. The compound must be kept in a tightly closed steel container, in a cool, dry room where temperatures and pressures do not vary frequently, when the compound is not in use. [...] This compound is typically manipulated under a fume hood, and, for more protection, wearing a respirator when the container is open. Direct physical contact is avoided by wearing <b>protective</b> gloves, <b>eyewear,</b> and clothing. In case of a spill of diethylaluminum chloride, the documented procedure is to first get rid of all ignition sources and prevent water from coming in contact with the spill. Then the spill is covered with dry earth or sand, followed by a plastic sheet. Finally the spill is swept up and disposed of properly.|$|R
25|$|As an officer, Castro was not {{required}} to personally provide fire support to fellow soldiers in the exposed housetop position. Nonetheless, he volunteered for the mission and was accompanied by Sergeant Ralph Porras and Private First Class Justin Dreese. A mortar round landed {{a few feet away}} from him, killing Sergeant Porras and PFC Dreese and severely wounding Castro. Shrapnel tore through his body, damaging a shoulder, breaking an arm, fracturing facial bones and collapsing his lungs. The blast also drove the frame of his <b>protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> into his face.|$|E
25|$|Lasers in {{this class}} may cause damage if the beam enters the eye directly. This {{generally}} applies to lasers powered from 5–500mW. Lasers in this category can cause permanent eye damage with exposures of 1/100th of a second or more depending {{on the strength of}} the laser. A diffuse reflection is generally not hazardous but specular reflections can be just as dangerous as direct exposures. <b>Protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> is recommended when direct beam viewing of ClassIIIb lasers may occur. Lasers at the high power end of this class may also present a fire hazard and can lightly burn skin.|$|E
25|$|A Class 3B laser is {{hazardous}} if the eye {{is exposed}} directly, but diffuse reflections such as those from paper or other matte surfaces are not harmful. The AEL for continuous lasers in the wavelength range from 315nm to far infrared is 0.5W. For pulsed lasers between 400 and 700nm, the limit is 30mJ. Other limits apply to other wavelengths and to ultrashort pulsed lasers. <b>Protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> is typically required where direct viewing of a class3B laser beam may occur. Class-3B lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Class3B lasers are used inside CD and DVD writers, although the writer unit itself is class1 because the laser light cannot leave the unit.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> in {{the form}} of {{spectacles}} or goggles with appropriately filtering optics can protect the eyes from the reflected or scattered laser light with a hazardous beam power, as well as from direct exposure to a laser beam. Eyewear must be selected for the specific type of laser, to block or attenuate in the appropriate wavelength range. For example, eyewear absorbing 532nm typically has an orange appearance (although one should never rely solely on the lens color when selecting laser eye protection), transmitting wavelengths larger than 550nm. Such eyewear would be useless as protection against a laser emitting at 800nm. Furthermore, some lasers emit more than one wavelength of light, and this may be a particular problem with some less expensive frequency-doubled lasers, such as 532nm [...] "green laser pointers" [...] which are commonly pumped by 808nm infrared laser diodes, and also generate the fundamental 1064nm laser beam which is used to produce the final 532nm output. If the IR radiation is allowed into the beam, which happens in some green laser pointers, it will in general not be blocked by regular red or orange colored <b>protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> designed for pure green or already IR-filtered beam. Special YAG laser and dual-frequency eyewear is available for work with frequency-doubled YAG and other IR lasers which have a visible beam, but it is more expensive, and IR-pumped green laser products do not always specify whether such extra protection is needed.|$|E

50|$|The Authorized <b>Protective</b> <b>Eyewear</b> List (APEL) {{is a list}} of <b>protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> {{tested and}} {{approved}} by the U.S. Military for use by its soldiers. It was created in 2006 because statistics showed that about 10% of battlefield injuries at that time included eye injuries. The APEL is updated periodically and there are usually more than a dozen types of non-prescription and prescription spectacles and goggles on the list for different duty situations and soldier preferences. In 2010, the APEL was placed under the oversight of the Military Combat Eyewear Protection (MCEP) program under the office of PEO Soldier.|$|E

50|$|Ballistic eyewear {{is a form}} {{of glasses}} or goggles that protect from small {{projectiles}} and fragments. For the U.S. military, choices are listed on the Authorized <b>Protective</b> <b>Eyewear</b> List (APEL).). Ballistic eyewear including examples that meet APEL requirements are commercially available for anyone who wishes to buy it. The history of <b>protective</b> <b>eyewear</b> goes back to 1880 and extends through to World War I and the present. There are three standards that are currently used to test the effectiveness of ballistic eyewear. These include a U.S. civilian standard (ANSI Z87.1 - 2010), a U.S. military standard (MIL-PRF-31013), and a European standard (EN166, 169, 170 & 172).|$|E
