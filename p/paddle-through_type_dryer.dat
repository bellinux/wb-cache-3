40|$|The rough-rice-drying {{process in}} a mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> was {{analysed}} by the theory of thin layer drying. The drying period of rough rice in the dryer {{is assumed to be}} a pre-heating period, and a heat balance equation is introduced as one of the basic equations. The Becker 2 ̆ 7 s equation of moisture content, the Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s equation of equilibrium moisture content, and the equations of air and vapour characteristics are used for the analysis with a slight modification. The drying process in mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> is assumed to be as folloes; 1 ） Drying air increase its humidity and reduces its temperature by absorbing the moisture of the products through the mixing layer from the inlet to the outlet. This means that the state of air changes with drying time and grain position as in deep stationary bed. 2) The state of grains is independent of their position, but dependent on drying time. This is due to constant mixing. 3) The drying rate of grains, averaged by constant mixing, is independent of their position although the local drying rate varies with their position. 4 ） The heating rate of grains is also independent of their position. This is the same situation as in the drying rate. The equations on the misture content, the temperature of grains, the absolute humidity, and the enthalpy of drying air are being derived. The numerical method of solving these equations is given together with its computer program. Results computed with this theory agree well with the measured values with the practical apparatus, L. S.

In Iran, rice (mostly Indica type) is dried by flat bed <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> until the final MC reaches to 6 to 8 %. The experiments were conducted to {{examine the effect of}} application of discharge fan with different heights of paddy on the drying efficiency. Experiments were designed based on two different configurations of the drying methods; with and without discharge fan with three different heights of paddy including; 5, 10, and 15 cm. The humid heated air will be going out immediately by the suction of discharge fan. The drying time is established upon the average final MC to achieve about 8 %. To save energy and reduce the drying time, the distribution of temperature between layers should be fast and uniform with minimum difference; otherwise the difference of MC gradient between layers will be high and will induce grain breakage. The difference of final MC between layers in the two methods was 48 - 73 %. The steady state of temperature between the two methods has saved time in the range of 10 - 20 %, and the efficiency of temperature distribution increased 17 - 26 % by the use of discharge fan. ...|$|R

The third method of drying which also served as the control is sun drying in which case the drying trays was placed 90 cm above the ground but left unenclosed to allow free flow of ambient air. The air temperature at points just above the drying rack was monitored for all three drying systems under no load conditions from morning to late afternoon.
