This paper {{presents}} a low cost system for the protection of DC motor from field failure. The purpose of this field <b>failure</b> <b>relay</b> is to protect the motor from the damage of field failure and also provide a simple speed control technique. Operational amplifier and microcontroller together works as field <b>failure</b> <b>relay.</b> The class-E chopper is used to rotate the motor in either directions and for breaking. The pulse width modulation technique is used for smooth speed control. The concept of op-amp in field failure protection can be extended for application to different DC motor drives such as: series, separately excited and permanent magnet DC motor...|$|R

The paper considers single <b>phase</b> <b>failures</b> in the 3 -phase system, and single- and double-phase failures in the 5 -phase system. Double-phase failures include both adjacent and non-adjacent <b>phase</b> <b>failures.</b> Simulation and practical experimentation are reported assuming the same DC link capacitance and the same total power output and power factor. Symmetrical Regular Sampled Phase Disposition PWM (SRSPDPWM) is employed to generate the PWM signals for the inverter using an Altera Cyclone FPGA.

Many systems from a range of industries experience such missions. The methods used for phased mission analysis are dependent upon the repairability of the system during the phases. If the system is non-repairable, fault-tree-based methods offer an efficient solution. For repairable systems, Markov approaches can be used. This paper is concerned with the analysis of non-repairable systems. When the <b>phased</b> mission <b>failure</b> causes are represented using fault trees, it is shown that the binary decision diagram (BDD) method of analysis offers advantages in the solution process.

Such systems {{were used to}} model the strength of fibrous composites where component fiber failures occur in cycles having two phases. As the load on the system increases, a single component fails (Phase I), which then causes a cascade of component <b>failures</b> (<b>Phase</b> II) due to the load transfer as these <b>Phase</b> II <b>failures</b> occur. Under monotone load-sharing the failures have a simple Markovian structure. The {{current state of the}} system only depends on the latest <b>Phase</b> I <b>failure</b> and the corresponding <b>Phase</b> II <b>failures</b> have a Gibbs measure (GM) representation when the component strengths are independent. The GM representation formalism indicates that log odds ratios for the strength distribution are the fundamental quantities in determining the potentials in the GM for the state of the system. Formulas for the potentials are particularly simple through the use of generalizations of the log-logistic and the log-logistic distributions for the component strength distributions. These simplified formulas can be used to understand the system structural reliability...|$|R

However, deploying MI waveguides to connect the wireless nodes in such networks is challenging due to the high deployment cost, the complex shape of the communication range of the MI waveguides, and the significant impacts of the node <b>failure</b> and <b>relay</b> coil displacement. To date, the deployment problems in the MI-based networks have not been addressed. In this paper, the optimal MI waveguide deployment strategies are investigated in both one and two dimensional MI-based networks where the nodes are distributed either randomly or according to a regular lattice. Validated by both theoretical deduction and simulations, the proposed deployment strategies can construct a reliable MI-based network that is robust to node <b>failure</b> and <b>relay</b> coil displacement with minimum cost.

In a contractual market relationship between customer and supplier, the capability to measure Change Requests, for technical and managerial reasons, is critical and influences directly the Customer Satisfaction level as well as the profitability of the business for the Supplier.

Mission success is only achieved if each of the phases is successful, and each phase is required to achieve a different objective and use different elements of the system. The reliability analysis of a phased mission system will produce the probability of failure during each of the phases, together with the overall mission failure likelihood. In the event that the system performance does not meet with the acceptance requirement, weaknesses in the design are identified and improvements made to rectify the deficiencies. In conventional system assessments, importance measures can be predicted which provide a numerical indicator of the significance of the role that each component plays in the system failure. Through the development of appropriate importance measures, this paper provides ways of identifying the contribution made by each component <b>failure</b> to each <b>phase</b> <b>failure</b> and the overall mission failure. In addition, a means is given to update the system performance prediction as phases of the mission are successfully completed. The causes of <b>phase</b> <b>failure</b> are expressed as fault trees.
