Secret Roman Catholic masses were held in private homes, including Morleys Hall, home of the Tyldesleys. On Easter Sunday 1641, the Catholic priest, Ambrose Barlow was arrested during a service at Morleys Hall at the instigation of the vicar of Leigh. He was taken to Lancaster Castle, tried as a traitor and executed on 10 September 1641. He was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church {{as one of the}} Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. A church and school bear his name. The St Ambrose Barlow parish was formed in 1965 and the church was built in 1981. St Ambrose Barlow parish is in the Leigh <b>Pastoral</b> <b>Area</b> in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|The two Catholic Bornheim congregations, with {{a part of}} {{the parish}} {{territory}} of the previous parish of St. Michael, were united to form the new parish of St. Josef. The Church of St. Michael in Frankfurt-Nordend became the Zentrum für Trauerseelsorge (=Centre for Mourning Counselling) of the Diocese of Limburg. The parish of St. Josef in Bornheim and the neighbouring parish of Maria Rosenkranz (=Mary Rosary) in Frankfurt-Seckbach formed the common <b>pastoral</b> <b>area</b> Frankfurt-Bornheim. Together with their neighbours Maria Rosenkranz in Frankfurt-Seckbach, the new St. Josef parishioners formed the <b>pastoral</b> <b>area</b> Frankfurt-Bornheim until 31 December 2011, in which a stronger cooperation than before took place. The parish of St. Josef was at this time with almost 11,000 Catholics {{one of the largest in}} the Diocese of Limburg. On 1 January 2012 the pastoral rooms in Frankfurt were reorganized and from the two pastoral areas of Frankfurt-Bornheim with the parishes of St. Josef-Bornheim and Maria Rosenkranz in Seckbach and Frankfurt-Ost with the two parishes of Heilig-Geist (=Holy Spiritin Frankfurt-Riederwald and Herz-Jesu (=Heart of Jesus) in Frankfurt-Fechenheim, a new <b>pastoral</b> <b>area</b> called Frankfurt-Ost was created.

30|$|Despite {{the vital}} role of {{pastoralism}} as {{way of life}} in food production for its inhabitants in arid environment for millennia, pastoral societies are poorly recognized by national policies. National policies and development agenda in East African pastoral systems often overlooked pastoralism only focusing on modernization of the agricultural sector as engine of economic development and poverty reduction (Mohammed 2010). Successive governments of Ethiopia have been promoting large-scale agricultural intervention in <b>pastoral</b> <b>areas</b> (James et al. 2014). Development in <b>pastoral</b> <b>areas</b> has long been a contested concept (James et al. 2014), which is arguably the case in the context of Afar pastoralists. Previous studies (Solomon and Abebe 2014; James et al. 2014) have indicated that the promotion of irrigated agriculture has often contributed to the continued marginalization and resource depletion rather than improvement of communities’ livelihood in Afar <b>pastoral</b> <b>areas.</b> According to the same authors, the view that pastoralism is an inefficient way of life, which should be replaced by sedentary agriculture, and as a result ignorance of local communities’ participation in development interventions contributed to the unfavorable effects facing them today.|$|R
