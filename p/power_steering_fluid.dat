30|$|In {{order for}} fire {{to occur in}} a {{passenger}} vehicle there are three main elements that must be present. First are the combustible materials which include fluids such as engine fuels and oils, transmission oils, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluids,</b> brake fluids and lubricants; upholsteries; tyres; plastic materials such as in dashboards and bumpers; possibly the body work of the vehicle itself; and finally, any contents being carried in the vehicle. Second is the availability of oxygen depends on whether vehicle doors and windows are open (and/or break during the fire), the ease that air can reach other internal parts of the car plus the external ventilation if the vehicle is in an enclosure. Some of the experiments collated in this review include the difference in vehicle burning characteristics {{as a result of}} the degree of opening of the vehicle windows. The third element is the source of ignition. Common sources of ignition for vehicles are electrical faults, hot surfaces, mechanical failure and deliberate actions (Cheong et al. 2008).|$|R
50|$|The {{penultimate}} {{round of}} pit stops began on lap 117 with Winterbottom and Lowndes pitting, followed by Whincup on lap 118 and Bright and Canto on lap 119. Michael Caruso's car {{had a major}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> leak, dropping <b>fluid</b> over the top section of the circuit. David Wall had a similar problem several laps later. Tander pitted on lap 126, leaving Ekström in the lead. Lowndes and Bright were battling for fifth position at this stage, going side by side around the final corner. Ekström pitted on lap 134, handing over to Andy Priaulx to finish the race. Winterbottom now led by just under two seconds over Whincup.|$|R
50|$|DEXRON III/Mercon - Most 1980s and 1990s GM and Ford, Mercury, Lincoln, many Asian vehicles, some Asian <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> applications, some Ford/Mazda manual transmissions. It is {{generally}} {{less expensive than}} Dexron VI/Mercon V.|$|E

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> helps drivers steer by augmenting the driver's <b>steering</b> effort. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> {{has used}} {{hydraulics}} to reduce a driver's steering effort. However, hydraulic steering is {{being replaced by}} electric <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> because it eliminates the hydraulic pump, and increases fuel efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} <b>power</b> <b>{{steering}}</b> {{is to reduce}} the driver’s effort at the steering wheel. Steering wheel that the spooked hand wheel {{at the top of the}} steering column of an automobile which actuates the steering gear. Such a system is used in heavy commercial vehicle and therefore, application of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> in car, is the biggest question today is. Because as per norms of <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> whose vehicle unladen weight is more than 1500 kgs, may affect as the proper norms. However, introducing of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> in car, in terms of prefect steering is to a problem by means of dragging, while sudden applied of brake. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism employs Electrical Devices, Compressed Air and Hydraulic pressure. There are two types of <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> i. e. integral and linkage. The integral type, the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> systems forms part of the steering gear, where as linkage type, it forms part of the steering linkage...|$|R
50|$|Royal Purple is an American {{manufacturer}} {{which produces}} lubricants for automotive, industrial, marine, motorcycle, and racing use. It is known primarily for its line of synthetic Royal Purple Motor Oil products used in gasoline and diesel engines. They also produce other fluids including gear oil, transmission fluid, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> and industrial gear, bearing, engine, and hydraulic oil. Other products include chassis and bearing grease, lubricant aerosol, aerosol chain lubricant, and firearm lubricant.|$|E
50|$|The {{oil filler}} tube for {{the engine is}} located behind the flip-down license plate door, as is the oil {{dipstick}} and the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir (when fitted). Most vans had a twist-on/off gas cap right on the outside just under and behind the passenger side door. A locking cap was optional. The spare tyre lies in a tray under the very front of the van (as the engine is in the back), just below the radiator.|$|E
50|$|The XT6 {{was also}} {{fitted with a}} unique Cybrid {{adaptive}} electrohydraulic steering system that changed the level of assistance based on the vehicle's speed. This system did not use a conventional belt-driven power steering pump, freeing up much-needed space in the XT6's already cramped engine bay. The Cybrid system also uses hydraulic fluid that is incompatible with conventional <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> (which is usually automatic transmission fluid). This fluid is still available directly from Subaru at a significant premium over more common types of hydraulic fluid.|$|E
50|$|Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> {{replaced}} the traditional hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> {{used by the}} Z3. The power assist is speed-sensitive, allowing for easier manoeuvering at low speeds. The steering has been criticised for lacking feedback. However, the Z4 M uses hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> and has been judged as having a more direct and communicative feel to the steering.|$|R
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>{{steering}}</b> {{gives the}} driver an easier {{means by which}} the steering of a car can be accomplished. Modern <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> has almost universally relied on a hydraulic system, although electrical systems are steadily replacing this technology. Mechanical <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> systems (e.g., Studebaker, 1952) have been invented, but their weight and complexity negate the benefits that they provide.|$|R
5000|$|Magnasteer speed-variable <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> which {{combines}} conventional hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and magnetized [...] "doughnuts" [...] mounted around the output shaft, which stiffen the steering as vehicle speed increases.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fail-safe}} {{cooling system}} with a dual speed electric fan was put in place, along with a coil-on-plug ignition system. Larger dual piston brake calipers {{were added to the}} front, requiring 16 inch wheels to be standard. A Watt's linkage was added to the rear suspension. Fuel lines were moved to the passenger side frame rail. A coded ignition key (known as Passive Anti-Theft System, or [...] "PATS") system was introduced and a 72 amp/hour battery replaced the previous 58. Other minor changes included a redesigned engine cover and the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir being moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|Qualifying for Race 3 {{consisted}} of a 20-minute qualifying session held on Sunday morning followed by a top ten shootout on Sunday afternoon. Only 25 cars {{took part in the}} session, with Pither's crash in Race 2 doing enough damage to rule the car out of Race 3. The qualifying session was stopped for several minutes when a power steering line on James Moffat's car broke and left <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> on the track at the final corner which needed to be cleaned up. McLaughlin was fastest, setting a time of 1:20.4055 {{at the end of the}} session. McLaughlin, Mostert, Whincup, Van Gisbergen, Fabian Coulthard, Rick Kelly, Pye, Winterbottom, Courtney and Waters progressed to the top ten shootout as a result of being the fastest ten drivers.|$|E
50|$|Some engines have an oil cooler, a {{separate}} small radiator {{to cool the}} engine oil. Cars with an automatic transmission often have extra connections to the radiator, allowing the transmission fluid to transfer its heat to the coolant in the radiator. These may be either oil-air radiators, as for a smaller version of the main radiator. More simply they may be oil-water coolers, where an oil pipe is inserted inside the water radiator. Though the water is hotter than the ambient air, its higher thermal conductivity offers comparable cooling (within limits) from a less complex and thus cheaper and more reliable oil cooler. Less commonly, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid,</b> brake fluid, and other hydraulic fluids may be cooled by an auxiliary radiator on a vehicle.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} energy saving <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system, which was named as KEEPS (Kayaba Electronic Controlled Energy Saving <b>Power</b> <b>Steering).</b> In a {{conventional}} hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system, the hydraulic pump always supplies enough quantity {{of oil to}} the hydraulic circuit. This extra oil flow increases driving torque of the pump, thus the hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system wastes energy. On the other hand, KEEPS can control oil flow electrically {{in accordance with the}} condition of a vehicle. In the measurement test for energy consumption of the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system with the actual vehicle on test courses, KEEPS got 48 % less at city mode, 41 % less at highway mode and 39 % less at country mode compared with the conventional hydraulic steering system...|$|R
50|$|This {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering.</b> Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> can be considered as a stage of evolution from mechanical steering to steer by wire systems.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> technology have promised {{significant improvements in}} vehicle handling performance and safety. Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> is {{a new kind of}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> which is developing rapidly these years due to their superior energy efficiency and energy conservation. This paper presents a pos-sible design solution of an electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> actuator for hybrid electric vehicles. The design criteria of a tubular linear motor with interior permanent magnet are described and a tubular interior permanent magnet lin-ear motor is designed and optimized with respect to weight and force ripple for Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> applica-tion. Such an application requires low motor vibration and low force fluctuations which are considered in design process. A finite element analysis is used to validate the results obtained from the analytical model, comparing the magnetic field quantities as well as the mechanical force.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} power steering (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than {{hydraulic power}} steering, since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid.</b> In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiator}} transfers {{the heat}} from the fluid inside to the air outside, thereby cooling the fluid, which in turn cools the engine. Radiators are also often used to cool automatic transmission fluids, air conditioner refrigerant, intake air, and sometimes to cool motor oil or <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid.</b> Radiators are typically mounted {{in a position where they}} receive airflow from the forward movement of the vehicle, such as behind a front grill. Where engines are mid- or rear-mounted, it is common to mount the radiator behind a front grill to achieve sufficient airflow, even though this requires long coolant pipes. Alternatively, the radiator may draw air from the flow over the top of the vehicle or from a side-mounted grill. For long vehicles, such as buses, side airflow is most common for engine and transmission cooling and top airflow most common for air conditioner cooling.|$|E
50|$|Common {{types of}} leaks {{for many people}} include leaks in vehicle tires, causing air to leak out {{resulting}} in flat tires, and leaks in containers, spilling the contents. Leaks can occur or develop in {{many different kinds of}} household, building, vehicle, marine, aircraft, or industrial fluid systems, whether the fluid is a gas or liquid. Leaks in vehicle hydraulic systems such as brake or power steering lines could cause outleakage of brake or <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> resulting in failure of the brakes, power steering, or other hydraulic system. Also possible are leaks of engine coolant - particularly in the radiator and at the water pump seal, transmission fluid, motor oil, and refrigerant in the air conditioning system. Some of these vehicle fluids have different colors to help identify the type of leaking fluid. A zinc-carbon battery is an example of an easy-leaking system; the electrolytes inside the cell sometimes leak out of the cell casing and cause damage to an electronic appliance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{interference}} {{characteristics of the}} active suspension anti-rollover control system and electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system, combining vehicle active suspension anti-rollover control system model, electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system model and the steering model, the automobile system dynamic model was established. The optimal control strategy of LQR(linear quadratic regulator) was designed, and integrated control system of the anti-rollover control system and electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> was realized. Under Matlab/Simulink, the simulation was done and {{the results show that}} the presented control scheme can improve handiness of electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system, and has a good anti- roll and anti- pitch ability...|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> is fitted, with 2.43 turns lock to {{lock and}} a turning circle of 11.86 m. The {{electric}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system allows the Discovery Sport to feature an automatic parking system.|$|R
50|$|The {{next round}} of pit stops began on lap 34 with Ritter and Nick Percat pitting, while Luff and Owen {{followed}} on the next lap. The car of Coulthard and Youlden had a small <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> leak but the problem was mended during a pit stop. Meanwhile, Whincup continued {{to pull away from}} Richards, though Alexandre Prémat was setting the fastest lap times after taking over from Ritter. Whincup pitted on lap 46, four laps after Richards. Lap 54 saw cars coming in to complete their third pit stops, with Will Davison taking over from Owen while Luff handed over to Lowndes on lap 55. By lap 67 all of the leaders had completed three pit stops. Steven Johnson had a problem with his cool suit which had frozen while Jonathon Webb lost the driver's side window on his car. Van Gisbergen endured a problem in his pit stop which caused him to go a lap down while Mostert had a similar delay with a starter motor problem. Tony D'Alberto's car was in the garage with a rear suspension problem.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2003 model year, the Grand Marquis {{retained}} {{the version of}} the Modular V8 introduced in 2001. Single-exhaust versions produced 220 hp, while the dual-exhaust version raised output to 235 hp. During the redesign, a number of changes {{were made to the}} engine. The oil pan was enlarged 20% to six quarts and an engine knock sensor was made standard. Other changes included an intake manifold with aluminum water crossover and an electronic returnless fuel system. The new engine was distinguished by a redesigned engine cover, featuring a chrome [...] "V8" [...] emblem; the oil filler cap was moved to the passenger-side valve cover and the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir was moved off of the engine block onto the radiator shroud.For 2006, revisions to engine tuning added 4 hp to both versions of the Modular V8, for a total of 224 and 239 hp, respectively. In 2007, the engine was given flex-fuel capability (E85). After the 2007 model year, the 239 hp version of the Grand Marquis was sold exclusively for GCC export.|$|E
30|$|Waste-lubricant oils {{includes}} crankcase (engine) oil, brake fluid, {{automatic transmission}} fluid, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>fluid,</b> liquid and semi-solid gear, chain, and ball bearing lubricants, and hydraulic fluid. Waste-lubricant oils {{are not considered}} hazardous waste unless it is mixed with a hazardous waste such as a chlorinated solvent. The problem of soil and groundwater pollution was widely recognized in recent years. The flushing air creates air bubbles where the oil will adhere.|$|E
50|$|The Z4 M uses {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> {{unlike the}} electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> {{used by the}} rest of the Z4 range. Other changes include a wider front track, revised front suspension and steering geometry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> is {{supplied}} as standard. However, because the continuous {{rotation of the}} engine is not available on an electric vehicle, an electric motor is used to <b>power</b> a <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> hydraulic pump.|$|R
25|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> is {{a system}} for {{reducing}} the steering effort on vehicles by using an external power source to assist in turning the roadwheels. In 1926, Francis W. Davis of Waltham, Massachusetts invented <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
