40|$|Expression {{quantitative}} trait loci (eQTL) mapping {{is a powerful}} tool for identifying genetic regulatory variation. However, at present, most eQTLs in humans were identified using gene expression data from cell lines, and it remains unknown whether these eQTLs also have a regulatory function in other expression contexts, such as human <b>primary</b> <b>tissues.</b> Here we investigate this question using a targeted strategy. Specifically, we selected a subset of large-effect eQTLs identified in the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines, and examined the association of these eQTLs with gene expression levels across individuals in five human <b>primary</b> <b>tissues</b> (heart, kidney, liver, lung and testes). We show that genotypes at the eQTLs we selected are often predictive of variation in gene expression levels in {{one or more of the}} five <b>primary</b> <b>tissues.</b> The genotype effects in the <b>primary</b> <b>tissues</b> are consistently in the same direction as the effects inferred in the cell lines. Additionally, a number of the eQTLs we tested are found in more than one of the tissues.

Thymus exhibited elevated joining, followed by brain and spleen, which could be correlated with NHEJ gene expression. However, NHEJ efficiency was poor in terminally differentiated organs like heart, kidney and liver. Strikingly, NHEJ junctions from these tissues also showed extensive deletions and insertions.

40|$|SummaryThe {{design of}} {{effective}} cell replacement therapies requires detailed {{knowledge of how}} embryonic stem cells form <b>primary</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as mesoderm or neurectoderm that later become skeletal muscle or nervous system. Members of the T-box transcription factor family are key {{in the formation of}} these <b>primary</b> <b>tissues,</b> but their underlying molecular activities are poorly understood. Here, we define in vivo genome-wide regulatory inputs of the T-box proteins Brachyury, Eomesodermin, and VegT, which together maintain neuromesodermal stem cells and determine their bipotential fates in frog embryos. These T-box proteins are all recruited to the same genomic recognition sites, from where they activate genes involved in stem cell maintenance and mesoderm formation while repressing neurogenic genes. Consequently, their loss causes embryos to form an oversized neural tube with no mesodermal derivatives. This collaboration between T-box family members thus ensures the continuous formation of correctly proportioned neural and mesodermal tissues in vertebrate embryos during axial elongation...|$|R

The cambium tissues, i.e., the cork cambium and the vascular cambium, are the only parts of a woody stem where cell division occurs; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. Phloem is a nutrient-conducting tissue composed of sieve tubes or sieve cells mixed with parenchyma and fibers. The cortex is the <b>primary</b> <b>tissue</b> of stems and roots.

50|$|Supercooling {{inhibits}} {{the formation}} of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular ice. Cellular barriers such as lignin, suberin and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled tissue. The xylem and <b>primary</b> <b>tissue</b> of plants are very susceptible to cold temperatures {{because of the large}} proportion of water in the cell. Many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the cold. Supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs Rhododendron ferrugineum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea as well as Abies, Picea and Larix species. Freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the plant. However, the extracellular ice may lead to plant dehydration.|$|E
50|$|Embryogenesis may {{be divided}} up into two phases, the first {{involves}} morphogenetic events which form the basic cellular pattern {{for the development}} of the shoot-root body and the <b>primary</b> <b>tissue</b> layers; it also programs the regions of meristematic tissue formation. The second phase, or postembryonic development, involves the maturation of cells, which involves cell growth and the storage of macromolecules (such as oils, starches and proteins) required as a 'food and energy supply' during germination and seedling growth. Embryogenesis involves cell growth and division, cell differentiation and programmed cellular death. The zygotic embryo is formed following double fertilisation of the ovule, giving rise to two distinct structures: the plant embryo and the endosperm which together go on to develop into a seed. Seeds may also develop without fertilization, which is referred to as apomixis. Plant cells can also be induced to form embryos in plant tissue culture; such embryos are called somatic embryos and can be used to generate new plants from single cells.|$|E

They include (1) a determinate single-phase model, where the primary body decreases in size along the main stem or branches toward the apex, and (2) a less determinate two- or three-phase model, where the primary body of stems and branches increases in size (epidogenesis), possibly maintaining a relatively constant maximal size (menetogenesis), and then diminishes in size (apoxogenesis) toward the apex. Developmental patterns of <b>primary</b> <b>tissues</b> (pith, <b>primary</b> xylem, inner and outer cortex) and secondary tissues (periderm and products of the bifacial vascular cambium, including wood and secondary phloem) are investigated {{within the context of}} each model. <b>Primary</b> <b>tissues</b> of inner and outer cortex as well as peridermal tissue initiated in the mid inner cortex show significant changes in response to {{growth of the}} bifacial vascular cambium.

30|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{difficult to distinguish}} muscle metastasis from <b>primary</b> soft <b>tissue</b> sarcoma accurately. Needle or open biopsy is usually performed to confirm a diagnosis. The imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI, ultrasonography, and gallium scintigraphy, have been employed to make a diagnosis. MRI {{has been reported to}} be the most useful not only for differential diagnosis but also for delineating the extent of the involved muscle, because of its high contrast to the surrounding muscle and its wider observational capability via multiple sections [1]. Muscle metastasis typically shows low- to iso-signal intensity on T 1 weighted images and high-signal intensity on T 2 weighted images compared with surrounding muscle. However, <b>primary</b> soft <b>tissue</b> sarcoma can show the similar findings. Contrast-enhanced MRI reveals extensive peritumoral enhancement and lobulation associated with central necrosis in muscle metastasis. These findings seem to be useful to distinguish between muscle metastasis and <b>primary</b> soft <b>tissue</b> sarcoma [1]. However, the histological examination should be performed to make the definitive diagnosis of muscle metastasis. In our case, the ring-enhanced peritumoral area on MRI suggested the skeletal muscle metastasis, and the definitive diagnosis was able to be achieved by the needle biopsy. Immunohistochemical examination is useful for the definitive diagnosis, although data on immunohistochemical staining is unavailable in our case.

50|$|In a {{targeted}} approach, sequencing of ctDNA can be directed towards a genetic panel constructed based on mutational hotspots for the cancer of interest.

Personalizing targeted analysis of ctDNA to each patient is also possible by combining liquid biopsies with standard <b>primary</b> <b>tissue</b> biopsies. Whole genome or whole exome sequencing of the primary tumor biopsy allows for discovery of genetic mutations specific to a patient’s tumor, and can be used for subsequent targeted sequencing of the patient’s ctDNA. The highest sensitivity of ctDNA detection is accomplished through targeted sequencing of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Commonly mutated genes, such as oncogenes, which typically have hotspot mutations, are good candidates for targeted sequencing approaches. Conversely, most tumor suppressor genes have a wide array of possible loss of function mutations throughout the gene, and as such are not suitable for targeted sequencing.|$|E
50|$|Proguanil (chloroguanide) is a biguanide; a {{synthetic}} derivative of pyrimidine. It {{was developed in}} 1945 by a British Antimalarial research group. It has many mechanisms of action but primarily is mediated through conversion to the active metabolite cycloguanil. This inhibits the malarial dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Its most prominent effect is on the <b>primary</b> <b>tissue</b> stages of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. ovale. It has no known effect against hypnozoites therefore is not used {{in the prevention of}} relapse. It has a weak blood schizonticidal activity and is not recommended for therapy of acute infection. However it is useful in prophylaxis when combined with atovaquone or chloroquine (in areas where there is no chloroquine resistance). 3 mg/kg is the advised dosage per day, (hence approximate adult dosage is 200 mg). The pharmacokinetic profile of the drugs indicates that a half dose, twice daily maintains the plasma levels with a greater level of consistency, thus giving a greater level of protection. The proguanil- chloroquine combination does not provide effective protection against resistant strains of P. falciparum. There are very few side effects to proguanil, with slight hair loss and mouth ulcers being occasionally reported following prophylactic use. Proguanil hydrochloride is marketed as Paludrine by AstraZeneca.|$|E

They consider that patients with porcine aortic bioprosthetic valves follow a clinically satisfactory course for around five years after operation. Late deterioration of these valves frequently necessitates re-operation. They estimate the rate of failure at approximately 15 to 25%, 7 to 10 years after valve implantation. Gallo and his associates describe in detail the rate of occurrence and timing of <b>primary</b> <b>tissue</b> failure with the Hancock porcine valve, and show a similar percentage of failures. The actuarial freedom from valve failure in the mitral position at 10 years is 69%, and in the aortic position only 53%. The rate of tissue valve failure accelerated from the third post-operative year in the mitral position, and from the fifth year in the aortic position with a precipitous fall during the 8th and 9th years of follow-up. They believe that the patient can be told {{that he or she}} has a 30% chance of requiring re-operation because of the porcine valve degeneration within the next 10 years. This general calculation {{does not take into account}} the other causes of valve 'problems' which may lead to re-operation or some other morbidity during that period of time.

However, it remains uncertain whether genomic alterations existing in <b>primary</b> tumor <b>tissues</b> are represented in cell lines and whether cell lines carry cell line-specific genomic alterations. This study was performed to answer these questions. Methods Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was employed with 4030 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that cover the genome at 1. 0 megabase resolution to analyze DNA copy number aberrations (DCNAs) in 35 primary breast tumors and 24 breast cancer cell lines. DCNAs were compared between these two groups. A tissue microdissection technique was applied to <b>primary</b> tumor <b>tissues</b> to reduce the contamination of samples by normal tissue components. Results The average number of BAC clones with DCNAs was 1832 (45. 3 % of spotted clones) and 971 (24. 9 %) for cell lines and <b>primary</b> tumor <b>tissues,</b> respectively. Gains of 1 q and 8 q and losses of 8 p, 11 q, 16 q and 17 p were detected in > 50 % of <b>primary</b> cancer <b>tissues.</b> These aberrations were also frequently detected in cell lines. In addition to these alterations, the cell lines showed recurrent genomic alterations including gains of 5 p 14 - 15, 20 q 11 and 20 q 13 and losses of 4 p 13 -p 16, 18 q 12, 18 q 21, Xq 21. 1 and Xq 26 -q 28 that were barely detected in tumor tissue specimens.
