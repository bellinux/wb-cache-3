25|$|In computing, a Digital Object Identifier or DOI is a <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> or handle used to uniquely {{identify}} objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). An {{implementation of}} the Handle System, DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports and data sets, and official publications though they also {{have been used to}} identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.|$|E
2500|$|A {{permalink}} {{is a type}} of <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> and {{the word}} permalink is sometimes used as a synonym of <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier.</b> More often, though, permalink is applied to persistent identifiers which are generated by a content management system for pages served by that system. This usage is especially common in the blogosphere. Such links are not maintained by an outside authority, and their persistence is dependent on the durability of the content management system itself.|$|E
2500|$|The DOI system offers persistent, semantically-interoperable {{resolution}} to related current data and is {{best suited to}} material {{that will be used}} in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as [...] "identifiers" [...] doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other [...] "identifier systems" [...] may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).|$|E

Other <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> schemes include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), Life Sciences Identifiers (LSIDs) and INFO URIs. All persistent identification schemes provide unique identifiers for (possibly changing) virtual resources, but not all schemes provide curation opportunities. Curation of virtual resources has been defined as, [...] "the active involvement of information professionals in the management, including the preservation, of digital data for future use." ...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} the use of <b>persistent</b> <b>identifiers</b> for assets of interest to scientific and other communities alike over the last two decades. Among <b>persistent</b> <b>identifiers,</b> Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) stand out quite prominently, with approximately 133 million DOIs assigned to various objects as of February 2017. While the assignment of DOIs to objects such as scientific publications has been in place for many years, their assignment to Earth science data sets is more recent. Applying <b>persistent</b> <b>identifiers</b> to data sets enables improved tracking of their use and reuse, facilitates the crediting of data producers, and aids reproducibility through associating research with the exact data set(s) used. Maintaining provenance – i. e., tracing back lineage of significant scientific conclusions to the entities (data sets, algorithms, instruments, satellites, etc.) that lead to the conclusions, would be prohibitive without <b>persistent</b> <b>identifiers.</b> This paper provides a brief background on the use of <b>persistent</b> <b>identifiers</b> in general within the US, and DOIs more specifically. We examine their recent use for Earth science data sets, and outline successes and some remaining challenges. Among the challenges, for example, is the ability to conveniently and consistently obtain data citation statistics using the DOIs assigned by organizations that manage data sets...|$|R

40|$|Minting <b>persistent</b> <b>identifiers</b> and {{managing}} their metadata is typically {{governed by a}} single organization. Such a {{single point of failure}} poses a risk to longevity and long-term preservation of identifiers. In this paper we address the risk by proposing a radically different approach, in which minting and management of <b>persistent</b> <b>identifiers</b> is distributed, and the integrity of the distributed system is guaranteed by public-key cryptography. We describe the general architecture of the system, analyse its robustness and discuss potential deployment scenarios...|$|R

5000|$|A PURL of type [...] "200" [...] is an [...] "Active PURL", {{in which}} the PURL {{actively}} participates in the creation or aggregation of the metadata returned.

They {{may be used to}} gather runtime status reports, perform distributed queries or any other type of data collection where a <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> is desired. Active PURLs act similar to a stored procedure in relational databases.|$|E
50|$|An Archival Resource Key (ARK) is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) {{that is a}} {{multi-purpose}} <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> {{for information}} objects of any type. An ARK contains the label ark: after the URL's hostname, which sets the expectation that, when submitted to a web browser, the URL terminated by '?' returns a brief metadata record, and the URL terminated by '??' returns metadata that includes a commitment statement from the current service provider. The ARK and its inflections ('?' and '??') gain access to three facets of a provider's ability to provide persistence.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the objects}} that are {{currently}} identified by handles are journal articles, technical reports, books, theses and dissertations, government documents, metadata, distributed learning content, and data sets.

50|$|The i-number {{form of an}} XRI is {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} address that does not need to change no matter how often the location of a resource on (or off) the Internet changes. XRIs accomplish this by adding a third layer of abstract addressing over the existing layers: IP numbering (first layer) and DNS naming (second layer). The notion of a third layer for persistent addressing is not new — Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and other <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> architectures have been developed for this purposes. However the XRI layer is the first architecture that combines a uniform syntax and resolution protocol for both persistent and reassignable identifiers.|$|E
5000|$|Of course, {{the issue}} of {{persistent}} identification predates the Internet. Over centuries, writers and scholars developed standards for citation of paper-based documents so that readers could reliably and efficiently find a source that a writer mentioned in a footnote or bibliography. After the Internet started to become {{an important source of}} information in the 1990s, {{the issue of}} citation standards became important in the online world as well. Studies have shown that within a few years of being cited, a significant percentage of web addresses go [...] "dead," [...] a process often called link rot. Using a <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> can slow or stop this process.|$|E
50|$|Fedora {{provides}} a general-purpose management layer for digital objects. Object management {{is based on}} content models that represent data objects (units of content) or collections of data objects. The objects contain linkages between datastreams (internally managed or external content files), metadata (inline or external), system metadata (including a PID - <b>persistent</b> <b>identifier</b> - that is unique to the repository), and behaviors that are themselves code objects that provide bindings or links to disseminators (software processes {{that can be used}} with the datastreams). Content models {{can be thought of as}} containers that give a useful shape to information poured into them; if the information fits the container, it can immediately be used in predefined ways.|$|E
