50|$|<b>Pyrometric</b> <b>cones</b> are {{pyrometric}} {{devices that}} are used to gauge heatwork during the firing of ceramic materials. The cones, often used in sets of three as shown in the illustration, are positioned in a kiln with the wares to be fired and provide a visual indication of when the wares have reached a required state of maturity, a combination of time and temperature. Thus, <b>pyrometric</b> <b>cones</b> give a temperature equivalent; they are not simple temperature-measuring devices.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{industries}} in Nigeria depend {{heavily on the}} use of refractory materials. For instance the iron and steel industries, cement, glass, refineries, bakeries and ceramic industries. However, almost all the refractory materials used by these industries are imported. Consequently, it leads to the draining of Nigeria’s foreign reserve and this in turn negatively affects the economy of the Country. Therefore, there is the need to increase the local production of the refractory materials in order to reduce their importation and thereby boost the economy Nigeria. Hence this researched work was carried out to investigate and see if the Birnin Gwari and Maraban Rido clays in Kaduna state, Nigeria can serve as refractory materials. The clay samples were obtained from the mining sites and processed to produce fireclay brick test specimens which were fired between 250 oC and 1400 oC. The fired bricks were then tested for refractory properties such as: the linear shrinkage, bulk density, apparent porosity, cold crushing strength, thermal shock resistance and refractoriness (<b>Pyrometric</b> <b>Cone</b> Equivalent) using ASTM standards.

As a control group, each glaze base will be fired without added chemical colorants. These glazes are then fired to pyrometric equivalent cone 10 (2340 ˚F). <b>Pyrometric</b> <b>cones,</b> which measure heat (a function of temperature over time), are standard use in studio ceramics. Each glaze will be fired in three different kiln atmospheres: reduction, oxidation, and reduction with the addition of sodium carbonate, or soda ash (Na 2 CO 3). A natural gas fueled kiln will be in each case, with alterations made to fuel:air ratios to create reduction or oxidation atmospheres. A natural gas kiln will also be used in the firing implementing the soda ash, which will be introduced into the kiln at 2300 ˚F. The expected results include a variation of color and surface in the different kiln atmospheres. The reduction with soda ash atmosphere is expected to show the greatest variation in texture due to the addition of this vaporized chemical, which will unevenly coat the ceramic tiles in places and melt the glaze, adding areas of glossy surface and color variation. While the oxidation environment will show differences in color variation in comparison to the reduction atmosphere, especially within the glazes containing the addition of copper carbonate CuCO 3. Test results from each group will be displayed for visual and tactile inspection...|$|E
40|$|Pure Home Water (PHW) is a {{non-profit}} organization {{with the goal of}} providing safe drinking water through household water treatment and storage (HWTS) to the inhabitants of Ghana, particularly in the Northern Region. To this end, PHW has pursued the distribution and training {{in the use of the}} Kosim ceramic pot filter (CPF), and now wishes to pursue its manufacture. Laboratory studies have found the CPF to be between 97. 8 and 100 % efficient in the removal of E. coil bacteria. One of the main reasons for a household's discontinued use of the CPF is breakage. In a follow up monitoring of 1, 000 homes receiving CPFs after an emergency flood distribution in 2008, the rate of breakage was found to be 12 %. To address this critical problem, the author performed a three-point bending test on rectangular-prism clay samples with varying recipes and thicknesses in an attempt to determine bending strengths associated with the recipes with the aim of moderating the lip failure due to the possible failure mechanism of bending stress. Filter recipes were assigned numbers 1 through 14 based on combustible type, presence or absence of grog, combustible volume, and manufacturing process. The recipes which incorporated only fine, sieved combustible materials yielded the highest mean bending strengths. Statistically significant decreases in bending strength were realized with the increase of combustible mass. The inclusion of grog was generally found to have no statistically significant impact on the bending strength. Experimentally observed gains in bending strength with increased thickness supported theoretical strength gains with the square of the thickness. The variable of firing condition was found to be a significant but unquantifiable variable in the bending strength of the samples. In all cases, the lower bound of a 95 % confidence interval of the mean bending strength of the materials was found to exceed the expected bending stress on the filter lip due to predicted loading conditions. It is recommended that PHW pursue the manufacture of a fine-and-waste rice husk recipe with a 3 : 8 combustible-to-clay ratio without the inclusion of grog. It is recommended that the lip of the filter be thickened to 25 mm. It is recommended that <b>pyrometric</b> <b>cones</b> be placed in the spy-hole and door of the kiln during each firing and monitored once an hour until the guide cone bends, and once every fifteen minutes thereafter until the firing cone bends, at which time firing should cease.

40|$|AbstractFerrochrome slag {{is a waste}} {{material}} obtained from the manufacturing of high carbon ferrochromium alloy. This slag {{is formed as a}} liquid at 1700 °C and its main components are SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and MgO. Additionally it consists of chrome, ferrous/ferric oxides and CaO. Present work outlines a novel approach in formulating castables with this industrial waste. Samples with decreasing cement content 15 – 05 wt. % were formulated in combination of both slag and calcined bauxite as matrix components. Effects of varying 0 – 10 wt. % microsilica as a micro-fine additive in these castables were investigated in this work. Pore filling properties of microsilica improved apparent porosity and bulk density. Phase analysis through X-ray diffraction techniques demonstrates successful formation of spinel and mullite crystalline phases. Mechanical behavior was evaluated through cold crushing strength and residual cold crushing strength after five consecutive water quenching cycles. Scanning electron microscopy measurements were carried out in order to better understand the packing density and reaction mechanisms of fired castables.

Neste trabalho, a borra de alumÃnio foi submetida a tratamento tÃrmico seguido de moagem e classificaÃÃo por peneiramento. Para melhorar as propriedades mecÃnicas das peÃas obtidas a partir da borra de alumÃnio, foram formuladas duas misturas com adiÃÃo de partÃculas de reforÃo inorgÃnicas eletrofundidas. Neste caso, a mulita do tipo TP- 325, com porcentagens variando entre 5 e 35 % e a outra com alumina do tipo AL-L 280 variando entre 20 e 30 % em peso, sendo comparadas com a borra pura (matriz cerÃmica). O resÃduo e as cargas inorgÃnicas foram caracterizados por fluorescÃncia de raios x difraÃÃo de raios x e anÃlise termogravimÃtrica. As misturas dos pÃs foram submetidas a prensagem uniaxial, utilizando uma pressÃo de compactaÃÃo de 30 MPa num molde em forma de barra e estas foram sinterizadas a 1400 ÂC com uma taxa de aquecimento de 5 ÂC/min, permanecendo nesta temperatura durante 2 horas.

ABSTRACT White dross is a reject {{generated}} during aluminium production. It contains several oxides {{that can}} be useful to the refractories and cement industries. However, white dross can be hazardous both to {{human health and the}} environment. In this work, white dross was evaluated as a prospective raw material for the production of refractories. For this purpose, the dross was subjected to calcination followed by comminution and classification. In order to improve the mechanical properties of the refractory, two different kinds of electrofused particles were used separately as reinforcement: mullite and alumina. Particles of the TP- 325 mullite were added to the white dross powder in proportions varying from 5 to 35 % weight. The AL-L 280 alumina particles were added to another batch of refractories, in two different amounts (20 and 30 % wt.). All materials were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. Mixtures of residual powder and particles were compression molded as prismatic bars under a pressure of 30 MPa. Pressed bars were sintered in air at 1400 ÂC for 2 h, and the heating rate was 5 ÂC/min. Mechanical and physical properties of the sintered parts were determined by means of linear shrinkage, water absorption, apparent porosity, density, MOR (three-point bending) and SEM analysis. The results obtained in this work indicate that the mixtures of white dross and 15 % mullite allowed for a better compaction and density, producing parts with higher mechanical strength than the mixtures with alumina. <b>Pyrometric</b> <b>cone</b> tests at 1400 ÂC show the refractoriness of the parts up to that temperature. Therefore, under the conditions of this research work, white dross with additions of mullite particles {{has proven to be a}} prospective candidate for the production of refractory parts...|$|R
