50|$|Deep Bay, {{located at}} the south end of the lake and {{measuring}} about 13 km (8 mi) wide and 220 m (720 ft) deep, is the site of a large meteorite impact dating about 140 million years ago. According to local legend, it is also the location of a monster which <b>pulls</b> <b>animals</b> through the ice in winter.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of training to approach or avoid novel animals on fear-related responses in children. Ninety-five primary school children (9 - 13 years old) were instructed to repeatedly push away or pull closer pictures of novel animals. We tested whether this manipulation would lead to changes in self-reported attitudes, implicit attitudes, fear beliefs, and avoidance behaviors towards these animals. The training produced more positive self-reported attitudes towards the <b>pulled</b> <b>animal</b> and more negative attitudes towards the pushed animal. After the training, girls reported more fear and avoidance of the pushed animal than of the <b>pulled</b> <b>animal,</b> while such training effects were absent in boys. No significant training effects were observed on implicit attitudes. Interestingly, the level of anxiety disorder symptoms prior to training was related to some of the training effects: Stronger prior fear was related to stronger changes in self-reported attitudes, and in boys, also to fear beliefs. The finding that a simple approach-avoidance training influences children's fear-related responses lends support to general theories of fear acquisition in children as well as to models that try to explain the intergenerational transmission of anxiety...|$|R
50|$|Wagons are {{immediately}} distinguished from carts (which have two wheels) and from lighter four-wheeled vehicles primarily for carrying people, such as carriages. Wagons are usually <b>pulled</b> by <b>animals</b> such as horses, mules or oxen. They may be <b>pulled</b> by one <b>animal</b> or by several, often in pairs or teams. However, there {{are examples of}} human-propelled wagons, such as mining corfs.|$|R
2500|$|Some of {{the items}} made by the company include vases, {{advertising}} ashtrays, pitchers, mugs, book ends, curtain shade <b>pulls,</b> <b>animal</b> figurines, cookie jars, salt and pepper shakers, sugars and creamers and tea pots. [...] In addition to glazed clay products, Dickota Badlands pieces were produced. [...] This process was brought to Dickota by Howard Lewis who learned the technique while working at Nilok. [...] It consisted of several colors of clay swirled together in one product. [...] ( [...] by Arley and Bonnie Olson) ...|$|R

5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred <b>pulling</b> <b>animal,</b> even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|R

5000|$|The idea {{of using}} [...] "tracked" [...] roads is at least 2000 years old; {{quarries}} in Ancient Greece, Malta and the Roman Empire used cut stone tracks to haul loads <b>pulled</b> by <b>animals,</b> as the Greek Diolkos did for transporting ships overland.|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessors}} of {{the flying}} vimanas of the Sanskrit epics are the flying chariots employed by various gods in the Vedas: the Sun (see Sun chariot) and Indra {{and several other}} Vedic deities are transported by flying wheeled chariots <b>pulled</b> by <b>animals,</b> usually horses.|$|R
50|$|The {{teacher at}} the local school {{encouraged}} Mónico to continue his studies and, without finishing the lower level of High School, he left for Madrid {{with the intention of}} studying electrical engineering. Madrid in 1901 {{was in the process of}} introducing both electric street-lighting and electrified trams, replacing those <b>pulled</b> by <b>animals.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{had to drop}} {{my camera}} to help Jones and Jim <b>pull</b> the <b>animal</b> from her perch. The {{branches}} broke in a shower; then the lioness, hissing, snarling, whirling, plunged down. She nearly jerked the rope out of our hands, but we lowered her to Emett, who noosed her hind paws in a flash.|$|R

They may draw carriages at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} {{locomotion}} used by Truncatella is unusual. Instead of gliding over a slime trail using minute waves in its foot, Truncatella uses {{a very large}} and muscular proboscis to reach ahead and grasp a surface, {{at which point the}} small foot releases its hold and the proboscis contracts to <b>pull</b> the <b>animal</b> forward, after which the entire procedure is usually repeated.|$|R
2500|$|The second pair of cephalic {{appendages}} in free-living copepods {{is usually}} the main time-averaged source of propulsion, beating like oars to <b>pull</b> the <b>animal</b> through the water. However, different groups have different modes of feeding and locomotion, ranging from almost immotile for several minutes (e.g. some harpacticoid copepods) to intermittent motion (e.g., some cyclopoid copepods) and continuous displacements with some escape reactions (e.g. most calanoid copepods.) ...|$|R
50|$|L. reevii is a filter-feeding {{invertebrate}} that burrows vertically {{in sandy}} sediment, leaving a three-hole siphonal {{opening at the}} surface. When disturbed, a rapid contraction of the pedicle <b>pulls</b> the <b>animal</b> below the surface and the siphonal openings are reduced to a slit. This species is capable of upward burrowing through a sediment layer, even if the animal has to autotomize (detach) the pedicle.|$|R
5000|$|Horseless {{carriage}} is a {{term for}} early automobiles; {{at the time it}} was common that carriages were <b>pulled</b> by <b>animals,</b> typically horses, but the automobiles were not. In 2010, the term was compared to other transitional terms, like cordless phone and wireless phone. These are cases in which a new technology is described by what it does not have, compared to an older technology.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Donald {{finds the}} fox and chases {{him into a}} burrow. Donald uses blasts from his hunting horn to blow the fox out of the hole. Finally, Donald {{believes}} he has cornered the fox in a hollow log. He calls all the other hunters who excitedly arrive at the scene. But when Donald <b>pulls</b> the <b>animal</b> out, he discovers it's nothing but a skunk. The hunters run away in terror.|$|R
2500|$|The {{hills of}} Lisbon have always {{presented}} {{a problem for}} travel between the lower streets of the main Baixa and the higher Largo do Carmo (Carmo Square)., In order to facilitate the movement between the two, the civil and military engineer Roberto Arménio presented a project to the Lisbon municipal council in 1874. A similar project was suggested in 1876, that included rail-lines that would be <b>pulled</b> by <b>animals</b> up an inclined plane.|$|R

50|$|A wagon (also {{alternatively}} and archaically spelt waggon in British and Commonwealth English) {{is a heavy}} four-wheeled vehicle <b>pulled</b> by draught <b>animals</b> or {{on occasion}} by humans (see below), used for transporting goods, commodities, agricultural materials, supplies and sometimes people.|$|R
50|$|Horse pulling is a {{draft horse}} {{competition}} where horses in harness, usually {{one or two}} <b>animals,</b> <b>pull</b> a stone-boat or weighted sled {{and the winner is}} the team or <b>animal</b> that can <b>pull</b> the most weight for a short distance.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{horizontal}} bar, attached or {{suspended in the}} middle, and able to hinge fore-and-aft in {{a horizontal}} plane. The traces (the straps by which the <b>animal</b> <b>pulls)</b> attach to its ends, and the vehicle is pulled from its middle.|$|R

50|$|Selecting one {{wild horse}} that is {{marked with a}} white streak on its face, the cowboy lassoes the horse and cinches the rope to a large stump, {{gradually}} <b>pulling</b> the <b>animal</b> closer to him. Once the wild horse gets used to his hands near the head, ears and neck, the cowboy ties a rope halter on its head. The {{next step is to}} introduce a loose halter, fitted without a bridle and bit and finally, a blanket and saddle on the half-broken steed.|$|R
25|$|Like most bivalves, mussels {{have a large}} organ {{called a}} foot. In {{freshwater}} mussels, the foot is large, muscular, and generally hatchet-shaped. It is used to <b>pull</b> the <b>animal</b> through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling {{the rest of the}} animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.|$|R
50|$|All nemerteans move slowly. Most nemerteans {{use their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and <b>pulling</b> the <b>animal</b> towards the object.|$|R
40|$|Soil crusting or capping is {{a serious}} problem in arid and {{semiarid}} regions; it restricts the emergence of crop seedlings. A mechanical, rolling soil crust breaker was designed, developed, and tested in the field. The equipment is of simple construction and breaks the soil crust over the rows of germinated seeds effectively, improving emergence significantly without any damage to seedlings. It can be manually operated as a single-row unit or a multiple row unit and can be <b>pulled</b> by <b>animal</b> draft power or a small tracto...|$|R
