40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to examine students’ perceived <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> lifelong learning; and to investigate the factor(s) that influence their <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> lifelong learning. The sample comprised of 234 students from UUM City Campus, who are currently pursuing their studies on a part-time basis. A model was developed to examine the relationships between the factors that are perceived to be associated with lifelong learning participation. Factor analysis and reliability test were carried out on items adapted from Education Participation Scale (EPS) by Boshier and Collins (1983). Five factors were identified that were perceived to influence students’ <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> lifelong learning namely,social contact, professional advancement, cognitive interest, external expectation and emotional relief. Regression analysis was performed {{to examine the relationship between}} the dependent and independent variables. The results showed that <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> lifelong learning was only associated with adult learners’ cognitive interest while other factors were not significantly associated with their <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> lifelong learning...|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} administration, Malang {{is divided into}} two regions, Malang City andMalang Regency. Although the regions are different, {{economically}} two regionscan not separated because almost all economic activities are concentrated atMalang City. This has impacts on the economic gap between Malang City andMalang Regency. With respect to gap, the research was conducted to analyze thegrowth center of Regional Development Unit (RDU) of the Malang City, based ontwo development directions: identifying sectoral economic potentials and thatfor regional sowol potentials. In terms of regional aspects, the description of development centers in each RDUare: (1) Ngantang Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the development center of RDU I;(2) Singosari Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the development center of northernRDU II; (3) Pakisaji Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the development center ofsouthern RDU II; (4) Poncokusumo Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the developmentcenter of RDU IV; (5) Kepanjen Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the developmentcenter of RDU V; (6) Pagelaran Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the developmentcenter of RDU VII; and (7) Turen Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the developmentcenter of RDU VIII. Since the results has policy impacts, the government of the Malang Regencyshould decide regional development policies referring to the regionaldevelopment concept based on the economic and regional potentials so that itcan give priorities to potential districts to be acted as development centers. Byimplementing the policy, it is expected that economic activities will not beconcentrated on one development point, the Malang City as the only developmentpoint...|$|R
30|$|At present, our {{algorithm}} is designed {{in such a}} way that all kinds of traffic are admitted with equal priority. In contrast to best-effort traffic, real-time flows have stringent QoS requirements; hence, we require the admission controller to prioritize the real-time traffic ahead of the best-effort traffic, if both flows arrive at the same time. In other words, a priority should be assigned for each kind of traffic (<b>for,</b> e.g., high <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> real-time traffic and low <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> best-effort traffic). For future work, we plan to extend the proposed algorithm by incorporating QoS prioritization. For example,real-time traffic has stringent QoS requirements when compared to best-effort traffic and therefore, the admission control algorithm should assign higher <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> real-time flows and lower <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> best-effort traffic.|$|R

Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals. The third would report on the expansion of psychiatric social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008 general election, Gibbs faced Republican Don Ytterberg, {{whom he had}} outraised roughly $80,000 to $50,000 by mid-October. Gibbs cited his {{track record}} of passing {{legislation}} and his connections and experience {{at the state capitol}} as part of his case for re-election, and named wildfire and business concerns as his major <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> a continued term in the Colorado Senate. He also called for reducing business personal property taxes and growing local small businesses. Gibbs' re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, the Summit Daily News, and the Boulder Daily Camera, the Arvada Press, and the Golden Transcript. Gibbs raised over $100,000 during his campaign to Ytterberg's $60,000, and ultimately won re-election with about 59 percent of the vote, taking three-quarters of votes cast in Summit County, but losing narrowly to Ytterberg in suburban Jefferson County.|$|E

Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to discuss the {{problems}} concerning the right of <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> re-employment in connection to employing temporary agency workers. This will {{be done with the}} help of relevant laws, preparatory work and literature that fall within the scope of the legal dogmatic method. Using temporary personnel is becoming considerably more common throughout the Swedish workplace. In recent years there has been a rapid growth of work agencies and a tendency to employ temporary personnel. At the same time employees are made redundant, suffering the consequences that arise from the workplace failing to abide by the rules of re-employment. In order to claim that the employer has failed to follow the right of <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> re-employment, evidence must be sufficient. It must also show that the employers’ actions were unfit in relation to the circumstance. It is difficult to identify whether the employer has failed to follow the right of <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> re-employment. The aim, measures and actions of the right of <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> re-employment must be reassessed in order to apply the law effectively. Unfortunately, in comparison to the labor management rights act, the right of <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> re-employment is easily bypassed...|$|R

5|$|Groves {{instituted a}} series of reforms. He {{installed}} phone lines for the Supervising Construction Quartermasters, demanded weekly reports on progress, ordered that reimbursement vouchers be processed within a week, and sent expediters to sites reporting shortages. He ordered his contractors to hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if necessary to guarantee quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order the contractors saw fit, Groves laid down <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, {{the worst of the}} crisis was over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential accommodations and facilities for two million men were 95 per cent complete. Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division let contracts worth $1,676,293,000 ($ with inflation), of which $1,347,991,000 ($ with inflation), or about 80 per cent, were fixed-fee contracts.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004, Tony Blair {{announced}} he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year. Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; {{he was the only}} candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds {{in the war on terror}} as key priorities.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression {{threatened}} the already tentative nature of Georgia Tech's funding. In {{a speech on}} April 27, 1930, Brittain proposed that the university system be reorganized under a central body, rather than having each university under its own board. As a result, the Georgia General Assembly and Governor Richard Russell, Jr. passed an act in 1931 that established the University System of Georgia and the corresponding Georgia Board of Regents; unfortunately for Brittain and Georgia Tech, the board was composed almost entirely of graduates of the University of Georgia. In its final act on January 7, 1932, the Tech Board of Trustees {{sent a letter to}} the chairman of the Georgia Board of Regents outlining its <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> the school. The Depression also affected enrollment, which dropped from 3,271 in 1931–1932 to a low of 2,482 in 1933–1934, and only gradually increased afterwards. It also caused a decrease in funding from the State of Georgia, which in turn caused a decrease in faculty salaries, firing of graduate student assistants, and a postponing of building renovations.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E
