Plate 1 : Geology of the La Prosperidad Area (in <b>pocket)</b> <b>Plate</b> 2 : Geology of the La Prosperidad Deposit (in <b>pocket)</b> <b>Plate</b> 3 : Columnar Sections of the La Prosperidad Deposit (in <b>pocket)</b> <b>Plate</b> 4 : Magnetic Contour Map and Locations Grid of the La Prosperidad Deposit (in pocket) The La Prosperidad banded {{ferromanganese}} deposit, {{in central}} Baja California Norte, Mexico, is enclosed by Mesozoic marine arc volcanic-sedimentary rocks. A dome-like dacite porphyry footwall and a hanging wall of interbedded tuffs, tuffaceous shales and rhyodacite flows are contemporaneous with the deposit. Detailed geologic mapping indicates these rocks were deposited {{in a highly}} restricted marine or lacustrian basin which formed following the emplacement of a large rhyolite ash flow. The deposit occurs as a steep dipping 3 m thick, by 360 m long outcrop of thin and rhythmic laminated Fe and Mn oxides. Subaqueous chemical precipitation {{is suggested by the}} high continuity of these strikingly distinct lamelli. The deposit's trace element enrichments (Sb, As, W[?], Zn ?? Ge, Co, Ba, Mo, V, Sr, Cu, Nb, Be) match those of present day Mn hot spring aprons and ancient syngenetic Mn deposits associated with silicic volcanism. Metal distribution within the deposit indicates adsorbtion on Mn and Fe oxides was an important mechanism of precipitation in a depositional basin that physiochemically was essentially homogeneous. This mode of precipitation was interrupted once by the rapid emplacement of an ash-rich unit and numerous times when hot spring activity decreased and thin travertine layers precipitated. Diagenesis and upper greenschist facies metamorphism caused complete recrystallization; however, their large scale effects on ore textures and compositions were minimal. More significant redistributions were produced by hydrothermal overprinting and supergene alteration. The La Prosperidad deposit belongs to the meta-volcanic mineral province of Baja California. However, the province is better characterized by deposits of Fe and Cu, formed mainly by contact metasomatic processes. Although {{it is possible that the}} La Prosperidad deposit was partially derived from surfacing Mn-rich residual solutions produced by the formation of a contact metasomatic Fe deposit at depth, most, if not all, of the Fe-Mn oxides probably were leached directly from the volcanic rocks underlying the La Prosperidad deposit by heated connate water and/or ground water...|$|E

Plate 1 : Geologic Map and Structure Section of North Island (back <b>pocket)</b> <b>Plate</b> 2 : Geologic Map and Structure Section of Middle Island (back <b>pocket)</b> <b>Plate</b> 3 : Geologic Map and Structure Section of South Island (back pocket) The Coronado Islands {{are four}} tilted fault blocks {{located on a}} shallow {{submarine}} shelf 25 km southwest of San Diego, California. The islands lie en echelon to one another along a north-northwest trend. 	North Island lies 7 km northwest of South Island and is the westernmost island of the group. North Island is 1. 5 km long and is composed of 200 +m of red sandstone and shale that dips west 20 to 30 ??. Since clasts of the Eocene Poway Suite (found as reworked clasts in all post-Eocene rocks of the region) were not located on North Island, a pre-Eocene age is likely. North Island rocks are a probable westward equivalent of the Upper Cretaceous nonmarine Lusardi Formation redbeds of the nearby Mainland. 	Middle Island and Middle Rock, located lkm west of South Island, are the smallest yet most structurally complex of the Coronados. Twelve tilted fault blocks of varying attitudes dominate {{the structure of the}} island. The whole of Middle Rock and the western margin of Middle Island are composed of nonmarine red sandstone and conglomerate. Unlike the North Island rocks, these beds contain reworked Poway Suite cobbles and Catalina Schist debris. The remainder of Middle Island contains beds of marine sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. An islet east of Middle Island is composed entirely of volcaniclastic breccia. A probable Miocene age is assigned the strata of Middle Island and Middle Rock on the basis of (1) the presence of Catalina Schist clasts, and (2) the lithologic similarity of some beds to known middle Miocene rocks of South Island. 	South Island, the largest of the Coronados, is 3. 5 km long. Three main structural blocks of west-dipping strata comprise the island. The north and south blocks together contain over 250 m of conglomerate and sandstone of the San Onofre Breccia facies. These beds contain various clasts of Catalina Schist and yield Foraminifera of middle Miocene age. The middle downdropped block is made up of conglomeratic sandstone, volcaniclastic breccia, siltstone, and sandstone of middle Miocene age. Sedimentary structures in San Onofre-type rocks of the island indicate north-northeast current-slope directions at the time of deposition. 	Miocene rocks of Middle Rock, Middle Island, and South Island were derived from the west. In middle Miocene time uplift west of the Coronados exposed Cretaceous and Early Tertiary sediments as well as the Catalina Schist complex. The rocks of these southern three islands were laid down as part of a sedimentary fan that prograded eastward in a subaerial, then submarine environment...|$|E

40|$|In this work, a new Bullet Guiding <b>Pocket</b> Armor <b>Plate</b> (BGPAP) was developed, with {{a target}} to {{maximize}} the ballistic protection by containing the bullet between the layers. To this end, experimental and numerical programs have been carried out. Accordingly, the study has been divided into three phases concerning the problem solution to improve the energy absorption capability of the body armor plate without complete penetration. In phase-I, the effects of material stacking sequence and geometrical configuration on the ballistic behavior of hybrid and non-hybrid body armor plates were studied. Three different materials have been used, carbon fiber, Kevlar and date palm fiber. In phase-II, the effect of conical angles on the quasi-static crushing behavior of bullet guiding pockets was studied, in which five conical angles were tested, ranged between 35 ° and 55 ° with an increment of 5 °. Two filament materials have been employed to fabricate the specimens. These are carbon fiber and Kevlar. The findings of the preceding phases were used as input for phase III, in which the new Bullet Guiding <b>Pocket</b> Armor <b>Plate</b> (BGPAP) has been developed. Finite Element software package, namely ANSYS/LS-DYNA {{has been used to}} simulate the ballistic behavior of tested body armors. Material stacking sequence has affected significantly the energy dissipation mechanism, energy absorption capability of hybrid composite body armor. Body armor with [CFRP 10 /KFRP 30] material sequence displayed the highest energy absorption capability and passed the ballistic real shooting test. On the other hand, body armors with [CFRP 4 /KFRP 6] 4 had displayed poor energy dissipation mechanism and didn’t pass the ballistic real shooting. Incorporating the untreated date palm natural fiber composites in the material sequence of body armor displayed promising ballistic behavior, although didn’t pass all the three-trial real shooting test. Introducing bullet guiding pockets in the design of body armors has a significantly effect on their sliding crush behavior. Similar sliding crush behavior trends have been observed for both CFRP and KFRP bullet guiding pockets have been found similar. Designing the bullet guiding pockets within the CFRP layers displayed the highest energy absorption capability compared with KFRP layers. Bullet guiding pocket conical angles has been optimized, and specimens with 50 ° had the highest specific energy absorption capability in both CFRP and KFRP. The newly developed BGPAP showed an excellent ballistic performance against 9 mm bullet with BFS 19. 6 mm. The newly developed BGPAP showed 16 % reduction in weight compared to the hybrid [CFRP 10 /KFRP 30] armor plate.

40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological Sciences. Plate 1 : Geologic Map of the Apache Mines Area, Baja California, Mexico (back <b>pocket)</b> <b>Plate</b> 2 : Map of the Mineralized Area and Excavations (back pocket) The Apache Mines sulfur-sulfate {{deposits}} lie {{near the}} Gulf coast of Baja California, about 35 km south of San Felipe. The deposits were formed by now extinct fumaroles. This {{is a study}} of near surface hydrothermal wall rock alteration. Granitic rocks (biotite, tonalite, and granodiorite), metamorphic rocks (schist, quartzite, and marble), andesitic volcanic rocks and fluvial sandstones make up the country rock. Block faults {{in the study area}} provided passage for hydrothermal fluids. All but the volcanic rocks were altered by these fluids. The rising sulfurous hydrothermal fluids became oxidized near the surface, depositing native sulfur and forming sulfuric acid and solfataric conditions. Downward percolating sulfuric acid leached large cavities near the surface and hydrogen metasomatism altered the adjacent country rock. Primary alteration produced expandable clays by altering plagioclase. Further hydrothermal attack produced kaolinite and natroalunite and finally anhydrite and gypsum. When biotite was present in the country rock, jarosite was produced instead of natroalunite. The silica released from the sulfate replacement formed hydrothermal opal. The most extreme alteration left only a porous opaline residue. The most probable origin of these deposits is a small pluton at depth. Volatiles left in the crystalizing magma chamber would have mixed with meteoric water and the hot, low-density fluids would have risen towards the surface along the fractures in the country rock. The possibility of a major economic sulfide deposit at depth is unlikely. Pyrite was found at depth, but trace element analyses indicate there are no base-metals such as Ag, Pb, or Zn. There were no Hg or As anomalies, although they are commonly associated with hot spring deposits. A copper anomaly suggests there might be some porphyry copper, but it would probably be at a depth of at least 1, 000 m. Native sulfur crystals, which are sold for museum specimens, are the best economic possibility in these deposits. Other possibilities include silica for use in the manufacturing of glass and sulfates for use as soil conditioners...|$|E
40|$|For the {{increasing}} amount of variable load generated by {{wind and solar}} energy a daily stationary storage system is inevitable. To date no storage system meets all performance parameters necessary in being low-cost, sustain high efficiencies, preserve low self-discharge {{on a daily basis}} and have a maintenance free long cycle lifetime. Iron-based electrodes of an electrochemical cell suffer from a parasitic side- reaction of hydrogen evolution at the Fe(0 /II) redox reaction and the irreversibility of oxidized iron species during charge. In addition, the presence of dissolved intermediates, also at the Fe(0 /II) redox reaction, causes the surface to passivate resulting in low current densities possible. Research by Manohar et al. and by E STONE Batteries indicate that commercial CHANGHONG NiFe cells already show a coulombic efficiency of 96 % at C/ 6 due to the use of a <b>pocket</b> <b>plate</b> design but also causes a poor overall energy efficiency of 55 % and the coulombic efficiencies to diminish to near zero values at higher C-rates. An extensive literature study shows that several research groups have reported enhanced coulombic efficiencies at higher C-rates by the use of additives, mostly sulfur-containing species, but for relatively short cycle lifetimes. Sulfur containing species added to the electrolyte are shown by Manohar et al. and by this thesis to effectively increase the coulombic efficiency of iron-based electrodes but is found to diminish over subsequent cycles, presumably by the oxidation of the anionic sulfur species to sulfate at the nickel-based counter-electrode. Only Manohar et al. has been able to preserve the beneficial effect of sulfur containing species on the performance of low-cost polymer pasted iron-based electrodes for 1200 cycles by using sulfur containing metals in the form of iron(II) sulfide as additive. Despite the effort, achieving near 100 % coulombic efficiencies for 150 cycles by only cycling on the Fe(II/III) redox reaction as van Dijk reported in 2012 has not been met. As a result of this thesis by cycling on the Fe(0 /II) and Fe(II/III) redox reaction an increase in discharge capacity up to 396. 4 mAh/g FeS and coulombic efficiency of 92 % has been achieved at C/ 6 rate for FeS-based electrodes in comparison to the results reported by Shangguan et al [...] This polymer pasted electrode also shows an increase in the overall energy efficiency up to 76. 6 % in comparison to commercial pocket plated cells but still has poor coulombic efficiencies at 1 C rate. Although the energy storage system performance parameters have not been met for the NiFeS battery, the advances made in performance and understanding the technology show sufficient grounds to further study this type of electrochemistry...|$|E

Objective The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the prevalence of isolated Candida albicans from periodontal endodontic lesions in diabetic and normoglycemic patients, and the fungi's virulence in different atmospheric conditions. Material and Methods A case-control study was conducted on 15 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (G 1) and 15 non-diabetics (G 2) with periodontal endodontic lesions. Samples of root canals and periodontal <b>pockets</b> were <b>plated</b> on CHROMagar for later identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virulence test. Results C. albicans was identified in 79. 2 % and 20. 8 % of the 60 samples collected from diabetic and normoglycemic patients, respectively. Of the 30 samples collected from periodontal pockets, 13 showed a positive culture for C. albicans, with 77 % belonging to G 1 and 23 % to G 2. Of the 11 positive samples from root canals, 82 % were from G 1 and 18 % from G 2. Production of proteinase presented a precipitation zone Pz< 0. 63 of 100 % in G 1 and 72 % in G 2, in redox and negative (Pz= 1), under anaerobic conditions in both groups. Hydrophobicity of the strains from G 1 indicated 16. 4 % with low, 19. 3 % with moderate, and 64. 3 % with high hydrophobicity in redox. In G 2, 42. 2 % had low, 39. 8 % had moderate, 18 % had high hydrophobicity in redox. In anaerobic conditions, G 1 showed 15. 2 % with low, 12. 8 % with moderate, and 72 % with high hydrophobicity; in G 2, 33. 6 % had low, 28. 8 % had moderate, and 37. 6 % had high hydrophobicity. There was statistical difference in the number of positive cultures between G 1 and G 2 (p< 0. 05) with predominance in G 1.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in fluorescent ligand technology have enabled {{the study of}} G protein-coupled receptors in their native environment {{without the need for}} genetic modification such as addition of N-terminal fluorescent or bioluminescent tags. Here, we have used a non-imaging plate reader (PHERAstar FS) to monitor the binding of fluorescent ligands to the human adenosine-A 3 receptor (A 3 AR; CA 200645 and AV 039), stably expressed in CHO-K 1 cells. To verify that this method was suitable for the study of other GPCRs, assays at the human adenosine-A 1 receptor, and β 1 and β 2 adrenoceptors (β 1 AR and β 2 AR; BODIPY-TMR-CGP- 12177) were also carried out. Affinity values determined for the binding of the fluorescent ligands CA 200645 and AV 039 to A 3 AR for a range of classical adenosine receptor antagonists were consistent with A 3 AR pharmacology and correlated well (R 2 = 0. 94) with equivalent data obtained using a confocal imaging plate reader (ImageXpress Ultra). The binding of BODIPY-TMR-CGP- 12177 to the β 1 AR was potently inhibited by low concentrations of the β 1 -selective antagonist CGP 20712 A (pKi 9. 68) but not by the β 2 -selective antagonist ICI 118551 (pKi 7. 40). Furthermore, in experiments conducted in CHO K 1 cells expressing the β 2 AR this affinity order was reversed with ICI 118551 showing the highest affinity (pKi 8. 73) and CGP 20712 A (pKi 5. 68) the lowest affinity. To determine whether the faster data acquisition of the non-imaging plate reader (~ 3 min per 96 -well plate) was suitable for high throughput screening (HTS), we screened the LOPAC library for inhibitors of the binding of CA 200645 to the A 3 AR. From the initial 1, 263 compounds evaluated, 67 hits (defined as those that inhibited the total binding of 25 nM CA 200645 by ≥ 40 %) were identified. All compounds within the library that had medium to high affinity for the A 3 AR (pKi ≥ 6) were successfully identified. We found three novel compounds in the library that displayed unexpected sub-micromolar affinity for the A 3 AR. These were K 114 (pKi 6. 43), retinoic acid p-hydroxyanilide (pKi 6. 13) and SU 6556 (pKi 6. 17). Molecular docking of these latter three LOPAC library members provided a plausible set of binding poses within the vicinity of the established orthosteric A 3 AR binding <b>pocket.</b> A <b>plate</b> reader based library screening using an untagged receptor is therefore possible using fluorescent ligand opening the possibility of its use in compound screening at natively expressed receptors...|$|R

Três variações da membrana absorvível derivada de osso bovino, provenientes do laboratório de Bioquímica da USP- Bauru foram testadas, a convencional (C), impregnada com cloridrato de tetraciclina (T) e impregnada com doxiciclina (D). Análises microbiológicas baseadas nos testes de sensibilidade in vitro a antimicrobianos foram feitas. Em placas com os meios de cultura apropriados foram semeadas bactérias aeróbias (Escherichia coli e Staphylococcus aureus), e um pool de bactérias anaeróbias proveniente de {{material}} coletado em bolsas periodontais. Cada placa foi dividida em quatro regiões e 3 amostras padronizadas das membranas depositadas, mantendo uma área sem amostra para confirmar o crescimento bacteriano. Utilizou-se a membrana convencional (C) para verificar se esta apresentava propriedades antimicrobianas e nas outras duas regiões foram colocadas as amostras de (D) e (T). Foram feitas três placas (1, 2 e 3) para cada grupo bacteriano, sendo os fragmentos de membrana convencional, doxiciclina e cloridrato de tetraciclina denominados (C 1 /D 1 /T 1; C 2 /D 2 /T 2; C 3 /D 3 /T 3) respectivamente. As placas de aeróbios foram incubadas em estufa a 35 °C e as de anaeróbios em jarra de anaerobiose. Análises semanais com a troca das amostras para novas placas foram feitas e a capacidade das membranas em inibir o crescimento bacteriano avaliada a partir da formação nas placas de halos de inibição ao redor de cada amostra, as quais tiveram seus diâmetros aferidos com paquímetro digital. A presença dos halos e a integridade das amostras determinaram o tempo do experimento.

Three variations of the resorbable membrane of bovine bone from the Biochemist laboratory of USPBauru were tested: conventional (C), tetracycline loaded (T) and doxycycline loaded (D). Microbiological analyses based in tests of in vitro sensibility to antimicrobials were made. Aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and a pool of nonaerobic bacteria were sown in plates with appropriate media cultures proceeding from the material collected into periodontal <b>pockets.</b> Each <b>plate</b> was divided in four regions and 3 standardized samples of the membranes were deposited, keeping an area without sample to confirm the bacterial growth. It was used a conventional membrane (C) to verify if it presented antimicrobial properties and in the other two regions it was placed (D) and (T) samples. Three plates (1, 2 and 3) were made for each bacterial group, being the doxycycline and tetracycline hydrochloride fragments called (C 1 /D 1 /T 1; C 2 /D 2 /T 2; C 3 /D 3 /T 3) respectively. The aerobic plates were kept into a greenhouse at 35 °C and the nonaerobic ones were kept into a specific anaerobic storage jar. Weekly analyses exchanging the fragments for new plates were made and the capacity of the membranes in inhibiting the evaluated bacterial growth from the formation of inhibition halos around of each sample, which had its diameters surveyed with a digital caliper. The halos presence and the integrity of the samples determined the time of the experiment. The results showed that in all plates of the three bacterial groups, where the samples of (C) were present, did not occur an inhibition of the bacterial growth, thus presenting no halo.
