25|$|At Clash of the Champions XXIX, Stars and Stripes {{were granted}} a final {{shot at the}} tag-team titles, but the challengers also {{had to put up}} he Patriot's mask on the line, if they lost he would unmask. After a {{controversial}} double pin finish Stars and Stripes were declared the winners and thus the champions putting the end to Pretty Wonderful's second and final run with the gold. After the loss Roma and Orndorff went their separate ways, wrestling in singles matches. Paul Roma was asked to help make WCW newcomer Alex Wright look good at SuperBrawl V. Roma dominated Wright for most of the match, yet Wright was able to score the upset win via pinfall {{at the end of the}} match. Roma would find himself in WCW management's doghouse for complaining about having to job to Alex Wright, <b>per</b> <b>Pro</b> Wrestling Torch. Roma continued appearing in WCW, teaming with Paul Orndorff two nights later in a losing effort against Dustin Rhodes & Johnny B Badd at a WCW Pro taping. He would lose multiple house show encounters with Alex Wright to close the month. His final match came in loss to Brian Pillman on WCW Saturday Night on March 8, 1995 (aired April 10). He was released as part of a WCW effort to lower their talent budget in March 1995, along with Dustin Rhodes and Barry Darsow.|$|E
