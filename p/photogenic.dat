5|$|A casting {{call was}} {{announced}} by Suresh Productions for {{the roles of}} Venkatesh's daughters in the film. They {{were looking for a}} girl aged 14–17 years {{to play the role of}} the elder daughter named Anjali, and another aged 8–12 years to play her younger sibling, Anu. Esther Anil was confirmed to reprise her role as the younger sister. Kruthika Jayakumar, a 17-year-old science student from Bangalore, was selected to play the role of elder sister in the film. This happened when a Malayalam filmmaker visited her dance performance in Thiruvananthapuram, and was struck by her expressions and <b>photogenic</b> features. He suggested that she pursue a career in the film industry. She referred to her character as a simple and vulnerable girl, who gets exploited. Her family is her world and she is particularly attached to her father. Kalabhavan Shajon was initially reported to reprise his role of a corrupt police officer from the original, but Ravi Kale was chosen instead.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} {{work on a}} boat might be <b>photogenic,</b> but, having no experience, {{could not get a}} job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E

25|$|Tarkovsky {{incorporated}} levitation scenes {{into several}} of his films, most notably Solaris. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their <b>photogenic</b> value and magical inexplicability. Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and <b>photogenic</b> value, {{as well as their}} symbolism, such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water. Bells and candles are also frequent symbols. These are symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, Rashumon {{was first}} launched. In 1990, AmigaDOS 2.0 was released. The {{interface}} of the Workbench GUI {{was changed to}} a fake 3D aspect using gray shades. For the first time, Commodore introduced a style guide for developers on AmigaOS; because of this, the majority of Amiga software developed for AmigaDOS 2.0 had a standardized GUI that improved usability. Programs such as Imagine 3D, Lightwave, ImageFX, and Scala continued using non-standard GUIs. AmigaVision was released and bundled free with any model of Amiga 3000.

It was a real partnership: both men brought their own strengths to the process, and images that survive demonstrate their aesthetic acumen {{as well as their}} journalistic desire to show the settings in which they worked. One image of an unveiled Ghawazee female dancer, signed on the negative by Hunt himself, is likely the earliest photographic portrait of a Middle Eastern woman.

25|$|Summaries of Jean's {{time as the}} Queen's {{representative}} emerged by mid-2010; Jean {{was regarded}} as having fulfilled the role in an admirable, though not perfect, fashion. It was noted that she used the office, her speaking abilities, and <b>photogenic</b> nature to Canada's advantage, promoting freedom, human rights, and urban youth, and to bring attention to socio-economic problems in the country's north. She was commended for her dedication to the arts, Aboriginal Canadians, the Armed Forces, and her outreach to Haiti following the earthquake there, but critiqued for specific incidents, such as referring to herself as Canada's head of state and making public comments that skirted the political. Her ability to personally connect with those she met was also noted, {{as well as her}} frequent displays of emotion; commentators dubbed her the empathizer-in-chief.|$|E

Spielberg chose to cast Wayne Knight after seeing his acting performance in Basic Instinct, saying, [...] "I waited for the credits to roll and wrote his name down".|$|E
500|$|In 1960, Nixon {{launched}} his first campaign for President of the United States. He faced little {{opposition in the}} Republican primaries and chose former Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. as his running mate. His Democratic opponent was John F. Kennedy, and the race remained close for the duration. Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the Eisenhower–Nixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U.S. in ballistic missiles (the [...] "missile gap"). A new political medium {{was introduced in the}} campaign: televised presidential debates. In the first of four such debates, Nixon appeared pale, with a five o'clock shadow, in contrast to the <b>photogenic</b> Kennedy. Nixon's performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television, though many people listening on the radio thought that Nixon had won. Nixon lost the election narrowly, with Kennedy ahead by only 112,827 votes (0.2percent) in the popular vote.|$|E
500|$|The couple's {{status as}} <b>photogenic,</b> {{articulate}} and professional {{was at first}} beneficial and protective. A white, middle-class family {{caught up in a}} nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could latch onto, writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from 10 Downing Street down. The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant Michael Cole called the [...] "monstering of the McCanns". They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone, in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges. Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.|$|E
500|$|Riegle did not {{continue}} his run, but Huber did. [...] In the ensuing primary contest, Romney's effort emphasized her gender, saying {{as a campaign}} theme, [...] "Never before has the voice and understanding of a concerned woman been more needed." [...] Billboards featuring her face were everywhere, captioned only as [...] "Lenore" [...] and omitting any reference to political party. [...] She was still <b>photogenic,</b> but so thin that she was sometimes described as [...] "frail" [...] or [...] "waiflike", and her husband sometimes worried about her weight. [...] She issued a half-hour campaign film that featured endorsements from many national and state party leaders {{as well as from}} celebrities Bob Hope and Art Linkletter, and showcased her family role and her concern for disadvantaged people. [...] Huber, in contrast, emphasized his edge in political experience, derided her [...] "motherly concern", and criticized the [...] "bossism" [...] that he said was trying to force another Romney into statewide office.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{the scale}} of the response, critics {{questioned}} the criteria against which patients were selected for evacuation. At first the UK was challenged over its decision to include only children in the transports while tens of thousands of adults remained wounded in the city. Sylvana Foa, spokesperson for the UNHCR, commented that Sarajevo should not be regarded as a [...] "supermarket" [...] of <b>photogenic</b> potential refugees, asking [...] "Does this mean Britain only wants to help children? Maybe it only wants children under six, or blond children, or blue-eyed children?" [...] Patrick Peillod, head of the United Nations medical evacuation committee, said that the UK had treated Bosnian children [...] "like animals in a zoo" [...] and was trying to pick and choose evacuees to suit a public relations agenda. When the government revised its approach and included adults on flights out of the city, claims were made that wounded combatants had been among those taken to the UK, Sweden, and Italy, and that patients had paid bribes {{to be included in the}} transports.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{ability to}} project his {{personality}} onto his characters {{played an important}} part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." [...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life." [...] William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a [...] "superb actor, a master of movie acting". In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean <b>photogenic</b> face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|After testing, the {{astronaut}} candidates {{had to wait}} 10 to 12 days for the results. Glenn had returned to his position at the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics when he {{received a call from}} the associate director of Project Mercury, Charles Donlan, offering him a position. The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. Glenn, wrote Tom Wolfe, [...] "came out of it as tops among seven very fair-haired boys. He had the hottest record as a pilot, he was the most quotable, the most <b>photogenic,</b> and the lone Marine." [...] The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: [...] "Well, I'm glad they got that out of the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardinale's {{first film}} work was participating, along with classmates, {{in a short}} film by French {{director}} René Vautier, Anneaux d'or, successfully presented at the Berlin Film Festival. The film made her a minor local celebrity, and led to her being spotted by Jacques Baratier, who offered her a minor role in Goha. She accepted it reluctantly after Baratier explained he wanted a Tunisian actress rather than an Italian to star in the main role opposite the Egyptian actor Omar Sharif. The appearance nonetheless marked her feature-film debut. The turning point came in 1957 during the Italian Cinema Week in Tunis, when she won a competition for the [...] "Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia", with {{a trip to the}} Venice Film Festival as first prize. After being spotted by several film producers at the event, she was invited to study at the Experimental Cinematography Center in Rome under Tina Lattanzi. She attended briefly as, despite her extremely <b>photogenic</b> looks, she had trouble with her acting assignments (partly owing to her difficulties with the Italian language). She left {{at the end of her}} first term and decided to return home, earning herself a cover story in the popular weekly Epoca triggered by her unexpected decision to turn her back on a career as a film star.|$|E

It however lost to Good Charlottes [...] "Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous" [...] in the Viewer's Choice category.

In 2014, The Guardian writer Michael Cragg included the clip for [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in his list of the ten best music videos by Beyoncé. He offered high praise for it, saying [...] "Aware of {{how much of a}} statement the song was, the video is a checklist of icon-making visuals, from the locations... the dance moves... to the part where she makes bubble blowing look like the sexiest thing a human could do." ...|$|E
