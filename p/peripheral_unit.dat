30|$|Reviewing {{the free}} text {{comments}} highlighted the concerns which some consultants have about centres of excellence causing {{a reduction in}} the skills in <b>peripheral</b> <b>units.</b> A more positive way of viewing centres of excellence would be as providing skills to treat the endometriosis which <b>peripheral</b> <b>units</b> may not feel confident in managing themselves. Additionally, they should offer back-up, support and most importantly advanced training to those wishing to specialise in the surgical treatment of advanced endometriosis and those working in other hospitals. The majority of other comments noted that advanced endometriosis is treated with varying efficacy across the country and encouraged the urgent establishment of a network of centres. With growing pressure from patients and their support groups there now appears to be a political will to develop such centres. This study has also demonstrated that there is also a professional will to do so. Provided that adequate funding is made available, the development of a network of centres for the management of advanced endometriosis has a promising future.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating timing of measurements and actuation in distributed sensor and control systems with central processing. The focus is on direct timing estimation for scenarios where clock synchronization is not feasible or desirable. Models of the timing and central and peripheral time stamps are motivated and derived from underlying clock and communication delay definitions and models. Heuristics for constructing a system time is presented and it is outlined how the joint timing and the plant state estimation can be handled. For a simple set of underlying clock and communication delay models, inclusion of <b>peripheral</b> <b>unit</b> time stamps is shown to reduce jitter, and {{it is argued that}} in general it will give significant jitter reduction. Finally, a numerical example is given of a contemporary system design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} design-ing a generic framework for distributed coordination and control in multiagent systems. Communication between agents increase their effectiveness, which is why this {{is the cornerstone of}} the software framework. Generic aspects are secured by making all layers of the software framework exchangeable, which secures compatibility with different wireless topologies, protocols and applications. A protocol for multiagent systems and an application regarding dis-tributed household cleaning is designed. The parts of the design concerning task assignment and <b>peripheral</b> <b>units</b> is implemented on the designed software framework. The results show {{that it is possible to}} implement applications on the designed software framework. The designed task assignment algorithm is able to distribute tasks between multiple agents in a hierarchical manner by means of the protocol. Furthermore it is possible to interact with <b>peripheral</b> <b>units</b> in the form of a Ubisense localisation system and an automated door from Besam. The tests of the protocol show that optimizations regarding collision avoidance are needed in order to make the protocol usable. The designed algorithm for cooperative completion of tasks is verified by means of UPPAAL. From this it is concluded that all states of the algorithm are reachable and it contains no deadlocks.

40|$|A novel {{architecture}} is proposed, suitable for high-speed digital processing of LANDSAT and other pictures. The machine comprises a collection (20 to 100) of small active units, perhaps microprocessors, {{each of them}} performing a task on a subimage.

This is a memory that contains addresses of tasks ready to be done, as well as destinations {{of the results of}} finished computations. The name 2 ̆ 2 heterarchy 2 ̆ 2 is used because there is no hierarchy of processors (active units). The machine exhibits some form of graceful degradation, and is incrementally expandible.

40|$|A new {{bidirectional}} telemetry {{system for}} amperometric sensor applications has been developed. A fully automated <b>peripheral</b> <b>unit</b> (PU), constituted by a potentiostat, a two-channel I/V converter, a microcontroller unit (MCU) and a signal transmitter, was designed, constructed, and tested. A peripheral interface controller (PIC) MCU drives a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which polarized the sensor, while the resulting anodic current {{is converted to}} a digital value by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The PIC firmware is developed in assembly and transferred to the MCU through a bootloader algorithm. The digital data are sent to a personal computer using a 4 -byte packet protocol {{by means of a}} miniaturized 433 MHz frequency modulation (FM) transceiver with a linear range up to 200 m. The central unit (CU) is connected to a PC via Universal Serial Bus (USB).

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the value of hemodynamic measurements taken intraoperatively in predicting midterm patency of coronary bypass grafts. METHODS: A pulsed Doppler flowmeter was routinely used during operation to determine the hemodynamic parameters of coronary bypass grafts. During a 7 -year period, 85 patients underwent angiographic evaluation. As a result, a thorough hemodynamic assessment of 214 grafts (89 arterial and 125 venous) at initial operation was available for analysis. RESULTS: The overall patency rate was 88. 3 %. The mean flow measured intraoperatively in 168 intact grafts was 60 +/- 3 mL/min (range, 9 to 230 mL/min), and the resistance was 1. 8 +/- 0. 1 <b>peripheral</b> resistance <b>units</b> (range, 0. 3 to 9. 0 <b>peripheral</b> resistance <b>units).</b> The mean flow was 36 +/- 5 mL/min (range, 2 to 107 mL/min), and the resistance was 5. 9 +/- 2. 0 <b>peripheral</b> resistance <b>units</b> (range, 0. 6 to 46. 0 <b>peripheral</b> resistance <b>units)</b> in 25 grafts found occluded at angiographic evaluation. Multivariate analysis identified three independent variables associated with a reduced patency rate: increased resistance as measured in the graft (p = 0. 012), increasing interval of control angiography (p = 0. 006), and preoperative cardiogenic shock (p = 0. 040).

40|$|The "Campania Salute" (CS) is {{a network}} system aimed at {{improving}} the management of essential hypertension by integrating the activity of general practitioners (GPs) {{with that of the}} hypertension specialists. It involves 23 outpatient hypertensive clinics distributed in different community hospitals of the Napoli's metropolitan area, 60 randomly selected GPs homogeneously distributed in the same area, and the Hypertension Clinic of the Federico II University in Naples (co-ordinating centre).
