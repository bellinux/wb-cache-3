Those colonies are located at {{the north and south}} of the Northwestern Pacific’s Kuroshio-Oyashio transition area where high seasonal temperature changes are observed, and where, consequently, birds may show comparable responses to such changes. Our results showed that streaked shearwaters from both colonies shifted their <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> northwards as the season progressed. The seasonal shift of <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> appeared to coincide with the movement pattern of pelagic fishes that migrate northward in association with the increase in water temperature.

Our results also indicated sex-related differences in this general pattern: females showed clear seasonal changes in <b>foraging</b> <b>area,</b> while males did not. During the pre-laying period males returned to the colony frequently to defend their nests or mates, and spent less time at sea.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study on}} the foraging ecology of the wood ant Formica rufa Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) at Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire over the period January 1994 to June 1996. Detailed observations were made on the foraging behaviour during this period and the food supply of two colonies was experimentally altered by food supplementation and food denial through grease-banding of trees within a 50 m by 50 m area centred on the nest. The <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> of F. rufa colonies were determined by observing trails to trees and showed seasonal variation. The size of the <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> their tree composition, the mean distance travelled by foragers {{and the extent to which}} particular trees were repeatedly foraged were monitored. There was stability in <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> between years due to colony persistence. Food supplementation did not alter the <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> of the nest. There was some evidence that the extra resources were channelled into producing more sexuals. Food denial caused the denied nest to expand its <b>foraging</b> <b>area.</b> The amount of honeydew collected by F. rufa was experimentally determined. The amount of prey taken was estimated from a survey of the literature. The proportion of net primary productivity moved by a F. rufa colony across its <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> was estimated as 0. 12 % to 0. 47 %. The effects of the distribution of F. rufa on other ground living invertebrates was experimentally investigated.

Coastal {{ecosystems}} are under intense pressure from anthropogenic and environmental factors in California. Human development, pollution and climate change continue to degrade coastal habitats. Marine predators such as marine mammals that depend on nearshore ecosystems are at risk from these anthropogenic and environmental factors. The Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) {{is one of the}} most common marine mammals along the coast of northern California and likely to be heavily impacted by changes in the coastal environment, yet little is known about their foraging behavior or habitat use. To accurately predict the response of local marine predators to changes in the coastal environment an understanding of their foraging behavior is required. This study aimed to develop baseline data on the foraging habitat and foraging behavior of the Pacific harbor seal in northern California.
