50|$|The hyperSPARC was a multi-chip design. It was {{packaged}} in a ceramic multi-chip module (MCM) with a <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA).</b>|$|E
50|$|The MCM has 387 pins, {{of which}} {{approximately}} half {{are arranged in}} a <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA)</b> and half in an interstitial pin grid array (IPGA). The packaging was designed for Socket 8.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array,</b> often {{abbreviated}} <b>PGA,</b> {{is a type}} {{of integrated}} circuit packaging. In a PGA, the package is square or rectangular, and the pins are arranged in a regular array {{on the underside of the}} package. The pins are commonly spaced 2.54 mm (0.1") apart, and may or may not cover the entire underside of the package.|$|R
40|$|A bus based {{parallel}} architectures is practical {{only for}} {{a small number of}} processors. For several thousand processors the bus would need to have a width of tens of thousands, or possibly a few hundred thousand wires (bits). Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} provide complete interconnectivity for highly parallel systems. For N = 10, 000, 100, 000, 000 channels would be required. Not only is the total number of channels unrealistic, but so is also the number of channels per node. One of the major constraints in system design is the packaging. The number of connections between a chip and a printed circuit (PC) board, or between a PC board and a backplane, or between backplanes, are limited by ensuring a sufficient mechanical strength of the connectors, enforcing a minimum width of each connector. <b>Pin</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays</b> (<b>PGA)</b> offer 200 – 400 pins per chip package, while current state-of-the art so-called Land <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays</b> (LGA) offers up to 2, 000 connectors with spacings at about 1 mm, requiring an area of close to 2, 500 mm 2. Board connectors may offer about 2 – 3 pins per mm, or about 1, 000 for a standard PC board. Thus, all highly parallel systems use some form of sparse network to interconnect the processors and memory modules. Locality of reference is important for performance at all levels in most systems.

It was an upgrade to Intel's first standard <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA)</b> socket and the first with an official designation. Socket 1 was intended as a 486 upgrade socket, and added one extra pin to prevent upgrade chips from being inserted incorrectly.|$|E
50|$|LGA {{is used as}} a {{physical}} interface for microprocessors of the Intel Pentium 4 (Prescott), Intel Xeon, Intel Core 2, Intel Core (Bloomfield and Lynnfield) and AMD Opteron, Threadripper and Epyc families. Unlike the <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA)</b> interface found on most AMD and older Intel processors, there are no pins on the chip; in place of the pins are pads of bare gold-plated copper that touch protruding pins on the microprocessor's connector on the motherboard.|$|E
50|$|The SPARC64 {{consisted}} of 21.9 million transistors. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-55 process, a 0.40 µm, four-layer metal complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor (CMOS) process. The seven dies are packaged in a rectangular ceramic multi-chip module (MCM), {{connected to the}} underside of the MCM with solder bumps. The MCM has 565 pins, of which 286 are signal pins and 218 are power pins, organized as a <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA).</b> The MCM has wide buses which connect the seven dies.|$|E

The die was fabricated in Digital's fourth-generation CMOS process, CMOS-4, a 0.75 µm {{process with}} three layers of aluminium interconnect. The NVAX is packaged in a 339-pin <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> while the NVAX+ is packaged in a 431-pin <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> that {{is compatible with the}} Alpha AXP-based DECchip 21064 microprocessor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA)</b> {{packages}} may {{be considered}} to have evolved from the DIP. PGAs with the same 0.1 inch pin centers as most DIPs were popular for microprocessors from the early to mid-1980s through the 1990s. Owners of personal computers containing Intel 80286 through P5 Pentium processors may be most familiar with these PGA packages, which were often inserted into ZIF sockets on motherboards. The similarity is such that a PGA socket may be physically compatible with some DIP devices, though the converse is rarely true.|$|E
50|$|LGA {{packaging}} {{is related}} to ball grid array (BGA) and <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA)</b> packaging. Unlike pin grid arrays, land grid array packages are designed to fit either in a socket, or be soldered down using surface mount technology. PGA packages cannot be soldered down using surface mount technology. In contrast with a BGA, land grid array packages in non socketed configurations have no balls, and use flat contacts which are soldered directly to the PCB. BGA packages, however have balls as their contacts in between the IC and the PCBs. The balls are normally attached to {{the underside of the}} IC.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{integrated circuits}} were packaged in ceramic flat packs, which {{continued to be}} used by the military for their reliability and small size for many years. Commercial circuit packaging quickly moved to the dual in-line package (DIP), first in ceramic and later in plastic. In the 1980s pin counts of VLSI circuits exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA)</b> and leadless chip carrier (LCC) packages. Surface mount packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by the small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC) package - a carrier which occupies an area about 30-50% less than an equivalent DIP and is typically 70% thinner. This package has [...] "gull wing" [...] leads protruding from the two long sides and a lead spacing of 0.050 inches.|$|E

50|$|The R4000PC was {{packaged}} in a 179-pin ceramic <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (CPGA). The R4000SC and R4000MC were {{packaged in}} a 447-pin ceramic staggered <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (SPGA). The <b>pin</b> {{out of the}} R4000MC {{is different from the}} R4000SC, with some pins which are unused on the R4000SC used for signals to implement cache coherency on the R4000MC. The pin-out of the R4000PC was {{similar to that of the}} PGA-packaged R4200 and R4600 microprocessors. This characteristic enabled a properly designed system to use any of the three microprocessors.|$|R
50|$|The Staggered <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (SPGA) {{is used by}} Intel {{processors}} {{based on}} Socket 5 and Socket 7. Socket 8 used a partial SPGA layout on half the processor.|$|R
50|$|The BGA is {{descended from}} the <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA),</b> which is a package with one face covered (or partly covered) with pins in a grid pattern which, in operation, conduct {{electrical}} signals between the integrated circuit and the printed circuit board (PCB) on which it is placed. In a BGA the pins are replaced by pads {{on the bottom of}} the package, each initially with a tiny solder ball stuck to it. These solder spheres can be placed manually or by automated equipment, and are held in place with a tacky flux. The device is placed on a PCB with copper pads in a pattern that matches the solder balls. The assembly is then heated, either in a reflow oven or by an infrared heater, melting the balls. Surface tension causes the molten solder to hold the package in alignment with the circuit board, at the correct separation distance, while the solder cools and solidifies, forming soldered connections between the device and the PCB.|$|E

The first area array package was a ceramic pin grid array package. Not long after, the plastic ball grid array (BGA), another type of area array package, {{became one of the most}} commonly used packaging techniques.|$|E
50|$|QED was a fabless {{company and}} did not {{fabricate}} their own designs. The R5000 was fabricated by IDT, NEC and NKK. All three companies fabricated the R5000 in a 0.35 µm complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor (CMOS) process, but with different process features. IDT fabricated the R5000 in a process with two levels of polysilicon and three levels of aluminium interconnect. The two levels of polysilicon enabled IDT to use a four-transistor SRAM cell, resulting in a transistor count of 3.6 million and a die that measured 8.7 mm by 9.7 mm (84.39 mm2). NEC and NKK fabricated the R5000 in a process with one level of polysilicon and three levels of aluminium interconnect. Without an extra level of polysilicon, both companies had to use a six-transistor SRAM cell, resulting in a transistor count of 5.0 million and a larger die with an area of around 87 mm2. Die sizes {{in the range of}} 80 to 90 mm2 were claimed by MTI. 0.8 million of the transistors in both versions were for logic, and the remainder contained in the caches. It was packaged in a 272-ball plastic ball grid array (BGA) or 272-pin plastic <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>PGA).</b> It was not pin-compatible with any previous MIPS microprocessor.|$|E
