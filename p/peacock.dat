5|$|During {{the episode}} Jack Donaghy {{inherits}} Argus, Don Geiss's beloved pet <b>peacock.</b> Throughout the episode, Argus {{can be seen}} at Jack's office in the 30 Rock building. An actual <b>peacock</b> was featured here. In one scene, Liz Lemon sees Argus and is frightened of him. While talking to Jack, Argus hits Liz across the face with his feathers, thus marking her as his mate. To accommodate this, puppeteers—Peter Linz, Noel MacNeal, and Carmen Osbahr—were brought in to hit Liz in the face with feathers instead of using the <b>peacock</b> itself.|$|E

50|$|Many animals {{roam the}} grounds of the City, {{including}} <b>peacocks,</b> deer, squirrels, and other species. The <b>peacocks</b> are generally quite accustomed to the presence of people and are tame. <b>Peacocks</b> pose a large problem on the farm, so countermeasures have been taken against the <b>peacocks,</b> including covering the plants, moving the <b>peacocks</b> to a walnut farm, and planting extra food {{based on the assumption that}} a significant fraction will be eaten or damaged by peacocks.During special Dharma Assemblies, a Liberating of Life ceremony is held where many animals - especially pheasants and chukars - bought from hunting preserves are set free.|$|R

50|$|<b>Peacocks</b> traded from Broadway Square {{from the}} unit's opening in 2001 until the firm's {{collapse}} in 2012; {{it was not}} one of the stores rescued by Edinburgh Woollen Mill. In its later years <b>Peacocks</b> had operated a Bonmarche concession on its upper level; this too has closed. In May 2012, Poundworld took over the <b>Peacocks</b> premises, installing its own sister firm DiscountUK in the former Bonmarche space. In spring 2015, <b>Peacocks</b> included the former (pre-2011) River Island premises within the main centre on its list of new and forthcoming stores; when opened, the new <b>Peacocks</b> in fact combined the ex-River Island site with the neighbouring former Harris's.|$|R
5|$|Bewick {{was fond}} of the music of Northumberland, and of the Northumbrian smallpipes in particular. He {{especially}} wanted to promote the Northumbrian smallpipes, and to support the piper John <b>Peacock,</b> so he encouraged <b>Peacock</b> to teach pupils to become masters {{of this kind of}} music. One of these pupils was Thomas's son, Robert, whose surviving manuscript tunebooks give a picture of a piper's repertoire in the 1820s.|$|E
5|$|M-63 {{originally}} {{ran from}} <b>Peacock</b> in Lake County west through Luther to M-13 (later US131) in Osceola County on July 1, 1919. This highway was extended in 1930 along US131 to Tustin {{and then to}} a terminus with M-66 in Marion. At the same time, M-37 was extended north from Baldwin to meet M-63 east of <b>Peacock.</b> This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 when it was redesignated as part of M-61. A short connector roadway, M-179, was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US131, forming a small triangle of highways. The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to <b>Peacock.</b> The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960, removing that short highway from the state trunkline highway system. M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control.|$|E

5|$|Because Ganesha rode a <b>peacock</b> (in Sanskrit, a mayura, in Marathi – mora), he {{is known}} as Mayureshwar or Moreshwar ("Lord of the peacock").

5|$|In {{the small}} town of Home, Pennsylvania, a woman gives birth to a {{deformed}} baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury it near their dilapidated house during a rainstorm. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a sandlot ball game. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (Tucker Smallwood), Mulder asks whether the <b>Peacock</b> brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the American Civil War and is without electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been inbreeding since the war. The three <b>Peacock</b> brothers watch the agents from their front porch.|$|E
5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full bowl of amrita (elixir of life) as a boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he could drink from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact. So to protect the bowl, he {{swallowed}} it. Sindhu terrorized the three worlds, so the gods asked Gunesha for help. Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces and then cut open Sindhu's body, emptying the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. At the end of this incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his <b>peacock</b> mount to his younger brother Skanda, with whom the <b>peacock</b> mount is generally associated.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in <b>peacock</b> feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: <b>peacock</b> feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, <b>peacock</b> tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often iridescent.|$|E

5|$|Among moths with deimatic behaviour, the {{eyed hawkmoth}} (Smerinthus ocellatus) {{displays}} its large eyespots, moving them slowly {{as if it}} were a vertebrate predator such as an owl. Among butterflies, the <b>peacock</b> butterfly Aglais io is a cryptic leaf mimic with wings closed, but displays 4 conspicuous eyespots when disturbed, in a display effective against insectivorous birds (flycatchers).|$|E
5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using <b>peacock</b> butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed off, insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) were much less effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Goodness-of-fit {{statistics}} {{measure the}} compatibility of random samples against some theoretical or reference probability distribution function. The classical one-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a non-parametric statistic for comparing two empirical distributions which defines the largest absolute {{difference between the}} two cumulative distribution functions as a measure of disagreement. Adapting this test to more than one dimension is a challenge because there are 2 d- 1 independent ways of ordering a cumulative distribution function in d dimensions. We discuss <b>Peacock’s</b> version of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for two-dimensional data sets which computes the differences between cumulative distribution functions in 4 n 2 quadrants. We also examine Fasano and Franceschini’s variation of <b>Peacock’s</b> test, Cooke’s algorithm for <b>Peacock’s</b> test, and ROOT’s version of the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We establish a lower-bound limit on the work for computing <b>Peacock’s</b> test of Ω(n 2 lg n), introducing optimal algorithms for both this and Fasano and Franceschini’s test, and show that Cooke’s algorithm is not a faithful implementation of <b>Peacock’s</b> test. We also discuss and evaluate parallel algorithms for <b>Peacock’s</b> test. 1...|$|R

5|$|Birds have {{featured}} in culture and art since prehistoric times, {{when they were}} represented in early cave paintings. Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans.
