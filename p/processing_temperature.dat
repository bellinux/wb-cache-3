2500|$|In Portland cement clinker, calcium aluminoferrite {{occurs as}} an [...] "interstitial phase", {{crystallizing}} from the melt. Its presence in clinker is solely {{due to the}} need to obtain liquid at the peak kiln <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> (1400−1450°C), facilitating the formation of the desired silicate phases. Apart from this benefit, its effects on cement properties are little more than those of a diluent. Its forms an impure solid solution that deviates markedly in composition from the simple chemical formula. The calcium aluminoferrite phase acts as a repository for many of the minor elements in the clinker. Most of the transitional elements in the cement are found in the ferrite phase, notably titanium, manganese and zinc. There is also a substantial amount of magnesium and silicon, and because of this, oxides other than CaO, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 often make up 15% of the mass of the calcium aluminoferrite. This substitution reduces the melting point to around 1350°C.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of biogenic amines (i. e. putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and spermine) on the N-nitrosamine formation in heated cured lean meat was {{studied in the}} presence or absence of sodium nitrite and at different meat <b>processing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Experimental evidence was produced using gas chromatography with thermal energy analysis detection (GC-TEA). Concentration of N-nitrosamines was modelled as a function of the temperature and the nitrite concentration for two situations, i. e. presence or absence of added biogenic amines to the meat. The significance of the {{influence of}} the changing parameters was evaluated by ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). It was found that higher <b>processing</b> <b>temperatures</b> and higher added amounts of sodium nitrite increase the yields of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP). Spermidine and putrescine amplify the formation of NDMA, but spermine and cadeverine do not influence the formation of this N-nitrosamine. Spermidine and cadeverine cause a significant increase of NPIP. Beside N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) in some rare cases, no other volatile N-nitrosamines are detected. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
