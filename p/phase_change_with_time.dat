30|$|Deep neural {{networks}} {{model has been}} validated using separate out-of-sample datasets not used for the training. The good agreement between experimental data and DNN’s model predictions indicates that the complex, transient, non-linear behaviour of reservoir fluids can be effectively modelled as their saturation and <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{the purpose}} of this study is to {{implement}} a Deep Neural Networks model for the prediction of relative permeability accounting for reservoir depletion, saturation and <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> <b>time.</b> Guler et al. (1999) developed several neural network models for relative permeability considering different parameters that affects the property and selected the best model to make predictions for the test set while Al-Fattah (2013) also used a generalized regression neural network to predict relative permeability. Getting better prediction for out-of-sample datasets (better generalization), performance flattening out with a certain amount of data (scalability) as well as requiring far more neurons (and hence an increased computational time) to achieve better results as deep learning models is an issue for such networks. Again most of the reviewed empirical models can hardly generalize (Du Yuqi et al. 2004) and are static but deep neural networks (with its advanced features), if appropriately tuned, can capture the transients faster and more accurately throughout the reservoir life while also getting better as more data becomes available <b>with</b> <b>time.</b> Training can be done offline and the trained networks are suitable for on-board generation of descent relative permeability profiles as their computation requires a modest CPU effort hence not a concern to real-time application.|$|R

40|$|This {{overview}} {{highlights the}} main steps {{to come to}} Periodic AC and Periodic Noise simulation in RF simulation. A distinction is made between forced oscillators and free oscillators. Noisy elements contribute in various ways to the overall noise eect. When dealing with free oscillators, phase noise is most important. In the case of white and coloured stochastic noise sources, the spectrum of the (stationary) autocorrelation of the phase shifted function can be determined by summing the eects of all independent noise sources. In general one has to take the non-linear way, in which the <b>phase</b> shift function <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> into account...|$|R

Here, glass/ceramic interfaces of niobo-, vanado- and titano-phosphate glasses were studied by micro-Raman spectroscopy, whose spatial resolution revealed the multiphase structures.

40|$|We {{have been}} observing the {{millisecond}} pulsars in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) at the Parkes radio telescope since 1999 August with threefold higher time-resolution than hitherto possible. We {{present the results}} in this paper, including: improved 1400 -MHz pulse profiles; one new timing solution, for PSR J 0024 - 7204 S, which imposes stringent constraints on the acceleration model for 47 Tucanae and implies a projected mass-to-light ratio > 1. 4 M-circle dot/L-circle dot at {{the centre of the}} cluster; refined estimates for the five previously determined proper motions; and newly determined proper motions for six pulsars. We have detected, for the first time, relative motions between the pulsars. We have detected a second period derivative for the pulsar in the PSR J 0024 - 7204 H binary system, which could indicate the presence of a third nearby object, and improved measurement of the rate of advance of periastron of this pulsar, which yields a total system mass of 1. 61 +/- 0. 04 M-circle dot. We also have determined upper limits for the masses of any hypothetical planets orbiting the pulsars in 47 Tuc. PSR J 0023 - 7203 J shows variations of dispersion measure (DM) as a function of orbital phase with a total column density at superior conjunction of about 1. 7 x 10 (16) cm(- 2), 10 times smaller than observed for a similar system in the Galaxy. We interpret the small value as being due to a smaller inclination of the orbit of PSR J 0023 - 7203 J. We find that the DM variation <b>with</b> orbital <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> and we detect material at more than 90 degrees (in orbital phase) from the companion. PSR J 0024 - 7204 O also shows variations of DM with orbital phase, but these are restricted to phases near the eclipse. This binary system displays significant monotonic variation of its orbital period: (P) over dot(b) =(9 +/- 1) x 10 (- 12). This is probably due to spin-orbit coupling; this effect seems to be significantly smaller for PSR J 0023 - 7203 J...|$|R

40|$|Wide biosurfactant {{application}} on biorremediation {{is limited}} by its high production cost. The search for cheaper biossurfactant production alternatives has guided our study. The use of selective media containing sucrose (10 g. L- 1) and Arabian Light oil (2 g. L- 1) as carbon sources showed to be effective to screen and maintain biosurfactant-producing consortia isolated from mangrove hydrocarbon-contaminated sediment. The biosurfactant production was assayed by kerosene, gasoline and Arabian Light Emulsification activity and the bacterial growth curve was determined by bacterial quantification. The parameters analyzed for biosurfactant production were the growth curve, salinity concentration, flask shape and oxygenation. All bacteria consortia screened were able to emulsify the petroleum derivatives tested. Biosurfactant production increased according to the incubation time; however the type of emulsification (non-aqueous phase or aqueous <b>phase)</b> did not <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>time</b> but <b>with</b> the compound tested.

Two in situ methods, i. e., optical microscopy and real-time reflectivity measurements, {{have been used in}} order to compare the optical response before and after <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> and to follow the <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> dynamics <b>with</b> a <b>time</b> resolution close to 400 ps. The results show that cycling is possible under irradiation with both fs and ns pulses using single pulses for amorphization and multiple pulses for crystallization. The use of ns pulses favors the crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation, with a characteristic transformation time of ∼ 15 ns. The presence of the liquid phase was identified and temporally resolved, featuring a well-defined transient reflectivity state, in between those of the crystalline and amorphous phases.

Final state is coherent linear {{combination of two}} states with same energy and definite different momenta. Initial state contains two components with same definite momentum difference and slightly different energies. Energy-time uncertainty allows two components with different energies to decay into same final state. One linear combination is Dicke superradiant state; other is subradiant. Relative phase of two components with slightly different energies <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> <b>time</b> and produces oscillations between superradiant and subradiant states.
