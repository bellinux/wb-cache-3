40|$|Abstract- A novel {{method to}} {{characterize}} the mechanism of positive-feedback regeneration in a p-n-p-n structure during CMOS latchup transition is developed. It {{is based on the}} de-rived time-varying transient poles in large-signal base-emitter voltages of the lumped equivalent circuit of a p-n-p-n struc-ture. Through calculating the time-varying transient poles during CMOS latchup transition, it is found that there exists a transient pole to change from negative to positive and then this pole changes to negative again. A p-n-p-n structure, which has a stronger positive-feedback regeneration during turn-on transi-tion, will lead to a larger <b>positive</b> transient <b>pole.</b> The time when the <b>positive</b> transient <b>pole</b> occurs during CMOS latchup transi-tion is the time when the positive-feedback regeneration starts.

Occasionally the time occupied in bringing on the action extended to eight or nine minutes, and sometimes even to forty minutes, and yet ignition and explosion would result.

Next, we examined the correlations of the ER 89 -R scale with several measures of adjustment and maladjustment. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence of partial configural, metric, and scalar invariance across Italy, Spain, and the United States. Overall, the correlation patterns were stable across countries and sex, with some exceptions. As expected, higher levels of ego-resiliency were strongly and consistently associated with the <b>positive</b> <b>poles</b> of the Big Five. Moreover, ego-resiliency showed a positive correlation with psychological well-being in each country, and negative relations with depression in Spain and Italy, {{but not in the}} United States.
