5000|$|The <b>damper</b> <b>pedal,</b> {{sometimes}} called the sustaining pedal, is used more often than the other pedals, and is placed {{at the right of}} the array of pedals, most conveniently accessible to (mostly right-footed) players. The <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> raises all the dampers off the strings so that they keep vibrating after a key on the keyboard has been released. In effect, the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> makes every string on the piano a sympathetic string, creating a rich tonal quality; it is probably this effect that lies behind the common saying that the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> is [...] "the soul of the piano". The <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> has the secondary function of allowing the player to connect into a legato texture notes that otherwise could not thus be played.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{development}} of the use of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> during the Classical period, with emphasis on the great contributions made by Steibelt and Dussek. Pedaling by the Austrian composers Mozart, Haydn, Woelfl, Kozeluch, and Beethoven is also considered, looking at the connections among these composers and the possible influence on them of London School composers such as Steibelt and Dussek. On the whole, the effects that these composers intended by means of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> are clear and precise—different from modern pedaling in which the consistent use of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> is normal and special effects are achieved by not using the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b> This study hopes to have recognized the contribution of Steibelt and Dussek to {{the development of}} the use of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal,</b> and to have encouraged pianists of today to take into consideration the pedal indications of composers of this period...|$|R
50|$|Piano pedals are {{foot-operated}} levers at {{the base}} of a piano which change the instrument's sound in various ways. Modern pianos usually have three pedals, from left to right, the soft pedal (or una corda), the sostenuto pedal, and the sustaining <b>pedal</b> (or <b>damper</b> <b>pedal).</b> Some pianos omit the sostenuto pedal, or have a middle pedal with a different purpose such as a muting function also known as silent piano.|$|R
40|$|Some {{preliminary}} {{results have been}} obtained for the dynamic response of a rotor operating over a speed range of 800 to 10, 000 rpm. Amplitude frequency plots show the lateral vibratory response of an unbalanced rotor with and without external damping. The mode of damping is by means of eddy currents generated with 4 c shaped permanent magnets installed at the lower bearing of a vertically oriented rotor. The lower ball bearing and its <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> are totally immersed in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of - 197 deg C (- 320 deg F). These {{preliminary results}} for a referenced or base line passive eddy current <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> show that the amplitude of synchronous vibration is reduced at the resonant frequency. Measured damping coefficients were calculated to phi =. 086; this compares with a theoretically calculated value of phi =. 079...|$|R

40|$|An active {{electromagnetic}} damper {{system was}} developed for and used in a 5. 5 % aeroelastic model of Saturn 1 B/SA 206 launch configuration in wind tunnel tests to determine ground wind-induced loads. Detailed descriptions are given of the damper development program: approach, design analyses, fabrication, checkout, system calibration, wind tunnel test results, <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> and operating instructions, and trouble-shooting procedures.

5000|$|The sustain <b>pedal</b> (or, <b>damper</b> <b>pedal)</b> {{is often}} simply called [...] "the pedal", {{since it is}} the most {{frequently}} used. It is placed as the rightmost pedal in the group. It lifts the dampers from all keys, sustaining all played notes. In addition, it alters the overall tone by allowing all strings, including those not directly played, to reverberate. When all of the other strings on the piano can vibrate, this allows sympathetic vibration of strings that are harmonically related to the sounded pitches. For example, if the pianist plays the 440 Hz [...] "A" [...] note, the higher octave [...] "A" [...] notes will also sound sympathetically.|$|R
50|$|In the US, the Joint Commission, State Fire Marshals and Other Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ's), require Fire and Smoke Dampers to {{be tested}} at {{specified}} intervals. Similarly, European authorities mandate maintenance and repairs of fire dampers also, as part of approvals or listings issued following successful testing of fire <b>damper</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Therefore, fire dampers that are not demonstrably maintained per regulations constitute fire code violations because installed but unmaintained fire dampers no longer comply with their certification listings.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the opening}} of the work, Beethoven {{included}} the following direction in Italian: [...] "Si deve suonare tutto questo pezzo delicatissimamente e senza sordino" [...] ("This whole piece ought to be played with the utmost delicacy and without dampers."). The way this is accomplished (both on today's pianos and on those of Beethoven's day) is to depress the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> throughout the movement - or at least {{to make use of the}} <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> throughout, but changing the pedal as the harmony changes.|$|R
5000|$|A sustain pedal or {{sustaining}} <b>pedal</b> (also called <b>damper</b> <b>pedal,</b> loud pedal, or open pedal) is {{the most}} commonly used pedal in a modern piano. It is typically the rightmost of two or three pedals. When pressed, the sustain pedal [...] "sustains" [...] all the damped strings on the piano by moving all the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely. All notes played will continue to sound until the vibration naturally ceases, or until the pedal is released.|$|R

This damping system was {{used on the}} LAGEOS spacecraft to control nutation buildup during the long coast period (approximately 75 minutes) after the third stage separation. The damper package was evaluated and proven on a three-axis gas-bearing simulator that duplicated the LAGEOS spacecraft critical flight dynamics. In addition, a failure analysis of the <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> was performed. Performance of the damper during the LAGEOS flight has confirmed the preflight evaluation and analysis...|$|R
5000|$|The player {{must pay}} close {{attention}} to the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> to play cleanly and avoid multiple notes ringing unintentionally at the same time. Because the notes ring for a significant fraction of a second when struck with the damper pad up, and ringing bars do not stop ringing immediately when contacted by the pad, players use a technique called after pedaling. [...] In this technique, the player presses the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> slightly after striking the bar—shortly enough so the recently struck note continues to ring, but long enough so that the previous note stops ringing.|$|R
50|$|One {{option is}} simply to change the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> {{periodically}} where necessary to avoid excessive dissonance. This is seen, for instance, in the editorially supplied pedal marks in the Ricordi edition of the sonata.|$|R

2500|$|Silbermann {{was also}} a central figure {{in the history of}} the piano. [...] He {{transmitted}} to later builders the crucial ideas of Bartolomeo Cristofori (the inventor of the piano), ensuring their survival, and also invented the forerunner of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coming to the , both Mercedes {{struggled}} {{to be at}} the forefront as the cars do not suit the track therefore performance and times slumped as a result. Hamilton and Rosberg could only qualify 5th and 6th respectively. In the race, Hamilton recorded his first retirement of the season and Rosberg finished 4th. At the 14th round of the season - , Mercedes was back on form during qualifying by locking out the 10th front-row of the season. In the race, Hamilton got the better start and forced Rosberg wide at turn 2 dropping him to fourth place {{at the end of the}} first lap. Hamilton dominated the race, leading every lap and setting the fastest lap whereas Rosberg recovered to second, 19s adrift of his teammate, securing Mercedes's 8th 1-2 finish of the season. During the , pole-sitter Rosberg was forced to retire in the early stages of the race owing to throttle <b>pedal</b> <b>damper</b> failure causing blockage on the throttle control. On the other hand, Hamilton qualified 2nd and eased to victory by 6 seconds, ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, in addition with a 2nd successive World Constructors' Champions.|$|R
40|$|An active {{nutation}} damping device, {{consisting of}} an angular accelerometer, a dc motor driven flywheel, and associated electronics, {{was developed for}} spacecraft use. This damping system was used on the Lageos spacecraft, launched 4 May 1976, to control nutation buildup during the long coast period after the third stage separation. Of many electrical and mechanical design choices, an angular rather than linear accelerometer offered some advantages but problems developed in adapting the angular accelerometer to spacecraft use.

50|$|A sonorous {{foundation}} for the melodic line {{is provided by the}} widely spaced notes in the accompaniment, connected by the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b> The waltz-like accompaniment gently emphasizes the 12/8 meter, 12 beats to the measure subdivided into four groups of 3 beats each.|$|R
40|$|Lateral shaft {{vibrations}} {{produced by}} a rotating unbalance weight were damped by means of eddy currents generated in copper conductors that were precessing cyclicly in the gap formed by the pole faces of C-shaped, permanent magnets. The <b>damper</b> <b>assembly,</b> which was located at the lower bearing support of a vertically oriented rotor was completely immersed in liquid nitrogen during the test run. The test rotor was operated over a speed range from 800 to 10, 000 rpm. Three magnet/conductor designs were evaluated. Experimental damping coefficients varied from 180 to 530 N sec/m. Reasonable agreement was noted for theoretical values of damping for these same <b>assemblies.</b> Values of <b>damping</b> coefficients varied from 150 to 780 N sec/m. The results demonstrate that passive eddy-current damping is a viable candidate for vibration control in cryogenic turbomachinery...|$|R
50|$|For {{mechanical}} pianos it {{is possible}} to press down the sustain pedal only partially such that the dampers just touch the strings very slightly. This technique for the advanced pianist is called half pedaling and allows a fine variation of the sound. It can be observed that with half <b>pedaling</b> the <b>damping</b> is more effective for the higher tones. An example for a musical piece that is played with half pedaling by some pianists is Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Most recent digital pianos also support this effect.|$|R
50|$|The extra {{keys are}} added {{primarily}} for increased resonance from the associated strings; that is, they vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed and thus give a fuller tone. Only {{a very small}} number of works composed for piano actually use these notes.|$|R
50|$|During the Classical era, the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> was {{generally}} not used {{as it is in}} later music; that is, as a more or less constant amplification and modulation of the basic piano sound. Instead, pedaling was employed as a particular expressive effect, applied to certain individual musical passages.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} {{can have}} numerous stops to soften and sweeten the sound: una corda, moderator, harp.

See Piano pedals.|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the more conventional squeeze-film bearing damper designs, a Viton- 70 shear-mounted, elastomeric damper was built and tested in a T- 55 power turbine high-speed balancing rig. This application demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of using elastomers as the primary rotor damping source in production turbine engine hardware. The shear-mounted damper design was selected because of its compatibility with actual gas turbine engine radial space constraints, its accommodation of both the radial and axial thrust loads present in gas turbine engines, and its capability of controlled axial preload. Test results showed that the Viton- 70 elastomeric damper operated successfully and provided excellent control of both synchronous and nonsynchronous vibrations through all phases of testing to the maximum rotor speed of 1676 rad/s (16, 000 rpm). Excellent correlation between the predicted and experienced critical speeds, mode shapes, and log decrements for the power turbine rotor and elastomer <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> was also achieved...|$|R

50|$|Silbermann {{invented a}} device {{by which the}} player could lift all of the dampers off the strings, {{permitting}} them to vibrate freely, either when struck or sympathetically when other notes were played. This is the function in later pianos of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b> Silbermann's device {{was different from the}} modern <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> in two respects. First, it was not actually controlled by a pedal, but rather was a hand stop, which required the player to cease playing on the keys for a moment in order to change the damper configuration. Thus, it was a device for imparting an unusual tonal color to whole passages, rather than a means of nuanced expression as the pedal is today. Second, Silbermann's device was bifurcated, permitting the dampers of the treble and bass sections to be lifted separately. This latter feature has recently been reintroduced to the piano, {{in the form of the}} fourth and fifth pedals of pianos made by the Borgato firm; see Innovations in the piano.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{methods for}} haptic modelling of soft and hard tissue with varying stiffness. The model provides visualization of deformation and calculates force feedback during simulated epidural needle insertion. A spring-mass-damper (SMD) network is configured from {{magnetic resonance image}} (MRI) slices of patient’s lumbar region to represent varying stiffness throughout tissue structure. Reaction force is calculated from the SMD network and a haptic device is configured to produce a needle insertion simulation. The user can feel the changing forces as the needle is inserted through tissue layers and ligaments. Methods for calculating the force feedback at various depths of needle insertion are presented. Voxelization is used to fill ligament surface meshes with spring mass <b>damper</b> <b>assemblies</b> for simulated needle insertion into soft and hard tissues. Modelled vertebrae cannot be pierced by the needle. Graphs were produced during simulated needle insertions to compare the applied force to haptic reaction force.

40|$|Milling {{is widely}} used in the {{manufacturing}} industry. Numerous efforts {{have been made to}} improve the efficiency of milling. For the efficiency of the milling process, high demands on the material removal rate and the surface generation rate. The process parameters determining the two rates are restricted by the occurrence of regenerative chatter. This project deals with reduction of chatter vibration in end milling tool by introducing the dampers. The main objective of the present work is to design a damped milling tool. A mechanical damper has been introduced to reduce tool vibration in milling tool. The mechanical damper is composed of multi-fingered cylindrical inserts placed in a matching cylindrical hole in center of standard end mill cutter. Centrifugal forces during high speed rotation press the flexible fingers against the inner surface of the tool. Bending of the tool and <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> due to cutting forces causes relative axial sliding between the tool inner surface and damper fingers dissipates in the form of friction work simple numerical analysis using ANSYS is performed to estimate the amount of friction work during bending.

50|$|Performers often {{hesitate}} to follow Beethoven's direction, particularly when {{playing on a}} modern piano. This is because the modern piano has a much longer sustain time than the instruments of Beethoven's time, so that a steady application of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> creates a dissonant sound.

50|$|The M5 Bomb Trailer is a 2½ ton {{capacity}} vehicle {{used during}} World War II for transporting bombs from munitions storage areas to the aircraft for loading. Up to six M5s can be towed in a train. The trailer weighs 7,200 pounds when fully loaded.The front {{pair of wheels}} are mounted on a caster assembly like a shopping cart. They are free to rotate 360 degrees about their vertical axis. There is a <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> that resembles 1/2 of a disk brake rotor that has friction pucks pressing against it to dampen oscillations of the caster assembly. These trailers would be towed out to the flightline all hitched together like a train and the train would stop at the first bomber and the last trailer in the train would be disconnected. The train would then continue {{on to the next}} bomber. After the train left, the crew would manhandle the trailer to a position under the bomber to enable the loading of the bombs. The front caster wheel assembly made this relatively easy. And so each trailer would be detached and when the towing vehicle had left the last trailer, it would circle around and go back and pick up the now empty first trailer detached.
