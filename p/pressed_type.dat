25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory <b>pressed</b> <b>type).</b> The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough {{to be used in}} microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} five years, {{researchers}} have improvised the existing in-pipe inspection robots by developing hybrid locomotion by combining two or more propulsion mechanism in achieving robust but yet flexible robot platform. In this paper, several hybrid robots have been reviewed and categorized according to their implemented locomotion system. The hybrid locomotion systems are caterpillar wall-pressed type, wheeled wall-pressed type and wheeled wall-pressing screw type. Each hybrid locomotion system is developed according to distinct design requirements for specific environment and might be not suitable for other application. The aim of this review is to highlight the current innovation of in-pipe robot for inspection. Based on the study, wall <b>pressed</b> <b>type</b> {{is the most popular}} main locomotion system in in-pipe robot development. Most of the prototypes are able to travel into branches with the same diameter as the pipe. Integration of caterpillar wheel gives more advantage in preventing motion singularity problem while surpassing branches. On the other hand, wheeled wall-pressed type provides advantage in high speed mobility. Wheeled wall pressing screw type gives the best navigation in curved pipe. None of these inventions show their ability in navigating bigger pipe to smaller branches...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ripening}} conditions (two temperatures, 9 degrees C and 13 degrees C, and two relative humidities 93 % and 97 %) {{on the growth}} of Listeria monocytogenes and other microbial populations was evaluated in the cores and rinds of uncooked <b>pressed</b> <b>type</b> cheeses prepared with pasteurised milk and inoculated either with Streptococcus thermophilus only or with an anti-listerial consortium. Regardless of temperature and relative humidity (RH), inhibition by the anti-listerial consortium was stronger in the cheese cores than in the rinds. Temperature had no significant effect on L monocytogenes counts in cores or rinds. However, {{at the beginning of}} ripening in the consortium cheese, L. monocytogenes growth was more strongly inhibited at 13 degrees C than at 9 degrees C. Regardless of inoculation type and ripening temperature, counts of L monocytogenes were significantly lower in the cores and rinds of cheeses ripened at 93 % than at 97 % RH. Lactobacilli counts were higher at 13 degrees C than at 9 degrees C and at 93 % than at 97 % RH. Lactobacilli can help to inhibit L monocytogenes by catabolising galactose and producing lactate. Further investigations will be needed to evaluate the effect of ripening at 13 degrees C and 93 % RH on the sensorial properties of cheese...|$|E

Four out of 6 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter freundii UCMA 4217, Klebsiella oxytoca 927, Hafnia alvei B 16 and Proteus vulgaris UCMA 3780) reached counts close to 6 log CFU g(- 1), in the model cheese. In core of cheeses inoculated with Gram-negative bacteria, only slight differences were observed for microbial counts (Enterococcus faecalis or Lactobacillus plantarum count differences below 1 log CFU g(- 1)), acetate concentration (differences below 200 mg kg(- 1)) and texture (greater firmness) in comparison to control cheeses. Cheese core colour, odour and volatile compound composition were not modified. Although ornithine, the precursor of putrescine, was present in all cheeses, putrescine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with H. alvei 816 and never exceeded 2. 18 mmol kg(- 1) cheese dry matter. Cadaverine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with H. alvei B 16, K. oxytoca 927.

40|$|Retrofits of {{hydraulic}} {{and mechanical}} deep drawing presses often {{stop with the}} exchange of the electrical and the hydraulic parts. But that is only half the job. The use of high definition control electronics, faster CPUs and more dynamic hydraulic actuators, offers the opportunity of redesigning the already existing control concepts of the press. In this paper we present how {{the performance of the}} press, i. e. the control quality, can be increased for hydraulic ram and cushion axes. The improvement in control quality is achieved through the use of intelligent closed-loop and open-loopcontrol algorithms. Therefore, creasing and crack formation can be reduced, since enhancements in control quality have direct influence {{on the quality of the}} forming process. Results will be shown for hydraulic drawing cushion control, i. e. pressure control, as well as for hydraulic ram control, i. e. position, velocity and parallelism control. We present findings for hydraulic cushion control of a mechanical <b>press</b> <b>type</b> Arisa S- 4 - 1600 - 470 - 230 -LDE (link-drive press with 10 hydraulic cushions) and for ram- / cushion-control of hydraulic <b>press</b> <b>type</b> Müller-Weingarten ZE 2100 (multi-curve press with 8 -point cushion) ...|$|R
