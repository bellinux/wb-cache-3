Hereby thou may'st not only receive the delectation of variety, but also arrive at a more certain judgment, by a grave and circumspect comparison of the witnesses with each other, or of each with himself. Hence also, thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections, not only of a critical, but a moral nature, by being let into many <b>particulars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> as well as genius, and of the fortune as well as merit, of our author: in which, if I relate some things of little concern peradventure to thee, and some of as little even to him, I entreat thee to consider how minutely all true critics and commentators are wont to insist upon such, and how material they seem to themselves, if to none other. Forgive me, gentle reader, if (following learned example) I ever and anon become tedious: allow me to take the same pains to find whether my author were good or bad, well or ill-natured, modest or arrogant; as another, whether his author was fair or brown, short or tall, or whether he wore a coat or a cassock.|$|E

It is well known that people are now living longer but health is still failing in a significant percentage of older people, meaning that many adults require care for longer, albeit to varying degrees and for varying amounts of time. Many of these individuals will receive care from relatives or close friends who are participating in the labour market: this is increasingly likely as adults are expected / wanting to remain in paid work for longer, often into their 60 s and 70 s. <b>The</b> requirements <b>of</b> elderly dependants can cause these workers huge difficulties and dilemmas as they attempt, across time, to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> for whom they wish to provide care, often a loved one, and meet <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> demands <b>of</b> their employment relationship.

40|$|PHILOSOPHERS {{writing in}} {{normative}} political theory have recently focusedour attention on two competing understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normative foundations <b>of</b> liberalism. According to those calling themselves political liberals, liberal political philosophy {{can and should}} proceed without <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> a <b>particular</b> conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> and <b>of</b> moral validity. It is argued that political philosophy should propose political principles that could be found acceptable to citizens holding {{a wide variety of}} doctrines concerning what persons are, and what <b>the</b> proper ends <b>of</b> human and community life are. On this view, <b>the</b> acceptability <b>of</b> political principles depends on the fact that they do not conflict with <b>the</b> fundamental values <b>of</b> dominant ethical traditions. 1 Comprehensive liberals, on the other hand, argue that political philosophy cannot be done without <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> a determinate conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> and moral validity. According to this view, we cannot say much of interest about how we ought to live together without knowing who we are and what <b>the</b> appropriate ends <b>of</b> human and community life are. Indeed, the comprehensive liberal accuses <b>the</b> political liberal <b>of</b> tacitly assuming such conceptions. Comprehensive liberals admit that their political doctrines, grounded as they are in particular and thus potentially controversial conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> and moral validity, may come into competition with common doctrines that citizens hold.

40|$|Includes bibliography. Most psychosocial {{services}} {{for people with}} cancer remain under-utilised. This phenomenon disturbs <b>the</b> logic <b>of</b> two facts: that people with cancer do experience psychosocial problems, and that most interventions are capable of alleviating psychological distress and improving quality of life. This dissertation approached the above problem using a multi-modal methodology. First, a multi-choice questionnaire survey was conducted at the out-patient oncology clinic, Groote Schuur Hospital, showing that interest in the more professionalised services such as psychiatry, psychotherapy, coping skills courses, and social work was low, while interest in less professionalised services such as self-help groups and veteran patient visits was relatively high. In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrative and discursive approaches to understanding human experience, it was argued that psychosocial oncology presents a <b>particular</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> 'ith cancer, rooted in positivist and medical frameworks, which {{may be out of}} sink with patients' own understandings of themselves. A discourse analytic study, using two focus group interviews and four individual interviews with people with cancer, served as an alternative approach to understanding the coping process and patients' attitudes towards psychosocial care. Two contrasting discourses were highlighted in this way: an individualistic discourse and a psychological discourse. Respondents employed various rhetorical strategies in order to ensure domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rational, individualistic, and coping 'I' over the emotional, psychologized mind. Taken together, these results suggest that less professionalised services, based largely on fellow patient support, should be central to a more consumer-friendly system of psychosocial care. An action research approach was recommended as a possible means of developing such a system of care...|$|R

It {{is also one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crimes in respect of which opinions vary considerably. Furtum possessionis is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime <b>of</b> theft at common law. <b>The</b> general requirements <b>of</b> furtum possessionis were already established in Roman law. Emphasis was not placed on <b>the</b> taker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing but on <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who was deprived <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. This approach was also followed in Roman-Dutch law. Fur tum possessionis in South African law {{can be defined as}} follows: It is the unlawful and intentional appropriation by the owner or someone else of a movable corporeal thing in commercio, in circumstances in which <b>the</b> possessor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing has a valid right <b>of</b> retention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing, with <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> depriving <b>the</b> possessor permanently <b>of</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing. Theft in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> furtum possessionis differs in an important respect from theft in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> a thing. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> removal <b>the</b> complainant can also be a person acting as a holder, that is someone exercising control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owner. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> furtum possessionis <b>the</b> complainant is <b>the</b> <b>person</b> with <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> retention and from whose possession the thing is taken away.

My first screenplay is a free reverie based on Mavis Gallant's "Wedding Ring", a highly blurred and elliptic story. I then chose to work on "Careful", a text by Raymond Carver. Carver's writing is very concise and detail oriented. In itself, it is already almost cinematographic. The external gestures, the outside world express the character's interiority and existential uneasiness. This kind of writing calls for {{a different approach to}} adaptation.

It was a very queer letter, no doubt; but it had been written skilfully enough to suit <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> personality <b>of</b> Isabel Walters: for Ernest Carnegie was a keen judge of character, and he flattered himself that he knew how to adapt his correspondence to <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> temperament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> he happened to be addressing. And though Isabel had no very distinct idea <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> two Carnegies were severally like (it could hardly have been much more distinct if she had known them both intimately), she felt they were two very good-looking, agreeable young men, and she was not particularly averse to <b>the</b> attentions <b>of</b> either. After all, upon what straws we all usually hang our love-making! We see one another once or twice under exceptionally deceptive circumstances; we are struck at first sight with something that attracts us on either side; we find the attraction is mutual; we flounder at once into a declaration of undying attachment; we get married, and on the whole we generally find we were right after all, in spite of our precipitancy, and we live happily ever afterwards. So it was not really very surprising that Isabel Walters, getting such a note from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two handsome young Mr. Carnegies, should have been in some doubt which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two identicals it actually was, and yet should have felt indefinitely pleased and flattered at the implied attention. Which was Ernest and which Harold could only mean to her, when she came to think on it, which was the one she danced with first last night, and which the one she danced with second. She decided in her own mind {{that it would be better}} for her to go to the Montagus' picnic to-morrow, but to say nothing about it to her mother. [...] "Mamma wouldn't understand the letter," [...] she said to herself complacently; [...] "she's so conventional; and when I come back to-morrow I can tell her one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young Carnegies was there, and that he proposed to me. She need never know there was any appointment." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work we examine how {{mechanical}} nonlinearity can be appropriately utilized to achieve strong robustness of performance in an energy harvesting setting. More specifically, for energy harvesting applications, {{a great challenge}} is <b>the</b> uncertain character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excitation. <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> this uncertainty with <b>the</b> narrow range <b>of</b> good performance for linear oscillators creates {{the need for more}} robust designs that adapt to a wider range of excitation signals. A typical application of this kind is energy harvesting from walking vibrations. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> that walks as well as on <b>the</b> pace <b>of</b> walking, <b>the</b> excitation signal obtains completely different forms. In the present work we study a nonlinear spring mechanism that is composed of a cantilever wrapping around a curved surface as it deflects. While for the free cantilever, the force acting on the free tip depends linearly on the tip displacement, <b>the</b> utilization <b>of</b> a contact surface with <b>the</b> appropriate distribution <b>of</b> curvature leads to essentially nonlinear dependence between the tip displacement and the acting force. The studied nonlinear mechanism has favorable mechanical properties such as low frictional losses, minimal moving parts, and a rugged design that can withstand excessive loads. Through numerical simulations we illustrate that by utilizing this essentially nonlinear element in a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) system, we obtain strongly nonlinear energy transfers between <b>the</b> modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. We illustrate that this nonlinear behavior is associated with strong robustness over three radically different excitation signals that correspond to different walking paces. To validate the strong robustness properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2 DOF nonlinear system, we perform a direct parameter optimization for 1 DOF and 2 DOF linear systems as well as for a class of 1 DOF and 2 DOF systems with nonlinear springs similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cubic spring that are physically realized by the cantilever–surface mechanism. The optimization results show that the 2 DOF nonlinear system presents the best average performance when the excitation signals have three possible forms. Moreover, we observe that while for the linear systems the optimal performance is obtained for small values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic damping, for the 2 DOF nonlinear system optimal performance is achieved for large values of damping. This feature is <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> importance for <b>the</b> system׳s robustness to parasitic damping. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Naval Engineering Education Center.

40|$|After {{referring}} to <b>the</b> accepted views <b>of</b> totemism, this article outlines the basic {{differences between the}} « guilt civilization », represented by Christianity with its linear time, and the « shame civilization », represented by totemism with its mythical time. <b>The</b> classification system <b>of</b> totemism may not organize its hierarchy with man at the top, but initiation will emphasize man's dual relationship with his ancestors (who {{are present in the}} paintings, singing, and dancing, and the final banquet, the ancestor's flesh) and with nature in which he must find his place : through rhythm (<b>the</b> initiated <b>person</b> participates in <b>the</b> time cycle), through dancing (he occupies his place in space), and through ornaments and dancing (he becomes a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhythm and space <b>of</b> nature). Recalling <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major feasts (pilou, etc.) in these societies who have a display economy rather than a survival one, the A. uses an aesthetic approach to initiation ceremonies to stress <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> « double » (in other words, the same). This « double » has the same appearance as <b>the</b> initiated <b>person</b> who with his festive costume (body paintings, ornaments, etc.) becomes « the same », that is, a real man, and through his decorations a creature of beauty. This festive costume and the way it is worn govern <b>the</b> ethics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> totemized <b>person.</b> <b>The</b> A. suggests the neologism « calliontique » (from χαλλος = beautiful, and ών, οντος = creature) to express <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> totemized <b>person</b> and to help counter the general tendency to limit totemism by associating it exclusively with religious systems.
