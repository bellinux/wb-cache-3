40|$|Individuals {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) {{have been known}} to struggle with attaining and maintaining employment. The stigma of ASDs plays a large role in this struggle, and research on stigma management strategies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace is needed. I investigated the effects of two specific stigma management strategies for adults with ASD <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace, self-disclosure and interpersonal warmth behaviors (e. g., asking others questions about their interests), on coworker attitudes. In this experiment, I showed participants a video of an individual with ASD interacting with coworkers. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four conditions, featuring 1) the presence or absence of self-disclosure and 2) the presence or absence of interpersonal warmth from an individual with ASD. Participants then completed questionnaires to capture several dimensions of their attitudes. Results showed that <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disclosure condition perceived more warmth and competence, felt more admiration and less irritation, and had greater intentions to help and associate than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> no disclosure condition. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disclosure condition also reported more willingness to work with an individual with ASD than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> no disclosure condition. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warmth present condition reported seeing the individual as significantly warmer than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warmth behaviors absent condition. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warmth behaviors present condition also reported feeling significantly less envy towards <b>the</b> individual <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warmth behaviors present condition than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warmth behaviors absent condition...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of emotion on false memory production. 118 undergraduate college students participated in this study. Each participant was first asked to listen to a list of study words taken from the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm. After listening to the word lists, participants were then given an emotion induction task that induced moods by rating person descriptive words taken from the Dumas norms. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: positive, negative, or neutral. Each participant was then given an immediate recognition memory test. One week later, participants were given a delayed recognition memory test to measure the degree of false memory. Results indicate that on <b>the</b> immediate memory <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> positive mood condition were more susceptible to false memory. On the immediate memory test it was also found that <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neutral condition had the highest acceptance rates for target words, suggesting they had the best true memory. On the delayed memory test, it was found that <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative condition were less likely to accept all types of words than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative and positive emotion conditions. This finding is consistent with what was found on the immediate memory test. Interestingly, on the delayed memory test <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> positive emotional condition actually increased their acceptance rate for targets while <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neutral condition decreased their acceptance rates and <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative condition kept their target rates consistent...|$|R
