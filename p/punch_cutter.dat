50|$|The Ludwig Wagner Type Foundry was {{established}} in 1902 in Leipzig after the veteran <b>punch</b> <b>cutter</b> Ludwig Wagner took over the small foundry Gundelach & Ebersbach in 1901. The beginning of his modern type production and the extension of his business happened before 1914. The large manufacturing facilities in East Leipzig suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II. In 1949, the company was given new facilities in the Southwestern part of Leipzig. Ludwig Wagner AG was incorporated into Typoart by the East German government in 1960 and Wagner himself moved to the German Federal Republic.|$|E
5000|$|Benton invented many of {{the most}} {{important}} type founding technologies of the day, including a mould (1882), self spacing type (1883), a <b>punch</b> <b>cutter</b> (1885), combination fractions (1895), a type dressing machine (1901), a matrix and punch-cutting machine (1906), and automatic type-caster (1907), and a lining device for engraving matrices of shaded letters (1913). One of his most famous inventions was the Benton Pantograph, an engraving machine which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design. [...] (Mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript.) The technology allowed metal type to be designed on large plan drawings and then cut at the desired size, rather than being hand-engraved at the desired size.|$|E
50|$|Jenson's highly legible and evenly colored typeface, {{based upon}} Humanistic scripts, has been reinterpreted {{through the centuries}} by {{numerous}} type designers, most notably William Morris. Jenson's fame as one of history's greatest typeface designers and <b>punch</b> <b>cutters</b> rests on the types first used in Eusebius's De praeparatione evangelica, which presents the full flowering of roman type design.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{stands as}} a {{landmark}} of typography in the Age of Enlightenment. The conception of the letterforms reflects a difference in attitude from the prevailing roman typefaces before it. Whereas previous roman typefaces developed naturally over time, evolving {{in the hands of}} <b>punch</b> <b>cutters</b> from the typefaces of the fifteenth century, the [...] was the result of rational design: the letterforms were mapped on grids before being cut into metal. The [...] was not the first [...] "constructed alphabet".|$|R
50|$|The {{capital of}} {{printing}} in Europe shifted to Venice, where visionary printers like Aldus Manutius ensured widespread {{availability of the}} major Greek and Latin texts. The claims of an Italian origin for movable type have also focused on this rapid rise of Italy in movable-type printing. This may perhaps {{be explained by the}} prior eminence of Italy in the paper and printing trade. Additionally, Italy's economy was growing rapidly at the time, facilitating the spread of literacy. Christopher Columbus had a geographical book (printed by movable types) bought by his father. That book is in a Spanish museum. Finally, the city of Mainz was sacked in 1462, driving many (including a number of printers and <b>punch</b> <b>cutters)</b> into exile.|$|R
5000|$|In 1494 Manutius {{founded the}} Aldine Press in Venice. Yet, it wasn't until February 1495 that the Aldine Press had its first publication. The Aldine Press was owned half by Pier Francesco Barbarigo, whose uncle was the doge, Agostino Barbarigo. The other half {{was owned by}} Andrea Torresani. Manutius owned 1/5 of Torresani's share. Aldus Manutius desired to {{preserve}} ancient Greek literature and make it accessible to everyday people by printing editions of Greek classics. He wanted typefaces designed {{to look like the}} handwriting of humanists, both in Latin and Greek. Cursive was the norm for everyday handwriting in Venice, but at the time, published works only contained block lettering. By creating a cursive typeface, Manutius could make the works he published more personal. Manutius hired Francesco Griffo of Bologna as the <b>punch</b> <b>cutter</b> to create the new typeface [...] "and the resulting roman face was first used to print Cardinal Pietro Bembo's De Aetna in 1495." [...] This roman face was also the first model of italic type and used until 1501.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, {{the films}} were {{prepared}} to perform a puncture test. To follow the duration on the soil of the mulching materials, a different preformed disk of chitosan-based films {{was put on the}} soil in the same condition of the experimental plot. Six discs were picked up every 2  weeks and performed puncture test on them. This test was carried out with an Instron machine, (model 4301, Instron, Canton, MA, USA) [16, 23]. Briefly, the samples were cut with a <b>punch</b> <b>cutter</b> with a diameter of 42  mm and were trapped in cups fixed {{on the underside of the}} Instron instrument. They underwent the action of a force exerted by a spherical dart linked to a steel rod fixed on the upper side of the apparatus. The dart, moving down at a fixed rate of 2  mm/min, penetrated the sample until its rupture. The applied load was recorded as a function of the displacement; the parameters obtained were normalized with respect to the half of the area of the sphere and with respect to an estimated value of the displacement of 10  mm.|$|E
40|$|Application of {{epoxy resin}} to make {{specimen}} punching pad was studied. The specimen punching pad compound {{was made from}} epoxy resin, CaCO 3 as filler, colour paste, and hardener. The compound was moulded in to specimen punching and moulding by casting moulding during 24 hours. Physical test result of the compound saw that compound which it consist of epoxy resin : 100 parts, CaCO 3 : 20 parts, hardener : 100 parts, colour paste : 1 required, has physical property like the physical property of the imported specimen punching pad. Presence of CaCO 3 as filler caused the specimen punching pad surface which it <b>punched</b> by <b>cutter</b> became brittle...|$|R
40|$|An {{international}} {{panel of}} type and design experts gathered at Sheridan on September 21, 2015 {{to talk about}} the form of typography and how its history contributes to its future. The panelists were Matthew Carter, Rod McDonald, Allan Haley and Charles Nix of Monotype. The discussion followed an exhibition and world premiere screening of a digitized and expanded film by Carl Dair, who designed Cartier – Canada 2 ̆ 7 s first Latin typeface. The film, Carl Dair at Enschedé: The Last Days of Metal Type features a digitized version of the 1957 silent film shot by Dair while studying in Holland with one of the last great European letter <b>punch</b> <b>cutters,</b> Paul Rädisch. It begins with a prologue by Canadian type designer Rod McDonald, who in 1998, updated and expanded Dair 2 ̆ 7 s Cartier typeface for digital technology. The film is narrated by Matthew Carter, one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading typeface designers who also studied with Rädisch. The film was co-produced by Sheridan College and Massey College at the University of Toronto. The exhibit in the Sheridan Art Gallery, opened prior to the film screening, included artifacts such as didactic panels, photographs, sketches, tools, letters and books. It told the story of Carl Dair 2 ̆ 7 s quest to create Canada 2 ̆ 7 s first Latin typeface as part of the 1967 centennial as well as Rod McDonald 2 ̆ 7 s redesign. The panel discussion was part of Sheridan’s Creative Campus Series. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Weeks later, Cutter {{sees that}} Aubrey is {{starting}} to care for Joey, and calls her out on it. Aubrey denies it, though several moments {{make it clear that}} she is in love with Joey. Fed up, Cutter starts an affair with Jessica Buchanan, who is currently Tess, which angers Aubrey. Tess finds out about their scheme and wants in, and Cutter agrees, much to the dismay of Aubrey. In April 2011, Tess and her husband Robert Ford lose custody of Ryder, putting Cutter and Aubrey's scheme in jeopardy when Aubrey volunteers to get temporary custody of Ryder with Joey, which causes Cutter to break up with Aubrey for good. However, Tess meets Cutter and reveals that she attacked Ford and has a new plan: They could get married as another way of not committing her into St. Anne's. On May 5, 2011, Tess and Cutter marry, and Ford <b>punches</b> <b>Cutter</b> when he finds out. After they got married, Cutter later experiences Jessica morphing into another alter named Wes (named after Jessica's ex-fiancé Brody Lovett's friend Wes Granger from his days as part of the Navy SEALS team during their war days) after having an argument with Brody over Tess/Jessica. Cutter also meets Jessica's other alter Bess after Wes was arrested for aiding and abetting Marty Saybrooke's kidnapping of Natalie Buchanan and John McBain's son Liam. Jessica eventually morphs back to being Tess again, and she is released on bail. After having to deal with Jessica's other alters Wes and Bess, Cutter gets fed up with Jessica's DID, and decides to double cross his wife by going to see her parents to discuss a deal to get Jessica serious professional help by using blackmail and extortion to get his way as payback for having to put up with their daughter's mental issues on May 25, 2011. In exchange for getting Tess committed to St. Anne's, Cutter makes an extortion deal with Clint and his ex-wife Victoria Lord to get his piece of the family fortune and the Buchanan Mansion where he kicks out Joey, Aubrey, Ryder, and Aubrey's best friend Rama Patel on June 1, 2011. Rama convinces Cutter to let her still stay in the mansion by lying to him about not wanting Aubrey to break up with him to stay with Joey, and blackmailing him about a [...] "dirty little secret" [...] that he's been keeping from Aubrey. Cutter also welcomes in Rama's husband Vimal Patel to move into the mansion after he is exonerated from prison after he took the fall for Clint for switching the DNA paternity results for his boss' daughters. On June 17, 2011, Rama blackmails Cutter to agree to Ford's request to end his marriage to Tess by signing divorce papers.|$|R
