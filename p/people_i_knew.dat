500|$|In 1976, at age 16 and as {{a member}} of the Melbourne punk rock band Young Charlatans, Howard wrote [...] "Shivers". Discussing the song's origins, Howard said that [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "intended as an ironic comment on the way that I felt that <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> were making hysterical things out of what were {{essentially}} high school crushes". He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song.|$|E

I believe that faith gives me a path to be {{cleansed}} of sin and have eternal life." [...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nightfly is more unapologetically jazzy than Fagen's {{previous}} work with Steely Dan, and his lyrics are more wistful and nostalgic than biting. Fagen aimed for his lyrics to have [...] "as little irony as possible," [...] and {{his goal was}} to make an album that was fun to listen to. As many of the songs come from an adolescent viewpoint, he hoped for them to maintain [...] "a certain innocence." [...] Walter Becker was responsible for the more sardonic elements in Steely Dan, and many writers have considered his absence the reason for the album's [...] "warm and nostalgic" [...] tone. Another difference between The Nightfly and his work with Becker is that it maintains a focus on a [...] "certain period [...] motif," [...] according to Fagen. Though Fagen hints in the album's liner notes that it is an autobiographical piece, he downplayed this notion in a later interview: [...] "It is not me exactly. It is a composite character of myself, what I remember and <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> Plus, it includes my feelings in retrospect." ...|$|E

2500|$|New Catholic episcopates, {{which ran}} {{parallel}} to the established Anglican episcopates, and a Catholic conversion drive awakened fears of 'papal aggression' and relations between the Catholic Church and the establishment remained frosty. At {{the end of the}} nineteenth century one contemporary wrote that [...] "the prevailing opinion of the religious <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> and loved was that Roman Catholic worship is idolatry, and that it was better to be an Atheist than a Papist". When former Prime Minister Gladstone wrote a polemic against the infallibility declaration of the Catholic Church, it sold 150,000 copies in 1874.

2500|$|Rock {{musician}} David Bowie famously {{declared himself}} bisexual {{in an interview}} with Melody Maker in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, [...] "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's {{the best thing that ever}} happened to me." [...] In a 1983 interview, he said it was [...] "the biggest mistake I ever made", elaborating in 2002 he explained [...] "I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of <b>people.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer [...] America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, the Defense Intelligence Agency {{received}} {{information from}} a source considered reliable, predicting that [...] "the situation is presently more critical than previously reported" [...] and postulating a 50% chance Iraq would invade Iran. An April 11 CIA analysis is more blunt: [...] "Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran {{with the aim of}} toppling the Khomeini regime"—and had [...] "sought to engage the Kuwaitis to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran." [...] Carter himself has confirmed that fear the U.S. hostages would be executed if Iraq attacked was one reason he approved a failed rescue mission on April 24. In light of these alerts, the claims of senior Carter administration officials involved with Iran—including White, Naas, Precht, and head of the National Security Council (NSC)'s Iran desk Gary Sick—that they were surprised by the invasion require some explanation. In all likelihood, these warnings went unheeded because [...] "those who doubted they amounted to compelling evidence won the argument. In effect, they were right. Only in early July did U.S. observers note the movement of Iraqi assets out of garrison with war-related 'basic loads' of ammunition" [...] and it was not until September 17 that the CIA indicated [...] "the intensification of border clashes between Iran and Iraq has reached a point where a serious conflict is now a distinct possibility." [...] Even then, as recounted by State Department official W. Nathaniel Howell, U.S. officials remained unsure what to make of Saddam's intentions: [...] "We all followed Saddam's actions and rhetoric closely but most <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> tended to believe he was posturing." [...] When the invasion came on September 22, [...] "it was unclear whether Saddam had simply fallen into a rage following a smaller skirmish." [...] White recalled: [...] "The outbreak of war did, in fact, {{come as a surprise to}} most of us because a decent portion of Iraq's ground forces were still in garrison. The hasty movement of the remaining units up to the front immediately after the beginning of major hostilities was the activity that tended to nudge me toward the abrupt scenario in which Saddam ordered the attack before all military preparations had been completed." [...] Thus, in the view of Chris Emery, [...] "it is unlikely that the United States was ever in possession of clear evidence of Saddam's intention to invade Iran. Although the Carter administration drastically underestimated the scale of Saddam's plans, the disorganized and apparently impetuous nature of the invasion, with much of the Iraqi army still in garrison, and occurring in the context of border skirmishes and aggressive propaganda, muddied the waters for U.S. observers." ...|$|E
