25|$|At the restart, Hill and Schumacher again {{held their}} positions, whilst Coulthard led the more circumspect Ferraris through Sainte Dévote, with Alesi jumping ahead of Berger. On this {{occasion}} {{there were no}} major incidents, although Katayama sustained light damage to his car's front wing {{as a result of}} a brush with Morbidelli. As the drivers completed the first lap, Hill led by 0.5seconds from Schumacher, who was followed in turn by Coulthard, Alesi, Berger, Herbert, Häkkinen, Irvine, Brundle, Barrichello, Blundell, Panis, Frentzen, Badoer, Morbidelli, Katayama, Martini, Boullion, Gachot, Moreno, Montermini, Salo, Diniz and Inoue. In the early laps, Hill gradually built a lead of nearly twoseconds over Schumacher by lap10, with the two pulling away in tandem from Coulthard, who was at this point a further eightseconds behind the Benetton. By this stage there had already been two retirements: Häkkinen's Mercedes engine failed due to a fuel <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> problem on the ninthlap of the race, and Moreno spun at Sainte Dévote when a brake fluid leak caused him to lose control of his Forti a lap later. Morbidelli also made an early unscheduled stop to cure a serious tyre vibration caused by a section of tie-rope from a tyre-warming blanket becoming jammed in one of his rear wheels, the Footwork driver dropping to the tail of the field in the process.|$|E

2500|$|The RASCAL was {{powered by}} a XLR67-BA-1 rocket engine also {{developed}} by Bell. The XLR-67 provided [...] of thrust using three vertical in-line thrust chambers. All three thrust chambers of the XLR67 were operated during the missile's boost phase which could last up to two minutes. At {{the conclusion of the}} boost phase the upper and lower chambers of the XLR-67 were shut down and thrust was sustained by the center chamber alone. Fuel for the XLR-67 included [...] of white fuming nitric acid oxidizer and [...] of JP-4 jet fuel. The oxidizer was stored in a series of tube bundles instead of a spherical storage tank. It is believed this configuration was chosen because it weighed less than a spherical tank of the same volume. Propellant was provided to the thrust chambers by a turbine driven propellant pump. A gas generator powered the propellant pump. The propellants were glow plug ignited. Bell contracted with Purdue University for the glow plug ignition system. Aerojet provided the <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> assemblies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} the {{takeover}} of the Rover Group by BMW, who brought their own range of diesel engines, made the Storm engine largely redundant. Only the 5-cylinder version made it to production as the powerplant for the Defender and the new Discovery Series II as the 'Td5' in 1998. Offering more power and greater refinement than the 300Tdi the Td5 greatly improved {{the appeal of the}} Discovery but caused concern amongst many operators of the Defender due to its electronic engine management systems which were considered to be less reliable and more difficult to repair 'in the field' than the mechanical injection systems used on previous Land Rover diesel engines. In deference to these concerns (including those voiced by the British Army) Land Rover kept the 300Tdi in production for fitment to special-order vehicles (see above). It transpired that the Td5's electronics were highly reliable. Early engines suffered two isolated mechanical failures—sudden and complete failure of the oil <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> and 'cylinder head shuffle' caused by weak retaining studs. Both these faults were fixed within 2 years of the engine starting production and the Td5 is now considered highly reliable. In 2002 the engine was improved to reach Euro 3 antipollution stage, and an EGR valve system was introduced. Electronics were also updated to improve the low-speed throttle response which had been prone to producing [...] a jerky power delivery in off-road or towing situations.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} a graphene quantum <b>pump,</b> adiabatically <b>driven</b> by two thin potential barriers vibrating around their equilibrium positions.

30|$|The {{improvement}} in the reliability and availability of the pumping engine components, which {{is a part of}} the general technological progress, has caused that the availability of the 2 [*]×[*] 60 % (2 [*]×[*] 50 %) systems driven with electric motors is only slightly different from the values achieved by the EM 3 [*]×[*] 50 % or BPT 100 %[*]+[*]EM 30 % configurations. On the other hand, the investment expenditures for the EM 2 [*]×[*] 60 % (EM 2 [*]×[*] 50 %) systems are much lower compared to the other two [6]. For these reasons, in many recent constructions of high capacity power units, it was the <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by a frequency-controlled electric motor that was selected, not the <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by the turbine. Despite the electric power losses in the generator, transformer, supply network, frequency converter and motor, this system is sometimes more efficient than the feed <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by a condensing turbine.|$|R

50|$|Canadian {{accident}} {{investigators found}} that a bevel gear in the oil <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> had failed, shutting off lubrication to the propeller. This caused the propeller to decouple from the engine, allowing it to windmill at high speed. Moreover, during the emergency descent, the pilots had allowed the aircraft's airspeed to increase {{too close to the}} maximum allowable. This put significant strain on the windmilling propeller and in all probability caused it to fail in flight. The possibility of the bevel gear drive failing causing the propeller to windmill had not been foreseen by Vickers engineers, and there was therefore no mention of it in the training or operations manual.|$|E
50|$|Differences in the Japanese {{block to}} Mexican are also present.

They also used a single row chain for the upper timing assembly without valve cover mounted guide. In addition to this, they removed the rearmost cam journal in the Mexico head. The crank rides on individually capped bearings with a slightly smaller diameter than the Japanese block, with shorter, slightly lower compression pistons in cylinders that have thicker walls than the Japanese DE. They retained the knock sensor and piston oilers.|$|E
50|$|Performance {{modifications}} {{started with}} an upgraded engine, which was enhanced by Lotus {{from the standard}} Opel 2969 cc 24v straight six unit (used in the GSi). The engine was enlarged to a capacity of 3615 cc. Lotus then added twin Garrett T25 turbochargers, which provide up to 0.7 bar of boost from about 1500 rpm. The original distributor ignition system of the engine was replaced with a three-coil wasted spark system. The distributor drive was re-purposed as a water <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> for the water-air intercooler circuit. The intercooler itself is manufactured by Behr and is capable of reducing {{the temperature of the}} compressed charge from 120 °C to 60 °C.|$|E
