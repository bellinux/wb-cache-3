The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated <b>policy</b> <b>to</b> deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.|$|E

5|$|De Gaulle {{decided that}} France, though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no longer}} participate in the NATO military organization.

German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank.

These attempts ruined relations and increased the support of Finnish movements vying for self-government.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{experiences}} of OECD countries with population aging and their policy responses, and suggest directions and measures of medium and long-term employment <b>policies</b> <b>to</b> cope with population aging in a comprehensive perspective. Specifically, following the policy objective of sustainable economic growth, we systematically classify <b>policy</b> types <b>to</b> cope with population aging and review possibilities and limitations of each policy type, while also considering Korea-specific situations as well as {{the experiences of}} other OECD countries. There are two broad types of employment <b>policies</b> <b>to</b> sustain economic growth in an aging society. One is to increase the quantity of labor force and the other is to enhance the quality of labor force. <b>Policies</b> <b>to</b> increase the quantity of labor force include pro-natalist policies, immigration <b>policies,</b> and <b>policies</b> <b>to</b> fully mobilize the labor resources of women and older people. <b>Policies</b> <b>to</b> enhance the quality of labor force include human resource development and flexicurity policies in the labor market. Our review suggests that direct pro-natalist <b>policies</b> seem <b>to</b> be ineffective. Also immigration policies cannot fundamentally solve the problem caused by population aging. <b>Policies</b> <b>to</b> fully mobilize the labor resources of women and older people seem to be the most effective policy. However, labor productivity should be an engine of economic growth in the long run when labor input reaches the limit of its capacity. In conclusion, in the long run, it is most important to enhance the quality of human capital and improve the functioning of the labor market to cope with the challenges of population aging...|$|R

5|$|In 1906, the {{government}} issued a <b>policy</b> <b>to</b> limit its {{financial support to}} one shrine per village.
