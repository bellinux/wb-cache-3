5000|$|In September 1959, Cary Grant {{confessed to}} Look {{magazine}} {{that he had}} taken LSD under a doctor's supervision, and it had changed his life. Grant's therapist, Mortimer Hartman, described LSD as [...] "a <b>psychic</b> <b>energizer</b> which empties the subconscious and intensifies emotion and memory a hundred times". Grant said that, with the help of LSD, he had [...] "found that he had a tough inner core of strength", and that when he was young, he [...] "was very dependent upon older men and women. Now, people came to him for help." [...] Williams stated that she wanted {{to be one of those}} people. As she said in Million Dollar Mermaid, [...] "At that point, I really didn't know who I was. Was I that glamorous femme fatale?... Was I just another broken-down divorc√©e whose husband left her with all the bills and three kids?" [...] Shortly after reading the article, she contacted Grant. He called his doctor and made an appointment for her. Williams said LSD seemed like instant psychoanalysis.|$|E

"The {{preliminary}} {{report of the}} study indicates that participants received methamphetamine and chlordiazepoxide along with the mescaline: 'In the individual sessions the drug regime consists of <b>psychic</b> <b>energizers</b> and a psychedelic drug (200 mg. of mescaline sulphate in these experiments), usually with additional energizer at mid-day' (Fadiman et al. 1965, p 4). The nature of these energizers is clarified later in the report where methedrine (methamphetamine) and librium (chlordiazepoxide) are explicitly mentioned (ibid, p B-1). Because the co-administration of other drugs was not described in the peer-reviewed publication by Harman et al. in Psychological Reports, very few subsequent commentators have noted this confound (Krippner (1968) notes the use of 'energizers' without comment)" [...] p.8 ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1959 it {{was used}} by over 2,000 {{physicians}} and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as [...] "chemically and clinically different {{from any of the}} tranquilizers, <b>psychic</b> <b>energizers</b> or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available." [...] During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, rats, cats, and dogs. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to phenobarbital in its anticonvulsant properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of barbiturates. Animal tests were conducted in the Boston Zoo and the San Diego Zoo. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various psychoses and neuroses were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, anxiety, tension, and motor excitement were [...] "effectively reduced." [...] The most positive results were observed among alcoholic patients. It was reported that ulcers and dermatologic problems, both of which involving emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide.|$|R
40|$|Cercine (Diazepam) is a oroad tranquilizer, having stron g {{actions of}} muscular relaxant, anti-convulsive {{sedative}} and <b>psychic</b> <b>energizering</b> effects, It possesses several times stronger actions than Chlordiazepoxide in these respects. Excellent clinical effectiveness {{has been reported}} in various field of medicine. This article deals with the re s ults of clinical use of "Cercine" as single trial for patients with neurogenous urinary tract diseases without organic lesion and as combined therapy with antibiotics for patients with various urinary tract infections. Out of 16 cases of neurogenous urinary tract diseases treate d, excellent, good and no effects were observed in 10, 4 and 2 cases respectively. Out of 12 cases of various urinary tract infections treated, excellent, good and no efects were seen in 5, 6 and 1 cases respectively. As side effects, slight drowsiness was mentioned by 3 patients out of 28 cases, but it was not so much as to discontinue the medication...|$|R

5000|$|Whitaker {{begins by}} {{reviewing}} {{the discovery of}} antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. These were discovered as side effects during research for antihistamines (specifically promethazine), gram negative antibiotics (specifically mephenesin) and the anti-tuberculosis agents isoniazid and iproniazid respectively. The psychiatric mechanisms of action of these drugs were not known {{at the time and}} these were initially called major tranquilizers (now typical antipsychotics) due to their induction of [...] "euphoric quietude"; minor tranquilizers (now benzodiazepines) and <b>psychic</b> <b>energizers</b> (now antidepressants) due to patients [...] "dancing in the wards." [...] These compounds were developed during a period of growth for the pharmaceutical industry bolstered by the 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment, giving physicians monopolistic prescribing rights thus aligning the interests of physicians and pharmaceutical companies. This also followed the industry's development of [...] "magic bullets" [...] that treat people with, for example, diabetes, which according to Whitaker provided an analogy to sell the idea of these drugs to the public. It was not until many years later, after the mechanisms of these drugs were determined, that the serotonergic hypothesis of depression and dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia were developed to fall in line with the drug's mechanisms. According to Whitaker's analysis of the primary literature, lower levels of serotonin and higher levels of dopamine [...] "have proved to be true in patients WITH prior exposure to antidepressants or antipsychotics (ie as homeostatic mechanisms) but NOT in patients without prior exposure." ...|$|R
