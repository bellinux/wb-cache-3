5000|$|The term deubré {{originates}} with a Nike footwear designer, Damon Clegg. In a 1994 <b>product</b> <b>presentation</b> for {{an internal}} group, Clegg pointed out features of his {{design for a}} Nike ACG boot, eventually coming to the shoelace tag, for which he lacked a term. Falling back on a word he had picked up from his Glasgow-native college roommate, he called it a [...] "doobrie". Doobrie is a Scottish placeholder name, akin to [...] "watchamacallit" [...] or [...] "thingy". Though Clegg suspected his audience had mistaken doobrie for a technical term, he continued his presentation. The word caught on. Nike documents reflect later uses of the word on designers' sketches and computer files with the Clegg spelling. However, over time, the pronunciation evolved to doo-bray and spellings would come to vary widely from [...] "doobray" [...] to [...] "dubret" [...] and [...] "deubré". The doo-bray pronunciation has become commonplace among sneaker collectors, with wide disagreement as to its spelling. With {{the publication of a}} catalog for the Nike Air Force 1 in 2006, Nike came to embrace the spelling [...] "deubré".|$|E

5000|$|In Case E-3/02 Paranova v. Merck'''', {{concerning}} the repackaging of pharmaceuticals, the Court {{departed from the}} ECJ’s previous criterion, that of making the right to repackage dependent on the so-called criterion of necessity, according to which, the repackaging is permitted only insofar as necessary to surmount obstacles to the free movement of goods. However, the issue in Paranova v. Merck concerned packaging design, which had not previously been addressed before the ECJ. The EFTA Court {{emphasized the importance of}} free trade in markets partitioned along national boundaries, such as the pharmaceutical market, where certain privileges are conferred on parallel importers. Once the right to repackage and to reaffix the original trade mark is established and market access is thereby ensured, the parallel importer is to be considered as an operator with basically the same rights as the manufacturer and the trade mark proprietor {{within the framework of the}} Trade Mark Directive. Thus, its strategy of <b>product</b> <b>presentation</b> and the new design cannot be subject to the necessity criterion.

40|$|Although {{there are}} many {{definitions}} of genre, virtually all of them include the ideas of ownership by a discourse community and social acceptance by this community. Modern genre theory emphasises the role of genres in social interaction. Genre {{is seen as a}} multidimensional phenomenon. Paré and Smart believe genres must be defined taking into account not only textual features but also the processes involved in producing and interpreting the texts. Berkenkotter and Huckin note down five basic features in the concept of genre: dynamism, situatedness, form and content, duality of structure, and community ownership.
