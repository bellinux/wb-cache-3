The relaunch of Victoria Secret's sports line, VSX, soon followed, along with her first official campaign as an Angel: promoting the company's fragrance Very Sexy Dare.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{her role}} in {{ensuring}} Güyük's election as Khagan, the relationship between Töregene and her son eventually collapsed. Güyük's brother Koden accused Fatima of using witchcraft to damage his health; when Koden died a few months later, Güyük insisted that his mother hand Fatima over for execution. Töregene threatened her son Güyük that she would commit suicide to spite him. Güyük's men seized Fatima and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> death by sewing up all of her orifices and dumping her into water; Töregene's supporters in the imperial household were simultaneously purged. Within 18 months of Fatima's death, Töregene herself died under still unexplained circumstances.|$|E

25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dirrty", {{directed}} by David LaChapelle, {{was intended to}} publicize Aguilera's new image. It depicts sexual fetishes such as mud wrestling and muscle worshipping. The controversial video eliminated her image as a bubblegum pop singer. It received criticism from various news publications and other recording artists, and it was banned on Thai television due to its sexual content. Aguilera defended the video, calling it inspirational as it <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the forefront. [...] "Dirrty" [...] was included on the setlists of Aguilera's three major concert tours: the Justified and Stripped Tour (2003), the Stripped Tour (2003), and the Back to Basics Tour (2006–08).|$|E
2500|$|On 7 November 1455 the retrial {{opened at}} Notre Dame Cathedral. Joan's family were present, and Isabelle made an impassioned speech which began: [...] "I had a {{daughter}} born in lawful wedlock, whom I had furnished worthily with the sacraments of baptism and confirmation and had reared in the fear of God {{and respect for the}} tradition of the Church... yet although she never did think, conceive, or do anything whatever which set her out of the path of the faith... certain enemies ... had her arraigned in religious trial... in a trial perfidious, violent, iniquitous, and without shadow of right... did they condemn her in a fashion damnable and criminal, and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> death very cruelly by fire... for the damnation of their souls and in notorious, infamous, and irreparable damage done to me, Isabelle, and mine".|$|E

2500|$|Singer-songwriter Courtney Marie Andrews {{provided}} backing vocals {{for five}} of the album's tracks. Adkins, who met Andrews through mutual friends in Phoenix, Arizona, described her as [...] "extremely talented", and stated that she is [...] "very versatile; she can sing really high. [...] There’s a few spots on the record that I knew I wanted a female vocal. [...] She came down and cut those and it worked out so well. I <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> work on some other things that I thought might be interesting to get more voices in there." [...] Andrews subsequently joined the band on tour, with Adkins stating, [...] "there's female vocals on most of our records, so it's nice to have that represented live. [...] It's nice having her around to cover the higher stuff that I don’t normally do live." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Bonduel McCourt (or {{according}} to some accounts Elizabeth Nellis McCourt) was born in 1854 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin to Irish-Catholic immigrants Peter and Elizabeth McCourt. She later {{claimed to have been}} born in 1860. She appears to have been christened on October 7, 1854 at St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church. Called Lizzie as a child, the fourth of eleven children, she grew up in a middle-class family in a two-story house. [...] Her father was a partner in a local clothing store and owner of Oshkosh's first theater, McCourt Hall. Her mother fostered in her beautiful daughter the belief that her looks were of great worth, excusing her from domestic chores so as to preserve her skin and allowing her to dream of a future as an actress. Concerned by his wife's indulgence in their young and striking daughter, Peter McCourt thought it prudent to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> work at the clothing store, where she was often in the company of fashionable young men. At age 16, she was a [...] "fashionably plump" [...] blond-haired young woman with a hectic social schedule.|$|E

Passengers who do not {{themselves}} recognize the Oneida as the former Hearst yacht {{are likely to be}} advised of this chapter of her history anyhow, for over a stairway leading downward from the main deck is a sign: [...] "MUSEUM Admission 10c." [...] Our traveller paid a dime and descended to the museum, which he found to be the Hearst living quarters, faithfully preserved in their elegance: two of the rooms, usually occupied by Mr. Hearst and his secretary in the old days, fitted with mahogany furnishings, dark-red damask hangings, and notably soft and deep bedding accessories; and the third room, Mrs. Hearst's, in ivory and gilt with a bath which even now has gold-plated fittings. The curator of the museum is a young lady who chats interestingly about the Hearsts, dealing in both fact and surmise, and sells souvenir postals of the interior for ten cents each.|$|E
