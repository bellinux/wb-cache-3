25|$|The Thameslink Programme has {{lengthened}} the platforms at most stations {{south of}} Bedford to 12-car capability. St Pancras, Cricklewood, Hendon and Luton Airport Parkway were already long enough, but bridges at Kentish Town mean it cannot expand beyond the current 8-car <b>platform</b> <b>length.</b> West Hampstead Thameslink {{has a new}} footbridge and a new station building. In September 2014 the current Thameslink Great Northern franchise was awarded and trains on this route are currently operated by Thameslink. In 2018 the Thameslink network will expand when some Southern services are merged into it.|$|E
25|$|Thirty new train units (named DT3) {{were ordered}} {{and have been}} {{delivered}} for U3 operations. Those trains are designed to operate without a driver, controlled by an ATC system from Siemens, and will provide the passengers with an unobstructed view from the front window into the tunnel. A normally locked drivers panel exists at every front window which enables service employees to drive DT3 units by hand if required. As with all Nuremberg subway trains, these units consist of two carriages and are half the <b>platform</b> <b>length.</b> They can be run as a single unit (short train) or coupled as double unit (long train), depending on passenger numbers. For {{the first time in}} a Nuremberg subway train, the two carriages of a unit are built with an accessible gangway. This is intended to improve passenger distribution in the train as many stations in the system have their exits at the very ends of the platform and therefore often the first and the last carriages of a 4 carriage (long) train are rather full, while the two middle carriages are relatively empty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was tiled in green and white, with decorative details. [...] At platform level, the stations {{were provided with}} a standardised tiling design incorporating the station name, but with quickly identified individual colour schemes and geometric tile patterns formed in repeating panels along the <b>platform</b> <b>length.</b> [...] Directional signs were {{also included in the}} tile designs. [...] The tiled surfaces created a unifying theme, and proved easy to maintain.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1980s both Slependen and Jong Stations were in poor shape {{and in need}} for modernization. In particular, the {{platforms}} were less than [...] long. NSB had just ordered new center cars for their Class 69 commuter trains and a double set would therefore exceed the <b>platform</b> <b>length.</b> Both stations were located in curves. NSB therefore proposed merging the two station, located [...] apart, and instead building a new station between them. This was estimated to cost 8.4 million Norwegian krone in 1986. This involved moving the station [...] towards Sandvika. The new station, designed by Arne Henriksen, opened on 23 May 1993, {{the same day the}} old station and Jong were closed. The old station was demolished in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|A daily {{through train}} service {{operated}} between Cleethorpes and London Kingâ€™s Cross via Grimsby, Market Rasen and Lincoln until 1993 {{when it was}} discontinued due to issues with {{the length of the}} platforms at Lincoln not being long enough for high-speed trains. This necessitated passengers changing trains at Newark when travelling to or from the capital. However, the East Coast Main Line passes through the county and so it is possible to catch direct trains to London, Leeds or Edinburgh from Grantham. As of the December 2008 timetable change, there is a daily service from Lincoln to London St Pancras, via Nottingham. [...] In the summer of 2008, a major refit of Lincoln Central station improved signalling and customer facilities but did little to change the <b>platform</b> <b>length</b> issue.|$|E
2500|$|Elverson Road, Royal Albert, Gallions Reach and Cutty Sark {{have not}} been {{extended}} for three-car trains; such extension may be impossible in some cases. Selective door operation is used, with emergency walkways in case a door fails to remain shut. [...] is underground, and both costs and the risk to nearby historic buildings prevent platform extension. The tunnel has an emergency walkway. Additional work beyond that needed to take the three-car trains was also carried out at some stations. This included replacing canopies with more substantial ones along the full <b>platform</b> <b>length.</b> A new [...] has been built [...] east of the former location as nearby curves precluded lengthening. [...] now has a third platform. [...] was closed until March 2009 and re-opened as a single-track three-car terminus with two platforms, one for boarding {{and the other for}} alighting.|$|E

50|$|This {{station has}} two {{high-level}} island platforms, each four cars long and accessible by stairway {{from the north}} side of East 241st Street. Because of these short <b>platform</b> <b>lengths,</b> only four cars can receive and discharge passengers at the station.|$|R
5000|$|The two facing <b>platform</b> <b>lengths</b> at Isleworth are {{constrained}} by a bridge over a road {{at each end}} and front-seven-doors opening is used for most rolling stock. Forerunner 8-car slam door trains fitted the <b>platform</b> <b>lengths,</b> as at two other stations along the line. A commercial street adjoins the station becoming Hounslow High Street within 500 metres, to the west. The more suburban district of Isleworth is primarily south-east of the station, comprising the [...] "Woodlands" [...] residential neighbourhood and a medieval riverside hub of Old Isleworth for which the railway station is the same distance as Syon Lane. Those parts of Isleworth north and east tend to be termed Spring Grove.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of four-carriage trains on 18 August 2002, services could not stop at Grant Street due to the <b>platform</b> <b>lengths</b> with alternative road transport provided. In May 2009, work was completed at the station to extend the platforms, and four-carriage trains now stop at the station.|$|R
50|$|Trains are 2 m {{wide and}} 26 m long (composed of {{permanently}} coupled two-car sets), and are rubber-tyred. Platforms are 52 m in length (though {{only half of}} the <b>platform</b> <b>length</b> is currently open to the public), long enough for two units. Each unit can carry 156 passengers.|$|E
50|$|In circa the 1870 an NER {{footbridge}} was added. The platforms were {{extended in}} 1888 to 364 and 383 ft, then to 390 and 405 ft in 1906, timber platform extensions were also added later, giving a <b>platform</b> <b>length</b> of 480 ft at peak. In the 19th century {{there were also}} ticket platforms.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} located on the second {{basement}} level of the terminal (level -2) and is reached only from the terminal via two escalators. Like all stations newly-built for the Dresden S-Bahn, it has a usable <b>platform</b> <b>length</b> of 140 metres; this {{is located on}} an island between the two terminating tracks.|$|E

50|$|Saint-Michel is {{a station}} on Line 4 of the Paris MÃ©tro in the 5th arrondissement. Located in the Quartier Latin, {{it offers a}} {{connection}} to the St-Michel - Notre-Dame RER station on RER lines B and C. The <b>platform</b> <b>lengths</b> are 110 metres, longer than the 90-105 metre length of most line 4 station platforms.|$|R
50|$|Another of {{the subtle}} {{technical}} {{benefits of the}} design was {{that all of the}} pointwork was concentrated on one folding baseboard, the other merely being the <b>platform</b> <b>lengths.</b> This simplified their operation, especially in the early days when electric point motors were rare and remote operation of points would be done by the mechanical wire-in-tube method, which could not cross the baseboard hinge.|$|R
