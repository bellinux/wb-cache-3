5000|$|In addition, Johnson {{also made}} several more accusations, {{including}} that {{people at the}} daycare had sexual encounters with animals, that [...] "Peggy drilled a child under the arms" [...] and [...] "Ray flew in the air." [...] Ray Buckey was questioned, but was not prosecuted {{due to lack of}} evidence. The police then sent a form letter to about 200 parents of students at the McMartin school, stating that their children might have been abused, and asking the parents to question their children. The text of the letter read:September 8, 1983. Dear Parent: This Department is conducting a criminal investigation involving child molestation (288 P.C.) Ray Buckey, an employee of Virginia McMartin's Pre-School, was arrested September 7, 1983 by this Department. The following procedure is obviously an unpleasant one, but {{to protect the rights of}} your children as well as the rights of the accused, this inquiry is necessary for a complete investigation. Records indicate that your child has been or is currently a student at the pre-school. We are asking your assistance in this continuing investigation. Please question your child to see if he or she has been a witness to any crime or if he or she has been a victim. Our investigation indicates that possible criminal acts include: oral sex, fondling of genitals, buttock or chest area, and sodomy, possibly committed under the pretense of [...] "taking the child's temperature." [...] Also photos may have been taken of children without their clothing. Any information from your child regarding having ever observed Ray Buckey to leave a classroom alone with a child during any nap period, or if they have ever observed Ray Buckey tie up a child, is important. <b>Please</b> <b>complete</b> the enclosed information form and return it to this Department in the enclosed stamped return envelope as soon as possible. We will contact you if circumstances dictate same. We ask you to please keep this investigation strictly confidential because of the nature of the charges and the highly emotional effect it could have on our community. Please do not discuss this investigation with anyone outside your immediate family. Do not contact or discuss the investigation with Raymond Buckey, any member of the accused defendant's family, or employees connected with the McMartin Pre-School.|$|E

5000|$|In jacket design, Bacon found {{a talent}} for [...] "finding {{something}} that would be a synthesis graphically of what the story was about." [...] He would work for about three weeks on a book - the first two reading and making a sketch, and the third to finalize the design once it was approved. He didn't draw thumbnails or multiple sketches, he simply provided one image of his idea.
