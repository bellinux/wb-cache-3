5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As <b>people</b> <b>age,</b> two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated the {{estimated}} average requirements (EARs) and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for copper in 2001. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for copper for <b>people</b> <b>age</b> 14 and older is 0.7mg/day. The RDA is 0.9mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. The RDA for pregnancy is 1.0mg/day. RDA for lactation is 1.3mg/day. For infants up to 12 months, AI is 0.22mg/day. For children age 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.34 to 0.7mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes.|$|E
