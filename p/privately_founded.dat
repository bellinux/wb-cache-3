25|$|In 2012, Mirvish {{announced}} a new condominium project designed by Frank Gehry, an acclaimed Canadian-born architect, dubbed Mirvish+Gehry Toronto. The project would necessitate the demolition of designated heritage properties at 274, 276, 284, and 322 King Street West, including the Princess of Wales Theatre. Located far south of Mirvish Village, the area was largely revitalized thanks to Ed Mirvish's investment in the Royal Alexandria and Poor Alex Theatres, and restaurant and shops leased or owned in the surrounding area. The Princess of Wales itself was the first privately funded and owned theatre in Canada to be built since 1907. The new complex would include facilities and a gallery for OCAD University, {{as well as a}} 60,000 square foot free gallery for Mirvish and his wife Audrey's collection. The project has yet to be approved by the City. Unlike previous <b>privately</b> <b>founded</b> Toronto museums (Bata Shoe Museum, Gardiner Museum), the gallery project is largely dependent on the sale of 2700 condominiums.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{left office}} as {{governor}} in January 1896. In February, Harrison {{made it clear}} that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president <b>privately</b> <b>found</b> unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.|$|R

40|$|The first {{essay is}} {{primarily}} a literature review that explains the organizational and economic perspectives of firm knowledge and explores the corporate governance mechanisms {{that are likely to}} influence firm knowledge. This study aims to review the emerging thoughts on knowledge based complementarities between economics and organization theory. Organization economics emphasizes organizational boundaries as determined by the minimization of transaction costs subject to the assumption of rational thought, opportunistic behavior, and bounded rationality. Organization theory on the other hand emphasizes the importance of internal organization and explains firm heterogeneity as a function of firm specific resources and capabilities. Such divergence in viewpoints of the two theories naturally led to a debate with each claiming to be more 2 ̆ 2 complete 2 ̆ 2 in explain the theory of the firm and its outcomes. However, this view has been challenged in favor of a more holistic understanding of the firm and its outcomes. Firm knowledge is generally used to uncover and explain complementarities between the two literatures. This review examines theoretical viewpoints of respective literature streams and the possible complementarities between organization economics and organization theory. ^ The review explains the relevance of examining possible complementarity between the two literatures in the context of CEE based firms. It also includes propositions that predict the complementary effect of knowledge and governance mechanisms on firm performance in transition economies. ^ The second essay considers the direct and joint influence of knowledge transfer processes and ownership form on success of strategic change in transition economies. This study classifies firms into three types based on their ownership form namely, state owned firms, privatized firms and <b>privately</b> <b>founded</b> firms. It is argued that the ownership form moderates the positive relationship between knowledge transfer processes used by top managers and strategic change due to the managerial incentives offered by the three forms of ownership. It is hypothesized that the relative strength of the relationship between knowledge transfer processes and strategic change is stronger for state owned firms compared to privatized firms and <b>privately</b> <b>founded</b> firms. A unique database from four transition economy countries is used to test the hypotheses. The results support most of the hypotheses and suggest that while privatized and <b>privately</b> <b>founded</b> firms perform better than state owned firms, the state owned firms experience greater strategic change than privatized and <b>privately</b> <b>founded</b> firms when ownership form is interacted with the knowledge transfer processes used in the firm. ^ The third essay argues that firms based in transition economies such as the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are expected to gain from advisory services of board of directors for achieving organizational transformation and competitive advantage. It is {{based on the premise that}} transition economy firms are shown to rely more on personal exchange of information and resources as compared to their counterparts in developed economies that are characterized by impersonal exchange in transactions. The first hypothesis predicts an inverted U shaped relationship between board size and firm performance. The next two hypotheses predict a positive relationship between the proportion of outside directors and board busyness, respectively, and firm performance in CEE countries. This study also develops competing hypotheses which predict the moderating effect of ownership type on the relationship between proportion of outside directors and performance of firms based in CEE countries. ...|$|E

40|$|In Europe, {{ever more}} private museums are now {{entering}} the field. This paper investigates {{the behavior of}} one of these private museums, using an institutional approach of cultural economics. The Beyeler museum in Basle, Switzerland, is a <b>privately</b> <b>founded</b> art museum with an extraordinary collection of art works. Though less than five years old, it is acknowledged to be the most successful museum in Switzerland in terms of number of visitors. However, the Beyeler museum is not completely private but receives public support. We analyze how this influences the museum&# 146;s behavior: (1) The directorate of the Beyeler museum stays away from the art market with its collection as public institutions do. (2) The museum embarks on a self-propelling process concerning special exhibitions, therewith losing some of its uniqueness. (3) Concerning visitors&# 146; amenities, differences between private and publicnmuseums emerge but to a lesser extent than expected according to theory. ...|$|E
