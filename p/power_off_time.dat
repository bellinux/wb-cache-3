40|$|Following recent {{experiments}} on power law blinking behavior of single nano-crystals, we calculate two-time intensity correlation functions for these systems. We use a simple two state (on and off) stochastic model {{to describe the}} dynamics. We classify possible behaviors of the correlation function and show that aging, e. g., dependence of the correlation function on age of process t, is obtained for classes of the on <b>time</b> and <b>off</b> <b>time</b> distributions relevant to experimental situation. Analytical asymptotic scaling behaviors of the intensity correlation in the double time t and t' domain are obtained. In the scaling limit [...] > h(x), where four classes of behaviors are found: (i) finite averaged on and <b>off</b> <b>times</b> x=t' (standard behavior) (ii) on and <b>off</b> <b>times</b> with identical <b>power</b> law behaviors x=t/t' (case relevant for capped nano-crystals). (iii) exponential on <b>times</b> and <b>power</b> law <b>off</b> <b>times</b> x=tt' (case relevant for uncapped nano-crystals). (iv) For defected <b>off</b> <b>time</b> distribution we also find x=t+t'. Origin of aging behavior is explained based on simple diffusion model. We argue that the diffusion controlled reaction A+B AB, when followed on a single particle level exhibits aging behavior. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWire {{electrical}} discharge turning (WEDT) {{is suitable}} for machining of precise cylindrical forms on hard and difficult-to-cut materials. In WEDT electrical discharge takes place between the traveling wire and the rotating workpiece to be machined. However, {{in many cases the}} machining efficiency of WEDT is considered to be rather low. One of the methods to enlarge the application envelope of WEDT and to improve its machining performance on difficult-to-machine materials is introduction of ultrasonic vibration to the wire electrode. An investigation has been made to combine ultrasonic vibration and wire electrical discharge turning. Design of a submerged, precise, flexible and corrosion-resistant rotary spindle is introduced. The spindle was mounted on a five-axis wire EDM machine to rotate the workpiece in order to generate free form cylindrical geometries. An auxiliary device which produces ultrasonic vibration was installed between the two wire-guides. The ultrasonic system consists of an ultrasonic generator, a transducer and a wire holder. When the wire is being driven, the transducer together with the wire holder vibrate under the resonance condition. Material removal rate (MRR) indicates efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the process. Experimental results show that wire vibration induced by ultrasonic action has a significant effect on material removal rate. This study has been to evaluate the influence of four design factors: <b>power,</b> pulse <b>off</b> <b>time,</b> spindle rotational speed and ultrasonic vibration over material removal rate. This has been done by means of design of experiments (DOE) technique. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant effective factors...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that high-energy impact of very small silicon nanoparticles on a substrate {{may lead to}} epitaxial growth of silicon films at low substrate temperature. A possible means for producing such energetic nanoparticle fluxes involves pulsing an RF silane-containing plasma, and applying a positive DC bias to the substrate during the afterglow phase of each pulse so as to collect the negatively charged particles generated during the RF power on phase. We here report numerical modeling to provide a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of this scheme. The system modeled is a parallel-plate capacitively-coupled RF argon–silane plasma at pressures around 100 mTorr. Simulation results indicate {{that it is possible}} to achieve a periodic steady state in which each pulse delivers a controlled flux of nanoparticles to the biased substrate, that average particle sizes can be kept below 2 – 3 nm, that impact energies of the negatively-charged nanoparticles that are attracted by the applied bias can be maintained in the ~ 1 eV/atom range thought to be conducive to epitaxial growth without causing film damage, and that the volume fraction of neutral nanoparticles that deposit by low-velocity diffusion can be kept well below 1 %. The effects of several operating parameters are explored, including RF voltage, pressure, the value of the applied DC bias, and RF <b>power</b> on and <b>off</b> <b>time</b> during each pulse...|$|R
