5|$|Since it is {{impossible}} to entirely eliminate pest insects from the human food chain, insects are inadvertently present in many foods, especially grains. Food safety laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit their quantity. According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris, the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> such as fish or livestock.|$|E
5|$|Key <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> include {{birds and}} tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri {{are largely}} {{dictated}} by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major <b>protein</b> <b>sources,</b> and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.|$|E

50|$|EAAs {{missing from}} the diet prevent the {{synthesis}} of proteins that require them. If a <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> is missing critical EAAs, then its biological value will be low as the missing EAAs form a bottleneck in protein synthesis. For example, if a hypothetical muscle protein requires phenylalanine (an essential amino acid), then this must be provided in the diet for the muscle protein to be produced. If the current <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> in the diet has no phenylalanine in it the muscle protein cannot be produced, giving a low usability and BV of the <b>protein</b> <b>source.</b>|$|R

25|$|Another isotopic {{method has}} been {{employed}} {{to investigate whether}} <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> in human diets in the early Anglo-Saxon varied with geographic location, or with respect to age or sex. This would provide evidence for social advantage. The results suggest that <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> varied little according to geographic location and that terrestrial foods dominated at all locations.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of MRPs use whey protein, casein (often listed as calcium caseinate or micellar casein), soy protein, and/or egg albumin as <b>protein</b> <b>sources.</b> Carbohydrates are typically derived from maltodextrin, oat fiber, brown rice, and/or wheat flour. Some MRPs also contain flax oil powder {{as a source}} of essential fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|The Asian {{giant hornet}} is {{intensely}} predatory; it hunts medium- to large-sized insects, such as bees, other hornet species, and mantises. The latter are favoured targets {{in late summer}} and fall. Large insects like Mantises are key <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> for hornet species including Giant hornet to feed their queen and drone larvae.|$|E

25|$|Consuming {{purified}} tryptophan increases brain serotonin whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. This {{is because}} the transport system which brings tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier is also selective for the other amino acids contained in <b>protein</b> <b>sources.</b> High plasma levels of other large neutral amino acids compete for transport and prevent the elevated plasma tryptophan from increasing serotonin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Today, the {{composition}} and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible. Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> to be unavailable at the market for local consumption. Few fisheries, though, {{have been able to}} make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that requires a significant amount of capital resources.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} with protein combinations of two incomplete <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> (e.g., rice and beans) {{to make a}} complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein {{do not need to}} be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body. Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis.|$|E
5000|$|Meat: Very few four- and five-month-old American babies {{eat meat}} or other <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> (excluding milk). [...] Six- to nine-month-old babies mostly eat meat {{as part of}} a baby food that {{contains}} a small amount of meat along with vegetables or grains. About three-quarters of nine- to twelve-month-old babies are given either meat or another <b>protein</b> <b>source,</b> such as eggs, cheese, yogurt, beans, or nuts. More than 90% of babies aged 12 to 18 months old, and nearly all toddlers older than that, are given a <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> at least once a day. Almost three-quarters of these toddlers are given a non-baby food meat; prepared baby food meat (by itself) is uncommon at any age.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} earthworm meal as <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> by monitoring the growth of broiler chickens in a feeding trial. Earthworms were reared outdoors on cow manure. The harvested worms were sun dried and ground to produce a meal that was used as <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> in feeding trials. Three different diets were compared {{over a period of}} 56 days. Growth, food consumption, efficiency of food conversion and production efficiency factor were determined. It is con­cluded that earthworm meal {{has the potential to be}} utilized as a <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> in diets for broilers. Special density production systems would have to he developed to make the concept economically viable. Therefore these preliminary findings must be interpreted with due care...|$|R

Edible <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> that may be used include food grade flours or meals from nonwheat cereals or oilseeds.

25|$|Mutton {{and pork}} were more common. Poultry, both wild and {{domestic}} and fish {{were available to}} {{all but the most}} destitute. The alternative <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> would rather have been legumes, eggs, cheese and the amino acids available in the tandem staples of bread and beer. Mice and hedgehogs were also eaten and a common way to cook the latter was to encase a hedgehog in clay and bake it. When the clay was then cracked open and removed, it took the prickly spikes with it.|$|E
25|$|The {{anthropologist}} Marvin Harris {{has suggested}} that the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> which require less work to obtain, such as poultry or cattle, though there are cultures which feature both animal husbandry and entomophagy. Examples can be found in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe where strong cattle-raising traditions co-exist with entomophagy of insects like the mopane worm. In addition, people in cultures where entomophagy is common are not indiscriminate in their choice of insects, as Thai consumers of insects perceive edible insects not consumed within their culture in a similar way as Western consumers.|$|E

30|$|Fish {{survival}} was {{not affected by}} experimental diets. The high survival rates recorded indicate that feeding C. gariepinus fingerlings with earthworm- and maggot-based diets could enhance their survivorship. This is made possible because C. gariepinus is an omnivorous fish species which used efficiently animal <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> to cover energy requirements (NRC 2011). Moreover, {{these results indicate that}} the protein quality of feed formulated with unconventional animal <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> ingredient was well accepted by the fish.|$|R
2500|$|The abomasum is {{the fourth}} and final stomach {{compartment}} in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here {{in much the same}} way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. [...] Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.|$|E
2500|$|Pigs are {{naturally}} omnivorous and are generally fed {{a combination of}} grains and <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> (soybeans, or meat and bone meal). [...] Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. [...] Consequently, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. [...] Pig feed may be bought packaged, in bulk or mixed on-site. [...] The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. [...] The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as vitamins and antibiotics are administered preemptively.|$|E
2500|$|The name Muisca Confederation {{has been}} given to the various small settlements, loosely {{organised}} in cacicazgos on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and surrounding valleys, such as the Tenza Valley. The character of this [...] "confederation" [...] was different from the Inca and Aztec Empires as a central authority was not present. The caciques were religious leaders who guarded the valleys of the Altiplano, caring for the subsistence economy of the people. The caciques did not control the production directly, although surpluses were distributed among them. Trading was performed using salt, giving the Muisca the name [...] "The Salt People". The extraction of the high quality salt was the task of the Muisca women. Other objects used for trade were small cotton cloths and larger mantles, and ceramics. The eastern trade was dominated by the markets in Teusacá, Chocontá and Suesca. The diet of the people consisted mostly of maize, tubers and potatoes; products of their rich agriculture, with <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> white-tailed deer and the widely domesticated guinea pig.|$|E
