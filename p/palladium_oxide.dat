5000|$|SEDs {{are very}} similar to FEDs, the primary {{difference}} between the two technologies is that SED uses a single emitter for each column instead of the individual spots of the FED. Whereas an FED uses electrons emitted directly {{toward the front of the}} screen, the SED uses electrons that are emitted from the vicinity of a small [...] "gap" [...] in a surface-conducting track laid down parallel to the plane of the panel, and extracted sideways to their original direction of motion. SED uses an emitter array based on <b>palladium</b> <b>oxide</b> laid down by an inkjet or silk-screen process. SED has been considered to be the variant of FED that is feasible to mass-produce, however, as of late 2009 no commercial SED display products have been made available by the industry.|$|E
50|$|Creating {{the rear}} layer with the {{emitters}} is a multi-step process. First, {{a matrix of}} silver wires is printed on the screen to form the rows or columns, an insulator is added, and then the columns or rows are deposited on top of that. Electrodes are added into this array, typically using platinum, leaving a gap of about 60 micrometres between the columns. Next, square pads of <b>palladium</b> <b>oxide</b> (PdO) only 20 nm thick are deposited into the gaps between the electrodes, connecting to them to supply power. A small slit is cut into the pad in the middle by repeatedly pulsing high currents though them. The resulting erosion causes a gap to form. The gap in the pad forms the emitter. The width of the gap has to be tightly controlled {{in order to work}} properly, and this proved difficult to control in practice.|$|E
40|$|Polynuclear Pd(II) {{complexes}} with biogenic polyamines present {{great potential}} clinical importance, {{due to their}} antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity coupled to less severe side-effects. The adsorption process and the redox behaviour of two polynuclear palladium chelates with spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd), Pd(II) -Spm and Pd(II) -Spd, {{as well as of}} their ligands Spm and Spd, were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and voltammetry at highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and glassy carbon electrodes. AFM revealed different adsorption patterns and degree of surface coverage, correlated with the chelate structure, concentration of the solution, applied potential and voltammetric behaviour of the Spm, Spd, Pd(II) -Spm and Pd(II) -Spd systems. The voltammetric study of Spm and Spd showed that these biogenic polyamines undergo an irreversible and pH-dependent oxidation. In acid medium the polyamines are fully protonated, rendering their oxidation more difficult. With increasing pH the oxidation potential for both Spm and Spd is shifted to less positive values, indicating a greater ease of oxidation in alkaline medium. The Pd(II) -Spm and Pd(II) -Spd complexes dissociate at high negative or high positive potentials. The application of a positive potential induced the oxidation of these Pd complexes and the formation of mixed layers of <b>palladium</b> <b>oxides,</b> Spm/Spd and Pd(II) -Spm/Pd(II) -Spd...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} for Pd and Sn co-deposition were achieved by voltage cycling between 0. 2 and - 0. 7 V vs. SCE in deaerated solution containing 0. 5 mM Na 2 PdCl 6, 0. 5 mM SnCl 2 and 25 mM HCl. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric techniques {{were used to}} investigate the electrochemical behaviour of the electrodeposited binary film toward the electrochemical reduction of nitrate species in slightly acid solutions. The relevant reduction mechanism was critically discussed. The resulting calibration plots for nitrate analysis performed under voltammetric conditions and in 50 mM H 2 SO 4 solution are linear over the range 1. 0 - 12 mM with correlation coefficients better than 0. 984. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique (XPS) was used in order to evaluate the chemical composition of the binary electrodeposited film. Electrodeposited Pd 30 Sn 70 films, independently of the electrochemical treatment, are composed of 50 - 60 % of Sri metal and 40 - 50 % of SnO of the total tin species, while the palladium species are composed by 60 - 70 % of Pd and 30 - 40 % of <b>palladium</b> <b>oxides</b> (i. e., PdOads and PdO).

40|$|This work aims {{to clarify}} the nanostructural {{transformation}} accompanying the loss of activity and selectivity for the hydrogen peroxide synthesis of palladium and gold–palladium nanoparticles supported on N-functionalized carbon nanotubes. High-resolution X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) allows the discrimination of metallic palladium, electronically modified metallic palladium hosting impurities, and cationic palladium. This is paralleled by the morphological heterogeneity observed by high-resolution TEM, in which nanoparticles with an average size of 2  nm coexisted with very small palladium clusters. The morphological distribution of palladium is modified after reaction through sintering and dissolution/redeposition pathways. The loss of selectivity is correlated {{to the extent to}} which these processes occur as a result of the instability of the particle at the carbon surface. We assign beneficial activity in the selective hydrogenation of oxygen to palladium clusters with a modified electronic structure compared with palladium metal or <b>palladium</b> <b>oxides.</b> These beneficial species are formed and stabilized on carbons modified with nitrogen atoms in substitutional positions. The formation of larger metallic palladium particles not only reduces the number of active sites for the synthesis, but also enhances the activity for deep hydrogenation to water. The structural instability of the active species is thus detrimental in a dual way. Minimizing the chance of sintering of palladium clusters by all means is thus the key to better performing catalysts...|$|R

40|$|In the {{following}} work, the catalytic behavior of Pd catalysts prepared using different oxides as support (Al 2 O 3, CeO 2 and TiO 2) {{in the catalytic}} combustion of propene, in low concentration in excess of oxygen, to mimic the conditions of catalytic decomposition of a volatile organic compound of hydrocarbon-type is reported. In addition, the influence of different promoters (Ce, Ti, Fe and Mn) when added to a Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was analyzed. Catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method and were characterized by ICP-OES, N 2 adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed oxidation, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Catalyst prepared using CeO 2 as the support was less easily reducible, due to the stabilization effect of CeO 2 over the <b>palladium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Small PdO particles and, therefore, high Pd dispersion were observed {{for all of the}} catalysts, as confirmed by XRD and TEM. The addition of Ce to the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts increased the metal-support interaction and the formation of highly-dispersed Pd species. The addition of Ce and Fe improved the catalytic behavior of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst; however, the addition of Mn and Ti decreased the catalytic activity in the propene oxidation. Pd/TiO 2 showed the highest catalytic activity, probably due to the high capacity of this catalyst to reoxidize Pd into PdO, as has been found in the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments...|$|R

Surf. Sci. 2007, 601, 5326]. In the present study, the formation of large amounts of CO 2 and the depletion of CO at the hyperactive state on both Pd(100) and polycrystalline Pd foil were evidenced by the infrared intensities of the gas phase CO 2 and CO, respectively. The active surfaces at the hyperactive state for palladium were characterized using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS, 450 - 4000 cm(- 1)) under the realistic catalytic reaction condition. <b>Palladium</b> <b>oxide</b> on a Pd(100) surface was reduced eventually by CO at 450 K, and also under CO oxidation conditions at 450 K.

40|$|In {{our days}} the {{catalytic}} CO-oxidation using Pd supported catalysts {{belongs to the}} most famous examples of synergetics in heterogeneous chemical systems. This reaction obeys periodic behaviour as well as chaos. For macroscopic structure formation in this system the cooperation {{of a lot of}} small catalytic active palladium particles within the catalyst support is essential. Which of the palladium particles are acting in synchrony depends on their particle sizes. The reason is that the exothermic CO-oxidation will heat up the small nano-meal particles extraordinarily. Although for small amounts of CO in the carrier gas the reaction can be executed isothermally with respect to the whole catalyst bulk. However, the catalytic active palladium particles can be heated up to several hundred degrees Celsius for very short times whereas their surrounding remains almost unaffected. This very high temperature enables the phase transition from active palladium to catalytic inactive <b>palladium</b> <b>oxide</b> in the presence of oxygen. After fast cooling because of the large temperature gradient between the nano-metal particles and their surrounding the <b>palladium</b> <b>oxide</b> can be reduced by its adsorbed CO via solid state reactions.

40|$|Abstract: Density {{functional}} B 3 LYP calculations {{have been}} employed to investigate potential energy surfaces for {{the reactions of}} scandium, nickel, and <b>palladium</b> <b>oxides</b> with methane. The results show that NiO and PdO are reactive toward methane and can form molecular complexes with CH 4 bound by 9 - 10 kcal/mol without a barrier. At elevated temperatures, the dominant reaction channel is direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom by the oxides from CH 4 with a barrier of ~ 16 kcal/mol leading to MOH (M = Ni, Pd) and free methyl radical. A minor reaction channel is an insertion into a C-H bond to produce CH 3 MOH molecules via transition states lying 19 - 20 kcal/mol above the initial reactants. For instance, for PdO the rate constant of the hydrogen abstraction channel evaluated using the transition state 3 theory for the 300 - 1000 K temperature range, kmethyl = 7. 12 x 10 - 11 exp(- 17329 /RT) cm 3 s- 1 molecule- 1, is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than the insertion rate constant and the branching ratio for the PdOH + CH 3 products is 98 - 99 %. The preferable channel of dissociation of CH 3 NiOH is a cleavage of the Ni-C bond leading to the radical NiOH + CH 3 products without an exit barrier, while CH 3 PdOH {{is more likely to}} undergo 1, 2 -CH 3 migration to produce a PdCH 3 OH complex and eventually Pd plus methanol. PdOH and CH 3 can recombine producing CH 3 PdOH and isomerization and dissociation of this molecule result in further transformation of methyl radical into methanol. However, the NiOH + CH 3 reaction is expected only to produce CH 3 NiOH or to restore the initial reactants, NiO + CH 4. ScO is not reactive with respect to methane at low and ambient temperatures. At elevated temperatures, the ScO + CH 4 reaction can proceed via a barrier of 22. 4 kcal/mol to form a CH 3 ScOH molecule with exothermicity of 9. 8 kcal/mol. CH 3 ScOH is not likely to decompose to the methyl radical and ScOH because this process is 58. 9 kcal/mol endothermic...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} major {{problems}} affecting efficiency {{in the catalytic}} oxidation of ammonia for obtaining nitric acid in an industrial plant: the limited life of gauzes, the low efficiency of the catalyst {{after a few months}} of operation, and finally, the necessity of recovering as much quantity of precious metals as possible. The first point to study in order to control the process and extend the useful life of the catalyst should be the correct characterization of the deactivated system. Therefore, this research is a systematic study about the performance of the catalytic recovering systems in nitric acid plants for all industrial pressures. In addition, it intends to cover the need of updating the knowledge in this field. The results obtained in this study with the support of SEM, EDX, XPS and AAS techniques, allow us to reach the following conclusions: The extremely critical conditions in which the activation pretreatment takes place cause important structural variations in the material surface. Beyond that, significant PtO 2 losses and subsequent enrichment in RhO 2 occur in a campaign in a high pressure plant, and mean while a continuous surface reconstruction is taking place. In contrast, an enrichment in Rh 0 occurs in a lower pressure plant. In all situations, the deactivation is associated to a decrease in the Platinum content, more active than Rhodium. The getter mechanism in the recovering gauzes is directional and consists in the absorption of PtO 2 (or Pt 0) {{on the surface of the}} Palladium-based wires. Next, the PtO 2 reduces itself to Pt 0 and forms the Pt-Pd alloy. The part of volatile Platinum and <b>Palladium</b> <b>oxides</b> which gest through the recovering pack, as well as the particles of Rh 2 O 3 carried away mechanically, settle in the heat exchangers line and in the Platinum filter of the high pressure plant.

The system was used to measure a stability diagram for the different oxide phases (surface oxide, bulk-like oxides) that exist on Pd(100) during catalytic CO oxidation at near ambient pressures. As soon as an oxide was present the reactivity of the surface was found to be mass transfer limited by the flux of CO molecules reaching the surface. Experiments on spontaneous reaction oscillations of the CO oxidation rate on Pd(100) reveal that a high density of steps strongly alters the stability of the thin, catalytically active <b>palladium</b> <b>oxide</b> film.

During the 32 -month research and development (R&D) program, GE Global Research successfully synthesized sensing materials using two techniques: sol-gel based fiber surface coating and magnetron sputtering based fiber micro-sensor integration. Palladium nanocrystalline embedded silica matrix material (nc-Pd/Silica), nanocrystalline <b>palladium</b> <b>oxides</b> (nc-PdO{sub x}) and palladium alloy (nc-PdAuN{sub 1 }), and nanocrystalline tungsten (nc-WO{sub x}) sensing materials were identified to have high sensitivity and selectivity to hydrogen; while the palladium doped and un-doped nanocrystalline tin oxide (nc-PdSnO{sub 2 } and nc-SnO{sub 2 }) materials were verified to have high sensitivity and selectivity to carbon monoxide. The fiber micro-sensor comprises an apodized long-period grating in a single-mode fiber, and the fiber grating cladding surface was functionalized by above sensing materials with a typical thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. GE found that the morphologies of such sensing nanomaterials are either nanoparticle film or nanoporous film with a typical size distribution from 5 - 10 nanometers. nc-PdO{sub x} and alloy sensing materials were found to be highly sensitive to hydrogen gas within the temperature range from ambient to 150 C, while nc-Pd/Silica and nc-WO{sub x} sensing materials were found to be suitable to be operated from 150 C to 500 C for hydrogen gas detection. The palladium doped and un-doped nc-SnO{sub 2 } materials also demonstrated sensitivity to carbon monoxide gas at approximately 500 C. The prototyped fiber gas sensing system developed in this R&D program is based on wavelength-division-multiplexing technology in which each fiber sensor is identified according to its transmission spectra features within the guiding mode and cladding modes. The interaction between the sensing material and fossil fuel gas results in a refractive index change and optical absorption in the sensing layer. This induces mode coupling strength and boundary conditions changes and thereby shifts the central wavelengths of the guiding mode and cladding modes propagation. GE's experiments demonstrated that such an interaction between the fossil fuel gas and sensing material not only shifts the central wavelengths of the guide mode and cladding modes propagation, but also alters their power loss characteristics.

40|$|With the {{financial}} {{support of the}} European Space Agency, ALTA S. p. A. is conducting an extensive experimental campaign {{for the development of}} advanced catalytic beds for hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thrusters in collaboration with the Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department of the University of Pisa. Manganese <b>oxides,</b> <b>palladium,</b> platinum, ruthenium and silver have been implanted on Gamma-Al 2 O 3 and Si-doped Al 2 O 3 spheres, starting from different precursors during the impregnation phase. Metal loadings on the ceramic substrates were evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscope analysis (SEM). Tests have been carried out in a specifically-designed experimental set-up in order to characterize and compare the chemical activity of different catalysts and for investigating the influence of the relevant operational parameters...|$|R
