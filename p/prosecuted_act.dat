2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable and {{influential}} precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century Nuremberg Trials. U.S. Justice Robert H.

Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression. The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.|$|R
