5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only {{feels like a}} <b>pin</b> <b>prick</b> or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{symptom of}} copper {{deficiency}} is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can {{start in the}} extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms. These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and <b>pin</b> <b>prick</b> was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation {{was lost in the}} sternum, and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self’s orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.|$|E
500|$|The {{actus reus}} is the wound or infliction of {{grievous bodily harm}} (GBH). A [...] "wound" [...] is {{something}} that breaks all layers of the skin, and must have an external component [...] internal bleeding, however serious, is not a wound. Serious wounds would also fall under grievous bodily harm, but some qualifying wounds (a <b>pin</b> <b>prick,</b> for example) are very minor. Some wounds would therefore not qualify as grievous bodily harm.|$|E
50|$|Unilateral lesions usually cause {{contralateral}} anaesthesia (loss of {{pain and}} temperature). Anaesthesia will normally begin 1-2 segments {{below the level of}} lesion, due to the sensory fibers being carried by dorsal-lateral tract of Lissauer up several levels upon entry into the spinal cord, and will affect all caudal body areas. This is clinically tested by using <b>pin</b> <b>pricks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Budgetary {{constraints}} {{meant that}} actors did their own hair and makeup, and special effects were not fancy. In {{the scene in}} which Martha bludgeons Janet Fay with a hammer, [...] "condoms containing glycerine and red dye were affixed {{to the head of}} the victim with plaster of Paris. The hammer, a balsa-wood prop, had a pin at the end. When the <b>pin</b> <b>pricked</b> the condoms, the blood began to flow." ...|$|R
60|$|In their hurry they had, however, {{forgotten}} two things: {{a bundle}} of keys which lay on the table, and the girl whom the <b>pin</b> had <b>pricked,</b> and who now stood pale and helpless beside the wood stack.|$|R
2500|$|Bites {{can cause}} pain, {{swelling}}, hemorrhagic bleb formation, and ecchymosis. Any swelling {{is usually not}} particularly severe, but it can involve all of the affected limb, {{as well as the}} trunk. Systemic symptoms can include nausea, dizziness, chills, coagulopathy, and shock. Klauber (1997) includes an account {{of a man who had}} been bitten on the first joint of the index finger of the right hand, with only a single fang penetrating. Although the bite was described as no more painful than a <b>pin</b> <b>prick,</b> a doctor was seen within about 25 minutes, and 10 cc of antivenin were administered. Within 2.5 hours, his entire arm was swollen and the pain was severe, [...] "as if the arm were soaked in a bucket of boiling oil." ...|$|E

[...] "To lie abed {{because of}} a <b>pin</b> <b>prick!</b> Why, when Bolgani, the king gorilla, tore me almost to pieces, while I was still but a little boy, did I have a nice soft bed to lie on? No, only the damp, rotting {{vegetation}} of the jungle. Hidden beneath some friendly bush I lay for days and weeks with only Kala to nurse me--poor, faithful Kala, who kept the insects from my wounds and warned off the beasts of prey.|$|E

50|$|Rather than {{a simple}} {{withdrawal}} reflex, the flatworm, Notoplana aticola, displays a locomotory escape behaviour following <b>pin</b> <b>pricks</b> to the posterior end. Touching the larvae of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, with a probe causes them to pause and {{move away from the}} stimulus, however, stronger mechanical stimulation evokes a more complex corkscrew-like rolling behaviour, i.e. the response is plastic. When a weak tactile stimulus is applied to the siphon of the sea-hare Aplysia californica, the animal rapidly withdraws the siphon between the parapodia. It is sometimes claimed this response is an involuntary reflex (e.g. see Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex), however, the complex learning associated with this response (see 'Learned Avoidance' below) suggests this view might be overly simplistic.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} reported and cited cases {{of patients with}} unilateral lesions in the thalamus region who {{have a tendency to}} react excessively to affective stimuli. For example, <b>pin</b> <b>pricks,</b> painful pressure, and excessive heat or cold all cause more distress on the damaged side of the body as compared to the normal side. Similar results can be observed from agreeable stimuli: warmth stimuli may cause intense pleasure, demonstrated by facial expressions of enjoyment and exclamations of delight by the individual. The increased influence of stimuli resulting in excessive responses was attributed to the release of the thalamus from cortical inhibition. When the thalamus is released from cortical control, the affective states and responses are increased; thus, it was concluded that the thalamic region is occupied with the affective component of sensation.|$|R
60|$|Jan {{had just}} fired his gun, {{and seeing the}} man he sprang to help me, whereon three more Kaffirs {{following}} on the dead soldier's path crawled {{out from under the}} waggon. Two of them gained their feet and ran at him lifting their assegais. I thought that all was lost, for one hole in our defence was like a <b>pin</b> <b>prick</b> to a bladder, but with a shout Jan dropped the empty gun and rushed to meet them. He caught them by the throat, the two of them, one in each of his great hands, and before they could spear him dashed their heads together with such desperate strength that they fell down and never stirred again. This was always thought something of a feat, for as everybody knows the skulls of Kaffirs are thick.|$|E

50|$|That night, {{during the}} {{performance}} of an olio on the show boat, Pete shows up with the town sheriff (Regis Toomey). But when Julie and Steve hear that the sheriff is coming to arrest them, Steve takes a sewing <b>pin,</b> <b>pricks</b> Julie's finger, and sucks blood from it. The Sheriff enters and announces {{that there is a}} case of miscegenation on board, a black woman married to a white man, which is illegal. Julie is the woman, and Steve is the man. Julie admits that she is half-black, but Steve, having sucked some of Julie's blood, successfully pretends that he is also half-black. Pete is fired by Cap'n Andy. However, Julie and Steve must still leave the acting company—blacks were not allowed onstage alongside whites in the 1880s.|$|R
40|$|Deniquelata barringtoniae gen. et sp. nov. (Montagnulaceae) forms {{numerous}} ascomata on distinct zonate leaf {{spots of}} Barringtonia asiatica (Lecythidaceae). We isolated this taxon and sequenced the 18 S and 28 S nrDNA. The result of phylogenetic analysis based on 18 S and 28 S nrDNA sequence {{data indicate that}} the genus belongs in the family Montagnulaceae, Dothideomycetes, Ascomycota. The ascomata are immersed, dark brown to black, with bitunicate asci and brown, muriform ascospores. Deniquelata is distinguished from the other genera in Montagnulaceae based on its short, broad, furcate and pedicellate asci, verruculose ascospores with short narrow pseudoparaphyses with parasitic naturee and {{this is also supported}} by molecular data.

5000|$|A {{division}} of the blue and white wares into three [...] "families" [...] or broad groups has been proposed by Barbara Harrisson: [...] "conservative", [...] "persistent" [...] and [...] "versatile", in chronological order. [...] This classification was further refined by Monique Crick in 2010 into three types of decoration: [...] "Sketchy", [...] "Composed", and [...] "Full [...] "rim-to-rim"". [...] The [...] "Sketchy decoration" [...] group uses [...] "a vigorous, brushed style, painted freehand and spontaneously" [...] by a single artisan. [...] The later groups often use drawing in dark concentrated blue to create the design, which is then overpainted with a lighter wash, in the same style that is often used with black and turquoise in the polychome enamels. Some of these pieces have visible <b>pin</b> <b>pricks</b> indicating where a stencil was fixed, presumably allowing rapid painting of the wash. The outline would have needed to dry before the wash was applied, suggesting {{that a number of}} artisans were involved in different stages of production requiring different levels of skill.|$|R
