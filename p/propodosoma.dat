50|$|In Lorryia formosa, {{like all}} Acariformes mites, the {{capitulum}} {{is the head}} segment and the idiosoma is the body segment. The idiosoma is further subdivided into the <b>propodosoma,</b> metapodosoma, and opisthosoma. The Tydeinae subfamily, to which Lorryia formosa belongs, is characterized by having three pairs of lyrifissures (grooves that encircle the surface of an appendage) {{and a pair of}} primitive eyes (oculi) which commonly occur laterally on the <b>propodosoma,</b> the middle body segment to which the first two pairs of legs are attached. The genital region includes a progenital aperture flanked by setae. Specimens are generally less than 250 µm long.|$|E

40|$|The {{external}} features of pink citrus rust mite, Aculops pelekassi (Keifer) were observed under scanning electron microscope. The body of this mite was spindle-shaped with {{a length of}} 100 - 150 μ m. The <b>propodosoma</b> lines were irregularly arranged and the hysterosoma possessed 30 - 40 rings. The legs originated from the ventral portion of gnathosoma and extended forward. The first, second and third coxa possessed seta on their surface. Genital organ {{and a pair of}} setae were observed bellow the coxal base. The cover flap of the genital organ had 12 muscles on its surface. The tubercle of the flagellate ventral seta was cone-shaped and had a length of 15 μ m. The first and second legs were six segmented where the tarsus had a single claw and a branched feathered claw. The gnathosoma was appended under the <b>propodosoma</b> and was extended forwardly. The palpi were segmented and smoothly surfaced. The rostrum was fixed between the palpi and the needle-like stylets were projected from its cavity...|$|E
40|$|The cheyletid predatory mite, Hemicheyletia bakeri (Ehara) habitat on {{the citrus}} plants in Ehime {{prefecture}} of Japan. Mite had an elongated {{body with the}} length of 230 ƒYm and the width of 92 ƒYm. Gnathosoma, <b>propodosoma</b> and hysterosoma were well differentiated. The propodosomal shield had four pairs of fanlike setae on the lateral side and two pairs on the middle portion. Opisthosomal shield possessed four pairs of fanlike setae on the corners. Anus of this mite consisted of elongated excretory pore as flap-shaped organ projected outwardly. There were three long and sharp tip setae on both sides. Legs comprised of six segments, coxa, trochanter, femur, genu, tibia and tarsus. Tarsus of leg one was longer and smoothly surfaced while, of leg two had sub segments. Tibia of the leg three and leg four {{had a pair of}} setae as other legs while tarsus of leg four was longer compared to three. Tarsus of the leg one had thick base, which was divided into two segments. Smaller segment had a pair of hook-shaped claws and several thin tenent hair. The tarsus of leg two, three and four possessed a pair of smoothly surfaced and hook-like claws. The empodial claws were elongated having pad-shaped tips. Eyes were granular-shaped projected outwardly with five regular circles and disconnected lines surrounded the eyeball. A pair of setae covers both sides of upper portion of eye...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The genus Metabelba {{was created}} by Grandjean in 1936 for Belbidae of which the solenidions of tibiae II and III are coupled with {{protective}} hairs, but of which the solenidion of tibia IV is free, long, and tactile. The genus belongs {{to the group of}} rather small species that are never covered with foreign material, but of which the cerotegument is very thick, especially on the moniliform legs, whilst the adults often bear the larval and nymphal skins. The species have three or four lateral apophyses : one (which is not always present) between leg I and leg II, two between II and III, and one between III and IV. We have been in doubt as to the nomenclature of these apophyses, for although they have generally been regarded as tectopedia, they do not protect the trochanteres. Grandjean (in litt.) recently proposed to us the following notation. The apophysis between I and II is restricted to some members of the Belbidae, and in the present paper it is simply called anterior apophysis (a. a.). The two apophyses between II and III occur in several families; they protect the sejugal stigma; here they are called anterior and posterior parastigmatic apophyses (a. p. a., a. p. p.). It is obvious that the fourth apophysis is a discidium (dis; cf. Grandjean, 1952, p. 31). There are no spinae adnatae but there is often one pair of protuberances under the anterior border of the notogaster, opposite to a corresponding pair on the propodosoma; sometimes there is even a second pair of protuberances on the <b>propodosoma,</b> also situated in the posterior part. The type of the genus is Damaeus papillipes Nicolet, a species that was insufficiently described, but of which Grandjean discovered specimens a...|$|E
40|$|Lardoglyphus zacheri Oudemans and L. (= H oshikadania) konoi (Sasa and Asanuma) {{were sent}} to me by Mr. D. A. Griffiths of the Infestation Control Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. They were found in butcher's offal ("gut greaves"), used in the {{manufacture}} of fertiliser, on premises near Chesterfield. In this particular case the offal was obtained locally, though it can also be imported from the Argentine; possibly the mites were orginally introduced into this country on empty uncleaned sacks obtained from other manufacturers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a more complete description of L. zacheri Oudemans, and also to clear up some confusion in nomenclature. Lardoglyphus zacheri Oudemans, 1927 (figs. 1 - 5) Female (fig. 1). Length of idiosoma of six individuals: 450 - 600 /JI. The body is spindle-shaped, widest between the second and third pairs of legs and tapering towards either end; the posterior edge is concave. The body cuticle is smooth and cream-coloured, the legs, apodemes, and chelicerae are of a darker shade; the <b>propodosoma</b> lacks a dorsal shield and is clearly separated by a transverse groove from the hysterosoma. The setae of the idiosoma are smooth and slightly pectinate. The vertical internals (v. i) arise close together and project forward over the gnathosoma without reaching its extremity; the vertical externals (v. e) orginate from the same level, they are pectinate and curve towards the base of the chelicerae; behind them are the pseudostigmatic organs — small, curved and serrated — which lie in a depression above the base of leg I and are encircled by a lateral sclerite; at the anterior end of this sclerite is Grandjeans organ, a triangular fold of cuticle...|$|E
