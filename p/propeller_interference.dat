A reduction gear equipped power-plant with a resultant clockwise rotation propeller like the 8B, produced [...] at 2,100 rpm. Two known weapons fitted were the SAMC with a rifled barrel and a smooth-bore cannon firing canister ammunition. The moteur-canon could fire a single shot at a time through the hollow drive shaft without <b>propeller</b> <b>interference.</b> This cannon mount required an [...] "elevated" [...] intake manifold design, bringing the intake [...] "runners" [...] straight off the inner surfaces of the cylinder banks to the updraft carburetor's plenum chamber. The engine was used on the SPAD S.XII.|$|E
40|$|A {{deep market}} {{analysis}} on the regional and commuter aircraft has revealed that nowadays the volatility of oil price (more and more prone to international political crises), the huge growth of air transport traffic and the increasing attention to the aircraft environmental footprint considerably lead the interest of specialists towards new configurations of regional and commuter transport aircraft. Also the major airlines in this segment have been addressing the replacement for many hundreds of heritage airplanes in the 20 - 150 seats categories currently in service around the world. Turboprop configuration could be the ideal answer to this request. An innovative turboprop configuration with a rear propeller installation {{can lead to a}} cleaner wing with possibilities to achieve laminar flow extension. In addition the wing without engine nacelle and free of <b>propeller</b> <b>interference</b> effects will be characterized by a more efficient high-lift system with a possible increase in aircraft maximum lift coefficient which will positively affect the ground performances. The analysis of the proposed innovative configuration with rear propeller installation, {{which is one of the}} main topics dealt by the IRON project proposal, is characterized by several aerodynamic, performance and propulsion feature that must be predicted with high accuracy and deep comprehension of involved phenomena in order to lead to a possible improved configuration respect to the classical configuration with wing-mounted engines. The IRON project will also address the conventional (wing mounted propeller) turboprop configuration. In this case one of the key element is the reduction of the perceived annoyance due to propeller noise emissions. A low-noise propeller system will be designed after exploring emerging technologies. This achievement will be attained while preserving the propulsion efficiency because of its high impact on economic, environmental and social issues...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{evaluation}} of the passive structure for the vessel detection is considered. The passive detection structure {{is based on the}} statistical likelihood ratio test and on the Neyman-Pearson statistical criterion. The assumption is that a vessel is approximately so-called noisy vessel. It means that the underwater acoustic vessel noise is approximately a stationary ergodic stochastic zero mean Gaussian process with finite variance. Then the source of the vessel noise is approximately only phenomenon of the vessel <b>propeller.</b> The <b>interference</b> (ambient deep-sea noise) is a stationary ergodic stochastic zero mean Gaussian process with finite variance too...|$|R
40|$|The Hess {{panel code}} was {{investigated}} as a procedure {{to predict the}} aerodynamic loading associated with <b>propeller</b> slipstream <b>interference</b> on the airframe. The slipstream was modeled as a variable onset flow to the lifting and nonlifting bodies treated by the code. Four sets of experimental data were used for comparisons with the code. The {{results indicate that the}} Hess code, in its present form, will give valid solutions for nonuniform onset flows which vary in direction only. The code presently gives incorrect solutions for flows with variations in velocity. Modifications to the code to correct this are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A semispan wing/body {{model with}} a powered highly loaded {{propeller}} has been tested to provide data on the propulsion installation drag of advanced propfan-powered aircraft. The model had a supercritical wing with a contoured over-the-wing nacelle. It was tested in the Ames Research Center's (ARC) 14 -foot Transonic Wind Tunnel at a total pressure of 1 atm. The test was conducted at angles of attack from - 0. 5 to 4 deg at Mach numbers ranging from 0. 6 to 0. 8. The test objectives were to determine propeller performance, exhaust jet effects, <b>propeller</b> slipstream <b>interference</b> drag, and total powerplant installation drag. Test results indicated a total powerplant installation drag of 82 counts (0. 0082) at a Mach number of 0. 8 and a lift coefficient of 0. 5, which is approximately 29 percent of a typical airplane cruise drag...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper,thecontrol {{equation}} of Multiple Reference Frame(MRF) as the propeller calculation model was present and analyzed, the <b>propeller</b> slipstream <b>interference</b> on HALE UAV was studied with three-dimensional numerical simulation. It is {{shown that the}} flow field of the MRF model is good consistent with true propeller flow, and MRF can accurately simulate aerodynamic interference on the aircraft. The stream traces on the V-tail surface were deflected and shrank, pressure distribution,Cmx and Cmzon V-tail surface was changed apparently too. Butslipstream {{had little effect on}} wing. The influence of propeller slipstream on the aerodynamic performance of the UAV at the status of taking off is biggest, become weaker at status of climbing and smallest at the status of cruising. The influence of propeller slipstream is enhanced with increment of propeller thrust and basically familiar in the same thrust between the two blade attack angle. The pressure drag on aft of UAV fuselage increased rapidly by the <b>interference</b> of <b>propeller</b> slipstream, leading aerodynamic performance of UAV become badly...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} linear {{frequency domain}} panel method {{has been extended}} to study the unsteady aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, and aeroacoustics of advanced ducted fans. Additional contributions are to extend and improve previous lifting surface theory to include for stator rows and planar supersonic tip Mach numbers, and radiated noise estimation. A two-dimensional viscous wake model is incorporated {{to account for the}} influence of the viscous wake generated by the upstream blade impinging on the downstream blade. ^ In order to verify the procedure, several test cases, most of which have been investigated by researchers, were examined and compared with the existing measurements and theoretical predictions for a rectangular wing, single rotation fans, a counter rotation propeller and advanced ducted fans. Subsequently, studies are performed to examine the unsteady aerodynamics, aeroelastic response, and aeroacoustics of ducted fans, where most of them have not been extensively studied, such as resonance conditions predicted by the two-dimensional strip theory, the effect of ducting the fan on aeroelasticity of a ducted eight-bladed SR 3 fan, the significance of unsteady interaction of ducted (2 x 2) counter rotation Purdue model propeller, and unsteady aerodynamics of ducted rotor-stator E 3 fan. ^ A non-compact loading noise calculation based on Farassat 2 Ì† 7 s formulation 1 A is developed for analyzing acoustic field generated by fans operating at subsonic tip Mach number. The noise calculation procedure is verified with existing acoustic measurements and theoretical predictions. Finally, applications to the noise characteristics of counter rotation <b>propellers,</b> both acoustic <b>interference</b> and aerodynamic interference, are demonstrated. ...|$|R
