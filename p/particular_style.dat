5|$|A {{characteristic}} of Douglas's work is {{his attention to}} both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any <b>particular</b> <b>style</b> and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, {{in the cases of}} Rowden Abbey and StMichael and All Angels Church, Altcar, the entire buildings were timber-framed.|$|E

5|$|Christchurch and its {{surrounding}} areas are unique in New Zealand for their <b>particular</b> <b>style</b> of Gothic architecture, {{something that can be}} directly attributed to Benjamin Mountfort. While Mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions, he is today better known for the designs executed for public, civic bodies, and the church. His monumental Gothic stone civic buildings in Christchurch, which would not be out of place in Oxford or Cambridge, are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials. His hallmark wooden Gothic churches today epitomise the 19th-century province of Canterbury. They are accepted, and indeed appear as part of the landscape. In this way, Benjamin Mountfort's achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with the identity of the province of Canterbury. Following his death, one of his seven children, Cyril, continued to work in his father's Gothic style well into the 20th century. Cyril Mountfort was responsible for the church of St Luke's in the City, which was an unexecuted design of his father's. In this way, and through the daily public use of his many buildings, Mountfort's legacy lives on. He ranks today with his contemporary R A Lawson as one of New Zealand's greatest 19th-century architects.|$|E
5|$|Mesolithic humans {{arrived in}} the Firth of the Clyde during the fourth {{millennium}} BC, probably from Ireland. This {{was followed by a}} wave of Neolithic peoples using the same route and {{there is some evidence that}} the Firth of Clyde was a significant route via which mainland Scotland was colonised at this time. A <b>particular</b> <b>style</b> of megalithic structure developed in Argyll, the Clyde estuary and elsewhere in western Scotland that has become known as the Clyde cairn. They are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape with a small enclosing chamber faced with large slabs of stone set on end and sometimes subdivided into smaller compartments. A forecourt area may have been used for displays or rituals associated with the interment of the dead, who were placed inside the chambers. They are concentrated in Arran, Bute and Kintyre and it is likely that the Clyde cairns were the earliest forms of Neolithic monument constructed by incoming settlers although few of the 100 or so examples have been given a radiocarbon dating. An example at Monamore on Arran has been dated to 3160 BC, although it was almost certainly built earlier than that, possibly c. 4000BC. There are also numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor, Arran and other examples on Great Cumbrae and Bute.|$|E

5|$|The {{single largest}} niche {{industry}} {{is based on}} Latin music. Latin music has long influenced American popular music, and was an especially {{crucial part of the}} development of jazz. Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America, including Colombian cumbia, Puerto Rican reggaeton, and Mexican corrido. Latin popular music in the United States began with a wave of dance bands in the 1930s and 1950s. The most popular styles included the conga, rumba, and mambo. In the 1950s Perez Prado made the cha-cha-cha famous, and the rise of Afro-Cuban jazz opened many ears to the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music. The most famous American form of Latin music, however, is salsa. Salsa incorporates many styles and variations; the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban-derived genres. Most specifically, however, salsa refers to a <b>particular</b> <b>style</b> that was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants, and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica.

50|$|Selective {{optimization}} with {{compensation is}} a developmental process that was first outlined by Baltes in 1980 {{to describe the}} relation between age-related changes within individuals and changes in behavioral and cognitive styles. Baltes argues that as individuals advance through life they are increasingly faced by age-related deficits which place limits on their cognitive and behavioral resources. To deal with these limits placed on domains, individuals will begin to invest resources into <b>particular</b> <b>styles</b> and behaviors that are deemed adaptive to the new constraints. This specialization in <b>particular</b> domains and <b>styles</b> will increase the ability in those particular faculties that are deemed more adaptive to growing age-related deficits. Baltes notes, specialization in <b>particular</b> domains and <b>styles</b> takes time, effort, and motivation, requiring individuals to disregard other behavior and cognitive styles which are not deemed adaptive to new developmental limits. The result {{of this process is}} an age-related increase in specialized styles and behaviors in order to enhance efficiency and improve performance, while a reduction in unfavourable styles. In response to the reduction in <b>particular</b> <b>styles</b> and behaviors, individuals will utilize specialized capacities as a compensatory mechanism to deal with gaps in capacities created by the specialization process.|$|R
