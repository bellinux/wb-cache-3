40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effects of <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> (VanPatten, 1996, 2007), as an input-based model for teaching second language grammar, on Syrian learners’ processing abilities. The present research investigated the effects of <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> on the acquisition of English relative clauses by Syrian learners {{in the form of a}} quasi-experimental design. Three separate groups were involved in the research (<b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction,</b> Traditional Instruction and a Control Group). For assessment, a pre-test, a direct post-test and a delayed post-test were used as main tools for eliciting data. A questionnaire was also distributed to participants in the <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> group to give them the opportunity to give feedback in relation to the treatment they received in comparison with the Traditional Instruction they are used to. Four hypotheses were formulated on the possible effectivity of <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> on Syrian learners’ linguistic system. It was hypothesised that <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> would improve learners’ processing abilities leading to an improvement in learners’ linguistic system. This was expected to lead to a better performance when it comes to the comprehension and production of English relative clauses. The main source of data was analysed statistically using the ANOVA test. Cohen’s d calculations were also used to support the ANOVA test. Cohen’s d showed the magnitude of effects of the three treatments. Results of the analysis showed that both <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> and Traditional Instruction groups had improved after treatment. However, the <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> Group significantly outperformed the other two groups in the comprehension of relative clauses. The analysis concluded that <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> is a useful tool for instructing relative clauses to Syrian learners. This was enhanced by participants’ responses to the questionnaire as they were in favour of <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction,</b> rather than Traditional Instruction. This research has theoretical and pedagogical implications. Theoretically, the study showed support for the Input hypothesis. That is, it was shown that <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> had a positive effect on input processing as it affected learners’ linguistic system. This was reflected in learners’ performance where learners were able to produce a structure which they had not been asked to produce. Pedagogically, the present research showed that <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> is a useful tool for teaching English grammar in the context where the experiment was carried out, as it had a large effect on learners’ performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate possible interpretation discourse level effects of <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> and re-exposure to <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> on the acquisition of a specific feature of the Japanese linguistics system: namely Japanese passive forms. <b>Processing</b> <b>instruction</b> is a type of focus on form which is framed around the input processing theoretical framework. In order to carry out this investigation two separate experimental studies were conducted. All participants were native English speakers and were randomly assigned to two groups. In both experimental studies, one group received <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> which involved an explicit instruction component and structured input practice directed at altering the way L 2 learners process input; the other group was used as a control group and received no instruction. Interpretation and production sentence level tasks, and discourse level tasks were used to measure performance after a one day instruction. A pre-test/post-test design was adopted to collect data in both studies. In the second experimental study, the <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> group received a re-exposure treatment between the post-test and the delayed post-test. Based on previous research carried out on the effectiveness of <b>processing</b> <b>instruction,</b> it was hypothesised that <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> would have positive effects on the accuracy with which subjects interpreted and produced sentences containing Japanese passive forms. A further hypothesis was that the effects of re-exposure to the <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> treatment (after the first post-test) would further improve subjects ability to interpret and produce sentences containing Japanese passive forms. A set of two hypotheses were formulated on possible interpretation discourse effects for <b>processing</b> <b>instruction.</b> It was hypothesised that the group receiving <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> would improve in its ability to interpret discourse (guided recall: dialogue and story version) containing Japanese passive forms, and that learners in this group, receiving re-exposure to the <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> treatment would further improve in their ability to interpret discourse containing Japanese passive forms. Overall the statistical analyses carried out on the raw scores of all the measures used supported the four hypotheses of this study. The results obtained in this research provide clear evidence that <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> has positive effects on the acquisition of Japanese passive construction. The present study showed that <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> was successful in altering the way in which learners processed the input and its effects had also an impact on the way learners produced Japanese passive construction forms. The main findings of the present study also provided new evidence on the effectiveness of <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> in improving learners’ performance on interpretation discourse level tasks. In addition to this, it also provides new evidence that learners receiving re-exposure to the <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> treatment between a post-test and a delayed post-test can further improve in their ability to interpret and produce the target feature at sentence level and interpret the target feature at discourse level. The results obtained in the two studies have implications at two levels. At the theoretical level this research provides further support for the role that input processing plays in SLA. At the pedagogical level it demonstrates the effectiveness of <b>processing</b> <b>instruction</b> on the acquisition of a different linguistic feature of the Japanese grammar system (passive forms), not only on an interpretation and production sentence level task but also on an interpretation discourse level task. It also demonstrated the important role of a re-exposure instructional treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effects of}} <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> on two {{different}} age groups and the role that cognitive task demands might play in the results generated by <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction.</b> This study includes school-age children and adult native speakers of German learning English as a foreign language – a language combination not previously investigated within the <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> and individual differences research paradigm. The present study investigates directly whether two different age groups will benefit equally from <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> in altering their reliance on lexical temporal indicators and redirecting their attention to verb forms on <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> activities with different cognitive demands.

The results from this study provide further evidence that the <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> is an effective instructional treatment in helping school-age children and adult L 2 learners to make accurate form-meaning connections. The results from the first sentence-level interpretation task and the production task showed that <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> has positive and equal effects on both age groups (school-age learners and adults). The positive effects of instruction were maintained over the delayed post-test for both age groups who made similar gains on the immediate post-test. The results from the second (cognitively more complex) sentence-level interpretation task indicated that the adults made greater gains than school-age learners. However, both groups retained the positive effects of instruction over time. The difference in gains between the two age groups on the second sentence-level interpretation task can be explained in terms of cognitive processing load...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the field}} of SLA, grammar {{instruction}} is an interesting subject. Researchers have debated over whether grammar instruction has {{a positive effect on}} SLA. Recently this has shifted to finding out what kind of grammar instruction is effective in SLA. This thesis focuses on a specific type of grammar <b>instruction,</b> namely <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> (PI). <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> is pedagogical intervention that tries to alter the processing strategies of the learners so that they will make more and better form-meaning connections. The goal of this thesis was to find out whether <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> is an effective method for teaching grammar. The main research question was: Is <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> effective as a method of teaching grammar? In this thesis <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> was compared to two other methods for teaching grammar: traditional instruction (TI) and meaning-based output instruction (MOI). The sub-questions were: 1) Is PI more effective than TI on sentence-level interpretation and production tasks? 2) Is PI more effective than MOI on sentence-level interpretation and production tasks? 3) Does PI have an effect on interpretation and production in discourse tasks? The finding indicate that <b>Processing</b> <b>Instruction</b> is an effective method for grammar instruction. PI is more effective than TI and MOI on sentence-level interpretation tasks and that PI is equally effective as TI and MOI on sentence-level production tasks. Also, PI has a positive effect on discourse interpretation and production tasks. These findings suggest that PI is a relevant addition to SLA teaching material...|$|R
