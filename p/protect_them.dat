The threat to reef health is {{particularly}} strong in Southeast Asia, where 80% of reefs are endangered. Over 50% of the world's coral reefs may be destroyed by 2030; as a result, most nations <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> through environmental laws.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital in order to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods {{began to appear in}} Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Mexican {{authorities}} {{gave the}} settlers of Gonzales a small cannon to help <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> from frequent Comanche raids. Over {{the next four}} years, the political situation in Mexico deteriorated, and in 1835 several states revolted.

25|$|Tufted puffins are preyed upon {{by various}} avian raptors such as snowy owls, bald eagles and {{peregrine}} falcons, and mammals like the Arctic fox.

5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German units used the Rommelspargel for defense, by cutting them down and using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions.

5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E

5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement.
