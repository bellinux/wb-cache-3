50|$|The {{effect of}} channel-length {{modulation}} upon the MOSFET output resistance varies {{both with the}} device, particularly its channel length, and with the applied bias. The main factor affecting the output resistance in longer MOSFETs is channel length modulation as just described. In shorter MOSFETs additional factors arise such as: drain-induced barrier lowering (which lowers the threshold voltage, increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance), velocity saturation (which tends to limit the increase in channel current with drain voltage, thereby increasing the output resistance) and ballistic transport (which modifies the collection of current by the drain, and modifies drain-induced barrier lowering so as to increase supply of carriers to the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance). Again, accurate results require computer models.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} the effect, first {{the notion of}} pinch-off of the channel is introduced. The channel is formed by attraction of carriers to the gate, and the current drawn through the channel is nearly a constant independent of drain voltage in saturation mode. However, near the drain, the gate and drain jointly determine the electric field pattern. Instead of flowing in a channel, beyond the pinch-off point the carriers flow in a subsurface pattern made possible because the drain and the gate both control the current. In the figure at the right, the channel is indicated by a dashed line and becomes weaker as the drain is approached, leaving a gap of uninverted silicon {{between the end of}} the formed inversion layer and the drain (the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region).</b>|$|E
40|$|In making {{experimental}} {{measurements of}} field-effect transistor static drain characteristics in the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> {{determination of the}} effective pinch-off voltage is not possible by direct measurement {{because of the presence}} of spurious drain current at and beyond pinch-off. Further, indirect measurement is hampered by the absence of a theoretical straight-line function from which the pinch-off voltage may be obtained as an intercept or a slope. In this communication a power-law relation for the transfer characteristic is assumed, from which values of both the pinch-off voltage and the exponent may be obtained directly from a straight-line plot of experimental quantities...|$|E
40|$|Carrier {{relaxation}} processes {{have been}} investigated in GaAs/Al xGa 1 -xAs v-groove quantum wires (QWRs) with a large subband separation (ΔE ≃ 46 meV). Signatures of inhibited carrier relaxation mechanisms are seen in temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence-excitation measurements; we observe strong emission from the first excited state of the QWR below ∼ 50 K. This is attributed to reduced intersubband relaxation via phonon scattering between localized states. Theoretical calculations and experimental {{results indicate that the}} <b>pinch-off</b> <b>regions,</b> which provide additional two-dimensional confinement for the QWR structure, have a blocking effect on relaxation mechanisms for certain structures within the v groove. Time-resolved PL measurements show that efficient carrier relaxation from excited QWR states into the ground state occurs only at temperatures ≳ 30 K. Values for the low-temperature radiative lifetimes of the ground- and first excited-state excitons have been obtained (340 ps and 160 ps, respectively), and their corresponding localization lengths along the wire estimated...|$|R

In this model, because the source is connected with the drain, the gate capacitance is only considered by analytical expressions, which are classified into three different regions for gate bias voltage: a before <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> an after-pinch-off region, and a transition region. The model includes consideration for free carrier movement in the active region, which is a critical contributor to the gate capacitance...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{microelectronics}} has made surprising {{advances in the}} last decade, mainly pushed by the enormous progress in semiconductor technology. Such a reduction of dimensions allows the fabrication of chips {{with more than one}} million components. In addition, it opens the way to new physical phenomena, which were not present in traditional structures. In this context, the Monte Carlo simulation has particular significance. This approach allowed conceiving applicable model for GaInP MESFET operating in the turn-one or <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> and valid for the short-channel and the long-channel GaInP MESFET, in which the two-dimensional potential distribution contributed by the depletion layer under the gate is obtained by conventional 1 D approximatio...|$|E
40|$|Simulations of the jetting of Newtonian fluids from drop-on-demand print heads {{show that}} the radial jet <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> which may lie inside the nozzle, is {{strongly}} affected by the fluid viscosity over the range of values that are commonly used. Jet profiles beyond the nozzle exit predicted in these simulations match previously published high resolution images very well and validate the code used. The simulations {{show that the}} radial velocity at the minimum radius in the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region</b> falls exponentially soon after neck formation but then approaches a speed near that predicted theoretically for filament rupture. The overall jet length is primarily controlled by the slow speed of radial pinch-off. Towards the final break-off time, competition between the original radial minimum and a developing second radial minimum can alter the flow conditions towards symmetry. The simulations also explain why visible jets are shaped like truncated cones. Pinch-off occurs typically within one nozzle radius of the nozzle exit, and {{while it may be}} located within the nozzle region, another radial minimum also forms outside the nozzle, close to the exit for low viscosity fluids but well beyond it for higher viscosity fluid. The radial collapse follows a power law with time, with the power-law index n varying between the value of n= 2 / 3 expected for an inviscid fluid and n= 1 law expected for a viscous fluid. The transition in behavior occurs at a viscosity of ~ 20 mPa s, which is within the range of ~ 10 – 40 mPa s typical of most DoD inks formulations...|$|E
40|$|Design {{of a high}} {{conversion}} gain frequency doubler has been {{presented in this paper}} by optimizing the input impedance at the second harmonic frequency. A LC tank resonator, as a second harmonic impedance optimizer at input side, properly adjusts the harmonic impedance without affecting matching performance at fundamental frequency. In practice, a stepped impedance resonator was utilized for realizing the designed input impedances at both fundamental and the second harmonic frequency. Based on this design technique, a 5 to 10 GHz single-ended GaAs FET frequency doubler was designed, fabricated, and tested. For the frequency doubler configuration, {{conversion gain}} of 7. 34 dB and saturated output power of 8. 17 dBm was achieved when the FET was biased in <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> rich second harmonic. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the {{conventional}} {{treatment of the}} field effect transistor, {{the first step is}} the specification of an impurity profile that describes the nature of the gate-channel contact. Solutions for the static and small-signal characteristics are then valid only for the particular impurity profile chosen, and must be repeated from the beginning for different structures. The purpose of this communication is to present a simple, though approximate, development of the characteristics of an FET without specifying the detailed nature of the structure. The charge-control approach is used, and it is shown that in the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region</b> the relation between the drain current and the gate-source voltage is approximately square law. The results are applicable to all gate-channel structures, including the insulated gate types...|$|E
40|$|Herein we {{demonstrate}} giant piezoresistance in silicon nanowires (NWs) by the modulation of {{an electric}} field-induced with an external electrical bias. Positive bias for a p-type device (negative for an n-type) partially depleted the NWs forming a <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> which resembled a funnel through which the electrical current squeezed. This region determined the total current flowing through the NWs. In this report, we combined the electrical biasing with the application of mechanical stress, which impacts the charge carriers’ concentration, to achieve an electrically controlled giant piezoresistance in nanowires. This phenomenon was {{used to create a}} stress-gated field-effect transistor, exhibiting a maximum gauge factor of 5000, 2 orders of magnitude increase over bulk value. Giant piezoresistance can be tailored to create highly sensitive mechanical sensors operating in a discrete mode such as nanoelectromechanical switches...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{simulate}} {{transport and}} fluctuations in 0. 3 μm gate length n-MOSFETs {{operating in the}} hot-carrier regime using ISE-TCAD software. Our results are compared with other results given by microscopic simulations. As a first step, drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic models are employed to study the static and dynamic characteristics of these devices in common-source configuration. The velocity overshoot and other hot electron phenomena in the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region</b> of the channel {{as well as the}} admittance parameters and other elements of small-signal equivalent scheme are in good agreement with the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The calculation of the spectral density of current fluctuations is implemented within the two-dimensional direct impedance field method of ISE-TCAD software at RF frequencies, when current fluctuations are dominated by diffusion noise. Among the two macroscopic models, only the hydrodynamic scheme simulates correctly the excess noise due to the presence of hot carriers...|$|E
40|$|A {{physical}} description of low-field {{behavior of a}} Schottky source-gated transistor (SGT) is outlined where carriers crossing the source barrier by thermionic emission are restricted by JFET action in the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region</b> at the drain end of the source. This mode of operation leads to transistor characteristics with low saturation voltage and high output impedance {{without the need for}} field relief {{at the edge of the}} Schottky source barrier and explains many characteristics of SGT observed experimentally. 2 -D device simulations with and without barrier lowering due to the Schottky effect show that the transistors can be designed so that the current is independent of source length and thickness variations in the semiconductor. This feature together with the fact that the current in an SGT is independent of source-drain separation hypothesizes the fabrication of uniform current sources and other large-area analog circuit blocks with repeatable performance even in imprecise technologies such as high-speed printing. © 1963 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{generation}} of additional interface traps in the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region</b> and the threshold voltage shift due to hotelectron stressing {{have been shown}} to cause 1 - 3 orders of magnitude increase in the flicker noise density. This flicker noise “overshoot ” can easily degrade the performance/resolution of analog circuits by 6 - 18 dB. An improved flicker noise model which is capable of accurately predicting the 1 /f noise characteristics of submicron MOSFET devices over a wide range of gate bias, and for various device sizes and hot-carrier stressing conditions has been developed. The functional form of the improved model takes into account both carrier number fluctuation and surface mobility fluctuation, and is similar to the BSIM 3 v 3. 1 model, with the exception that the improved model accounts for hot-carrier stressing effects. Excellent agreement between the improved model and measured data for devices fabricated in a 0. 35 μm standard CMOS process was observed. A I...|$|E
40|$|The droplet {{separation}} from a liquid jet was investigated experimentally. Details of {{the shape of}} the thin liquid neck joining the droplet to its parent body were studied in terms of the fluid viscosity and the jet diameter. As the viscosity increased, the neck rapidly elongated creating a long thread. Its final diameter before rupture was approximately one micrometer and seems to be constant within wide range of parameters varied. One or multiple breakups of the micro-thread were observed, which produced micro-satellites, i. e. droplets in a micrometer range. The experimental results only partly confirmed the predictions of Eggers' (1993) similarity solution. The predicted shape of the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region</b> well overlaps the long thread observed for very viscous liquids. However, the final jet diameter, retraction velocity of the thread and presence of multiple breakups differentiate the experimental evidence from the model expectations. 1 Introduction A liquid jet, starting as a laminar [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A new flash EEPROM {{cell and}} a novel erasing scheme on SOI {{substrates}} are reported. This flash EEPROM cell incorporates two separate control gates, located an {{opposite sides of}} the silicon film. One is a conventional control gate fabricated on top of the film as in bulk cells. The second control gate is the back gate itself, which is located underneath the silicon film and is inherent to all SOI MOSFET structures. As usual, the front control gate is used to WRITE the cell. By contrast, the back control gate is used to ERASE the cell in a new erasing scheme arrangement. In this scheme the back gate and the drain are used to invert the back channel and operate it in the impact ionization regime, such as to produce electron/hole pairs. Most of the generated electrons flow into the drain and some are injected into the back (buried) oxide. The holes, however, are accelerated towards the front gate, and many are finally injected into the floating gate, sandwiched between the front gate dioxide and front control gate. A prototype flash EEPROM cell was fabricated using a standard 1 -metal, 1 -poly CMOS SOI process and tested for concept proof. The cell was programmed via avalanche channel hot-electron injection from the drain <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> same as in bulk cell...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} capacity-approaching, yet simple scheme over a multiple-input single-output (MISO) {{wireless}} fading channel, {{which is very}} common in the downlink of a cellular system. The proposed scheme {{is based on a}} concatenation of a mixture of short memory-length convolutional codes or repetition codes and a short, and simple rate- 1 linear block code, followed by either 1 -dimensional (1 -D) anti-Gray or Gray mapping of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. By interpreting rate- 1 code together with 1 -D mapping as a multi-D mapping performed over multiple transmit antennas, the error performance is analyzed in the turbo <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region</b> using EXIT chart. At first, a simple design criterion on the bit-wise mutual information with perfect a priori information is derived. Based on the obtained design criterion, an optimal rate- 1 code for each 1 -D mapping is then constructed to maximize the bit-wise mutual information with perfect a priori information. The combination of optimal rate- 1 code and 1 -D mapping results in a steep inner detector's EXIT curve over an MISO channel, which matches very well to that of a simple outer code. It is demonstrated that the simple concatenation scheme can achieve a near-capacity performance over the MISO channels. In some cases, the selected mixed code is just a simple repetition code...|$|E

By interpreting the rate- 1 code and the 1 -D mapping as a multi-D mapping performed over multiple transmit antennas, the error performance is analyzed in two regions. In the error-floor region, a tight union bound and the corresponding design criterion on the asymptotic performance are derived. The bound provides a useful tool to predict the error performance at relatively low bit error rate (BER) values. Based on the obtained design criterion, an optimal rate- 1 code for each 1 -D mapping is then constructed to achieve the best asymptotic performance. In the turbo <b>pinch-off</b> <b>region,</b> by using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts, the most suitable mixed codes are selected for both symmetric and asymmetric antenna configurations. It is demonstrated that the simple concatenation scheme can achieve a near-capacity performance over the MIMO channels. Furthermore, its error performance is shown to be comparable to that obtained by using well-designed irregular LDPC and RA codes, and therefore, the proposed scheme significantly outperforms a scheme employing a parallel concatenated turbo code.
