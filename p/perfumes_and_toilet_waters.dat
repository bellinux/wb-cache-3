Introduction: The hygienic {{disposal of}} household wastes {{is one of}} the greatest problems of the day.

The health of the communitiesâ depends largely upon the disposal of the refuse matter Death rates have been permanently lowered since the introduction of even fairly efficient disposal of wastes. The dumping refuse upon vacant lots or around houses always leads to disease. Winds, animals, flies, and mosquitoes way become the carriers of disease.
