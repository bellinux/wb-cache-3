40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that species-specific <b>pit</b> properties such as <b>pit</b> membrane thickness, <b>pit</b> membrane porosity, torus-to-aperture diameter ratio and <b>pit</b> chamber depth influence xylem vulnerability to cavitation. Despite the indisputable importance of using mean <b>pit</b> characteristics, considerable variability in <b>pit</b> structure within a single species or even within a single <b>pit</b> field should be acknowledged. According to the rare <b>pit</b> hypothesis, a single <b>pit</b> that is more air-permeable than many neighboring <b>pits</b> is sufficient to allow air-seeding. Therefore, any irregularities or morphological abnormalities in <b>pit</b> structure allowing air-seeding should be associated with increased vulnerability to cavitation. Considering the currently proposed models of air-seeding, <b>pit</b> features such as rare, large pores in the <b>pit</b> membrane, torus extensions, and plasmodesmatal pores in a torus can represent potential glitches. These aberrations in <b>pit</b> structure could either result from inherent developmental flaws, or from damage caused to the <b>pit</b> membrane by chemical and physical agents. This suggests the existence of interesting feedbacks between abiotic and biotic stresses in xylem physiology...|$|R
