This procedure will reduce the downward sagging of the skin around {{the area of the}} triceps, tightening the skin.

40|$|Food, {{while it}} is {{essential}} for survival, is a dynamic and complex marketplace. The drive to be innovative and popular, combined with ever changing public perception and scientific knowledge, makes the food industry fascinating. One of the recent trends, including sugar and salt, has been the reduction <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> in our diets. However, consumers like to treat themselves and fatty foods give a pleasurable eating experience. These two things are often at odds. This work focusses on the development and use <b>of</b> a novel <b>fat</b> replacement technology known as air filled emulsions (AFEs) as a substitute for the function, both structurally and organoleptically, <b>of</b> the <b>fats</b> present within emulsion products. AFEs are micron sized <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> air coated in a protective protein coat. This work demonstrates that they can be produced reliably at kilogram scales with great potential for further scale-up.

40|$|This study {{followed}} {{the progression of}} lipolysis in Emmental cheese by quantifying the concentrations of individual free fatty acids (FFA) released during ripening {{in each of the}} different rooms: 12 days at 12 °C, 28 days at 21 °C, and 8 days at 4 °C. Lipolysis, which corresponded to 1. 56 % <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> mainly occurred in the 21 and 4 °C rooms, with 68 and 16. 5 % of total FFA, respectively. The nonselectivity of lipolytic enzymes was evidenced: all fatty acids were released with level of g 1 %. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that the thermal properties of cheese were affected by (i) lipolysis <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> that is, the monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and FFA that may be localized at the fat/whey interface, and/or by (ii) hydrolysis of high-melting-point triacylglycerols constituted mainly by long-chain saturated fatty acids (e. g., palmitic acid). Analysis of the cheese microstructure was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fat globules were mainly disrupted after pressing of curd grains, leading to the release <b>of</b> the milk <b>fat</b> globule membrane (MFGM); fat inclusions were surrounded by <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> whey, delimited by casein strands. Moreover, colonies of bacteria were preferentially localized in situ at the fat/protein interface. This study showed that both the localization of bacteria and the supramolecular organization <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> which was not protected by the MFGM can help the accessibility <b>of</b> milk <b>fat</b> to lipolytic enzymes and then contribute to the quality of cheese...|$|R
40|$|SummaryLiving in an enriched {{environment}} with complex {{physical and social}} stimulation leads to improved cognitive and metabolic health. In white fat, enrichment induced the upregulation <b>of</b> the brown <b>fat</b> cell fate determining gene Prdm 16, brown fat-specific markers, and genes involved in thermogenesis and β-adrenergic signaling. Moreover, <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> cells with prototypical brown fat morphology and high UCP 1 levels were observed in the white <b>fat</b> <b>of</b> enriched mice associated with resistance to diet-induced obesity. Hypothalamic overexpression of BDNF reproduced the enrichment-associated activation <b>of</b> the brown <b>fat</b> gene program and lean phenotype. Inhibition of BDNF signaling by genetic knockout or dominant-negative trkB reversed this phenotype. Our genetic and pharmacologic data suggest a mechanism whereby induction of hypothalamic BDNF expression in response to environmental stimuli leads to selective sympathoneural modulation <b>of</b> white <b>fat</b> to induce “browning” and increased energy dissipation...|$|R

40|$|Development of the eardrum {{retraction}} pocket, as pathologic finding, depends on Eustachian tube dysfunction, {{onset of the}} middle ear infection and site of development of retraction on the eardrum. The study is aimed at: 1. Determining the incidence <b>of</b> {{eardrum retraction}} <b>pocket</b> and cholesteatoma within it, {{as well as at the}} degree of eardrum retraction; 2. Determining of association between eardrum retraction <b>pocket</b> and changes <b>of</b> the eardrum mucosaand parstensa of the tympanic membrane; 3. Determining of onset and intensity of the bone destruction in eardrum retraction pocket; 4. Examining of Eustachian tube function based on time of mucocilliary transport according to the type of the eardrum retraction pocket. The study is based on the retrospective analysis of the results obtained from the patients treated at the Institute of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade for the diagnosis of the chronic suppurative otitis who underwent otosurgical procedures during the six-year period, from 1996 - 2001. In our series of 540 patients subjected to otosurgical treatment, the incidence <b>of</b> the retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum was 11. 23 %. Onset of more severe degree of eardrum retraction was most frequent in the attic. Cholesteatoma was detected in 82. 2 % of patients of the group with the attic-retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum, as well as in 25 % of patients of the group <b>of</b> tensa-sinus retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum. Atrophic changes of the tympanic membrane pars tensa were detected in almost all tensa-sinus retraction <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum. Approximately one half <b>of</b> the attic-retraction <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum were accompanied by eardrum atrophy. Bone destruction of the auditory ossicles was limited to the long process of incus and superior structures of stapes. Time of the mucocilliary transport was significantly longer (p< 0. 01) in attic-retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum than in tensa-sinus retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the eardrum, indicating significance of tube in development <b>of</b> attic-retraction <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the tympanic membrane.

50|$|It {{is highly}} {{recommended}} to limit how long one does a PSMF diet for hormonal and energetic reasons. In general, {{people who are}} more obese can stay on the PSMF diet longer {{than those who are}} leaner since their bodies' fat reserves can supply more energy. As one's body fat percentages decrease, it becomes more important to limit the diet to {{no more than a few}} weeks, whereas a very obese person could do it for much longer given proper micronutrient supplementation. Example) A 300-pound person at 40% BF has 120 pounds <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> and each pound <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> can supply about 31 calories energy to the body/pound <b>of</b> body <b>fat.</b> Thus, this person could theoretically produce up to 31 calories/lb <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> * 120 pounds <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> = 3,720 calories from his fat reserves in a day. A 160-pound person at 10% body fat, however, with 16 pounds <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> could only produce 31 calories/lb <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> * 16 pounds <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> = 496 calories from his fat reserves.|$|R
