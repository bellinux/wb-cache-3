2500|$|The {{primary device}} was a COBRA Deuterium-Tritium gas-boosted atomic bomb made by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, a very compact MK 7 device. This boosted fission device was {{tested in the}} Upshot Knothole Climax event and yielded [...] (out of 50â€“70 kt {{expected}} yield range), so that the planned operation Domino could be cancelled before the coming presidential election. The implosion system was quite lightweight at , because it eliminated the aluminium pusher shell around the tamper and used the more compact ring lenses, a design feature shared with the Mark 5, 12, 13 and 18 designs. The explosive material of the inner charges (I.C. for short) in the MK 7 was changed to the more powerful Cyclotol 75/25, instead of the Composition B used in most stockpiled bombs at that time, as Cyclotol 75/25 was denser than Composition B and thus could generate {{the same amount of}} explosive force in a smaller volume (it actually provided 13% more compressive energy than Comp B). The composite uranium-plutonium COBRA core was levitated in a type-D pit. COBRA was Los Alamos most recent end-product of design work on the very important [...] "new principles" [...] of the hollow core. A copper <b>pit</b> <b>liner</b> encased within the weapon-grade plutonium inner capsule prevented DT gas diffusion in plutonium, a technique first tested in Greenhouse Item. The assembled module weighed , measuring [...] across. It was located {{at the end of the}} device, which, as seen in the declassified film, shows a small cone projecting from the ballistic case. This cone is the part of the paraboloid that was used to focus the radiation emanating from the primary to the secondary.|$|E

40|$|Depth/diameter ratios {{measured}} for 98 craters in lunar glass targets {{reveal a}} broad distribution {{with a single}} strong peaking between 0. 55 and 0. 8. The measured values indicate a mean meteoroid density greater than 1 g/cu cm and probably less than 4 g/cu cm. Microprobe analyses show that typical glass <b>pit</b> <b>liners</b> on silicate targets contain only approximately 0. 1 % or less of meteoritic material. The size-frequency distribution of meteoroids was analyzed for a fractured glass surface of 60095, and a very steep size distribution of submicron meteoroids is indicated. As {{in the case of}} 15205, a dip at approximately 5 micron in the size-frequency distribution is detected...|$|R
5000|$|Compacted Clay LinedIf in-situ {{soils are}} not of the quality needed for a [...] "Cut and Fill" [...] design, the next most {{desirable}} construction {{is that of a}} Compacted Clay Liner. Clay used for the liner may of lower quality than that found in-situ where a [...] "Cut and Fill" [...] EMS is built. However, it must be able to achieve a similar permeability when compacted to a specified Proctor Density. Clay may also be trucked in from a borrow <b>pit.</b> The <b>liner</b> will be at least 1 metre in thickness and installed in 15 cm lifts, compacting between lifts.|$|R
40|$|Pit defects due to {{corrosion}} {{may occur}} in the inner surfaces of metal liners of fiber wrapped composite cylinders during working process, which may affect their anti-fatigue performance. Finite element method was {{used to analyze the}} stress of hoop-wrapped composite cylinders with pit defects of different sizes based on element birth and death method to take the pre-stress resulted from autofrettage process into consideration. Numeral results show that stress concentration appears in the pit defects, but the portion of the liner far away from pit defects keeps the same stress level with the defect-free composite cylinder. <b>Pit</b> defects on <b>liner</b> reduce the fatigue performance of the composite cylinder. Goodman equation was utilized to calculate the equivalent alternating stress amplitude to evaluate the variation of the fatigue performance with the dimensional change of the pit defects in the inner surfaces of metal liners of hoop-wrapped composite cylinders...|$|R
40|$|Numerous Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, {{as well as}} Department of Defense (DOD) and {{commercial}} facilities, have used earthen pits for disposal of chemicals, organic contaminants, and other waste materials. Although this was an acceptable means of disposal in the past, direct disposal into earthen <b>pits</b> without <b>liners</b> or barriers {{is no longer a}} standard practice. At the Savannah River Site (SRS), approximately three million pounds of such material was removed from seven chemical, metal, and pesticide disposal pits. This material is known as the Chemical, Metal, and Pesticide (CMP) Pit waste and carries several different listed waste codes depending on the contaminants in the respective storage container. The waste is not classified as a mixed waste because it is believed to be non-radioactive; however, in order to treat the material in a non-radioactive facility, the waste would first have to be screened for radioactivity. The Defense Waste Processing Technology (DWPT) Section of the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) was requested by the DOE-Savannah River (SR) office to determine the viability of vitrification of the CMP Pit wastes. Radioactive vitrification facilities exist which would be able to process this waste, so the material would not have to be analyzed for radioactive content. Bench-scale treatability studies were performed by the DWPT to determine whether a homogeneous and durable glass could be produced from the CMP Pit wastes. Homogeneous and durable glasses were produced from the six pits sampled. The optimum composition was determined to be 68. 5 wt% CMP waste, 7. 2 wt% Na{sub 2 }O, 9 wt% CaO, 7. 2 wt% Li{sub 2 }O and 8. 1 wt% Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }. This glass melted at 1, 150 C and represented a two fold volume reduction...|$|R
