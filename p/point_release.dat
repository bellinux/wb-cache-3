5|$|From Debian 5.0, the {{numbering}} scheme of point releases was changed, conforming to the GNU version numbering standard; the first <b>point</b> <b>release</b> of Debian 5.0 was 5.0.1 instead of 5.0r1. The {{numbering scheme}} {{was once again}} changed for the first Debian 7 update, which was version 7.1. The r scheme {{is no longer in}} use, but <b>point</b> <b>release</b> announcements include a note about not throwing away old CDs.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was {{to include the}} letter r (for revision) after the main version number and then {{the number of the}} point release; for example, the latest <b>point</b> <b>release</b> of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.|$|E

25|$|GNOME version numbers {{follow the}} scheme v.xx.yy. Here, v {{is a major}} version, which can include large changes such as ABI breakage; these have no regular {{schedule}} and occur in response to requirements for large-scale changes. xx is a minor version, released on the above schedule of approximately every 6 months, in which the 1- or 2-digit number's parity indicates the type of release: if xx is even (e.g. 3.20) the release is considered stable, whereas if xx is odd it represents a current development snapshot (e.g. 3.21) that will eventually evolve into the next stable release. yy indicates a <b>point</b> <b>release,</b> e.g. 3.20.6; these are made on a frequency of weeks in order to fix issues, add non-breaking enhancements, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Among iOS 11's changes: {{the lock}} screen and Notification Center are combined, {{allowing}} all notifications to be displayed {{directly on the}} lock screen.

Certain new features will appear only on iPad, including an always-accessible application dock and a new user interface to show multiple apps at once.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>point</b> <b>release,</b> {{the changes}} to the {{software}} project are typically minor, usually reserved for bug fixes, optimizations, security patches, or to add minor new features. Typically, bugs that affect the broad user population are picked for a <b>point</b> <b>release.</b> Depending on the organization, the size and breadth of a <b>point</b> <b>release</b> can range anywhere from a fix targeted release for a single customer to a general maintenance release or even a service pack. Point releases typically try to be interface-compatible with the previous major release of the software. Also, a <b>point</b> <b>release</b> tends to be compatible with all other point releases under the current minor or major version.|$|E
