50|$|In the 1970s, Hogan and Shprintzen {{advanced}} posterior pharyngeal flaps, {{leading to}} an increased success rate in the elimination of VPI. Hogan (1973) proposed a ‘lateral portal control’ flap to modulate the postoperative <b>port</b> <b>size.</b> In this flap, lateral ports exist {{on both sides of}} the pharyngeal flap to assist in drainage, nasal breathing, and nasal resonance. Using the pressure-flow studies of Warren and colleagues as a basis for lateral <b>port</b> <b>size,</b> Hogan placed a 4 mm diameter catheter through the lateral ports on either side of the flap to tailor the <b>port</b> <b>size</b> to the perception of nasal resonance (Sloan, 2000). Consistent with Warren’s aerodynamic data, Hogan advocated that the velopharyngeal opening be no greater than 4 mm in diameter because a larger gap would most likely result in hypernasal speech (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2001).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: This is {{the first}} {{nationwide}} prospective study to investigate the incidence and risk factors of endophthalmitis following pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). METHODS: This was a prospective, nationwide case-control study. Cases of presumed infectious endophthalmitis within 6 weeks of PPV were reported via the established British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit. The surveillance period was 2 years. Controls (patients who had PPV but no endophthalmitis) were recruited from nine randomly selected UK centres. RESULTS: 37 reports were received and 28 cases met the diagnostic criteria for presumed infectious endophthalmitis following PPV. The incidence of endophthalmitis following PPV was 28 cases per 48 433 PPVs (1 in 1730 with a 95 % CI of 1 in 1263 to 1 in 2747). 272 controls were randomly recruited from nine UK centres. Smaller gauge <b>port</b> <b>sizes</b> were {{not found to be}} a risk. Immunosuppression (OR 19. 0, p= 0. 001) and preoperative topical steroids (OR 131. 4, p< 0. 001) increased the endophthalmitis risk. Operating for retinal detachment was associated with a reduced risk of endophthalmitis (OR 0. 10, p= 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis following PPV is rare. Operating with smaller gauge <b>port</b> <b>sizes</b> does not increase the risk of endophthalmitis...|$|R

5000|$|After {{the first}} few years of rave reviews of the Quad 4, the {{automotive}} press began to criticize it for its noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). At the time, the Quad 4 was generally compared to turbocharged four cylinders, V6s, and occasionally V8s. The first changes of the Quad 4 to address its NVH were two rounds of exhaust <b>port</b> <b>size</b> reductions, followed by the addition of balance shafts in 1995. Further changes were made for the 1996 model year when the engine's bore and stroke were changed, and the engine was subsequently redubbed [...] "Twin Cam".|$|E

Changes that differentiate the LG0 from the LD2 engine are more aggressive camshafts and an extra half point of compression; 9.5:1 to 10.0:1.

5000|$|The TU2 has a {{displacement}} of 1294 cc, with a bore of 75 mm and {{a stroke of}} 73 mm. Power was initially 95 PS (94 hp/70 kW), powering the Citroën AX Sport, but a slightly more powerful version of the TU24 was developed for the Peugeot 205 Rallye with a straighter intake manifold and slightly larger venturi size in the Weber carburttors. A new version with 100 PS (99 hp/74 kW) was created in 1992 for the Peugeot 106 Rallye, with {{the adoption of a}} Magneti Marelli fuel injection system and a catalytic converter.

5000|$|Most current gas systems employ {{some type}} of piston. The face of the piston is acted upon by {{combustion}} gas from a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. Early guns such as Browning's 'flapper' prototype, the Bang rifle, and Garand rifle used relatively low-pressure gas from {{at or near the}} muzzle. This, combined with more massive operating parts, reduced the strain on the mechanism. To simplify and lighten the firearm, gas from nearer the chamber needed to be used. This high pressure gas has sufficient force to destroy a firearm unless it is regulated somehow. Most gas-operated firearms rely on tuning the gas <b>port</b> <b>size,</b> mass of operating parts, and spring pressures to function. Several other methods are employed to regulate the energy. The M1 carbine incorporates a very short piston, or [...] "tappet". This movement is closely restricted by a shoulder recess. Excess gas is then vented back into the bore. The M14 rifle and M60 GPMG use the White expansion and cutoff system to stop (cut off) gas from entering the cylinder once the piston has traveled a short distance. Most systems, however, vent excess gas into the atmosphere through slots, holes, or ports.|$|E
50|$|Reciprocating {{compressors}} {{often have}} better unloading capabilities than scroll compressors. Reciprocating compressors operate efficiently in unloaded mode when flow {{to some of}} the cylinders is completely cut off by internal solenoid valves. Two-stage reciprocating compressors are also well suited for vapor injection (or what may be called economized operation) when partially expanded flow is injected {{between the first and second}} compression stages for increased capacity and improved efficiency. While scroll compressors can also rely on vapor injection to vary the capacity, their vapor injection operation is not as efficient as for the case of reciprocating compressors. This inefficiency is caused by continuously changing volume of the scroll compressor compression pocket during the vapor injection process. As the volume is continuously being changed the pressure within the compression pocket is also continuously changing which adds inefficiency to the vapor injection process. In case of a two-stage reciprocating compressor the vapor injection takes place between the two stages, where there is no changing volume. Both scroll and reciprocating compressors can be unloaded from mid-stage compression, however reciprocating compressors are also more efficient for this mode of unloading than scroll compressors, because the unloaded port dimensions in case of scroll is limited by the internal <b>port</b> <b>size,</b> which would not be the case for a reciprocating compressor where unloading again occurs from between the two stages.|$|E

[...] Very early XK engines fitted to the XK 120 sports car and Mark VII saloon lacked fixing studs at the front part of the cam covers, where they covered the timing chains, which leaked oil as a result.

40|$|Bifurcated nozzles {{are used}} in {{continuous}} casting of molten steel, where they influence {{the quality of the}} cast steel slabs. The present study performs two and three-dimensional simulations of steady turbulent (K-ε) flow in bifurcated nozzles, using a finite-element (FIDAP) model, which has been verified previously with water model experiments. The effects of nozzle design and casting process operating variables on the jet characteristics exiting the nozzle are investigated. The nozzle design parameters studied include the shape, angle, height, width, and thickness of the ports and the bottom geometry. The process operating practices include inlet velocity profile and angle, and port curvature caused by erosion or inclusion buildup. Results show that the jet angle is controlled mainly by the port angle, but is steeper with larger port area and thinner walls. The degree of swirl is increased by larger or rounder ports. The effective port area, where there is no recirculation, is increased by smaller or curved ports. Flow asymmetry is more severe with skewed or angled inlet conditions or unequal <b>port</b> <b>sizes.</b> Turbulence levels in the jet are higher with higher casting speed and smaller ports...|$|R

Conventional hydraulic cylinders are simulated in FLUENT. Results show that the small outlet ports are the sources of energy loss in hydraulic cylinders. A new hydraulic system was proposed as a solution to relieve the hydraulic resistance in the actuators. The proposed system is a four ports hydraulic cylinder fitted with a novel flow control valve. The proposed four ports cylinder was simulated and parameters such as <b>ports</b> <b>sizes,</b> loads and pressures are varied during the simulation.
