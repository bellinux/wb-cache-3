40|$|To {{define the}} fate of {{embryonic}} neuroblasts in rat gut, which transiently express several noradrenergic traits, we investigated the high-affinity uptake of norepinephrine. At 12. 5 days of gestation, these cells exhibited immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase [tyrosine 3 -monoxygenase; L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3 -hydroxylating), EC 1. 14. 16. 2] and endogenous catecholamine fluorescence. However, by 13. 5 days these noradrenergic neurotransmitter <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characters</b> essentially disappeared. In contrast, norepinephrine uptake, which was also apparent at 12. 5 days, persisted at least through 17. 5 days.

5000|$|One basic {{mechanism}} {{which can}} produce mosaic tissue is mitotic recombination or somatic crossover. It was first discovered by Curt Stern in Drosophila in 1936. The amount of tissue which is mosaic {{depends on where}} in the tree of cell division the exchange takes place. A <b>phenotypic</b> <b>character</b> called [...] "Twin Spot" [...] seen in Drosophila {{is a result of}} mitotic recombination. However, it also depends on the allelic status of the genes undergoing recombination. Twin spot occurs only if the heterozygous genes are linked in repulsion i.e. trans phase. The recombination needs to occur between the centromere the adjacent gene. This gives an appearance of yellow patches on the wild type background in Drosophila. another example of mitotic recombination is the Bloom's syndrome which happens due to the mutation in the blm gene. The resulting BLM protein is defective. the defect in RecQ an helicase facilitates the defective unwinding of DNA during replication and is thus associated with the occurrence of this disease.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "wild type" [...] allele is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} an allele that is thought {{to contribute to the}} typical <b>phenotypic</b> <b>character</b> as seen in [...] "wild" [...] populations of organisms, such as fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Such a [...] "wild type" [...] allele was historically regarded as dominant (overpowering - always expressed), common, and normal, in contrast to [...] "mutant" [...] alleles regarded as recessive, rare, and frequently deleterious. It was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the [...] "wild type" [...] allele at most gene loci, and that any alternative [...] "mutant" [...] allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of [...] "affected" [...] individuals, often as genetic diseases, and more frequently in heterozygous form in [...] "carriers" [...] for the mutant allele. It is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic, with multiple alleles, whose frequencies vary from population to population, and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences.|$|E
5000|$|The bead {{theory is}} a disproved {{hypothesis}} that genes are arranged on the chromosome like beads on a necklace. According to this theory, {{the existence of}} a gene as a unit of inheritance is recognized through its mutant alleles. A mutant allele affects a single <b>phenotypic</b> <b>character,</b> maps to one chromosome locus, gives a mutant phenotype when paired and shows a Mendelian ratio when intercrossed. Several tenets of the bead theory are worth emphasizing :-1. The gene is viewed as a fundamental unit of structure, indivisible by crossing over. Crossing over take place between genes ( [...] the beads in this model [...] ) but never within them.2. The gene is viewed as the fundamental unit of change or mutation. It changes in toto from one allelic form into another; there are no smaller components within it that can change.3. The gene is viewed as the fundamental unit of function ( [...] although the precise function of gene is not specified in this model [...] ). Parts of a gene, if they exist cannot function.Seymour Benzer showed in the 1950s that the bead theory was not correct. He demonstrated that a gene can be defined as a unit of function. A gene can be subdivided into a linear array of sites that are mutable and that can be recombined. The smallest units of mutation and recombination are now known to be correlated with single nucleotide pairs.|$|E

A total of 791 BC 1 F 8 backcross recombinant lines, {{derived from the}} cross of Xieqingzao B / N 22 // Xieqingzao B, were used as materials. Each rice line was separated evenly into two groups, and the heat tolerance of all rice lines were evaluated at natural high temperature in fields.

Our objective was to determine the distribution patterns of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characters</b> and the relationship of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characters</b> and environmental factors of A. thaliana populations. Methods From May to June 2009, we studied ten populations in the northern Tianshan Mountains. We placed 10 m × 10 m quadrats at each population plot, each comprised of about 400 smaller (0. 5 m × 0. 5 m) quadrats, and investigated the distributional patterns of populations and nine environmental factors. Twenty A. thaliana plantswere selected, and ten phenotypic characteristics (branch number, plant height, plant biomass, root biomass, single fruit weight, fruit number per plant, fruits weight per plant, fruit length, fruit dehiscence force, fruit weight per plant/total weight) were measured. Variance, principal component and regression analyses were used. Important findings All phenotypic characteristics except branch number showed significant differences among populations, which indicated that there is strongly plasticity in the nine characters. The results of the analysis of variance and coefficients of variance indicated that fruit length and fruit dehiscence force have little variation within and among populations. <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>characters</b> varied little among different mountains, altitudes, latitudes and longitudes. The results indicated that A. thaliana populations mainly distributed on sandy soils that contained lower HCO 3 –, pH values and higher soil organic carbon (SOC). The distribution frequencies of A. thaliana within populations are very low, ranging from 1. 56 % to 10. 69 %, with spatial autocorrelation distances being 15. 4 to 46. 7 cm and variable. Ten populations were all highly clumped in their distribution (p < 0. 01), which was significantly correlated with the fruit dehiscence force, while the fruit dehiscence force increased as environmental stress increased. Results suggested that the growth and distribution of A. thaliana in the northern Tianshan Mountains are influenced mainly by microenvironments. In dry environments, A. thaliana would increases the ratio of reproduction distribution and produce poorly dehiscent fruits that make seeds disperse around maternal plants and utilizefeasible habitats...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies are showing {{evidence in support of}} sympatric speciation. One basic question remains, however.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} evolution of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characters</b> is very complex and is poorly understood with few examples documenting the roles of multiple genes. Considering that a single gene cannot fully explain the convergence of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characters,</b> we choose to study the convergent evolution of rod vision in two divergent bats from a network perspective. The Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) are non-echolocating and have binocular vision, whereas the sheath-tailed bats (Emballonuridae) are echolocating and have monocular vision; however, they both have relatively large eyes and rely more on rod vision to find food and navigate in the night. We found that the genes CRX, which plays an essential role in the differentiation of photoreceptor cells, SAG, which is involved in the desensitization of the photoactivated transduction cascade, and the photoreceptor gene RH, which is directly responsible for the perception of dim light, have undergone parallel sequence evolution in two divergent lineages of bats with larger eyes (Pteropodidae and Emballonuroidea).

The exceptional plasticity of morphological traits towards environmental parameters causes difficulties in the circumscription of species, and taxonomic revisions are needed, especially in tropical regions. In this taxonomic treatment of Usnea in tropical South America (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, incl. the Galapagos Islands, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela), we identified 51 species, representing ca. half of the total diversity of species occurring in this region. Out of these 51 species, 16 are so far endemic to South America, whereas several species have a wide distribution, sometimes across several continents. Twelve species were newly described and 15 species were newly reported for South America, indicating that the diversity of Neotropical Usnea species is particularly high and that numerous discoveries are yet to be made. In addition to taxonomic studies, the phylogeny of Usnea was investigated using the nuclear ribosomal genes ITS rDNA and nuLSU, {{as well as two}} protein-coding genes RPB 1 and MCM 7.
