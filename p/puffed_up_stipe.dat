5000|$|With its sharp, grey-green, keeled leaves, and its <b>puffed</b> <b>up,</b> {{inflated}} flowers, {{the species}} is easily mistaken for the closely related Astroloba spiralis species. However it is genetically distinct and can always be distinguished by its flowers. Both spiralis and herrei have <b>puffed</b> <b>up,</b> inflated flowers, but those of herrei are smooth (unlike spiralis, which has a wrinkled, transversely rugose, perianth).|$|R

60|$|At first {{everybody}} {{thought it a}} great joke to see Old Mr. Toad so <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> with, pride, but after a little they grew tired of being snubbed by their old friend and neighbor, and began to say unpleasant things about him.

40|$|We explore whether protoplanetary disks with self-shadowing from <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> inner rims exhibit {{observable}} {{features in}} scattered light images. We use both self-consistent hydrostatic equilibrium calculations and parameterized models {{to produce the}} vertically <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> inner rims. We find that, in general, the transition between the shadowed and flared regions occurs in a smooth manner over a broad radius range, and no sudden jump exists at {{the outer edge of}} the shadow in either the disk temperature or density structures. As a result, a <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> rim cannot create sharp ring/arc/spiral-arm-like features in the outer disk as have been detected in recent direct NIR imaging of disks. On the other hand, if the <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> rim has a sharp edge in the vertical direction, the shadowing effect can produce a distinct 3 -stage broken power law in the radial intensity profile of the scattered light, with 2 steep surface brightness radial profiles in the inner and outer disk joined by a shallow transition region around the shadow edge. These types of scattered light profiles may have already been observed, such as in the recent Subaru direct imaging of the TW Hydrae system.
