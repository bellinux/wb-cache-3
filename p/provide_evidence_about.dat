25|$|In {{forensic}} science, questioned document examination (QDE) is {{the examination}} of documents potentially disputed {{in a court of}} law. Its primary purpose is to <b>provide</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>about</b> a suspicious or questionable document using scientific processes and methods. Evidence might include alterations, the chain of possession, damage to the document, forgery, origin, authenticity, or other questions that come up when a document is challenged in court.|$|E
25|$|De facto {{relationships}} often face an onerous {{burden of}} proof before rights that are automatically granted to married couples can be accessed. This means partners may have to <b>provide</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>about</b> their living and childcare arrangements, sexual relationship, finances, ownership of property, commitment to a shared life and how they present as a couple in public. This can present difficulties when de facto relationships are legally contested by other people, usually other family members. Marriages rarely encounter such difficulties as they are generally regarded as immediate and incontrovertible.|$|E

According to Jutta Ditfurth, the last days before Meinhof's death went smoothly.

50|$|In {{addition}} to explaining how mass is acquired by vector bosons, the Higgs mechanism also predicts the ratio between the W boson and Z boson masses {{as well as}} their couplings {{with each other and with}} the Standard Model quarks and leptons.

5000|$|The {{plastered}} skulls represent some of {{the earliest}} forms of burial practices in the southern Levant. During the Neolithic period, the deceased were often buried under the floors of their homes. Sometimes the skull was removed, and its cavities filled with plaster and painted. In order to create more lifelike faces, shells were inset for eyes, and paint was used to represent facial features, hair, and moustaches. [...] Some scholars believe that this burial practice represents an early form of ancestor worship, where the plastered skulls were used to commemorate and respect family ancestors. Other experts argue that the plastered skulls could be linked to the practice of head hunting, and used as trophies.

Also, while traditional clinical trials focus primarily on therapeutic efficacy and safety, outcomes research may consider additional parameters such as cost, timeliness, convenience, geographical accessibility and patient preferences. Consequently, the field is more multi-disciplinary, involving, in addition to healthcare professionals and the manufacturers of medical devices or pharmaceuticals, medical economists, sociologists, and public health researchers.|$|E
50|$|The {{designers}} {{hoped that}} SuperB {{would help to}} <b>provide</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>about</b> the flavour sector of the Standard Model. SuperB was intended to give further information about any new physics found by the Large Hadron Collider. It {{may also have been}} able to check for sources of CP violation, which may contribute to an understanding of why the universe is full of matter and not antimatter. Accepted physical theory indicates that at the Big Bang equal quantities of matter and antimatter were created. However, when matter and antimatter meet they annihilate one another, so we should expect the universe to be empty. Physicists believe that CP violation may account for the discrepancy, and the designers hoped that SuperB may be able to throw light on the question. They expected that SuperB {{will be able to make}} much more precise checks for CP violation than has been possible in the past.|$|E
