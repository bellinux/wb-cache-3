40|$|The {{work began}} in October 1994 with the {{following}} objectives: (1) to produce an improved version of the programming language Formian; and (2) to create a means for computer aided handling of <b>polyhedric</b> configurations including the geodesic forms of all kinds. A new version of Formian, referred to as Formian 2, is being implemented {{to operate in the}} Windows 95 environment. It is an ideal tool for configuration management in a convenient and user-friendly manner. The second objective was achieved by creating a standard Formian function that allows convenient handling of all types of <b>polyhedric</b> configurations. In particular, the focus of attention is on <b>polyhedric</b> configurations that are of importance in architectural and structural engineering fields. The natural medium for processing of <b>polyhedric</b> configurations is a programming language that incorporates the concepts of 'formex algebra'. Formian is such a programming language in which the processing of <b>polyhedric</b> configurations can be carried out using the standard elements of the language.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the construction of <b>polyhedric</b> space structures using reciprocally supported structural elements of circular, rectangular, triangular and trapezoidal cross-section. Platonic and Archimedean polyhedral forms are considered for potential space structure construction. Several examples of these basic forms are investigated using elements that are variously aligned to the polyhedra surface edges. The impact of element cross-section and orientation alternatives is also considered. A feature of structures constructed using reciprocally supported elements is the way the load bearing elements mutually support one another.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} optimization problems with complementarity constraints in infinite-dimensional spaces. On the one hand, {{we deal with}} the general situation, in which the complementarity constraint is governed by a closed convex cone. We use the local decomposition approach, which is known from finite dimensions, to derive first-order necessary optimality conditions of strongly stationary type. In the non-polyhedric case, stronger conditions are obtained by an additional linearization argument. On the other hand, we consider the optimal control of the obstacle problem. This is a classical example for a problem with complementarity constraints in infinite dimensions. We are concerned with the control-constrained case. Due to the lack of surjectivity, a system of strong stationarity is not necessarily satisfied for all local minimizers. We identify assumptions on the data of the optimal control problem under which strong stationarity of local minimizers can be verified. Moreover, without any additional assumptions on the data, we show that a system of M-stationarity is satisfied provided that some sequence of multipliers converges in capacity. Finally, we also discuss the notion of <b>polyhedric</b> sets. These sets have many applications in infinite-dimensional optimization theory. Since the results concerning polyhedricity are scattered in the literature, we provide a review of the known results. Furthermore, we give some new results concerning polyhedricity of intersections and provide counterexamples which demonstrate that intersections of <b>polyhedric</b> sets may fail to be <b>polyhedric.</b> We also prove a new polyhedricity result for sets in vector-valued Sobolev spaces...|$|E

40|$|Open cell foams are {{considered}} promising catalytic substrates providing high surface {{area and a}} tortuous structure resulting in enhanced mass transfer characteristics. CFD analysis, recently, has focused in pointing structures with favourable reactivity-flow resistance characteristics.

In this study a comprehensive comparison of real foams with equivalent Kelvin cell lattices is performed in CFD. Therefore 4 typical foams (two ceramic and two metallic) have been chosen. Geometric properties have been accessed with Micro-Tomography scans. Randomised Kelvin cell lattices have been generated matching porosity and specific surface area of the scanned real foams. Geometric, momentum and mass transfer characteristics of real foams and Kelvin cell lattices are analysed with CFD. Kelvin cell lattices showed similar behaviour in respect to their real foam equivalents, had though clearly better reactivity-pressure drop trade-offs.

When heated to 1230 °C, 16. 7 % of HA had decomposed to ß-TCP. SEM investigations showed homogeneous, sharp angular <b>polyhedric</b> blocks of 30 to 50 µm with rare surface pores. On heating at 1230 °C, ß-TCP had entirely transformed to a-TCP. During sintering, {{the size of the}} powder grains increased and progressive bridging between the grains was observed. At 1230 °C, a network within round-shaped <b>polyhedric</b> blocks of 50 to 90 µm was formed. In both, HA and IJ-TCP, surfaces were smooth. The chemical composition and the crystallinity of calcium phosphate ceramics determine their dissolution behavior and osteogenic properties. Nevertheless, their temperature dependent morphological features, such as, particle shape and size, surface texture, and porosity, as demonstrated in the present study, also influence the resorption rates, tissue responses, and wound healing duration.

We prove that the hypotheses required by this abstract sensitivity result are veried for the nonlinear obstacle plate problem. Namely, the constraint set dened by the obstacle is <b>polyhedric</b> and the mapping involved in the denition of the plate problem, considered {{as a function of the}} middle plane of the plate, is semi-dierentiable.
