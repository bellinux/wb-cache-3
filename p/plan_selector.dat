40|$|The system {{consists}} of collection of services, running on several of nodes. The workload generated by services may cause nodes overload, which negatively impacts the response time of services. The reconfiguration {{of the system}} incrementally transforms one system state to the other. The goal of the reconfiguration is to transform the system state into one, which all services meet their response time. Finding the appropriate reconfiguration that satisfies all timing requirements is the dynamic, preemptive scheduling problem. We consider this problem as the planning problem, where plan {{consists of}} consequent steps of the reconfigurations actions. Classical planning algorithms {{cannot be applied to}} this problem because of the incomplete information. We used the concept of the conformant planning (Smith and Weld 98), which refers to planning with incomplete information that achieves the goal from any initial state compatible with the available information. The planner consists of the plan generator and the <b>plan</b> <b>selector.</b> The generator creates a collection of plans. The selector selects that one, which in the most probable degree transforms system to the state that satisfies all timing requirements. The selected plan is applied to the system. The simulation results proved the concept of our approach...|$|E
40|$|Rindex (a {{short for}} RAM Index) is {{designed}} as a platform to be used top of a traditional database management system (DBMS). The main focus for this project has been on how to maximize the usage of the available main memory by keeping the indexes entirely in RAM. This way we avoid disk I/O when using an index, and therefore increase the efficiency drastically. In Rindex the relations still resides on disk, only the indexes are kept entirely in memory. This distinguishes Rindex from already existing MMDBMS (main memory DBMS). We have designed and implemented a first version of this platform. This version of Rindex is limited in that it only supports {{a subset of the}} SQL language, and just utilizes static indexes (i. e. modifying relations or schemas is currently not supported). Rindex contains all the standard components: scanner, parser, optimizer, plan generator, <b>plan</b> <b>selector,</b> and plan executor. On startup, the platform generates an index on every attribute that are comparable, e. g. integer, floats, and strings. Inverted indexes are also generated. The main focus of this thesis is to analyzes the efficiency of the substitution operator, a special operator in Rindex. The operator substitutes the attribute values in a intermediate index, with the corresponding values from another attribute (i. e. values with the same primary key). We propose several different solutions to optimize this operator, and this results in a significantly improved substitution operator. We design new data structures for the inverted index, since the substitution algorithm heavily depends and follows from this structure. We also analyzes the algorithm that inserts the substitution operator into the query tree. Our attempt to improve the algorithm, i. e. to minimize the number of substitution operators, led to the conclusion that it requires knowledge of the cost estimates and heuristics used by the optimization algorithm. The reason is that the optimization algorithm and this algorithm often disagrees on the ordering of the operators. The thesis is written in Norwegian...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest and examine a control system with a fuzzy {{controller}} and a fuzzy-PID controller to solve the problem of mobile robot path planning. The environment information about obstacles and the goal has been detected by using sensors. The system divides environment situations into two types the obstacle mode and non-obstacle mode. In view of the oscillation problem existing in fuzzy control when there is no obstacle, this paper proposes that the fuzzy control is used for the obstacle mode and the fuzzy adaptive PID control is used for the non-obstacle mode. The robot performs the real-time planning choice by path <b>planning</b> <b>selector,</b> and the control system is simulated by Matlab software. The simulation result shows that the control strategy has the characteristics of faster response, better real-time performance and achieves a better path from the start point to the target point...|$|R
2500|$|He {{announced}} his retirement from international cricket after the 2012 Boxing Day Test at Melbourne. His last Test appearance was the New Yearâ€™s fixture against Sri Lanka at the SCG, starting on 3 January 2013. He planned to play {{out the rest of}} the Australian summer in limited overs cricket but was surprisingly dropped with Australian <b>selectors</b> <b>planning</b> for the 2015 world cup and to give Phillip Hughes and Usman Khawaja an opportunity at ODI level. Hussey explained that his motivation for his retirement was to spend more time with his family. [...] Hussey also delayed his announcement until before the Sydney Test in 2013, fearing that he would have been dropped before the Australian summer season was over.|$|R
