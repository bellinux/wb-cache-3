5|$|Over a dozen medical papyri {{have been}} preserved, {{most notably the}} Edwin Smith <b>Papyrus</b> (the oldest extant {{surgical}} handbook) and the Ebers <b>Papyrus</b> (a handbook of preparing and using materia medica for various diseases), both from the 16th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|The Edwin Smith <b>Papyrus,</b> {{an ancient}} Egyptian medical {{treatise}} {{written in the}} 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this <b>papyrus,</b> describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head. The <b>papyrus</b> mentions the external surface of the brain, the effects of injury (including seizures and aphasia), the meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|A Book of the Dead <b>papyrus</b> was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. <b>Papyrus</b> itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand <b>papyrus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that Sahure had not faded from memory during the Middle Kingdom is the Westcar <b>Papyrus,</b> {{which was written}} during the 12th Dynasty. The <b>papyrus</b> tells the mythical story {{of the origins of}} the 5th Dynasty, presenting kings Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai as three brothers, sons of Ra and a woman named Rededjet.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red ochre, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus <b>papyrus</b> plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that <b>papyrus</b> rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of <b>papyrus</b> documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus <b>papyrus.</b> It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and <b>papyrus,</b> writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E

5|$|Most {{settlements}} in ancient Egypt were {{situated on the}} alluvium of the Nile floodplain. This moist environment was unfavorable for long-term preservation of <b>papyrus</b> documents. Archaeologists have discovered a larger quantity of <b>papyrus</b> documents in desert settlements on land elevated above the floodplain, and in settlements that lacked irrigation works, such as Elephantine, El-Lahun, and El-Hiba.|$|E
5|$|No {{historical}} attestation of Sheshi {{is known}} for certain. Sheshi is absent from the Turin canon, a list of kings written on <b>papyrus</b> during the Ramesside period and which serves as the primary historical source for the second intermediate period. This is because {{the section of the}} <b>papyrus</b> covering the 13th to 17th Dynasties is heavily damaged and the problem of Seshi's chronological position cannot be resolved from the document.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon dating {{determined}} that the <b>papyrus</b> is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas. The fragment's provenance and similarity to another fragment from the same anonymous owner widely believed to be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that the text is a modern forgery written on a scrap of medieval <b>papyrus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian Ebers <b>Papyrus</b> from 1550BCE and the Kahun <b>Papyrus</b> from 1850BCE have {{within them}} {{some of the}} {{earliest}} documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm. It is believed that in Ancient Greece silphium was used as birth control which, due to its effectiveness and thus desirability, was harvested into extinction.|$|E

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith <b>Papyrus</b> XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the <b>papyrus,</b> (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings <b>papyrus</b> for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} <b>papyrus</b> by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the <b>papyrus</b> to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve the fragment. A second analysis was performed by Harvard University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E
5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty <b>papyrus.</b> However, A {{man and his}} Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty <b>papyrus,</b> <b>Papyrus</b> Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In A man and his Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{is handled}} in Books XII to XVIII, with Theophrastus {{as one of}} Pliny's sources. The {{manufacture}} of <b>papyrus</b> and the various grades of <b>papyrus</b> available to Romans are described. Different types of trees and the properties of their wood are explained in Books XII to XIII. The vine, viticulture and varieties of grape are discussed in Book XIV, while Book XV covers the olive tree in detail, followed by other trees including the apple and pear, fig, cherry, myrtle and laurel, among others.|$|E

5|$|However, {{while the}} <b>papyrus</b> itself is medieval in origin, further {{analysis}} {{has suggested that}} the text itself includes additional errors that suggest it is not authentic.|$|E
5|$|In Book VI, Isidore {{describes}} ecclesiastical {{books and}} offices {{starting with the}} Old and New Testaments, the authors and names of the holy books, libraries and translators, authors, writing materials including tablets, <b>papyrus</b> and parchment, books, scribes, and Christian festivals.|$|E
5|$|Shepseskare is {{completely}} absent from another king list {{dating to the}} same period: the Abydos king list, written {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the <b>papyrus</b> on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the <b>papyrus</b> also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th dynasty, the Book of the Dead {{had become}} {{widespread}} {{not only for}} members of the royal family, but courtiers and other officials as well. At this stage, the spells were typically inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around the dead, though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on <b>papyrus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Medicines {{derived from}} willow trees and other salicylate-rich {{plants have been}} part of pharmacopoeias at least dating back to ancient Sumer. The Ebers <b>Papyrus,</b> an Egyptian medical text from ca. 1543 BC, {{mentions}} use of willow and myrtle (another salicylate-rich plant) to treat fever and pain.|$|E
5|$|Several early sources, {{including}} an Egyptian <b>papyrus,</b> an Ayurvedic medical treatise, the Bible, and Galen's writings, describe symptoms resembling those of PD. After Galen {{there are no}} references unambiguously related to PD until the 17th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, several authors wrote about elements of the disease, including Sylvius, Gaubius, Hunter and Chomel.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} attested {{examples of}} mathematical calculations {{date to the}} predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed numeral system. The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical <b>Papyrus</b> and the Moscow Mathematical <b>Papyrus</b> show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.|$|E
5|$|The mineral beryl, which {{contains}} beryllium, {{has been used}} {{at least since the}} Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. In the first century CE, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia Natural History that beryl and emerald ("smaragdus") were similar. The <b>Papyrus</b> Graecus Holmiensis, written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small <b>papyrus</b> {{fragment}} was found, and {{the first half of}} the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the Catalogue. Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the Catalogue was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of <b>papyrus</b> witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the Catalogue. The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.|$|E
5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers <b>Papyrus</b> dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep's reign saw {{literary}} developments. The Book of What {{is in the}} Underworld ('the Egyptian Book of the Dead'), {{an important}} funerary text used in the New Kingdom, {{is believed to have}} reached its final form during Amenhotep's reign, since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I. The Ebers <b>papyrus,</b> which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, also seems to date to this time (the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document).|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes <b>papyrus</b> scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{names for}} crow or raven species include very {{possibly}} gbgb/gbg3; this bird is once called 3pd km or 'black bird', while its eggs could apparently be gathered {{according to a}} medical <b>papyrus,</b> and therefore points to a breeding bird of Egypt. In demotic an ʾbḳ-bird can be determined by help {{of the existence of}} Coptic abook 'Crow, raven'. But perhaps the latter is also a derivatiuon of the bird name kbk.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{source of information about}} Egypt during the reign of Djedkare Isesi is the Abusir papyri. These are administrative documents, covering a period of 24 years during Djedkare's reign; they were discovered in the mortuary temples of pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre and queen Khentkaus II. In addition to these texts, the earliest letters on <b>papyrus</b> preserved to the present day also date to Djedkare's reign, dealing with administrative or private matters.|$|E
5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the <b>papyrus.</b> Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes frequent use of plant motifs and patterns, including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the decorative arts in the Western world in such forms as the Rococo and later the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} two years at Harvard, Benchley worked with the Harvard Advocate and the Harvard Lampoon. He was elected to the Lampoons board of {{directors}} in his third year. The election of Benchley was unusual, as he was the publication's art editor and the board positions typically fell to the foremost writers on the staff. The Lampoon position opened a number of other doors for Benchley, and he was quickly nominated to the Signet Society meeting club as well as becoming the only undergraduate member of the Boston <b>Papyrus</b> Club at the time.|$|E
5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is the most reliable witness of the text. In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, <b>Papyrus</b> 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, opinion is divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce and {{ambiguous}} literary evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and that the other units contained {{in the region of}} 500 men each. Others draw on <b>papyrus</b> and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged about half the Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for other units.|$|E
5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more {{copies of}} the Book of the Dead are found in hieratic script. The {{calligraphy}} {{is similar to that}} of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds to the size of the <b>papyrus</b> sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.|$|E
