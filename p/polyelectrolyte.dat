25|$|If <b>polyelectrolyte</b> {{chains are}} added {{to a system of}} charged macroions (i.e. an array of DNA molecules), an {{interesting}} phenomenon called the <b>polyelectrolyte</b> bridging might occur. The term bridging interactions is usually applied to the situation where a single <b>polyelectrolyte</b> chain can adsorb to two (or more) oppositely charged macroions (e.g. DNA molecule) thus establishing molecular bridges and, via its connectivity, mediate attractive interactions between them.|$|E

We have compared the self-diffusion coefficients of counterions of four families of systems with different compositions (presence or not of charged obstacles and of <b>polyelectrolytes).</b> Our main result is that the presence of <b>polyelectrolytes</b> only modulates a behavior we had already observed before: In the domain where the porosity is relatively high compared to the Debye length, diffusion coefficients of counterions increase when the porosity decreases. Moreover, we have shown that, in the systems investigated here without charges on obstacles, the self-diffusion of counterions is mostly affected by the presence of <b>polyelectrolytes</b> and not by concentration effects, contrarily to co-ions. Also, we have seen that even if the density of the probability of presence of counterions in the vicinity of <b>polyelectrolytes</b> is much higher than that on obstacles, the residence time of ions around <b>polyelectrolytes</b> is shorter than around charged obstacles...|$|R
40|$|The complexation, phase separation, and redissolution of polyelectrolyte-macroion {{solutions}} {{have been}} studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A simple model system with focus on the electrostatic interactions {{has been used to}} examine the properties of the macroion solutions at different amounts of oppositely charged <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> As oppositely charged <b>polyelectrolytes</b> are added, the stable macroion solution with repelling macroions becomes successively less stable. The strong electrostatic attraction brings macroions and <b>polyelectrolytes</b> closely together, and slightly before macromolecular charge equivalence, distinct and repelling complexes formed by macroions and <b>polyelectrolytes</b> are established. At macromolecular charge equivalence, the system becomes unstable, and a large and loose cluster of macro ons and <b>polyelectrolytes</b> is formed. Finally, in excess of <b>polyelectrolytes,</b> the large cluster is broken up and the macroions are dispersed again-a redissolution has occurred. The effect of the macroion radius, the chain length, and the chain flexibility on the phase separation is also investigated.

Monitoring the spectroscopic changes of covalently labeled poly(acrylic acid) in a surfactant-stabilized film, we followed the effects of confinement down to a film thickness of 15 nm. Already upon film formation at thicknesses of 50 nm, a marked increase of the excimer/monomer ratio was found irrespective {{of the degree of}} charge of the polymer. Hence, the majority of <b>polyelectrolytes</b> is located within regions of locally elevated polymer density. Surface tension measurements showed these regions to be located at the interfaces in case of uncharged <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> In charged <b>polyelectrolytes,</b> stratification of the film is observed and accompanied by an additional rise of the excimer/monomer ratio, suggesting that charged <b>polyelectrolytes</b> reside in a few distinct sites within the film...|$|R

25|$|Polymer {{conformation}} {{of course}} affects many bulk properties (such as viscosity, turbidity, etc.).

40|$|AbstractThis article reviews our {{understanding}} of ionization processes of weak <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> The emphasis is put on a general introduction to site binding models, which are able to account for many experimental features of linear and branched <b>polyelectrolytes,</b> including dendrimers.

50|$|<b>Polyelectrolytes</b> will be {{much more}} soluble in polar {{solvents}} due to the charge on the polymer backbone and will spread out more.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between two colloids with grafted <b>polyelectrolytes</b> {{in aqueous solution}} is studied within the primitive model by Monte Carlo simulations. For neutral colloids with grafted <b>polyelectrolytes</b> and in absence of salt the interaction is strongly repulsive in absence of salt. The interaction depends on {{the extension of the}} <b>polyelectrolytes</b> from the surfaces and the interaction is derived and the interaction can be estimated for different chain length. The {{interaction between}} two charged colloids depends on the amount of surface charge neutralized by <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> The interaction has a minimum when the surface charge is perfectly neutralized by <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> When the energy term dominates in a double layer almost all ions are found {{in the vicinity of the}} charged surfaces forming alternating layers of counterions and coions. Coions have the same charge as the surface and counterions the opposite charge. The energy term becomes dominant at high surface charge density, low dielectric constant, low temperature or by reducing the entropy by a increasing the counterions valency. Another way to reduce the importance of the entropy is replace the counterions by <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> In the latter case the effect increases with the chain length. If the <b>polyelectrolytes</b> are only grafted to one of two equally but oppositely charged surfaces a more long-range attraction occurs than if both surfaces are neutralized by either ions or polymers. The origin of this extra atrraction is the small ions, which are spread over the whole volume and causes a charge imbalance of the system. The MC results are shown to be in qualitatively agreement with results from surface force measurements...|$|R
25|$|At small macroion separations, {{the chain}} is {{squeezed}} {{in between the}} macroions and electrostatic effects in the system are completely dominated by steric effects – the system is effectively discharged. As we increase the macroion separation, we simultaneously stretch the <b>polyelectrolyte</b> chain adsorbed to them. The stretching of the chain {{gives rise to the}} above-mentioned attractive interactions due to chain's rubber elasticity.|$|E
25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of <b>polyelectrolyte</b> flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E
25|$|Polyelectrolytes are {{polymers}} whose repeating units bear an electrolyte group. Polycations and polyanions are polyelectrolytes. These groups dissociate in aqueous solutions (water), {{making the}} polymers charged. <b>Polyelectrolyte</b> properties are thus similar to both electrolytes (salts) and polymers (high molecular weight compounds) and are sometimes called polysalts. Like salts, their solutions are electrically conductive. Like polymers, their solutions are often viscous. Charged molecular chains, commonly present in soft matter systems, play a fundamental {{role in determining}} structure, stability and the interactions of various molecular assemblies. Theoretical approaches to describing their statistical properties differ profoundly from those of their electrically neutral counterparts, while technological and industrial fields exploit their unique properties. Many biological molecules are polyelectrolytes. For instance, polypeptides, glycosaminoglycans, and DNA are polyelectrolytes. Both natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes are used in a variety of industries.|$|E
40|$|Negatively charged single-walled carbon {{nanotube}} (SWCNT), also called SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes</b> and single-walled carbon nanotubides (SWCNTDs), are formed by the reduction (either chemical or electrochemical) of the SWCNT wall by alkali metals (or an electrode) to form negative charged SWCNTs surrounded by an alkali metal counter ions. SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes</b> can spontaneously dissolve {{in a variety of}} polar aprotic solvents without assistance of sonication and will readily react with alkyls and aryls halides to functionalize the walls of SWCNTs. Although SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes</b> present a good alternative for achieving high concentration of SWCNTs in solution, the condensation of the counter ions on the surface of negatively charged SWCNTs partially shield their charge, limiting the solubility of SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> For HiPco SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes,</b> the highest solubility reported before this work was only 0. 4 mg/mL in DMSO. However, we developed a method that greatly improve the solubility of SWCNTs by adding crown ether into the system to coordinate the potassium cation and thus separate the negatively charged SWCNTs from counter ions. This new method produces a high concentration of SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes</b> up to 9. 2 mg/mL in DMSO. In addition, we were able to observe the formation of liquid crystalline phases at highly concentrated solutions, which has been proved to be an essential factor for manufacturing highly ordered robust macroscopic materials. After applying a more efficient dispersion method, speed-mixing, the concentration of SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes</b> can be further improved up to 52 mg/mL. Compared with previous reported results, the increase in solubility is more than 100 times. As mentioned above, we achieved high concentration of SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes</b> by adding crown ether to the mixture and using speed-mixing. The SWCNTs in these solutions spontaneously align forming liquid crystalline solutions that can be manufactured into strong and conductive {{carbon nanotube}}s fibers by spinning the SWCNT dispersions into aqueous coagulation solutions. The best fibers we have obtained by this method have tensile strength up to 124 MPa, which compares to HiPco SWCNT fibers spun from superacid solutions, and conductivity 2 × 104 S/m. Our method provides an acid-free alternative towards high performance carbon nanotube fibers, which can be expanded for the production of other materials such as films. Also, we expanded our methodology to disperse graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) into graphene <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> Graphene <b>polyelectrolytes,</b> when mixed with SWCNT <b>polyelectrolytes</b> were spun onto SWCNT/Graphene hybrid fibers, which maintains a similar tensile strength (as for HiPco SWCNT fibers) while the Young’s modulus increases by 70 % and conductivity increases 2 times...|$|R

25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the <b>polyelectrolyte</b> chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, <b>polyelectrolyte</b> synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E

2500|$|Recently, {{polyelectrolytes}} {{have been}} utilized {{in the formation}} of new types of materials known as <b>polyelectrolyte</b> multilayers (PEMs). These thin films are constructed using a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique. During LbL deposition, a suitable growth substrate (usually charged) is dipped back and forth between dilute baths of positively and negatively charged <b>polyelectrolyte</b> solutions. During each dip a small amount of <b>polyelectrolyte</b> is adsorbed and the surface charge is reversed, allowing the gradual and controlled build-up of electrostatically cross-linked films of polycation-polyanion layers. Scientists have demonstrated thickness control of such films down to the single-nanometer scale. LbL films can also be constructed by substituting charged species such as nanoparticles or clay platelets in place of or in addition to one of the polyelectrolytes. LbL deposition has also been accomplished using hydrogen bonding instead of electrostatics. For more information on multilayer creation please see <b>polyelectrolyte</b> adsorption.|$|E
2500|$|Acids are {{classified}} as either weak or strong (and bases similarly may be either weak or strong). Similarly, polyelectrolytes {{can be divided into}} [...] "weak" [...] and [...] "strong" [...] types. A [...] "strong" [...] <b>polyelectrolyte</b> is one that dissociates completely in solution for most reasonable pH values. A [...] "weak" [...] <b>polyelectrolyte,</b> by contrast, has a dissociation constant (pKa or pKb) in the range of ~2 to ~10, meaning that it will be partially dissociated at intermediate pH. Thus, weak polyelectrolytes are not fully charged in solution, and moreover their fractional charge can be modified by changing the solution pH, counter-ion concentration, or ionic strength.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conformation}} of any polymer {{is affected}} {{by a number of}} factors: notably the polymer architecture and the solvent affinity.

Whereas an uncharged linear polymer chain is usually found in a random conformation in solution (closely approximating a self-avoiding three-dimensional random walk), the charges on a linear <b>polyelectrolyte</b> chain will repel each other [...] via double layer forces, which causes the chain to adopt a more expanded, rigid-rod-like conformation.
