25|$|The first Miriam Vale {{selections}} {{were made}} available in 1889, encouraging new settlers into the area. Saw milling {{was an important}} adjunct industry, as the land was cleared for grazing or agriculture. Miriam Vale was first listed as a separate district in the Queensland <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directory</b> of 1892. It had {{a population of about}} 60, but no real township. The post office was located at Miriam Vale, but closest settlement appears to have been in the Mount Jacob area at that time. In 1893 the Miriam Vale Hotel was established and the Miriam Vale Post and Telegraph Office was made official.|$|E
500|$|The 1915 <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directory</b> for London listed Charles Churchill & Co Ltd trading from 9 – 15 Leonard Street EC (Finsbury) {{in various}} categories: under [...] "Emery Wheel and Machinery Makers" [...] as agents for Norton & Co of Worcester, Massachusetts; under [...] "Engineers' Machine Tool Makers", [...] "Merchants – American", [...] "Merchants – General", [...] "Toolmakers and Dealers" [...] and under [...] "Machinery Merchants". The address was shared with Carson James & Co Ltd, machine toolmakers, and The Churchill Machine Tool Co Ltd was also listed. The 1914 {{edition of the}} {{publication}} states Norton & Co was involved in [...] "alundum and crystolon grinding wheels"; its appointment of Churchill as agents took place in 1910. In 1921, there was a US patent application for a lathe assigned to Churchill directors and in which James Carson living in London was cited as the inventor.|$|E

50|$|Pugh's Almanac and the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directories</b> {{from the}} 1910s {{indicate}} the saturation of lodging houses in Wickham Terrace and Boundary Street alone. Pugh's Almanac {{for the years}} 1916 and 1918 list 18 and 15 boarding houses in Wickham Terrace respectively, while in South Brisbane only seven are recorded for both years. The <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directories</b> for 1915-16 included listings for 195 boarding houses in Brisbane, of which six were listed in Boundary Street. While neither listing is conclusive, they do illustrate the importance of Spring Hill as a location of boarding houses.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directories</b> (1868) record Buckland as {{residing}} at Breakfast Creek (which {{the area}} was known as). Based {{on a combination of}} the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directories</b> and photographic evidence, it is the Bucklands who are believed to have erected what was to become the first stage of Lochiel. A photograph dated 1868 shows the house at this stage believed to have comprised 2 rooms upstairs with kitchen area below fronting what is now known as Hillside Crescent. No architect or builder has to date been identified although in 1864 Brisbane architect WH Chambers erected the Queen Street premises of Fraser and Buckland. During the Buckland's residency the house appears to have been known firstly as Balmoral Cottage and from 1885-6 as Runnymeade.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Brighton-le-Sands Post and Telegraph Office" [...] {{was opened}} in about 1903 (1904 {{edition of the}} Sands <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directory)</b> giving the suburb its {{distinct}} name to distinguish it from Brighton in England. About this time a ferry service opened in Botany Bay. This allowed many more people {{to take advantage of}} the picnic facilities at Brighton.

2500|$|In 1877 Charles Upfold {{was back}} in London and visiting {{factories}} in England. The following year the New South Wales Official <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directory,</b> has listed under the now entirely separate heading of [...] "Wickham", [...] "Charles Upfold, soap manufacturer" [...] (p.621). Interestingly, also in Wickham in the same directory were Charles's three brothers-in-law, Albert, James, and John Blundell, who came from Finchley, Middlesex, (north London), and were clearly all working for Charles as their occupations are given as soap-boilers.|$|E
2500|$|Gibbons {{moved to}} Gower Street (London) in 1876. [...] Gibbon's first wife, Matilda, died on 11 August 1877 in Devon from a wasting disease, marasmus. [...] The <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directory</b> lists the main {{occupier}} of the Gower Street property as ‘Stanley Gibbons & Co publishers’ or ‘Stanley Gibbons & Co postage stamp dealers’. In 1887, Gibbons married his assistant and housemaid, Margaret Casey and in 1890, sold his business to Charles Phillips of Birmingham for £25,000 and retired. (It had first been offered to Theodor Buhl for £20,000.) In 1891, Phillips opened a shop at 435 The Strand, {{as well as}} keeping the office at 8 Gower Street.|$|E
50|$|In 1892, Buckland became {{insolvent}} although {{according to}} the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directories</b> he remains at Runnymeade until the mid 1890s. From 1895-97 the house is listed as vacant, but was apparently occupied {{for a short time}} thereafter by Fred Lawson (of Lawson and Johnson fancy goods dealers) and renamed Langley Grove.|$|R
50|$|Sources {{published}} in the late 20th century claim that this station opened on Sunday 28 February 1909, {{which would have been}} highly unlikely given Scotland's sabbatarian culture at the time.

2500|$|Folklore later {{taught in}} local {{elementary}} schools suggested that Hartford was originally {{a place to}} ford (or cross) Lick Creek. [...] It was known as [...] "Hart’s ford" [...] or [...] "Hart ford", where the [...] "Hart" [...] came either from a farmer named Jacob Hart or the old English word for stag – [...] "hart". [...] This evolved to Hartford. [...] There was already another Hartford in Indiana, so eventually Blackford County’s Hartford was changed to Hartford City to avoid confusion. By 1842, the community of Hartford consisted of seven families in log cabins. [...] The family surnames were Branson, Brough, Graham, Marley, Payton, Shelton, and Turner. [...] The Paytons and Graham were merchants. [...] John Marley was the town’s first blacksmith. [...] Hartford grew to a population of 250 by 1850, and {{was said to have}} about 40 houses. [...] The town had a post office, and a national <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>directory</b> for 1855 lists the town as Hartford City. [...] Hartford City became incorporated as a town in 1857.|$|E

60|$|I {{wished to}} go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the {{theatrical}} advertisements in the shopwindows as I went. I found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directory</b> and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all these intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart; and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip--a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.|$|E
50|$|Burnell and Jones, Merchants, {{appear in}} the Queensland <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Directories</b> for Boulia in 1889.

5000|$|As {{the suburb}} of Brighton-le-Sands grew {{it was given}} its own {{recognition}} and the less developed region south of President Avenue to Rockey Point was called Sandringham. As the various settlements within its boundaries expanded they, too, were given <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> and suburban status.
