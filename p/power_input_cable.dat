40|$|NEPTUNE) is an {{underwater}} power and communications network for scientific experiments. It is {{proposed for the}} ocean floor of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The NEPTUNE power system is a 10 kV dc network. In the science nodes connected to the NEPTUNE network, 10 kV to 400 V dc-dc converters are used to power various scientific instruments and underwater vehicles. The focus {{of this paper is}} the startup circuit design and its implementation.

40|$|Radio-frequency signals {{simulating}} {{electrical interference}} ranging from 50 Hz to 50 MHz {{were applied to}} the shields of the <b>input</b> <b>cable</b> system (two solid- shielded, mineral-insulated cables approximately 6 m long) of a wide-band (approximately 60 MHz) differential preamplifier for use with fission counters as input devices as part of in-vessel, low-level flux monitors in future liquid- metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBRs) to determine the common-mode rejection. Results show that differences in electrical properties and shielding characteristics of the two <b>input</b> coaxial <b>cables</b> along with end effects produced by an unbalanced sensor severely degrade the rejection capability of the differential preamplifier. At 1 MHz, the common-mode rejection without <b>input</b> <b>cables</b> is approximately - 70 dB; this is reduced to approximately - 10 dB when measured with the rf signal applied {{to the surface of}} the <b>input</b> <b>cable</b> shields. Measurements of the shielding characteristics of the <b>input</b> <b>cables</b> showed resonances at test frequencies greater than 2 MHz. A ferrite core was installed in the input assembly to increase the impedance of the shields and to permit termination of the coaxial line consisting of the <b>input</b> <b>cable</b> shields and the protective metal conduit for the <b>input</b> <b>cables.</b> This assembly eliminated all resonances below 20 MHz.

40|$|Birds on {{migration}} {{alternate between}} consuming fuel stores during flights and accumulating fuel stores during stopovers. The optimal timing {{and length of}} flights and stopovers for successful migration depend heavily on the extra metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> (fuel use) required to carry the fuel stores during flight(1, 2). The effect of large fuel loads on metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> has never been empirically determined. We measured the total metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> of a long-distance migrant, the red knot (Calidris canutus), flying for 6 to 10 h in a wind tunnel, using the doubly labelled water technique(3). Here we show that total metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> increased with fuel load, but proportionally less than the predicted mechanical power output from the flight muscles. The most likely {{explanation is that the}} efficiency with which metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> is converted into mechanical output by the flight muscles increases with fuel load.

30|$|The {{viscosity}} {{change in}} bitumen for different sonication frequencies with different <b>power</b> <b>inputs</b> {{is presented in}} Fig.  6. The major viscosity changes were observed to occur at sonication frequencies of 378 and 574  kHz with increasing <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> The highest viscosity change of 38 % was observed at a sonication frequency of 574  kHz with 83.33 % <b>power</b> <b>input,</b> and lowest viscosity changes (5 %) were observed at sonication frequency of 1173  kHz with a <b>power</b> <b>input</b> of 83.33 %. However, {{it was observed that}} the change in viscosity increases in all the five sonication frequency conditions tested with increasing <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> The increase in viscosity change (lower viscosity) with increasing the <b>power</b> <b>input</b> was due to higher disintegration of asphaltene flocs. Higher cavitation yield causes more acoustic cavitation in the medium, which then causes floc disintegration and cell breakage, leading to release of intracellular materials to the aqueous phase. Cavitation yield during different sonication frequencies and <b>power</b> <b>input</b> conditions is a result of a series of energy conversions (electrical energy → mechanical energy → acoustic energy → cavitation energy) that occur in the ultrasonic processor. In case of varying frequencies, such chain of energy conversion strongly depends on the total bubble volume fraction in the medium which further depends on the number of bubbles and their size distribution (Moholkar and Warmoeskerken 2003).|$|R

In the first series of tests the agitator impeller diameter and speed were varied among runs so as to vary impeller tip speed and agitator power independently while keeping other conditions constant. In the second series of tests the mixing tank size and agitator speed were varied while the ratio of tank diameter to impeller diameter were held constant. All tests were conducted with finely ground Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and with i-octane as the agglomerant.
