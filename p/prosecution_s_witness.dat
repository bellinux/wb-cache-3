Conflict arises at {{times with the}} medical staff concerning how best to manage their care. This article will begin with {{a brief description of}} the beliefs of Jehovah 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> and will then recommend specific clinical strategies highlighting newer potential therapies according to the principles of bloodless medicine. The scenarios of bleeding and acute and chronic anemia will be discussed in detail for the care of these patients refusing red blood cell transfusions. An update in the use of blood substitutes will be mentioned as well as the surgical advances used today that can minimize blood loss for all patients. The experience of organ transplantation in Jehovah 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> will be detailed. Further resources for physicians with questions in the care of these patients will be listed. Stressed throughout the article will be the need for a team approach and good communication between physicians to successfully care for their patients who are Jehovah 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses...</b>|$|R

40|$|I {{provide a}} description, analysis, and {{interpretation}} of the social reality constructed by the discourse of Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses.</b> I utilize a qualitative-interpretive approach for my exploration into a social reality. My purpose is {{to determine how the}} textual and contextual reality of Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> influences their lives and courses of action. ^ I identify in Chapter I the focus of the dissertation, discuss the theoretical framework of the social construction of reality, and explicate the method used to illuminate the social reality of Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses.</b> ^ Chapter II has two primary sections. First, I provide a description of the Witnesses 2 ̆ 7 history, including beliefs, standards, terminology. Second, I provide a review of literature concerning social issues involving Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses,</b> the intersection of research on religion and language, research involving religious-communication genres, and research addressing Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> and the Watch Tower Society. ^ I illuminate in Chapter III the reality I interpret as emerging in Witness 2 ̆ 7 discourse. The description section articulates a reeality composed of three world formations [...] Satan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> World, <b>Witness</b> 2 ̆ 7 World, and Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 s World. The analysis section posits Witness 2 ̆ 7 reality is composed of three primary themes including visual, family, and foundation. The interpretation section focuses on what I identify as the processes of splitting and bridging occurring in the discourse. ^ Chapter IV focuses on how this dissertation strengthens our understanding of the subjectivity of social reality within the realm of discursive constructionism. The breadth and diversity of the categories, patterns, and themes in the analysis section of Chapter III illuminate the plurality and the subjectivity [...] the polysemy [...] of discursive constructed realities. I argue an independent and objective reality removes a realm of responsibility from humans for what occurs in their lives. A rhetorical-constructionist perspective forces persons to actively engage in an analysis {{and interpretation of}} reality, and to involve themselves in how reality is perceived and understood. I address implications for both the Watch Tower Society and the communication discipline. ...|$|R

Even nowadays this denomination has a significant progress in number of population. This research is aimed to find the answer of the above problem and to describe about whether Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> as a Christian denomination or religious sect in which its existence are opposed by Christian community in general. Subject {{of this research is}} focused on Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> in Yogyakarta. This Christian denomination becomes an International religious movement and has been assured in the 1945 Constitution as well as gets recognition from the government as a religious organization who has equal rights. In Yogyakarta, this group is also accepted; this is a picture of Yogyakarta as a multicultural city, and a town with high tolerance. In contrast, other Christian 2 ̆ 7 s denominations have rejected this sect because it has different basic theology. The emergence of new denominations is caused by the absence of limitation in this open room. Therefore, it needs a “re-thinking” whether to leave this phenomenon free or to create a rule to control this situation so as to create harmony in managing religious life...|$|R

Here, we review the preoperative planning and overall management of a Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witness</b> patient with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who would not accept blood transfusion. Management of this case is reviewed, along with the relevant literature regarding major surgery in the Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witness</b> population. The use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation was used successfully in locally advanced disease, allowing surgical resection. In addition, we outline a cogent strategy using pre-, intra-, and postoperative techniques to minimize blood loss and maintain hemoglobin at acceptable levels thereby preventing the need for transfusion. These strategies, once in place, may be able to reduce transfusions in all patients having major resections for malignancy...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} how {{developing}} countries can accelerate their economic growth is of crucial importance. The two primary alternative routes to development are inward-oriented growth strategies, which emphasises import-substitution industrialisation (ISI); and outward-oriented policies, which emphasises the economic benefits {{of participation in the}} world economy, that is, export-led growth (ELG). The late 1960 s and 1970 <b>s</b> <b>witnessed</b> a disillusionment with ISI in many developing countries, leading to a reduction in protectionist measures. The 1980 <b>s</b> <b>witnessed</b> further intensification of liberalisation measures as many countries retreated from socialism, regulation and planning. The dis-advantages of ISI, the potential strength of ELG policies and the conditions necessary for successful transition from an inwardoriented regimes to an outward oriented have been extensively researched 1 and beyond the scope of the present study. Moreover many of the rapidly growing newly industrialising countries (NICs) lend support to the idea that export promotion can be an effective development strategy. ...|$|R
