50|$|Mindlin's theory {{assumes that}} there is a linear {{variation}} of displacement across the <b>plate</b> <b>thickness</b> but that the <b>plate</b> <b>thickness</b> does not change during deformation. An additional assumption is that the normal stress through the thickness is ignored; an assumption which is also called the plane stress condition. On the other hand, Reissner's theory assumes that the bending stress is linear while the shear stress is quadratic through thethickness of the plate. This leads to a situation where the displacement through-the-thickness is not necessarily linear and where the <b>plate</b> <b>thickness</b> may change during deformation. Therefore, Reissner's theory does not invoke the plane stress condition.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{high-frequency}} {{mechanical impact}} (HFMI) treatment {{has grown in}} popularity due to its efficiency in improving the fatigue strength of welded joints. The fatigue performance of HFMI-treated welded steel joints has, however, not been thoroughly studied for <b>plate</b> <b>thicknesses</b> above 30 mm.

Axial fatigue strengths were estimated by a modification of the experimental results with fracture mechanics calculations.

50|$|Firstly, a {{projectile}} {{hitting a}} plate {{at an angle}} other than 90° has to move through a greater thickness of armour, compared to hitting the same plate at a right-angle. In the latter case only the <b>plate</b> <b>thickness</b> (the normal {{to the surface of}} the armour) has to be pierced; increasing the armour slope improves, for a given <b>plate</b> <b>thickness,</b> the armour's level of protection at the point of impact by increasing the thickness measured in the horizontal plane, the angle of attack of the projectile. The protection of an area, instead of just a single point, is indicated by the average horizontal thickness, which is identical to the area density (in this case relative to the horizontal): the relative armour mass used to protect that area.|$|E

5000|$|The zero-order antisymmetric mode (designated a0) {{is highly}} {{dispersive}} {{in the low}} frequency regime where it is properly called the [...] "flexural mode" [...] or the [...] "bending mode". For very low frequencies (very thin plates) the phase and group velocities are both proportional to the square root of the frequency; the group velocity is twice the phase velocity. This simple relationship {{is a consequence of}} the stiffness/thickness relationship for thin plates in bending. At higher frequencies where the wavelength is no longer much greater than the <b>plate</b> <b>thickness,</b> these relationships break down. The phase velocity rises less and less quickly and converges towards the Rayleigh wave velocity in the high frequency limit. The group velocity passes through a maximum, a little faster than the shear wave velocity, when the wavelength is approximately equal to the <b>plate</b> <b>thickness.</b> It then converges, from above, to the Rayleigh wave velocity in the high frequency limit. In experiments that allow both extensional and flexural modes to be excited and detected, the extensional mode often appears as a higher-velocity, lower-amplitude precursor to the flexural mode. The flexural mode is the more easily excited of the two, and often carries most of the energy.|$|E

Generally, electrical contacts are Au plated. But contacts formed by applying two-layer plating of Au/Ni on a Cu substrate have the problem that the lower Ni layer and/or the Cu substrate corrode due to the pinholes present in the Au plating. Because the number of pinholes is inversely proportional to <b>plating</b> <b>thickness</b> (1), <b>plating</b> Au with a certain level of thickness will solve corrosion problems.

40|$|During the bending of {{flange plate}} used for dapped girders some highway bridge fabricators are {{experiencing}} cracking of the flange plate particularly when heat {{is used in}} assisting the bending process. Due to the extreme strains experienced during the fabrication process, investigating this problem {{requires the use of}} a finite element analysis. The fabrication process was broken down into two parts, first the heating of the plate through the use of either a furnace or an acetylene torch (thermal), and the second was the bending process (structural). The five different temperatures collected during the thermal analysis were a uniform temperature of 75 oF, a 1100 oF uniform temperature as a result of furnace heating, both five and ten minutes of air-cooling after the plate had reached a uniform temperature of 1100 oF, and the temperature gradient after heating the flange plate to a surface temperature of 1200 oF though the use of an acetylene torch. After the thermal analysis was completed, the resulting temperatures were imported into the structural model. The <b>plate</b> <b>thicknesses</b> analyzed were one, one and a half, and two inches, assuming both 50 and 70 ksi yield strengths. To achieve a 90 degree six-inch radius bend the plate was bent in five separate locations. The result of this analysis showed that with the introduction of temperature gradients into thefabrication process, the strains along the plate??s extreme fibers increased. The model further showed that for both a one and a half and two-inch thick plate the extreme fiber strains exceeded ten percent, which further adds to the increased risk of the flange plate cracking during fabrication. The highest residual stresses through the <b>plate??s</b> <b>thickness</b> occurred during cold bending. The residual stresses through the <b>plate??s</b> <b>thickness</b> decreased when the fabrication process was carried out at elevated temperatures. When steel exceeds a strain of 10 to 16 percent during the fabrication process, the plate becomes susceptible to cracking.
