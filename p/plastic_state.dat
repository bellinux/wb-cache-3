25|$|As a hard, rigid solid {{in the dry}} state, soil {{becomes a}} crumbly (friable) semisolid when a certain {{moisture}} content, termed the shrinkage limit, is reached. If it is an expansive soil, this soil will also begin to swell in volume as this moisture content is exceeded. Increasing the water content beyond the soil's plastic limit will transform it into a malleable, plastic mass, which causes additional swelling. The soil will remain in this <b>plastic</b> <b>state</b> until its liquid limit is exceeded, which causes it to transform into a viscous liquid that flows when jarred.|$|E
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a <b>plastic</b> <b>state</b> bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|E

40|$|As {{a summary}} and {{extension}} of previous work on arching in granular heaps, an anal-ysis is given of statically admissible stress distributions in in nite planar wedges and axisymmetric cones composed of an isotropic linear-elastic material {{subject to a}} non-cohesive Mohr{Coulomb yield criterion. The treatment {{is based on a}} combination of analytical solutions for elastic and simple <b>plastic</b> <b>states,</b> together with numerical integration of the (Sokolovskii{Kotter) ordinary di¬erential equations appropriate to more complex <b>plastic</b> <b>states.</b> For wedges, we obtain a one-parameter family of continuous elastoplastic solutions, with only three isolated symmetric solutions for symmetric wedges, one of which has a central pressure dip or `arch’. For axisymmetric cones subject to a well-known closure for plastic hoop stress, only one continuous elastoplastic state is found, and it exhibits an arch. In addition to the above continuous solutions, a class of discontinuous plastic-limit states is considered, which exhibit a central pressure dip associated with the discontinuous transition from active to passive states proposed by Savage. The only solutions of this type found for symmetric wedges and cones involve central pressure dips. A brief discussion is given of the relation of this work to an extensive recent literature on the central pressure dip observed in certain experiments on granular heaps...|$|R

Then a coating of the same compound was laid over the finished conductor, and thus the core was solidified. Next, the core was surrounded with a coating of the purest gutta-percha--a splendid non-conductor, impervious to water--which, when pressed to it, while in a <b>plastic</b> <b>state,</b> formed the first insulator or tube to the core.

60|$|The jagged {{peaks of}} the valley's wall notched the sky in vivid relief, their sharp teeth biting the blue. We below were blinking. Luckily before very long we had crossed the level and were attacking the wall, and once on it the glare lessened, for we were facing the south, and the slant of the slope took off from the {{directness}} of the sun's rays. The higher we rose, the greater the tilt became. The face of the slope was completely buried in snow except where the aretes stuck through, for the face was well wrinkled. The angle soon grew unpleasant to visage, and certainly looked to have exceeded the limit of stable equilibrium. In mid-ascent, as we were winding cautiously up, a porter slipped. He stopped himself, however, and was helped on to his feet again by his fellow behind. The bad bit was preface to a worse effect round the corner, for on turning the arete, we came upon a snow slope like a gigantic house-roof. It was as steep as you please, and disappeared {{a few hundred feet}} below over the edge into the abyss. Across and up this the guide, after looking about him, struck out, and I followed. The snow was in a <b>plastic</b> <b>state,</b> and at each step I kicked my toes well in, so wedging my footing. The view down was very unnerving. It soon grew so bad I fixed my thought solely on making each step secure, and went slowly, which was much against my inclination. In this manner we tacked gradually upward in zigzags, some forty feet apart, each of us improving the footprints of his predecessor.|$|E

This article presents a similar approach {{for the design of}} reinforced concrete walls and deep beams, with holes or otherwise. The model – which is called stringer-panel model – combines the advantages of the popular strut-and-tie method and the standard finite element method. It has the same geometry as the plastic model proposed by Prof. M. P. Nielsen in the seventies (Kærn 1979). However, the stringer-panel model accurately uses the non-linear behaviour of reinforced concrete. So, it encompasses both the elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>states.</b> The method provides crack width information in the serviceability limit state and allows for redistribution of forces in the ultimate limit state.
