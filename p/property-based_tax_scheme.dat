Unfortunately when tax administrators change the tax laws or auditing procedures to eliminate known fraudulent schemes another potentially more profitable scheme takes it place. Modeling both the <b>tax</b> <b>schemes</b> and auditing policies within a single framework can therefore provide major advantages. In particular we can explore the likely forms of <b>tax</b> <b>schemes</b> in response to changes in audit policies. This can serve as an early warning system to help focus enforcement efforts.

40|$|I analyze whether wage {{policies}} - like minimum {{wages and}} wage subsidies - can add value to an optimal non-linear earnings <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> in a perfectly competitive labour market. Jobs in the labour market differ along two margins: intensity (labour effort) and duration (labour hours). Three key results follow. First, even though minimum wages destroy low performance jobs, they increase employment if {{the minimum wage}} is binding, but not too high. Second, minimum wages - and wage and labour controls more generally - can enhance redistributive efficiency. The underlying mechanism is their potential to deter mimicking and thus to relax the self-selection constraints in the optimal income tax problem. Third, wage and labour controls become superfluous if a wage-contingent earnings <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> - a <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> that depends non-linearly on earnings and wages - can be optimally set.

In this <b>taxing</b> <b>scheme</b> the waste disposal tax is made dependent {{on the amount of}} waste a household produces. Inspecting the pattern of the introduction of this tariff, it seems to be contagious: the probability of introduction is increasing in the number of neighboring municipalities that have already introduced this <b>taxing</b> <b>scheme.</b> A possible rationale is that the tax encourages illegal dumping of waste which in turn might increase the waste of neighboring municipalities (spillover effect). Using panel data it is possible to distinguish between municipal specific effects and the spillover effect. The results indicate the presence of strong spillovers. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{conducting}} economic policy, governments generally face {{conflicts in}} various objectives, e. g. between efficiency and equity. In Norway, one objective of energy politics {{has been to}} reduce electricity consumption, and several tax increases have been proposed. Whether this objective may be in conflict with objectives of efficiency and equity is the focus in this paper. We discuss the effects on household behaviour of three different electricity <b>tax</b> <b>schemes,</b> one proportional and two non-linear. For each household we estimate the reduction in household electricity consumption. As measures of distributional effects and efficiency effects we estimate compensating variation and excess tax burden from the <b>tax</b> <b>schemes.</b> We find that the non-linear <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> targeting high electricity consumption is most preferred {{in order to reduce}} consumption and least preferred concerning the objective of minimizing excess tax burden. When considering distributional effects, the ranking of <b>tax</b> <b>schemes</b> depends on the weight placed on different household groups.

Therefore, as income inequality rises, the rich are increasingly excluded from the design of the income <b>tax</b> <b>scheme.</b> Consequently, the rich bear a larger fraction of the public good, and the tax system becomes more progressive...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of routing traffic for {{independent}} selfish users in a congested network to minimize the total latency. The inefficiency of selfish routing motivates regulating {{the flow of the}} system to lower the total latency of the Nash Equilibrium by economic incentives or penalties. When applying tax to the routes, we follow the definition of [Christodoulou et al, Algorithmica, 2014] to define ePoA as the Nash total cost including tax in the taxed network over the optimal cost in the original network. We propose a simple <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> consisting of step functions imposed on the links. The <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> can be applied to routing games with parallel links, affine cost functions and single-commodity networks to lower the ePoA to at most 4 / 3 - epsilon, where epsilon only depends on the discrepancy between the links. We show that there exists a <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> in the two link case with an ePoA upperbound less than 1. 192 which is almost tight. Moreover, we design another <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> that lowers ePoA down to 1. 281 for routing games with groups of links such that links in the same group are similar to each other and groups are sufficiently different...|$|R

A meta-regression analysis on 18 calibration articles on the subjects of tax reforms provides robust results of the mean tax elasticity from the studies, and also the transformation into long run growth is robust. The average growth potential is summarized to 6. 75 percent, translating into a growth potential of 9. 16 percent in real output for the OECD area based on the 2006 / 2007 level of tax progressivity and tax elasticity.
