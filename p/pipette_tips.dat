Further, based on the developed by Heinrich Schnitger basic principle variants are called multi-channel pipettes for simultaneous dosing over eight or twelve channels and pipettes with electronic adjustment and control of dosage.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{our group}} {{reported}} that an any aqueous droplet dispensed from a <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> has {{considerable amount of}} electrical charge. This natural electrical charge of a droplet could cause undesired, unfamil-iar experimental results. Since {{the origin of the}} charge of a droplet is related to the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> material, we modified the inside material of the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> with poly(dimethylsiloxane) -graphene nanocomposites. The droplets dispensed from the modified <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> has lower elec-trical charge than that from the common <b>pipette</b> <b>tip.</b> We compare the experimental results with the droplets from common <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> and modified <b>pipette</b> <b>tip.</b> This fluid dynamics video includes the principle of the spontaneous electrification of the droplet and the results of the droplet in oil experiments. 1 Detailed explanation Our fluid dynamics video includes 4 segments: 1. The undesired, unfamiliar experimental results with droplet in oil sys-tem. The used droplets were DI water droplet and the fibroblast cell sus-pension. The surrounding medium is silicone oil (50 cs). The charge of a DI water droplet dispensed from the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> spontaneously has positive charge and the cell suspension in our experiment has negative charge. This cause a natural electrical repulsion among the DI water droplets and electrical attraction between cell suspension and the DI 1 a...|$|R

50|$|Any {{material}} {{exiting the}} level 3 or 4 laboratories must be sterilized or decontaminated in some manner. Air is {{drawn into the}} laboratories {{through the use of}} negative air pressure before being filtered out through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. Laboratory waste such as gloves, test tubes, and <b>pipette</b> <b>tips</b> are removed via an autoclave, a piece of equipment that sterilizes materials with steam and pressure. Any liquids leaving the high-containment space go through a biowaste system that operates like a large autoclave to sterilize it. The high-containment labs are built as a box-in-a-box; they do not border exterior walls and there are mechanical spaces above and below them.|$|E
50|$|More {{severe than}} the {{difficulties}} with handling are losses of material while processing the samples. The mass spectrometric protein analysis is often {{performed at the}} limit of detection, so even small losses can decide about {{success or failure of}} the whole analysis. These losses are due to washout during different processing steps, adsorption to the surface of reaction tubes and <b>pipette</b> <b>tips,</b> incomplete extraction of peptides from the gel and/or bad ionisation of single peptides in the mass spectrometer. Depending on the physicochemical properties of the peptides, losses can vary between 15 and 50%. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of the peptides, up to now, a universally valid solution for this major drawback of the method has not been found.|$|E
5000|$|To eject a droplet, a {{transducer}} generates and transfers {{acoustic energy}} {{to a source}} well. When the acoustic energy is focused near {{the surface of the}} liquid, a mound of liquid is formed and a droplet is ejected. 1 The diameter of the droplet scales inversely with the frequency of the acoustic energy—higher frequencies produce smaller droplets. [...] Unlike other liquid transfer devices, no <b>pipette</b> <b>tips,</b> pin tools, or nozzles touch the source liquid or destination surfaces. Liquid transfer methods that rely on droplet formation through an orifice, e.g., disposable tips or capillary nozzles, invariably lose precision as the transfer volume decreases. Touchless acoustic transfer provides a coefficient of variation (CV) that is significantly lower than other techniques and is independent of volume at the levels tested.|$|E

50|$|The plunger is {{depressed}} to both draw up and dispense the liquid. Normal operation {{consists of}} depressing the plunger button {{to the first}} stop while the pipette is held in the air. The tip is then submerged in the liquid to be transported and the plunger is released in a slow and even manner. This draws the liquid up into the tip. The instrument is then moved to the desired dispensing location. The plunger is again depressed to the first stop, {{and then to the}} second stop, or 'blowout', position. This action will fully evacuate the tip and dispense the liquid. In an adjustable pipette, the volume of liquid contained in the tip is variable; it can be changed via a dial or other mechanism, depending on the model. Some pipettes include a small window which displays the currently selected volume. The plastic <b>pipette</b> <b>tips</b> are designed for aqueous solutions, and are not recommended for use with organic solvents that may dissolve the plastics of the tips or even the pipettes.|$|E

As a girl, Tye worked in her mother's laboratory organizing <b>pipette</b> <b>tips.</b> She completed a Bachelor of Science with a major in cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1999 to 2003. After graduating, she backpacked around Australia for a year before returning to the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), to study a PhD in neuroscience. She joined the laboratory of neurobiologist Patricia Janak and her thesis—which showed that neuronal activity was increased in the amygdala of rats learning to associate a stimulus with a reward—was published in Nature and won the Donald B. Lindsley Prize in Behavioral Neuroscience and the Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award. She received her PhD in 2008 and worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the UCSF Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center in 2008-2009 and at Stanford University from 2009 to 2011. At Stanford, she was mentored by Karl Deisseroth in optogenetics, a technique that uses light to activate or inhibit specific neurons.|$|E
50|$|After {{finishing}} the digestion the peptides generated {{in this process}} have to be extracted from the gel matrix. This is accomplished by one or several extraction steps. The gel particles are incubated with an extraction solution and the supernatant is collected. In the first extraction, {{almost all of the}} peptide is recovered, the repetition of the extraction step can increase the yield of the whole process by only 5-10%. To meet the requirements of peptides with different physical and chemical properties an iterative extraction with basic or acidic solutions is performed. For the extraction of acidic peptides a solution similar to the concentration and composition of the digestion buffer is used; basic peptides are extracted in dependence to the intended mass spectrometric method with a low concentrated acidic solution of formic acid for ESI and trifluoroacetic acid for MALDI respectively. Studies on model proteins showed a recovery of approximately 70-80% of the expected peptide yield by extraction from the gel.Many protocols contain an additional fraction of acetonitrile to the extraction solution which, in concentrations above 30% (v/v), is effective in reducing the adsorption of peptides to the surface of reaction tubes and <b>pipette</b> <b>tips.</b> The liquid of the pooled extracts is evaporated in a centrifugal evaporator. If the volatile salt ammonium bicarbonate was used for the basic extraction, it is partially removed in the drying process. The dried peptides can be stored at -20°C for at least six months.|$|E

40|$|Scanning ion {{conductance}} microscopy (SICM) {{is currently}} used for high resolution topographic imaging of living cells. Recently, {{it has been}} also employed {{as a tool to}} deliver stimuli to the cells. In this work we have investigated the mechanical interaction occurring between the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> and the sample during SICM operation. For the purpose, we have built a setup combining SICM with atomic force microscopy (AFM), where the AFM cantilever replaces the sample. Our data indicate that, operating in far-scanning mode with current decrease values below 2 %, no force can be detected, provided that the level of the electrolyte filling the pipette is equal to that determined by the capillary tension. A filling level different from this value determines a hydrostatic pressure, a flux through the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> and detectable forces, even in far-scanning mode. The absolute value of these forces depends on the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> size. Therefore, a possible pitfall when using SICM for cell imaging is to imply zero-force working conditions. However the hydrostatic forces can be exploited in order to deliver weak mechanical stimuli and guide neuronal growth cones. Evidences of the effectiveness of this approach are herein given...|$|R

40|$|Scanning ion-conductance {{microscopy}} (SICM) {{belongs to}} the family of scanning-probe microscopies. The spatial resolution of these techniques is limited {{by the size of the}} probe. In SICM the probe is a pipette, obtained by heating and pulling a glass capillary tubing. The size of the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> is therefore an important parameter in SICM experiments. However, the characterization of the tip is not a consolidated routine in SICM experimental practice. In addition, potential and limitations of the different methods available for this characterization may not be known to all users.

The overview includes imaging techniques, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force microscopy, and indirect methods, which measure some physical parameter related to the size of the pipette. Examples of these parameters are the electrical resistance of the pipette filled with a saline solution and the surface tension at the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip.</b> We discuss advantages and drawbacks of the methods, which may be helpful in answering a wide range of experimental questions...|$|R
