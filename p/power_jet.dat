25|$|In early 1940, Rover was {{approached}} by Frank Whittle to do work for Whittle's company, <b>Power</b> <b>Jets.</b> This led to a proposal from <b>Power</b> <b>Jets</b> in which Rover would put forward £50,000 of capital in exchange for shares in <b>Power</b> <b>Jets.</b> Rover contacted the Air Ministry (AM) regarding the proposal, which ultimately led to an arrangement between Rover and former <b>Power</b> <b>Jets</b> contractor British Thomson-Houston (BTH) to develop and produce Whittle's jet engine. The Air Ministry had left Whittle and <b>Power</b> <b>Jets</b> out of these negotiations. Rover chief engineer Maurice Wilks led the team to develop the engine, improving the performance over the original Whittle design. The first test engines to the W.2B design were built in a former cotton mill in Barnoldswick, Lancashire which Rover moved into in June 1941 (along with Waterloo Mill in Clitheroe).

To achieve fast speeds, gills need to be small - water will be passed through them quickly when energy is needed, compensating for their small size. However, organisms which spend most of their time moving slowly along the bottom do not naturally pass much water through their cavity for locomotion; thus they have larger gills, along with complex systems to ensure that water is constantly washing through their gills, even when the organism is stationary. [...] The water flow is controlled by contractions of the radial and circular mantle cavity muscles.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Sukhoi and {{his team}} {{was among the first}} Soviet {{aircraft}} designers who led the work on jet aircraft, creating several experimental jet fighters. Sukhoi started developing two jet fighters, the Sukhoi Su-5 and the Sukhoi Su-7 before 1945. The Su-5 is a mixed <b>power</b> <b>jet</b> fighter, using both a propellor and a motorjet to power it, but the experiment was later cancelled even though the fighter had a maiden flight in April 6, 1945. The Su-7 is a swept-wing, supersonic, air superiority fighter, and it was successful as it was adopted by the Soviet Air Forces in 1959, which was over 14 years later. At the start of 1945, the design bureau started working on jet fighters such as the Sukhoi Su-9, Sukhoi Su-11, Sukhoi Su-15, and the Sukhoi Su-17, the Sukhoi Su-10 jet bomber, and the reconnaissance and artillery spotter twinjet, the Sukhoi Su-12. Sukhoi {{and his team}} also used the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber to develop and produce the trainer bomber UTB-2, worked on passenger and troop-carrying aircraft, the jet fighter Sukhoi Su-14, {{and a number of other}} aircraft. From 1945 to 1950, Sukhoi and his team also developed the Soviet Union's first booster aircraft control system, landing braking parachute, catapult ejection seat with telescopic trolley, and a jettisonable nose with a pressurized cockpit. From 1949, Sukhoi fell out of Stalin's favor and in a government resolution, the Sukhoi Design Bureau was scrapped, and Sukhoi was forced to return to work under Andrei Tupolev, this time as Deputy Chief Designer. In 1953, the year of Stalin's death, he was permitted to re-establish his own Sukhoi Design Bureau, set up with new production facilities.|$|E

A stability parameter was defined as the ratio of the <b>power</b> <b>jet</b> pressor to the change in control pressure required for switching to occur. When this ratio is a minimum, maximum stability has been attained. Data was obtained for wall angles from zero to fifty degrees; wall offsets from one-half to none inches; and <b>power</b> <b>jet</b> pressures in the range from 0. 7 to 4. 0 inches of mercury. Comparisons were made between the stability parameter, the wall angle, and the wall offset to find the most stable configuration of the wall. This configuration was a wall angle of thirty degrees and a wall offset of one inch. The stability parameter remained approximately constant for different <b>power</b> <b>jet</b> pressures at each geometric configuration...|$|E
