50|$|Dimethyldithiocarbamate is a {{chemical}} compound {{classified as a}} dithiocarbamate. It is a component of various pesticides {{in the form of}} its salts (zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, ferric dimethyldithiocarbamate, sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate, and <b>potassium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate)</b> or in its oxidized form, thiram.|$|E
40|$|Optimum {{condition}} in {{the synthesis of}} MTBO was found by the examination and improvement of thiono-thiol isomerization of salithion. For the isomerization of salithion were used acetone as the solvent, sodium iodide as the catalyst, potassium carbonate as the acceptor of iodide ion, and methyl iodide as the methylating agent. MTBO was crystallized from ether to give pure crystals which are stable on storage for a long time. Salithion was readily demethylated by <b>potassium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate</b> to give potassium saligenin cyclic phosphorothioate (KSCP). KSCP was S-methylated by methyl iodide to give MTBO in high yield...|$|E
