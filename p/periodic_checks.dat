50|$|The Moulin Rouge {{had opened}} two years earlier, in 1889, and {{instantly}} established {{itself as a}} Montmartre landmark. It was renowned for the elasticity of its young dancers, both physically and morally; police officers made <b>periodic</b> <b>checks</b> {{to ensure that they}} were all wearing underwear. However, the poster by Jules Ch√©ret advertising the club's delights, was relatively subdued, so the director Charles Zidler hired the young (only 27 years old) Toulouse-Lautrec to create a more vibrant poster.|$|E
50|$|The college abides by the set {{of norms}} {{specified}} by Calcutta University for colleges under its jurisdiction, according to which, students, who attend 75% of classes per year, are declared eligible to sit for university examinations.

50|$|The {{number of}} tenting {{games in a}} single season is {{determined}} by the Line Monitor Committee of the Duke Student Government. The UNC game is always a tenting game but potentially there may be a second game where tent order determines seating. Months before the actual game, students begin to put up and live in tents outside Cameron Indoor Stadium. As many as twelve people can occupy a specific tent group (a tent group may contain up to two physical tents). As regulated by Duke Student Government, there must be a certain number of students in the tent at regular, <b>periodic</b> <b>checks.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} stage {{starts with}} the signing of a chemical leasing agreement that defines the scope and conditions, unit of payment, KPIs, roles, and responsibilities. The chemical company supervises the chemical process, transporting and managing the inventory, laboratory management, improving process controls, record keeping, and training workers. <b>Periodic</b> <b>checks</b> and inspections are carried out independently to verify that the implementation is proceeding on expected lines. At {{the end of the}} implementation phase, progress is evaluated, often by an external party to secure objectivity. Finally, any project benefits are quantified and learning is documented, to provide input for future projects.|$|E

25|$|Vitreous-lined {{tanks are}} much lower in initial cost, and often include {{one or more}} {{sacrificial}} anode rods {{designed to protect the}} tank from perforation caused by corrosion made necessary since chlorinated water is very corrosive to carbon steel. As it is very nearly impossible to apply any protective coating perfectly (without microscopic cracks or pinhole defects in the protective layer) manufacturers may recommend a <b>periodic</b> <b>check</b> of any sacrificial anode, replacing it when necessary.|$|R
30|$|The MBSC-SS {{is the key}} {{functional}} entity that orchestrates all the components used to enable, create, and manage the MBS IPTV streaming service. In order {{to fulfill the requirements}} illustrated in Section 2.3, the Mobicents JSLEE (MSLEE) has been selected to implement the central signaling server. It handles all the incoming SIP signaling messages from the MBS clients and the ASN-GW. In addition, it performs user authentication, service subscription, session join/leave, <b>periodic</b> <b>check</b> of active users, and their authorizations.|$|R
40|$|Investigation {{showed that}} the wear of the pistons was {{responsible}} for the failure of the hydraulic pump in question. Ingression of hard abrasive particles through contaminated fuel led to wear of the pistons. The particles were found rich in Si, Al and O. The damages to the other components of the pump were caused subsequent to this primary failure and are secondary in nature. <b>Periodic</b> <b>check</b> of fuel samples is suggested to avoid recurrence of similar failures...|$|R
5000|$|In 1916 Clyde Engineering were award a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} 300 K class locomotives. Following experiments with Southern type valve gear on an earlier class, Chief Mechanical Engineer Edward Lucy proposed its installation on these locomotives. The use of Southern valve gear was rare on locomotives operating outside the United States of America. Southern Valve Gear required specific routine maintenance checks to ensure perfection of valve events. Failure to observe these <b>periodic</b> <b>checks</b> and corrections, if necessary, would result in less than exact valve events. This was not a great forfeit in itself, as the 460 members of the closely related other two sub-divisions of the Standard Goods engines normally had markedly indifferent valve events.|$|E
50|$|The NIDM works under government's {{directives}} {{to train}} and conduct <b>periodic</b> <b>checks</b> to regulate effective earthquake and disaster control policies throughout the country with support from semi-government,private firms and NGOs. It also conducts mock drill, crises communication and a hazard hunt exercise among their staffers {{every two to three}} months. Recently, Delhi witnessed one of biggest mega mock drills conducted in India, simulating an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 on Richter Scale. The main purpose was to check the alertness and preparedness of various agencies,commuters {{in the event of a}} disaster of such magnitude. National Disaster Management Authority and Delhi Disaster Management Authority jointly conducted the drills at several places across the national capital including the six Metro Stations at 11.30 a.m.|$|E
50|$|The system {{makes use}} of several {{distinct}} pulse train patterns of alternating current flowing through a track circuit to convey {{an aspect of the}} next signal. The circuit comprises the feedpoint at the next signal, one running rail, first locomotive axle, another running rail and back to the signal feedpoint. The resulting electromagnetic field is picked up by receiver coils located just front of the first axle of the locomotive. The signal is then amplified, filtered and evaluated.If the received signal changes from a more permissive to a less permissive aspect (like when passing a yellow light, indicating the next signal is red, which, in turn, requires stopping in front of it), an immediate vigilance control acknowledge is required; depending on configuration and aspects, <b>periodic</b> <b>checks</b> and a speed limit may be enforced as well.|$|E
50|$|In many applications, such as {{hardness}} testing, {{the mechanism}} {{does not have}} an adjustment for impulse strength, and may require <b>periodic</b> calibration <b>checks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Several {{characteristics}} are defined to describe parking. The mathematical relationships between these {{characteristics are}} derived both {{in a general}} form and applied to specified parking duration distribution. The results of the analysis can be applied in planning and dimensioning of parking places. Methods of revising and generalizing field survey data collected by <b>periodic</b> <b>check</b> methods are discussed.
