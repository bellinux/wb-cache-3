5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term <b>population</b> <b>biology</b> is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although <b>population</b> <b>biology</b> is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E

25|$|Though {{restoration}} ecologists {{and other}} conservation biologists generally agree that habitat {{is the most}} important locus of biodiversity protection, the disciplines themselves have different focuses. Conservation biology as an academic discipline is rooted in <b>population</b> <b>biology.</b> Because of that, it is generally organized at the genetic level, looking at specific species populations (i.e. endangered species). Restoration ecology is organized at the community level, looking at specific ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|The {{new tools}} of molecular-biology changed {{the study of}} bird systematics. Systematics changed from being based on {{phenotype}} to the underlying genotype. The use of techniques such as DNA-DNA hybridization to study evolutionary relationships was pioneered by Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist resulting in {{what is called the}} Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. These early techniques have been replaced by newer ones based on mitochondrial DNA sequences and molecular phylogenetics approaches that make use of computational procedures for sequence alignment, construction of phylogenetic trees and calibration of molecular clocks to infer evolutionary relationships. Molecular techniques are also widely used in studies of avian <b>population</b> <b>biology</b> and ecology.|$|E
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are firmly rooted in the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While {{it can be argued that}} White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in <b>population</b> <b>biology</b> and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|One of Boas's most {{important}} books, The Mind of Primitive Man (1911), integrated his theories concerning {{the history and}} development of cultures and established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study he established that in any given <b>population,</b> <b>biology,</b> language, material and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another. In other words, he established that culture {{does not depend on}} any independent variables. He emphasized that the biological, linguistic, and cultural traits of any group of people are the product of historical developments involving both cultural and non-cultural forces. He established that cultural plurality is a fundamental feature of humankind, and that the specific cultural environment structures much individual behavior.|$|E

He observed that its scope was far wider than the social insects of Wilson's previous book The Insect Societies, dealing with [...] "social phenomena from the slime molds to man".

He noted Wilson's statement that altruism is the central problem of sociobiology, and remarks that Wilson's account in fact indicates the solution, kin selection.

500|$|Concerning {{the anniversary}} edition, Yudell and Desalle thought it strange that nothing worth adding had {{happened}} in 25 years: the book remained a primary text, and Wilson's failure to develop it weakened the edition's impact. The early chapters still seemed a [...] "lucid and engaging" [...] introduction to <b>population</b> <b>biology,</b> {{but much of the}} rest seemed after 25 years to lack [...] "methodological breadth", given that it did not cover the new fields that had emerged; while barely mentioning the growing importance of phylogenetic systematics seemed [...] "curious". They pointed out that comparing human and [...] "animal" [...] social evolution [...] "is tantamount to making homology" [...] claims, but Wilson had said nothing about the need for a methodology to test behavioural homology. The reviewers were also troubled by Wilson's attitude to the debate, remaining [...] "contemptuous of his anti-sociobiological opposition" [...] and [...] "opprobrium towards Marxism" [...] (especially Gould and Lewontin). Yudell and Desalle noted the irony that Wilson despised Marxism but advocated an [...] "aggressive paradigm ... seeking to blaze an historical path towards the future" [...] (as Marxism did). They argued that by demonising his opponents in this way, Wilson created support for Sociobiology [...] "not necessarily sustainable by his data and methodologies." [...] He was still doing that 25 years on, stated the reviewers.|$|E

40|$|Digitonthophagus gazella (F.) {{has been}} widely {{introduced}} to the New World and both natural dispersal and intentional releases continue. In this study, we compare a population of D. gazella from South Africa and from the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Genetic diversity {{was found to be}} high in both South Africa (H = 0. 3623) and Vieques (H = 0. 3846), providing no evidence of inbreeding depression on Vieques. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 69 % of genetic diversity is within the populations and 31 % of genetic diversity is between the populations, indicating that if interbreeding occurs between these populations, it is rare and likely human-mediated. The Fst value of 0. 3143 also suggests that there is genetic isolation between populations in Africa and newly established populations in the New World. Because of its competitiveness and natural dispersal ability, additional comparisons of D. gazella <b>populations,</b> <b>biology,</b> and genetics are warranted...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{failure to}} {{replicate}} the experiment and criticism of Kettlewell's methods by Theodore David Sargent in the late 1960s led to general skepticism. When Judith Hooper's Of Moths and Men was published in 2002, Kettlewell's story was more sternly attacked, accused of fraud, and became widely disregarded. The criticism became a major argument for creationists. Michael Majerus was the principal defender.
