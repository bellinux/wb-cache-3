25|$|A {{team can}} score {{a field goal}} by {{shooting}} the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team during regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points if shot from {{in front of the}} line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points {{at the end of the}} game wins, but additional time (overtime) is mandated when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by passing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to lift, or drag, one's <b>pivot</b> <b>foot</b> without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a <b>pivot</b> <b>foot.</b> When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a <b>pivot</b> <b>foot</b> now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of <b>pivot</b> <b>foot.</b> He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

30|$|There was no {{significant}} difference in the occurrence of MT- 5 fracture between the kicking <b>foot</b> and <b>pivoting</b> <b>foot.</b> Elite players use not only the dominant foot but also the non-dominant foot for kicking; therefore, the proportions of right foot use and left foot use for kicking will need to be investigated.|$|R

60|$|He {{opened his}} arms, and they {{mutually}} embraced. Then they separated, taking hold of each other's hands solemnly, and falling back {{until they were}} at arm's length. Then they slowly extended their arms sideways at full length, until this action naturally brought their faces and lips together. They did this with the utmost gravity three times, and then embraced again, rocking on <b>pivoted</b> <b>feet</b> like a metronome. Alas! it was no momentary inspiration. The most casual and indifferent observer {{could see that it}} was the result of long previous practice and shameless experience. And as such--it was a revelation and an explanation.|$|R
5000|$|If {{both feet}} {{are off the}} floor and the player lands on one foot, then that foot becomes the <b>pivot</b> <b>foot.</b> If a player jumps off that foot and comes to a stop landing on both feet simultaneously, then neither foot is a <b>pivot</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{large-scale}} combined legged and {{wheeled vehicle}} with anthropomorphic legs is presented. This concept combines {{the advantages of}} a walking machine with the stability of a wheeled vehicle. The leg utilises a spherical hip joint, a revolute knee joint and a passively <b>pivoting</b> <b>foot.</b> Due {{to the size of}} the system linear hydraulic actuators are used, and thus kinematic loops are created in the mechanism. This paper describes the closed-form recursive solution of the direct and the inverse kinematics, the statics for one leg and some results from computer simulations. 1 Introduction For the manipulation of heavy loads in unstructured environments combined legged and wheeled vehicles, often realized as walking excavators, can be used. These machines consist of a platform with two front legs and two swivelling wheels at the back. They combine the advantages of a walking machine [...] mobility in unknown terrain [...] with the higher stability of wheeled vehicles. Here the forward movement is provi [...] ...|$|R

50|$|For the pugilist, {{footwork}} {{is to be}} deft and simplistic, {{allowing the}} fighter to {{move in and out}} of striking range as quickly as possible. Footwork is key to generating sufficient power in the basic strikes shared between the major boxing styles. During the jab, the lead foot can move forward to close distance or remain stationary. During the cross, the rear <b>foot</b> <b>pivots</b> inward to launch the rear shoulder forward, allowing the cross a good deal of its strength. During the left hook, the lead <b>foot</b> <b>pivots</b> in an inward manner to transfer body weight. The right hook's pivot is identical to the cross (assuming the boxer is orthodox). The lead uppercut, like the jab does not use any pivotal motion, the power comes from the transfer of body weight to the lead foot. The rear uppercut employs the same inward pivot as the cross. To maintain balance, both <b>feet</b> can step, <b>pivot</b> or slide as appropriate. The jab may be thrown while moving forward or backward; for the other punches it is advisable not to throw while in motion.|$|R

5000|$|Ancient sailing ships did {{not require}} sheers to erect their masts, {{as they could be}} lifted into place by ropes and allowed to <b>pivot</b> around their <b>feet.</b> As ships became larger, their larger and heavier masts were no longer able to be handled in this way. A crane was needed, tall enough to lift the entire mast {{vertically}} and then lower it into the ship. By the 18th century, such sheers were a necessity in any large shipyard.|$|R
50|$|When {{throwing}} a hook, the puncher shifts his body {{weight to the}} lead foot, allowing him to <b>pivot</b> his lead <b>foot</b> and generate kinetic energy through the hip/torso/shoulder, swinging his lead fist horizontally toward the opponent. Sometimes, depending on style and what feels comfortable to the individual, the lead <b>foot</b> is not <b>pivoted.</b> Pivoting increases {{the power of the}} punch, but leaves one lacking in options to follow up with, such as the right uppercut or right hook.|$|R
50|$|For Kato Hiroshi Sensei, Aikido {{is a way}} of {{life not}} just a martial art (Budo). Sensei Kato's Aikido is a style that resembles much of the one taught at Hombu Dojo by Shihans such as Watanabe Nobuyuki and Endo Seichiro (although not as intense as these two) in a sense that he {{practices}} the no-touch throws, using the momentum of the uke but without much touching him. Strong Hip movements are applied together with slight <b>feet</b> <b>pivoting</b> movements as well.|$|R

5000|$|The Turn is {{a walking}} step, <b>pivoting</b> on one <b>foot</b> to change direction. The right foot {{comes from the}} {{preceding}} step {{to the place of}} starting; while it makes two successive long steps the left foot turns “on its place”. The turn′s completion brings the right foot into anterior fourth position. The woman′s steps are the converse of the man′s, her left foot making the long steps, while her right foot turns on its place. The turn gains smoothness by means of allowing the right knees to touch each other lightly.|$|R

50|$|In dance, a pivot turn (or simply pivot) is {{a general}} {{classification}} for dance turns in which the performer's body rotates about its vertical axis without traveling. The performer may be supported by one or both feet, which swivel in place during the pivot turn. In some dance genres, a <b>pivot</b> on both <b>feet</b> is called a twist turn. Pivot turns are commonly named as such in ballroom dancing, folk dancing and ethnic dances. In many other dance genres, pivot turns are known by specific names and typically are not referred to as pivots. For example, in ballet, a pirouette {{is a type of}} pivot turn on one foot.|$|R
