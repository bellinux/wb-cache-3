In the United States, the voluntary phasing-out of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on 31 December 2003, and alternative chemicals are now used, such as Alkaline Copper Quaternary, borates, copper azole, cyproconazole, and <b>propiconazole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Propiconazole</b> is used agriculturally as a {{systemic}} fungicide on turfgrasses grown for seed and aesthetic or athletic value, wheat, mushrooms, corn, wild rice, peanuts, almonds, sorghum, oats, pecans, apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, prunes and lemons. It {{is also used}} in combination with permethrin in formulations of wood preserver. [...] <b>Propiconazole</b> {{is a mixture of}} four stereoisomers and was first developed in 1979 by Janssen Pharmaceutica. <b>Propiconazole</b> exhibits strong anti-feeding properties against the keratin-digesting Australian carpet beetle Anthrenocerus australis.|$|E
50|$|As the {{frequency}} of resistant isolates to TBZ increase, some other fungicides have been tested to control silver scurf, such as imazalil, prochloraz and <b>propiconazole</b> fungicides, which are all classified in conazole, DMI (demethylation inhibitors). Imazalil and prochloraz fungicides are commonly used in seed treatment, while <b>propiconazole</b> fungicide is usually for foliar treatment.|$|E

50|$|The 1992 Ecuadorian TS {{epidemic}} occurred concurrently with {{an outbreak}} of black leaf wilt disease in banana plantations.The outbreak of black leaf disease led {{to an increase in}} fungicide usage within the Taura River basin district near the city of Guayaquil. The fungicides <b>propiconazole</b> (Tilt, Ciba-Geigy) and tridemorph (Calixin, BASF) used to control black leaf, ran off into nearby ponds and were initially thought to be responsible for the disease. Analytical data demonstrated <b>propiconazole</b> in water, sediments and hepatopancreas tissues of shrimp harvested from affected farms in Ecuador. No other pesticides were discovered.|$|E
50|$|Alamo (<b>propiconazole)</b> {{has become}} {{available}} more recently, though several university studies {{show it to}} be effective for only the current season it is injected. Alamo is primarily recommended for treatment of oak wilt.|$|E
50|$|Hydrazine is a {{precursor}} to several pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Often these applications involve conversion of hydrazine to heterocyclic rings such as pyrazoles and pyridazines. Examples of commercialized bioactive hydrazine derivatives include cefazolin, rizatriptan, anastrozole, fluconazole, metazachlor, metamitron, metribuzin, paclobutrazol, diclobutrazole, <b>propiconazole,</b> and triadimefon.|$|E

However, questions remain about the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this treatment in commercial groves ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Propiconazole</b> is a {{triazole}} fungicide, {{also known}} as a DMI, or demethylation inhibiting fungicide due to its binding with and inhibiting the 14-alpha demethylase enzyme from demethylating a precursor to ergosterol. Without this demethylation step, the ergosterols are not incorporated into the growing fungal cell membranes, and cellular growth is stopped.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of {{chemical}} groups that are labeled for control of Microdochium Patch. They include, {{but are not limited to}} the methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs) such as thiophanate methyl, the dicarboximides such as iprodione and vinclozolin, the DMIs such as fenarimol and <b>propiconazole,</b> the QoIs such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin, the phenylpyrroles such as fludioxonil, certain aromatic hydrocarbons such as PCNB, and the cholronitriles such as chlorothalonil.

50|$|Chemical {{control is}} {{possible}} with fungicides such as triadimefon and <b>propiconazole.</b> Another chemical treatment involves treating wheat with a silicon solution or calcium silicate slag. Silicon helps the plant cells defend against fungal attack by degrading haustoria and by producing callose and papilla. With silicon treatment, epidermal cells are {{less susceptible to}} powdery mildew of wheat.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} formulations exist with imazalil, difenoconazole, prochloraz, <b>propiconazole,</b> chlorothalonil, cyprodinil, fludioxonil, azoxystrobin, and copper. In {{wood preservatives}} it {{is mixed with}} didecyldimethylammonium chloride.It is the active ingredient in two foliar fungicides for soybeans in the U.S., Alto X, and mixed with azoxystrobin in Quadris Xtra, both by Syngenta.It is also manufactured by Bayer CropScience and Dow AgroSciences.|$|E
50|$|Discarded wooden pallets {{should not}} be used for {{firewood}} or crafts unless it has been determined that the wood in these pallets has not been treated with wood preservatives, fungicides and/or pesticides. Various pyrethrins and <b>propiconazole</b> are common treatments for wooden pallets. In addition, imported palletized goods are routinely fumigated with highly toxic pesticides. During use, harmful materials or chemicals also may spill on the pallet wood and be absorbed.|$|E
50|$|Pecan scab is {{the deadliest}} {{disease of the}} pecan. In the right conditions—high {{humidity}} and dampness—up to 100% crop reduction can occur if left uncontrolled. As a result, fungicides are used on 85-90% of all pecan acreage in southeastern states annually. Fenbuconazole, <b>propiconazole,</b> and TPTH are the primary fungicides used in the southeast for scab control. In the southwest however fungicides are rarely used because the dry growing conditions are not conducive to growth of pecan scab.|$|E
5000|$|In recent {{surveillance}} by the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries, 6 out of 24 {{olive oil}} samples contained residues of azoxystrobin or the fungicide <b>propiconazole</b> {{in excess of}} the maximum residue limit (MRL) set for agricultural chemicals. [...] "When the processing factor is taken into account, these results indicate that the raw olives would have likely breached the MRLs for those compounds." [...] In the Ministry's judgement, this violation did not pose health or food safety concerns.|$|E
50|$|False smut {{damages the}} rice plant by infecting the ovaries of the rice kernel {{in its early}} development. Once inside the disease takes over the ovary and replaces it with spores that burst, {{producing}} a large orange ball between the glumes. These galls not only are covered in spores that spread the disease but when harvested result in rice that must be cleaned {{before it can be}} sold. Use of <b>propiconazole</b> can reduce false smut by as much as 75%.|$|E
50|$|Copper azole {{is similar}} to ACQ with the {{difference}} being that the dissolved copper preservative is augmented by an azole co-biocide like organic triazoles such as tebuconazole or <b>propiconazole,</b> which are also used to protect food crops, instead of the quat biocide used in ACQ. The azole co-biocide yields a copper azole product that is effective at lower retentions than required for equivalent ACQ performance. The general appearance of wood treated with copper azole preservative {{is similar to}} CCA with a green colouration.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{control is}} an option for {{practitioners}} who need to maintain high quality, visually pleasing turfgrass. There are many fungicides labeled for control of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, including benzimidazoles, carboxamides, nitriles, dicarboxamides, and demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). Some common fungicides used include chlorothalonil (nitrile), <b>propiconazole</b> (DMI), boscalid (carboxamide), thiophanate-methyl (benzamidazole), and iprodione (dicarboxamide). Preventative fungicide programs should be implemented when conditions are favorable for disease development (i.e., in the Spring when nighttime temperatures reach 50 F). While preventative applications are most effective, curative applications are also successful, but often require high rates and short application intervals.|$|E
50|$|When left untreated, BOB {{will often}} kill the {{infected}} tree. Management is thus an important implication when discussing this disease. Due {{to the fact}} that BOB overwinters on leaf petioles that stay on the tree, removing fallen infected leaves will do little in terms of disease control. One proven method of attacking the pathogen is the introduction of a fungicide. Macro injections of the fungicide Alamo™ (<b>Propiconazole</b> (K)) {{have been shown to be}} effective on a two-year rotation. Dosage should be carefully monitored, as there are some phytotoxic effects.|$|E
50|$|When {{spraying}} fungicides Quilt and Headline EC at 6 oz/a at tassel stage using a tractor-mounted CO2 powered sprayer using 20 {{gallons of}} water/acre, average yield {{was seen to}} increase. The use of fungicides can be both economically and environmentally costly and should only be applied on susceptible varieties and large-scale corn production. In order to prevent fungal resistance to fungicides, all fungicides are to be used alternatively, switching fungicides with different modes of action. Pyraclostrobin (Headline EC) and azoxystrobin are Quinone outside Inhibitor (QoI) fungicides, whereas <b>propiconazole</b> and prothioconazole are DeMethylation Inhibitors (DMI) fungicides.|$|E
50|$|Necrotic ring spot can {{be managed}} through {{chemical}} and cultural controls. Cultural control includes the use of ammonium sulfate or other acidifying fertilizers to suppress the pathogen by lowering the pH of the soil to between 6.0 and 6.2. The more acidic soil discourages the activity of O. korrae (9) When reducing pH to these levels, additional manganese applications should be undertaken to compensate for lower pH. As of now, {{there are only two}} resistant cultivars of bluegrass, which are ‘Riviera’, and ‘Patriot’ (9). One component of their resistance could be that they are tolerant to low temperature, because the grass is more susceptible to the pathogen under colder temperatures(8). In addition, reducing watering inputs and growing turf on well drained soils can lessen disease symptoms. Many different fungicides are used to control the pathogen, Fenarimol, <b>Propiconazole,</b> Myclobutanil, and Azoxystrobin (8). Historically, Fenarimol and Myclobutanil were predominantly used (14). In a study where diluted pesticides were sprayed throughout infested test plots, Fenarimol was found to be the most effective with a 94.6% reduction of the disease. Myclobutanil also decreased the amount of disease, but only by 37.7% (8). Myclobutanil is generally recognized as a very weakly acting demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and fenarimol is no longer registered for turf so a number of other DMI fungicides have been employed successfully, including <b>Propiconazole,</b> Tebuconazole, Metconazole and others. Pyraclostrobin and Fluoxastrobin have also been used to control the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|These {{chemical}} classes {{should be}} rotated so that selection {{pressure on the}} disease in limited as to avoid resistant strains of this disease. The applicator should read and follow all label rates and directions. Breaking these directions and misuse of any labeled product is breaking the law. Remember that the label is the law. The best way to control Microdochium Patch especially going into winter {{is to use a}} three way spray right before the first snow fall. A combination of a dicarboximides such as iprodione, a chloronitrile such as chlorothalonil, and a DMI such as <b>propiconazole</b> will give sufficient control over the span of an average winter.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicide {{applications}} {{are not always}} suitable for large stands of juniper trees. When practical, however, foliar chemical applications can significantly {{reduce the amount of}} disease on juniper plants. A variety of broad-spectrum fungicides may be used to control Phomopsis blight on juniper. Typically fungicides marketed to combat leaf, tip, and flower blight on ornamentals will effectively manage disease development by inhibiting fungal growth and development. Fungicides with active ingredients such as <b>propiconazole</b> or mancozeb, a combination of zinc, manganese, and ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, should help prevent disease development. [...] Information about appropriate fungicides specific to a particular area can be found at a local extension office.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{multiple}} fungicides {{have been}} seen to reduce Banana Freckle disease. In Hawaii, spraying the leaves and fruit with maneb (1 lb./100 gal water plus 4 oz of sticker-spreader) every 2 weeks or once a month throughout the year has remarkably reduced the spread of inoculum. In Taiwan, spraying fungicides, such as phaltan, orthocide, chlorothalonil, dithiocarbamates, and <b>propiconazole,</b> biweekly have produced effective results against the disease. In the Philippines, chemical controls used against Black or Yellow Sigatoka disease have been helpful. These consist of mancozeb, triazoles, tridemorph, and strobilurin. Mancozeb {{seems to be the}} most effective fungicide against Banana Freckle disease in Hawaii and the Philippines [...] These fungicides do not eliminate the pathogen completely, but they reduce the inoculum levels and eventually reduce yield loss.|$|E
50|$|Although {{pesticide}} use should be minimized, fungicides have proven useful and economical {{in the control}} of tan spot (Loughman et al., 1998) and spot blotch (Viedma and Kohli, 1998). The triazole group (e.g. tebuconazole and <b>propiconazole)</b> especially {{has proven to be}} very effective for both HLBs, and their judicious use should not be overlooked. However, it may provide acceptable control but not always economic return in commercial grain production. This is dependent on the price received for the wheat, the price of the fungicide and the percent yield increase from using the fungicide. Situations will differ significantly according to geographical areas and cropping conditions. Spot blotch in particular is a very aggressive disease, and under a favourable environment, spraying at one- to two-week intervals for as long as necessary may be needed to maintain the disease under control.|$|E
50|$|Kernel smut can {{be found}} {{throughout}} soils in the Mid-South where spores are able to survive {{up to two years}} without a crop being planted. When a crop is planted the disease infects the rice kernels during early development and replaces the starch inside with black kernel smut spores. These spores swell the plant until the grain eventually cannot contain the spores and bursts, releasing spores into the air. These spores either infect the current crop or land on the soil to infect the next year's crop. The disease harms the plant because when rice infected with kernel smut is harvested it often breaks during the milling process and is rendered useless. Research in Arkansas has recently shown that yield losses is about 10% when rice is left untreated. <b>Propiconazole</b> has been found to provide the best fungicidal control, offering 85-95% reduction in kernel smut.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{specific}} {{controls for}} Ascochyta leaf spot diseases {{have not been}} clearly described. [...] Effective controls for a similar disease, Septoria leaf blotch, have been prescribed for Ascochyta leaf spot diseases. These include: crop rotation, fungicide application, variety selection, irrigation management, tillage to reduce residue, and good grassy weed control. [...] Fungicides that are listed as providing 'Very Good' control of Septoria leaf blotch include Azoxystrobin 22.9%, Pyraclostrobin 3.6%, and <b>Propiconazole</b> 41.8%. [...] Applying fungicides {{at the beginning of}} the season reduces the number of sporulating pycnidia and mycelium that overwintered. Sanitation through removing all plant debris from the field at the end of the season reduces the inoculum for the following season. Reduced irrigation prevents the spread of conidia from infected leaves to healthy leaves by decreasing dispersal of conidia. Removing grassy weeds that can harbor the pathogen also decreases the presence of inoculum.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides {{have been}} used since the 1990s to control cottonball. Orbit (<b>propiconazole)</b> is the most {{effective}} fungicide available. Spray recommendations depend on the previous year's disease pressure. [...] "If disease pressure was low to moderate (fewer than 15 % of berries infected), two fungicide applications are recommended: one at 10 - 20% bloom and again 7 - 10 days later. If disease pressure was high in the previous year (greater than 15% of berries infected), two additional fungicide applications are recommended: one when about half the shoots have started to elongate and the second 7 - 10 days later." [...] Experiments have shown that bloom sprays are especially important, and unless disease pressure is high, spraying during shoot elongation appears to be unnecessary. No negative impacts on bees, yield, berry size, or berry color have been observed when Orbit was applied during bloom. Control of cottonball is the main reason for fungicide use in cranberry production.|$|E
50|$|In the Lake States, if {{infection}} is {{discovered in a}} tree, a vibratory plow line, commonly called a trench (or better yet, two generally parallel trenches at different distances from the area of risk) may be plowed to a minimum depth of {{four and a half}} feet (54 inches) between it and other potentially susceptible species to prevent root graft disease transmission. Such plowing will sever root grafts that may transmit the disease to neighboring trees. In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows. An infected tree should not be cut down before vibratory plowing, because that increases the risk of oak wilt migrating quickly via roots to nearby trees. Injections of <b>propiconazole,</b> a fungicide, can help prevent transmission as well; as many as a half dozen injections every six months may be required to protect a large red oak near infected trees. Injections every other year may also be used to treat a white oak, if it is not yet greatly affected.|$|E

40|$|Though many {{fungicide}} {{applications are}} made {{on a golf course}} in a year, little consideration is given to possible non-target effects of fungicides on turfgrasses. Since non-target effects are usually subtle and inconsistent, these effects must be better understood to use fungicides safely and effectively. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of four fungicides on creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) growth and performance. Our hypothesis was that fungicides applied repeatedly and/or at high rates would negatively affect creeping bentgrass growth and/or water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) status. Fungicides used were benomyl (methyl- 1 -(butylcarbamoyl) - 2 -benzimidazolecarbamate), chlorothalonil (tetrachloroisophthalonitrile), iprodione(3 -(3, 5 -dichlorophenyl) -N-(1 -methylethyl) - 2, 4 -dioxo- 1 -imidazolidinecarboximide), and <b>propiconazole</b> (1 -(2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl) - 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole). Single applications of fungicides at recommended rates had no negative side effects {{at any time during the}} studies. All applications of <b>propiconazole</b> consistently caused creeping bentgrass to turn dark green in all studies. Benomyl applied once at 1 X, 3 X, and 9 X the recommended rate increased shoot growth in the greenhouse. Chlorothalonil, iprodione, and <b>propiconazole</b> reduced plant weights and iprodione and <b>propiconazole</b> 3 X reduced WSC in the greenhouse. Repeated applications of <b>propiconazole</b> increased root-to-shoot ratios in the growth chamber. Nine applications of benomyl, chlorothalonil, and <b>propiconazole</b> over a four week period decreased growth whereas, nine applications of benomyl, iprodione, and <b>propiconazole</b> decreased WSC concentrations in the growth chamber. In a field study, 16 applications of fungicides in each of three years had few significant effects on a creeping bentgrass putting green. Fungicide treatments slightly improved rooting in the last year of the study. <b>Propiconazole</b> consistently decreased visual quality but improved color and increased shoot growth. <b>Propiconazole</b> increased snow mold incidence one spring. Three years of chlorothalonil or benomyl applications reduced earthworm populations. If turf is managed properly and fungicides are applied judiciously and at recommended rates, there are few negative non-target effects of fungicides on creeping bentgrass growth and performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Plant growth regulators, such as {{hormones and}} their {{respective}} biosynthesis inhibitors, are effective tools to elucidate the physiological function of phytohormones in plants. A problem of chemical treatments, however, {{is the potential for}} interaction of the active compound with the growth media substrate. We studied the interaction and efficacy of <b>propiconazole,</b> a potent and specific inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, with common soilless greenhouse growth media for rice, sorghum, and maize. Many of the tested growth media interacted with <b>propiconazole</b> reducing its efficacy up to a hundred fold. To determine the molecular interaction of inhibitors with media substrates, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and sorption isotherm analysis was applied. While mica clay substrates absorbed up to 1. 3 mg of <b>propiconazole</b> per g substrate, calcined clays bound up to 12 mg of <b>propiconazole</b> per g substrate. The efficacy of the gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor, uniconazole, and the most active brassinosteroid, brassinolide, was impacted similarly by the respective substrates. Conversely, gibberellic acid showed no distinct growth response in different media. Our results suggest that the reduction in efficacy of <b>propiconazole,</b> uniconazole, and brassinolide in bioassays when grown in calcined clay is caused by hydrophobic interactions between the plant growth regulators and the growth media. This was further confirmed by experiments using methanol-water solvent mixes with higher hydrophobicity values, which reduce the interaction of <b>propiconazole</b> and calcined clay...|$|E
