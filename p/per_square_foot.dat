5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot</b> (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot,</b> however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot.)</b> When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations.|$|E

5|$|In June 2004, 901 New York Avenue NW was 75 percent leased, at {{an average}} cost of $36 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot.</b> The {{delivery}} date was changed once more to September 2004. The building, however, was eventually delivered in early 2005.|$|E
50|$|The other {{economical}} {{concern is}} about the underestimated compensation given by URA. During the reconstruction of Lee Tung Street, the compensation given by the Urban Renewal Authority to the flat owners was $4000 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>feet.</b> However, the selling price of a flat, after the reconstruction, in Avenue Walk is $23000 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>feet</b> in 2013. The URA was criticized for depriving the flat owners by paying an unreasonably low compensation to the flat owner in the affected area i.e. 1.8 billion in total while Urban Renewal Authority is foreseeably gaining $3.4 billion by this project.|$|R

5|$|Two {{units on}} the 87th and 88th floors sold for prices {{in excess of}} $5million in 2009 {{directly}} from the developer. After a few soft years {{in the real estate}} market, it took until August 2014, for units to sell for prices in excess of $1000 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot.</b> Two units sold for over $3million that month including a $3.99million sale, which was the highest sale price in the building since 2009. The penthouse sold for $17million in late 2014 to Sanjay Shah, the founder and CEO of Vistex.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} in February 2007 {{placed the}} initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot</b> ($12,380 per square meter). However, the tower's total estimated construction cost {{had risen to}} $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building {{in the world at}} the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction.|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 pounds <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot,</b> a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified load could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand the load without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum load. In 1992, over {{a decade after the}} mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim to be able to support the load without the use of a composite topping.|$|E

When it opened in 2006 the bike station was one of the country's largest and most modern. The Cycle Center's bicycle parking facilities use high-capacity, two-tiered DoubleParker racks that accommodate {{more than twice as many}} bicycles <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot</b> as traditional bike racks. These racks were manufactured by Josta, a German manufacturer of bicycle parking systems and stands.

The Chicago Park District runs the station, which has a full-time staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the shellac was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by {{exposure}} to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>foot</b> ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In view of {{the vast}} growth in RCC construction, a {{research}} based on optimization of multistoried RCC buildings was carried out since so many years. Many projects come across financial constraints during their development stages. This project is emphasizing on the further development of optimization integrated with different techniques to judge the cost effectiveness of RCC structure. The present study focuses on analysis of (G+ 10) RCC space frame structure using various optimization methodologies. The analysis of space frame was done by Seismic Coefficient Method and Response Spectrum Method using ETABS Software. The project aims at finding a concrete solution on optimization techniques for economic analysis and design of RCC space frame with dual systems. (Moment resisting frames with shear walls or bracings.) In this project optimization was carried out on whole building frame not on an individual element. The fundamental optimization criterion chosen is the area of reinforcement <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>feet.</b> Analysis and design results are presented {{in the form of}} required area of reinforcement <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>feet</b> in (mm 2) in optimization techniques for overall structure. The result shows that, after application of different optimization methodologies, a significant saving in cost of material and there by the cost of construction can be done...|$|R

30|$|The group’s {{next phase}} of model {{development}} involved a consideration of engineering, scientific, and societal factors. The group decided that these should be incorporated within their earlier model. These additional data included the necessary extra lanes for bridges, bikes, and pedestrians, {{as well as the}} difficulty level for each bridge construction. The last factor was determined by dividing the estimated final cost <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>feet</b> by 1.5 for the given examples of the four major bridge types. The group referred to this as the “difficult constructability” factor, which they specifically created to provide the same basis of comparison for all bridge types.|$|R
