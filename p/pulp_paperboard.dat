The rapidly increasing energy cost of the late 70 's and early 80 's put us in the proverbial state of being too busy drowning to stop and take off our shoes. Our utility (gas and electric) bills went from almost insignificant in 1974 to our third highest cost behind only raw material (wood) and labor and peaked at $ 3, 700, 000 /month in January 1983.

40|$|Abstract Beneficial Reuse of Corrugated Paperboard in Civil Engineering Applications Gregory Michael Stone An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} explore the potential for reuse of corrugated paperboard. Corrugated paperboard represents a large fraction of the municipal solid waste generated and discarded in the United States. Alternative applications for reuse can provide a significant benefit by reducing the volume of waste being disposed and by reducing the use of raw materials. Four civil engineering applications were examined for potential beneficial reuse of corrugated paperboard: slurry trench construction, vertical drilling, directional drilling, and controlled low strength materials (CLSM). For {{the purpose of this}} project, corrugated <b>paperboard</b> was <b>pulped</b> and added to bentonite slurry or CLSM mixtures. Bentonite slurry mixtures were tested for viscosity, density, filtrate loss, and permeability. The behavior of the bentonite slurries was greatly influenced by interaction and interlocking of corrugate fibers; in general resulting in increased viscosity, filtrate loss, and permeability and decreased density. CLSM mixtures were tested for flow consistency, unit weight, air content, and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures prepared with corrugated paperboard showed an increased water demand due to high absorption of the corrugate. The higher water content was a significant factor contributing to decreased unit weight and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures containing corrugated paperboard also exhibited increased air contents, possibly due to entrapment of air within the corrugate <b>pulp.</b> Corrugated <b>paperboard</b> was used to successfully replace up to 27 % of bentonite for slurry trench applications, 60 % of bentonite for vertical drilling applications, and 59 % of bentonite for directional drilling applications while maintaining acceptable engineering properties. For CLSM mixtures up to 1 % of fine aggregate was replaced with corrugated paperboard while maintaining satisfactory engineering properties. Incorporation of corrugated paper board into bentonite slurry, CLSM, and drilling fluid applications provides a viable option for beneficial reuse...|$|R

40|$|Swedish {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} is facing a future with increased competition from manufacturers with access to faster-growing raw materials, cheaper labour and more modern mills. To survive and stay competitive, investments in more efficient production could be one option. This thesis addresses the potential for increased energy efficiency at Iggesund Paperboard - Iggesund mill. The mill is an integrated <b>pulp</b> and <b>paperboard</b> mill that is almost self-sustaining in energy aspects, producing most of its own need for electricity, and is a provider of heat to the local district heat system. To evaluate the energy situation, pinch analysis was used for identifying and evaluating the energy saving potential. The analysis is limited to the pulping process and the chemical recovery cycle. A new recovery boiler will be in place by June 2012 and the energy situation has been adapted to these future conditions. Based on data collected on site, today’s energy situation was mapped and the potential for energy savings evaluated. The author can conclude that energy savings are possible. The pinch analysis shows that up to 18 MW of steam theoretically can be saved in the future process. Besides this there is also a wish to reduce the use of primary heat in the district heat production. Available heat sources for process integration are mainly flue gases, hot bleach plant effluents and flash steam. In order to partly realise this saving potential, two stream saving retrofits are presented. By changing the preheating of boiler feed water, 7. 9 MW of steam can be saved, which is equal to 2. 6 % of the mill’s total steam demand. If a more extensive retrofit is constructed the savings increase to 13 MW, which is equal to 4. 4 % of the total steam demand. Increased process integration will reduce the capacity for district heat production but still the more extensive retrofit has the opportunity to produce 44 % of the needed district heat peak load. Furthermore, this thesis also presents a retrofit evaluating the maximum potential for district heat production that aims to produce 22 MW of peak district heat, but without possibility for other steam saving actions. Finally, it is also concluded that when comparing the mill to others, there is a potential for reduction of the steam demand at the wood yard...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters related to the low-price guarantee marketing strategy and energy efficiency analysis. The low-price guarantee is a marketing strategy in which firms promise to charge consumers the lowest price among their competitors. Chapter 1 addresses the research question "Does a Low-Price Guarantee Induce Lower Prices'' by looking into the retail gasoline industry in Quebec {{where there was a}} major branded firm which started a low-price guarantee back in 1996. Chapter 2 does a consumer welfare analysis of low-price guarantees to drive police indications and offers a new explanation of the firms' incentives to adopt a low-price guarantee. Chapter 3 develops the energy performance indicators (EPIs) to measure energy efficiency of the manufacturing plants in <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>paperboard</b> industry. Chapter 1 revisits the traditional view that a low-price guarantee results in higher prices by facilitating collusion. Using accurate market definitions and station-level data from the retail gasoline industry in Quebec, I conducted a descriptive analysis based on stations and price zones to compare the price and sales movement before and after the guarantee was adopted. I find that, contrary to the traditional view, the stores that offered the guarantee significantly decreased their prices and increased their sales. I also build a difference-in-difference model to quantify the decrease in posted price of the stores that offered the guarantee to be 0. 7 cents per liter. While this change is significant, I do not find the response in comeptitors' prices to be significant. The sales of the stores that offered the guarantee increased significantly while the competitors' sales decreased significantly. However, the significance vanishes if I use the station clustered standard errors. Comparing my observations and the predictions of different theories of modeling low-price guarantees, I conclude the empirical evidence here supports that the low-price guarantee is a simple commitment device and induces lower prices. Chapter 2 conducts a consumer welfare analysis of low-price guarantees to address the antitrust concerns and potential regulations from the government; explains the firms' potential incentives to adopt a low-price guarantee. Using station-level data from the retail gasoline industry in Quebec, I estimated consumers' demand of gasoline by a structural model with spatial competition incorporating the low-price guarantee as a commitment device, which allows firms to pre-commit to charge the lowest price among their competitors. The counterfactual analysis under the Bertrand competition setting shows that the stores that offered the guarantee attracted a lot more consumers and decreased their posted price by 0. 6 cents per liter. Although the matching stores suffered a decrease in profits from gasoline sales, they are incentivized to adopt the low-price guarantee to attract more consumers to visit the store likely increasing profits at attached convenience stores. Firms have strong incentives to adopt a low-price guarantee on the product that their consumers are most price-sensitive about, while earning a profit from the products that are not covered in the guarantee. I estimate that consumers earn about 0. 3 % more surplus when the low-price guarantee is in place, which suggests that the authorities should not be concerned and regulate low-price guarantees. In Appendix B, I also propose an empirical model to look into how low-price guarantees would change consumer search behavior and whether consumer search {{plays an important role in}} estimating consumer surplus accurately. Chapter 3, joint with Gale Boyd, describes work with the <b>pulp,</b> paper, and <b>paperboard</b> (PP&PB) industry to provide a plant-level indicator of energy efficiency for facilities that produce various types of paper products in the United States. Organizations that implement strategic energy management programs undertake a set of activities that, if carried out properly, have the potential to deliver sustained energy savings. Energy performance benchmarking is a key activity of strategic energy management and one way to enable companies to set energy efficiency targets for manufacturing facilities. The opportunity to assess plant energy performance through a comparison with similar plants in its industry is a highly desirable and strategic method of benchmarking for industrial energy managers. However, access to energy performance data for conducting industry benchmarking is usually unavailable to most industrial energy managers. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through its ENERGY STAR program, seeks to overcome this barrier through the development of manufacturing sector-based plant energy performance indicators (EPIs) that encourage U. S. industries to use energy more efficiently. In the development of the energy performance indicator tools, consideration is given to the role that performance-based indicators play in motivating change; the steps necessary for indicator development, from interacting with an industry in securing adequate data for the indicator; and actual application and use of an indicator when complete. How indicators are employed in EPA’s efforts to encourage industries to voluntarily improve their use of energy is discussed as well. The chapter describes the data and statistical methods used to construct the EPI for plants within selected segments of the <b>pulp,</b> paper, and <b>paperboard</b> industry: specifically <b>pulp</b> mills and integrated paper & paperboard mills. The individual equations are presented, as are the instructions for using those equations as implemented in an associated Microsoft Excel-based spreadsheet tool. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{products}} provide essential {{resources for}} human civilization, including energy and materials. In processing forest products, however, unwanted byproducts, such as {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are generated. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a cost effective and reliable air pollution control system to reduce VOC and HAP emissions from <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>paperboard</b> mills and solid wood product facilities. Specifically, this work focused on the removal of VOCs and HAPs from high volume low concentration (HVLC) gases, particularly methanol since it is the largest HAP constituent in these gases. Three technologies were developed and tested at the bench-scale: (1) A novel composite material of activated carbon coated with a photocatalyst titanium dioxide (TiO{sub 2 }) (referred to as TiO{sub 2 }-coated activated carbon or TiO{sub 2 }/AC), (2) a novel silica gel impregnated with nanosized TiO{sub 2 } (referred to as silica-titania composites or STC), and (3) biofiltration. A pilot-scale reactor was also fabricated and tested for methanol removal using the TiO{sub 2 }/AC and STC. The technical feasibility of removing methanol with TiO{sub 2 }/AC was studied using a composite synthesized via a spay desiccation method. The removal of methanol consists of two consecutive operation steps: removal of methanol using fixed-bed activated carbon adsorption and regeneration of spent activated carbon using in-situ photocatalytic oxidation. Regeneration using photocatalytic oxidation employed irradiation of the TiO{sub 2 } catalyst with low-energy ultraviolet (UV) light. Results of this technical feasibility study showed that photocatalytic oxidation can be used to regenerate a spent TiO{sub 2 }/AC adsorbent. A TiO{sub 2 }/AC adsorbent was then developed using a dry impregnation method, which performed better than the TiO{sub 2 }/AC synthesized using the spray desiccation method. The enhanced performance was likely a result of the better distribution of TiO 2 particles on the activated carbon surface. A method for pore volume impregnation using microwave irradiation was also developed. A commercial microwave oven (800 W) was used as the microwave source. Under 2450 MHz microwave irradiation, TTIP was quickly hydrolyzed and anatase TiO 2 was formed in a short time (< 20 minutes). Due to the volumetric heating and selective heating of microwave, the solvent and by-products were quickly removed which reduced energy consumption and processing time. Activated carbon and TiO{sub 2 }/AC were also tested for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, which was chosen as the representative total reduced sulfur (TRS) species. The BioNuchar AC support itself was a good H{sub 2 }S remover. After coating TiO{sub 2 } by dry impregnation, H{sub 2 }S removal efficiency of TiO{sub 2 }/AC decreased compared with the virgin AC due to the change of surface pH. Under UV light irradiation, H{sub 2 }S removal efficiency of TiO{sub 2 }/AC composite doubled, and its sulfate conversion efficiency was higher than that of AC. The formation of sulfate is preferred since the sulfate can be removed from the composite by rising with water. A pilot-scale fluidized bed reactor was designed to test the efficiency of methanol oxidation with TiO{sub 2 }/AC in the presence of UV light. TiO{sub 2 }/AC was prepared using the spray desiccation method. The TiO{sub 2 }/AC was pre-loaded with (1) methanol (equivalent to about 2 %wt) and (2) methanol and water. When the TiO{sub 2 }/AC loaded with methanol only was exposed to UV light for one hour in the reactor, most of the methanol remained in the carbon pores and, thus, was not oxidized. The TiO{sub 2 }/AC loaded with methanol and water desorbed about 2 / 3 of the methanol from its pores during fluidization, however, only a small portion of this desorbed methanol was oxidized. A biofilter system employing biological activated carbon was developed for methanol removal. The biofilter contained a mixed packing with Westvaco BioNuchar granular activated carbon, perlite, Osmocote slow release ammonium nitrate pellets, and Agrasoke water crystals in a 4 : 2 : 1 : 1 ratio by volume. The biofilter was inoculated with a bacterial culture collected from a Florida <b>pulp</b> and <b>paperboard</b> plant. A non-inoculated biofilter column was also tested. Use of a biological inoculum enriched from biofilm in the pulp and paper process has the potential to enhance the performance of a GAC biofilter. During testing, packing material was removed from the inlet and oulet of the biofilters and analyzed for genetic diversity using molecular techniques. The biofilter inoculated with specifically-enhanced inoculum showed higher bacterial diversity for methylotrophs and all bacteria, as compared to a non-inoculated biofilter. Mixed methylotrophic cultures, selected as potential biofilter inocula, showed increased methanol removal with highest concentrations of nitrogen provided as nitrate...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, new {{technology}} {{has been slow to}} enter the paper industry, which turns over its capital stock in about 40 years. In this paper, we will examine some of the reasons for this long transition period and the implications of such a transition period for government policy. If the turnover time could be cut in half, the potential energy savings could be 4 quadrillion Btu (Quads) in 20 years. Examples of new technologies that will become prominent throughout the paper industry by the year 2000 include vapor recompression evaporation, oxygen bleaching, twin-wire forming and extended nip pressing. We present explicit projections of production shares (based on a computer model) for selected new technologies. New technology blends into an industry over a period of years. This paper examines some of the factors that accelerate or retard this transition in the capital-intensive (“heavy”) industries. For purposes of this article, our example is the paper industry, and so the examples of new innovations are drawn from pulp and paper-making processes. (Incidentally, we use the term “paper” throughout as a shorthand for SIC 26, <b>Pulp,</b> Paper and <b>Paperboard.)</b> The examination of paper-industry technology reported here is based to a great extent on a study of industrial energy use [1] conducted by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) for the U. S. Congress. The OTA study examined the four most energy-intensive American industries (paper, steel, chemicals and petroleum refining), to identify technologies to improve energy efficiency, to project industrial energy use in each industry between now {{and the end of the}} century, and to assess the impact of various policies on energy use and energy efficiency. The study found remarkable similarities between the four industries. One notable commonality is the attitude of management towards introduction of {{new technology}}.

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} summary of the results of a survey on Environmental Management Practices (EMP) conducted by the University of California at Santa Barbara during October and November 2003. The survey was sent to 3255 facilities in 8 industrial sectors: <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>paperboard</b> mills, chemical and allied products, refining, primary metals, machinery, electronics /electrical, automotive, and utilities. The survey yielded 562 responses, which constitutes a 17. 2 % response rate. This summary includes a general description of the sample, a profile of the respondents, and summary statistics of facilities' environmental management practices, relations with stakeholders, and environmental performance measures. In addition, we report the factors that respondents noted were influencing them to improve their environmental performance and adopt particular environmental management practices. In many cases, these results are categorized by industry to facilitate comparisons. The environmental management practices we inquired about include the adoption of an environmental policy and its communication, the number of internal and external audits performed at the facility, the proportion of employees in various departments receiving environmental training, "green purchasing" policies, the adoption of the ISO 14001 international standard, participation in industry and governments voluntary programs, and solicitation of opinions from environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Overall, we identified important differences between industrial sectors in terms of the level of adoption of these environmental management practices. Companies can employ these survey results to benchmark their practices to facilities in their own industry as well as to other industries. In addition, government, NGOs, and local communities can employ this information to learn the prevalence of different environmental management practices across various industries, and to better understand how firms are motivated - and influenced - to adopt environmental management practices...|$|R
