40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{two types of}} micropumps have been developed: (1) Micropumps to pump gases and (2) self-filling micropumps, which are able to pump gases as well as liquids. Both are {{actuated}} thermopneumatically by heating up gas with a resistive heater and consist of two passive membrane valves for fluid direction. The micropumps are assembled out of three parts only. A single 1, 5 #mu#m thick polyimide membrane, which carries out all movable functions, is mounted between two <b>pump</b> <b>cases</b> out of plastic material. The polyimide layer serves as the highly elastic pump membrane and also serves as valve membranes at its free suspended areas. Micropumps for gases (1) consist of a thinfilm heater wire (thickness: 130 nm), which is located directly on the pump membrane. The micropumps are driven by small electric pulses (2 ms) of typically 2 W at frequencies of up to 30 Hz. At a frequency of 20 Hz flowrates of 400 #mu#l/min are achieved and a maximum counter pressure of 200 hPa is built up. The outer dimensions of these micropumps are 10 x 10 x 1, 2 mm" 3. The polyimide membranes with the heater wires on top are manufactured separately on a silicon substrate and are bonded to the injection-molded <b>pump</b> <b>cases</b> by a new adhesive bonding technique. This technique has been developed to bond together {{a large number of}} microstructures in parallel. Micropumps for gases are manufactured in a small series production and are commercially available. Micropumps for gases and liquids (2) are driven by a heater wire, which is located on the pumpcase in the actuator chamber. The micropumps are self-filling and are able to pump liquids and gases under identical electrical conditions. Liquids may contain air bubbles. The smallest micropumps (2) manufactured have outer dimensions of 2 x 2 x 0, 26 mm" 3. The <b>pump</b> <b>cases</b> of these micropumps are out of polyimide, which is patterned by optical lithography. The micropumps for gases (1) have been developed {{to be used in the}} two microsystems 'Elektrolytanalysator' and 'Optochemischer Schadstoffanalysator' of the Research Centre Karlsruhe. A new fluidhandling concept has been set up especially to handle with polluted liquids. Using micropumps for gases which are working on an air cushion over the system liquids made it possible to manage all fluidical system functions. To trigger the design process a simulation model based on electrical analogies has been developed for a micropump for gases. The discrete circuit model describes the micropump as a coupled nonlinear dynamic system. Closed simulations have been carried out using PSPICE. The validity of the model could be proved by measurements on a number of micropumps in the range of the parameters, that could be adjusted in practice. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by B.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 99 Positive {{displacement}} and {{centrifugal pumps}} sometimes seem to inhabit different worlds. Users are generally much {{more familiar with}} one type than the other. This causes some confusion when the user?s expectations are based on experience with one type {{of the reality of}} the pump?s operation is based on the other type. Contrasted, herein, will be the differences in operation of the two types of pumps through real world examples where the characteristics of each were used to advantage. Centrifugal and positive displacement pumps operate on completely different principals. With centrifugal pumps, flow results from a pressure differential created by the pump. For a positive displacement pump, pressure differential results from flow created by the pump. This is analogous to moving a truckload of tennis balls from the street to the second story of a warehouse. There are two ways to accomplish this. One could stand in the street and throw the balls through an open second story window. This is the centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>case.</b> One could also put a few balls into a box and carry the box up the stairs, dump out the balls and bring the box back from another load. This is the positive displacement <b>pump</b> <b>case.</b> Continue the analogy by noting that some balls thrown from the street miss the window and bounce off the wall, like recirculation in the centrifugal pump. Similarly, some balls fall out of the box and roll back down the stairs, like slip in a positive displacement pump. Imagine that as the height of the window increased, more balls will miss and bounce back. Eventually, the window will be too high to throw any balls into, and the ?shutoff? point will have been reached. At the same time, the number of ball carried up the stairs will remain relatively constant as the height of the window increases. A few more balls may roll out of the box on the taller stairs, but most of the ball will still reach the top. Five examples of pump applications are examined to illustrate how these different characteristics may be used to good effect. First, a positive displacement pump solved problems for an aluminum can manufacturer because the insensitivity of flow rate to change in pressure (Figure 1, A and B) improved the uniformity of a coating applied {{to the inside of the}} cans. Second, a centrifugal pump was favored to boost the suction pressure of a high pressure fuel pump on a gas turbine, because the variable flow characteristics of the centrifugal pump matched the variable demand (Figure 1, A and C). Third, positive displacement pumps were preferred for unloading tanker trucks because of their self-priming characteristics and relative insensitivity to large changes in the viscosity or specific gravity of the liquid being pumped. Next, a centrifugal pump was the best choice for a large pump to circulate cooling water, and finally, a centrifugal pump was also preferred for use as a boiler feedpump...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study has}} been performed to investigate the effects of blade row interaction {{on the performance of}} radial turbomachines, which was motivated by the need to improve our understanding of the blade row interaction phenomena for further improvement in the performance. High-speed centrifugal compressor stages with three settings of radial gap are configured and simulated using a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow method in order to investigate the impact of blade row interaction on stage efficiency. The performance predictions show that the efficiency deteriorates if the gap between blade rows is reduced to intensify blade row interaction, which is in contradiction to the general trend for stage axial compressors, hi the compressors tested, the wake chopping by diffuser vanes, which usually benefits efficiency in axial compressor stages, causes unfavourable wake compression through the diffuser passages to deteriorate the efficiency. Similarly, hydraulic turbine stages with three settings of radial gap are simulated numerically. A new three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow method based upon the dual-time stepping technique combined with the pseudo-compressibility method has been developed for hydraulic flow simulations. This method is validated extensively with several test cases where analytical and experimental data are available, including a centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>case</b> with blade row interaction. Some numerical tests are conducted to examine the dependency of the flow solutions on several numerical parameters, which serve to justify the sensitivity of the solutions. Then, the method is applied to performance predictions of the hydraulic turbine stages. The numerical performance predictions for the turbines show that, by reducing the radial gap, the loss generation in the nozzle increases, which has a decisive influence on stage efficiency. The blade surface boundary layer loss and wake flow mixing loss, enhanced with a higher level of flow velocity around blading and the potential flow disturbances, are responsible for the observed trend...|$|E
40|$|Condition Monitoring is an {{area that}} has seen {{substantial}} growth in the last few decades. The purpose for implementing condition monitoring in industry is to increase productivity, decrease maintenance costs and increase safety. Therefore, condition monitoring can be used not only for planning maintenance but also for allowing the selection of the most efficient equipment to minimize operating costs. Hydraulic systems are widely used in industry, aerospace and agriculture and are becoming more complex in construction and in function. Reliability of the systems must be supported by an efficient maintenance scheme. Due to component wear or failure, some system parameters may change causing abnormal behaviour in each component or in the overall circuit. Research in this area has been substantial, and includes specialized studies on artificial fault simulation at the University of Saskatchewan. In this research, an axial pump was the focus of the study. In an axial piston pump, wear between the various faces of components can occur {{in many parts of the}} unit. As a consequence, leakage can occur in locations such as between the valve plate and barrel, the drive shaft and oil wiper, the control piston and piston guide, and the swash plate and slippers. In this study, wear (and hence leakage) between the pistons and cylinder bores in the barrel was of interest. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, as well as at other research institutions, have been involved in studies to detect wear in pumps using a variety of condition monitoring algorithms. However, to verify the reliability and indeed, limitations of some of the approaches, it is necessary to test the algorithms on systems with “real” leakage. To introduce actual wear in the piston of pumps can be very difficult and very expensive. Hence, introducing piston wear in an “artificial” manner would be of great benefit in the evaluation of various condition monitoring techniques. Since leakage is a direct consequence of piston wear, it is logical to conclude that varying the leakage in some prescribed manner can be used to artificially simulate wear. A prime concern, therefore, is to be able to precisely understand the dynamic relationships between the wear and leakage and the effect it has on the output flow or pressure waveform from the pump. Introducing an artificial leakage to simulate the wear of pistons is a complex task. The creation of an artificial leakage path was not simply a process of providing a resistive short to the tank at the outlet of the pump port as was done in other studies. The objective was to create a leakage environment that would simulate leakage from a single piston (or combination of several pistons thereof). The complexity of the flow and pressure ripple waveforms (which various condition monitoring algorithms did require) was such that a more comprehensive leakage behaviour had to be modeled and experimentally created. A pressure control servo valve with a very high frequency response was employed to divert the flow from the pump outlet with a prescribed waveform directly to the tank to simulate the piston leakage from the high pressure discharge chamber to the <b>pump</b> <b>case</b> drain chamber as the simulated worn piston made contact with the high pressure chamber. The control algorithm could mimic the action of a single worn piston at various degrees of wear. The experimental results indicated that the experimental system could successfully introduce artificial leakage into the pump which was quite consistent with a unit with a “real” worn piston. Comparisons of the pressure ripples from an actual faulty pump (worn piston) and the “artificial” faulty pump (artificial leakage) are presented...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 81 In {{this case}} history, the {{successful}} application of well-known tools for hydraulic design changes and cavitation erosion prediction is presented. A {{description of the}} tools {{can be found in}} many publications and will not be repeated here. However, the application of the tools in a difficult field situation with unfavorable hydraulic boundary conditions is outlined and the resulting successful solution is presented. There are six pumping stations in the Rio Colorado Tijuana Aqueduct (water pipeline), which crosses northern Baja California in Mexico. The planning of the construction work did not adequately consider all the necessary hydraulic boundary conditions for the pipeline pumps; i. e., some of the suction reservoirs were built with a relatively small elevation relative to their pumping stations. Consequently, the existing available net positive suction head (NPSH) for the pumps of some stations is very low and marginal for satisfactory operation. Therefore, impellers are experiencing premature wear (repair/replacement after less than a year of operation), caused by cavitation erosion. Construction changes to the pipeline to increase the NPSH available were cost prohibitive. Hence, to extend the life expectancy of impellers, the customer placed an order with the OEM to develop an improved hydraulic design with respect to cavitation erosion. As nothing but the pump hydraulic could be changed, the new design would have to work under the existing, far less than optimum pipeline conditions, and compromises had to be found which would normally not be desirable for a new pipeline layout. Preliminary testing was to be done on the test bed and final testing was subject to a joint effort of the manufacturer and the user of the prototype pump installed and operating in the pipeline. A new impeller, with slightly modified rated flow conditions to adapt to effective plant conditions, and a steeper head ? a capacity characteristic to avoid runout on the curve, was developed. <b>Pump</b> <b>case</b> changes were introduced at the inlet splitters and at the volute tips. Cavitation noise level to estimate erosion rates was measured as described by Guelich and Pace [1] and Guelich [2]. The original impeller?s life with respect to cavitation was estimated. A 65 to 70 percent probability of a 16, 000 hr life was determined based on data from the new configuration, both on the test bed and in the pipeline, allowed the expected impeller life to be quantified. A guarantee to reach at least double the original time span for the worst operating conditions possible, at max flow, i. e., single pump operation, could be given. More than three years could be guaranteed for operation at plant design conditions and the chance to reach 4. 5 years was estimated to be about 80 percent. The extrapolated life has been verified through a prorate erosion rate during a field inspection after almost 3000 hrs of operation. Vibration levels were significantly lowered due to the new hydraulic design with staggered impeller vanes. The comparison of old design and new design pump vibrations, taken during pipeline operation at the same station, indicate the clearly higher safety margin for the mechanical integrity of the upgraded machines. Additionally, as a byproduct, the efficiency has been increased by about two percent, as the pump best efficiency flow had been adjusted to the effective operating flow in the pipeline...|$|E
