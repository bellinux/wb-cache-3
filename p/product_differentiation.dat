This paper addresses spatial competitions along with horizontal <b>product</b> <b>differentiations</b> and entry deterrence. By the dynamic game theory model about one firm and a potential entrant with different cost in a linear city, this paper finds that both the higher fixed setup cost and the higher transportation cost deter entrants. To efficiently deter the entrants, the establisher is inclined to locating at the middle point of the linear city...|$|R

Mafia-enforced collusion typically appear in markets where collusion is both desirable (inelastic demand, lack of <b>product</b> <b>differentiation,</b> etc.) and difficult to set up (numerous competitors, low barriers to entry). Industries which fit this description include garbage collection.|$|E
25|$|Lack of Specialization: Under monopolistic competition, {{there is}} little scope for {{specialization}} or standardization. <b>Product</b> <b>differentiation</b> practiced under this competition leads to wasteful expenditure. It is argued that instead of producing too many similar products, only a few standardized products may be produced. This would ensure better allocation of resources and would promote economic welfare of the society.|$|E

Markets can also be worldwide, for example the global diamond trade. National economies can be classified, for example as developed markets or developing markets.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{sustainability}} {{as a business}} opportunity {{has led to the}} formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the Society for Organizational Learning, the Sustainable Business Institute, and the World Council for Sustainable Development. The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green-collar workers. [...] Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability, and led to emergence of the concept of [...] "embedded sustainability"—defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as [...] "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium". Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better <b>product</b> <b>differentiation,</b> d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.

A monopolistically competitive market is productively inefficient market structure because marginal cost is less than price in the long run. Monopolistically competitive markets are also allocatively inefficient, as the price given is higher than Marginal cost. <b>Product</b> <b>differentiation</b> increases total utility by better meeting people's wants than homogenous products in a perfectly competitive market.|$|E

A basic template for writing positioning statements is as follows: [...] "For (target customer) who (statement of the need or opportunity), the (product name) is a (product category) that (statement of key benefit - that is, compelling reason to buy).

In order to develop a competitive advantage, the company must have resources and capabilities that are superior to those of its competitors.

[...] American Motors executives apparently felt confident enough to not worry that the Gremlin name might have negative connotations. Time magazine noted two definitions for gremlin: [...] "Defined by Webster's as 'a small gnome held {{to be responsible for}} malfunction of equipment.' American Motors' definition: 'a pal to its friends and an ogre to its enemies.'" [...] The car's cartoon-inspired mascot was marketed for <b>product</b> <b>differentiation</b> and was intended to be memorable to consumers. The Gremlin's unorthodox hatchback design was also needed to make the car stand out in the competitive marketplace, and according to Teague: [...] "Nobody would have paid it any attention if it had looked like one of the Big Three" [...] automobiles.|$|E
2500|$|The long-run {{characteristics}} of a monopolistically competitive market are almost {{the same as a}} perfectly competitive market. [...] Two differences between the two are that monopolistic competition produces heterogeneous products and that monopolistic competition involves a great deal of non-price competition, which is based on subtle <b>product</b> <b>differentiation.</b> [...] A firm making profits in the short run will nonetheless only break even in the long run because demand will decrease and average total cost will increase. [...] This means in the long run, a monopolistically competitive firm will make zero economic profit. This illustrates the amount of influence the firm has over the market; because of brand loyalty, it can raise its prices without losing all of its customers. This means that an individual firm's demand curve is downward sloping, in contrast to perfect competition, which has a perfectly elastic demand schedule.|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of the organic food market and the growing competition are factors that fuel the differentiation of organic food <b>products.</b> <b>Differentiation</b> may be achieved by developing “organic-plus” products that integrate other value-adding characteristics beyond the organic quality. In this context, {{the aim of this}} study was to explore whether consumers would notice and value further improvements in the animal welfare standards than those imposed by organic regulation. The results of three focus groups designed as a concept test reveal positive attitudes towards the proposed production process from both regular and occasional organic buyers. The results further indicate that the proposed “organic-plus” products would probably be valued by a niche of regular organic meat consumers, provided that the products also offer good overall quality and that the animal welfare aspect is clearly communicated...|$|R
