Earlier in the morning, engineers said that the problem had been solved, however another glitch in the system raised concerns and additional troubleshooting was ordered.

2500|$|Golf {{had mixed}} to {{positive}} reception; the positive reception {{was due in}} part to the T Soft's experience with golf games which was noted by multiple outlets including Official Nintendo Magazine, Edge, Allgame, and Nintendo Power (the latter which called it the third best Virtual Boy game of the year). Nintendo Power [...] called Golf the most realistic sports game on the Virtual Boy at the time of its release. A reviewer for Next Generation said that the gameplay holds up surprisingly well to golf simulations on systems better suited to the genre. Total! magazine felt that the game was very basic and lacked in content and features. Nintendo Life's Dave Frear felt that the controls were designed well, but criticized its lack of multiplayer, internal memory of high score data between <b>power</b> <b>cycles,</b> and a second golf course.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of FAT32, long seek and scan times became more apparent, particularly on very large volumes. A possible justification suggested by Microsoft's Raymond Chen for limiting the maximum size of FAT32 partitions created on Windows was {{the time required to}} perform a [...] "DIR" [...] operation, which always displays the free disk space as the last line. Displaying this line took longer and longer as the number of clusters increased. FAT32 therefore introduced a special file system information sector where the previously computed amount of free space is preserved over <b>power</b> <b>cycles,</b> so that the free space counter needs to be recalculated only when a removable FAT32 formatted medium gets ejected without first unmounting it or if the system is switched off without properly shutting down the operating system, a problem mostly visible with pre-ATX-style PCs, on plain DOS systems and some battery-powered consumer products.|$|E

In <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> theory, foreign policy role is the “bargaining substance ” of statecraft, requiring actor initiative and systemic (other actors’) acceptance. Leadership is not hegemony. The concept of “systemism ” provides a persuasive justification for the research on micro–micro and micro–macro linkages in <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> theory.

In literature, the fatigue life of power devices has been evaluated {{on the basis of the}} thermal cycle. This cycle is alternately repeated within a range from a high temperature to a low temperature. In an actual operating environment, however, a power device works in a <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> that consists of being switched ON and OFF. To accurately predict the fatigue life cycle of a device, then, the evaluation should take account of this important aspect of the <b>power</b> <b>cycle.</b> To verify the utility of the evaluation method presented in this study, the results for a <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> based on the combined use of electrical analysis, heat analysis, and stress analysis are compared to the results based on the thermal cycle, as found in the literature.

50|$|Because {{of these}} high temperatures, light {{hydrocarbon}} fuels, such as methane, propane, and butane can be internally reformed within the anode. SOFCs {{can also be}} fueled by externally reforming heavier hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel (JP-8) or biofuels. Such reformates are mixtures of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam and methane, formed by reacting the hydrocarbon fuels with air or steam in a device upstream of the SOFC anode. SOFC power systems can increase efficiency by using the heat given off by the exothermic electrochemical oxidation within the fuel cell for endothermic steam reforming process. Additionally, solid fuels such as coal and biomass may be gasified to form syngas which is suitable for fueling SOFCs in integrated gasification fuel cell <b>power</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|E
