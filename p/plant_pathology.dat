40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, trends in herbal {{cropping}} have lead to increase cultivation of medicinal plants, herb and spices. With these new particular crops, however, unique diseases and pest problems are emerging. In terms of production, {{it is well known}} that <b>plant</b> <b>pathologies</b> can cause considerable losses in gross medicinal plants yield. Nevertheless, raw harvesting yield are not the sole key factor in determining the quality (and hence the market value) of the herbs intended for the phytotherapic market. The quality and therapeutic value of the products are, in fact, also determined by the abundance of specific secondary metabolites reputed responsible for the pharmacological ativity of medicinal plants. As a direct consequence of its raison d'etre, it is generally known that secondary metabolism in plants can be altered in response to biotic and abiotic factors, including exposure of individual <b>plants</b> to <b>pathologies.</b> However, only in few cases has the extent of such changes been investigated.

30|$|There {{are several}} ways to detect <b>plant</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Some {{diseases}} do not have any visible symptoms associated, or those appear only when it is too late to act. In those cases, normally some kind of sophisticated analysis, usually by means of powerful microscopes, is necessary. In other cases, the signs can only be detected in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not visible to humans. A common approach in this case is the use of remote sensing techniques that explore multi and hyperspectral image captures. The methods that adopt this approach often employ digital image processing tools to achieve their goals. However, due to their many peculiarities and to the extent of the literature on the subject, they will not be treated in this paper.

Declining crop health affects farmers, consumers and societies through higher input costs, lower outputs and damage to environmental and human health through the abuse and misuse of pesticides. To try to quantify the problem, the International Society for <b>Plant</b> <b>Pathology's</b> online global survey of experts in crop health ([URL] is determining the importance of crop pests and diseases in five staple crops: wheat, rice, maize (corn), soya bean and potato. So far, around 75 % of responses report losses every season, with one-third experiencing yield reductions of 5 – 60 % each year. The survey, which ends on 31 January, has revealed large geographical gaps in the available expert knowledge on crop losses. Such gaps must be addressed to improve access to crop-health information and to increase understanding of today's needs and priorities for future sustainable food systems...|$|R

40|$|Metagenomic {{analyses}} {{have been}} widely used in the last decade to describe viral communities in various environments or to identify the etiology of human, animal, and <b>plant</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Here, we present a simple and standardized protocol that allows for the purification and sequencing of RNA viromes from complex biological samples with an important reduction of host DNA and RNA contaminants, while preserving the infectivity of viral particles. We evaluated different viral purification steps, random reverse transcriptions and sequence-independent amplifications of a pool of representative RNA viruses. Viruses remained infectious after the purification process. We then validated the protocol by sequencing the RNA virome of human body lice engorged in vitro with artificially contaminated human blood. The full genomes of the most abundant viruses absorbed by the lice during the blood meal were successfully sequenced. Interestingly, random amplifications differed in the genome coverage of segmented RNA viruses. Moreover, the majority of reads were taxonomically identified, and only 7 - 15 % of all reads were classified as "unknown", depending on the random amplification method. The protocol reported here could easily be applied to generate RNA viral metagenomes from complex biological samples of different origins. Our protocol allows further virological characterizations of the described viral communities because it preserves the infectivity of viral particles and allows for the isolation of viruses...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{identification}} and phylogenetic studies rely {{to a large}} extent on rDNA sequence polymorphism. In the field of fungal taxonomy, despite the use of huge amounts of rDNA data available, some species within a given genus remain indistinguishable. Therefore, new target sequences need to be selected and validated. This is the case for Fusarium, which includes numerous species most of which are involved in both animal and <b>plant</b> <b>pathologies.</b> In addition to the rDNA fragment encompassing the internal transcribed spacers ITS 1 and ITS 2 and the 5. 8 S sequence, two newly characterized genes were used as molecular markers for Fusarium species genotyping. The cellobiohydrolase-C (cbh-C) and the topoisomerase II (topII) gene parts were cloned and sequenced for at least one isolate of each of the eleven different species of our collection. Both cbh-C and topII were found to be single copy genes. DNA fragments amplified by PCR in order to establish phylogenetic trees range from 1123 to 1157 bp for rDNA and from 327 to 344 bp for cbh-C (this part contains one intron). The topII gene part encoding the carboxy-terminus of the ATP binding domain of the enzyme is constant in length with a value of 724 bp. PAUP-generated phylogenetic analyses based either on cbh-C or topII data enabled all species to be distinguished, and were more informative than those resulting from rDNA sequences. Furthermore, a combination of the three datasets enhanced the accuracy of the analyses and open up new possibilities for rapid molecular {{identification and}} evolution studies within the Fusarium genus...|$|R

25|$|The disease triangle, {{consisting}} of host, environment, and pathogen, {{is an important}} concept, {{especially in regards to}} <b>plant</b> <b>pathology.</b> In this case, the pathogen is Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Agrobacteria have the widest host range of any plant pathogen, so the main factor to take into consideration in the case of crown gall is environment. There are various conditions and factors that make for a conducive environment for A. tumefaciens when infecting its various hosts. For example, the bacterium requires the host plant to be wounded, as this is where the invasion occurs. Factors leading to wounds in plants include cultural practices, grafting, freezing injury, growth cracks, soil insects, and other animals in the environment causing damage to the plant. Thus, in exceptionally harsh winters, it's common to have an increased incidence of crown gall due to the weather-related damage. Along with this, there are methods of mediating infection of the host plant. For example, nematodes can act as a vector to introduce Agrobacterium into plant roots.|$|E

More impelling problems {{in the management of}} organic vineyards are represented by the <b>plants</b> <b>pathology</b> defence and particularly by Plasmopara viticola containment. Copper represents one of the few usable fungicides in the organic farming and the only one effective against downy mildew. The EC Regulation n. 473 / 2002 fixed the maximum usable quantity of copper compounds, owing to the environment problems due to the copper accumulation in the soil. To reduce quantity of metal copper or replace it with natural products, field trials with copper compounds at a low rate or with alternative copper products have been conducted in organic farms located near Rome. Besides, we have also estimated the possibility of reducing the operations against P. viticola optimizing fungicidal treatments. Guidelines EPPO/OEPP PP 1 / 31 (3) have been carried out. The results of the trials have shown that, using cupric products with low metallic content, to reduce copper quantities used, always allowed to respect the limits established by EC Regulation. The alternative products that were investigated have not guaranteed, instead, an adequate protection in high pressure of grapevine downy mildew. It was possible to reduce treatments against P. viticola through the control of different environmental parameters. The trials confirm that copper is indispensable for plant protection in organic farming, as {{it is not possible to}} replace it and no alternative substances from natural extracts exist. We can instead reduce the applied copper quantities using new products with low quantity of metal copper or trough the evaluation of climatic and pedologic data that allow to rationalize the fungicidal treatments. ...|$|R
