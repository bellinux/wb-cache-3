The research results do not indicate that celebrity endorsement is effective. This result was also found for the advertisements with the endorsement of celebrities who were found to match best with the products at hand. These results, therefore, suggest that the considerable amounts invested in celebrity endorsement could better be allocated to other advertisement ends.

When "asymmetric information" exists in a market, in order to cope with it, many Vertical Restraints like resale price maintenance (RPM) are carried out.

And then, we analyze that how maker and dealer will deal with the asymmetric information, together with its effects on the economy...|$|E

40|$|Global {{commodity}} {{markets are}} affected {{by a variety of}} government policies that may expand or lower overall supply and as a result affect world prices for the specific <b>products</b> <b>concerned.</b> Market failures and market structures (market power along the value chain) also affect supply. This paper briefly reviews a number of factors that may distort international commodity markets with a view to identifying elements of an agenda for multilateral cooperation to reduce such distortions. Much of the policy agenda that arises is domestic and requires action by national governments. But numerous policies [...] or absence of policy [...] generate international spillovers that call for the negotiation of international policy disciplines. Independent of whether distortions are local or international in scope, the complexity of prevailing market structures and their impacts on efficiency call for much greater monitoring and analysis by the international community.

40|$|Endocrine tumours of the pancreas, {{also known}} as islet cell tumours, are neuroendocrine tumours arising from the {{pancreatic}} islets. Pancreatic endocrine tumours are uncommon and no endocrine surgeon has vast experience with them. Patients with these rare tumours present either with a specific syndrome or with symptoms related to the malignant nature of the tumours. In addition, {{an increasing number of}} 'pancreatic incidentalomas' with no obvious function have been detected by abdominal computerized tomography. Diagnosis relies on a high index of clinical suspicion and is based on the demonstration of elevated serum levels of the secretory <b>products</b> <b>concerned.</b> Therapeutic strategy depends on the exact localization of the primary tumor and {{the presence or absence of}} metastasis, and is designed to control the tumoral process as well as ameliorate the syndrome associated with it.

40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{investigate}} the knowledge and attitudes among pharmacists in Oman towards the specific use and knowledge of herbal drugs. Methods: The study was conducted on 100 pharmacists employed in Oman. The data was collected using two self- administered questionnaire containing 7 and 11 closed ended questions in each, respectively. Results: The mean age of pharmacists was 32. 6 (SD= 5. 6) years. The majority of pharmacists were interested in herbal information and their herbal information mainly comes from their previous classes during college. Most of them have belief {{on the effectiveness of}} herbal products. Pharmacists were more knowledgeable on specific therapeutic indications of herbal products rather than on other areas such as drug- herb interaction or side effects. Conclusion: In summary, Pharmacists need to be informed on the therapeutic indications, drug interactions, dose, active constituent and precautions of herbal <b>products.</b> <b>Concerned</b> bodies must also provide them with regular continuing education programs apart from putting their effects to incorporate relevant topics in herbal medicine in pharmacy curriculum...|$|E
40|$|I {{consider}} an adverse selection model of product quality to analyze a 8 ̆ 5 rms incentives to sell di¤erent products under an umbrella brand. My main {{result is that}} umbrella branding can signal positive quality correlation to consumers, {{even in the absence}} of any exogenous "technological " correlation between the <b>products</b> <b>concerned.</b> In any equilibrium with positive endogenous quality correlation, the decision to umbrella brand has, for at least one of the products, a positive signaling e¤ect on the price consumers are willing to pay. Moreover, subsequent successes (failures) of either of the products have positive (negative) feedback e¤ects on the other product. For such equilibria to exist, it is necessary that (i) consumers prior information about product qualities is limited, (ii) the markets for the di¤erent products are su ¢ ciently symmetric, (iii) potential quality di¤erences are substantial, and (iv) 8 ̆ 5 rms attach su ¢ cient weight to repeat sales of all products.
