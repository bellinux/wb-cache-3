A program was undertaken to investigate the dynamic response of cylindrical shell panels to impulsive loads. Hot [...] rolled mild steel and aluminum 6061 -T 6 panels of various thicknesses and two panel sector sizes were loaded internally with DuPont "Detasheet" explosive. Calibration tests were conducted to determine the specific impulse of the explosive. The explosive impulse was sufficiently high to result in permanent plastic deformation of the shell panels. The final <b>permanent</b> <b>deflections</b> of the panel specimens were measured. Plots were made of the center deflection of the specimen {{as a function of the}} initial velocity and of the center deflection as a function of a nondimensional impulse parameter. Comparison of the results of tests on specimens made from mild steel, a strain-rate sensitive material, to those of aluminum 6061 -T 6, which is insensitive to strain-rate, revealed that the <b>permanent</b> <b>deflections</b> of the mild steel specimens were reduced. Thus it is concluded that the effect of material strain-rate sensitivity is important and must be considered in analyzing the response of cylindrical shells to impulsive loads. It is also concluded that the influence of geometry changes is insignificant on the cylindrical shell deflections in these tests. Although, to the author's knowledge, there are no present theoretical methods of analysis with which these results may be compared, rigid-plastic methods of analysis are bring developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The large ductile {{deformation}} {{response and}} rupture of thin circular metal plates subjected to central blast loading is investigated using the ABAQUS general purpose finite element code. The finite element code incorporates non-linear geometry and material effects {{as well as}} strain rate sensitivity. A material failure model is also incorporated. The SA. XI axisymmetric sheet elements are used to model the plate. The shell element uses a theory that includes shear deformation effects but degenerates to the Kirchoff classical thin shell theory for thin shell elements. An explicit time integration scheme is considered more suitable than an implicit scheme for the analysis. A uniform mesh with 1000 elements is used in modelling the experiments. The mesh size is chosen to satisfy the conditions for numerical stability in the explicit analysis scheme. Two boundary conditions are considered; a plate clamped to its supports by bolts and a plate fully built-in. The pressure loading from the explosive charge {{is assumed to be}} uniform over the loaded area and decaying exponentially to the plate boundary. The pressure pulse is assumed to be rectangular. Material parameters are obtained from uniaxial quasi-static material tensile test results. The predicted plate responses; mid-plate <b>permanent</b> <b>deflections,</b> <b>permanent</b> deformation shape, strain rate dependence, strain predictions, response time and rupture are compared to experimental data and/or analytical and other numerical solutions.

The governing motion equation was derived by the D’Alembert principle considering the contact characteristic between disks, nonlinear oil-film force, rub-impact force, unbalance mass, etc. The contact effects between disks was modeled as a flexural spring with cubical nonlinear stiffness. The coupled nonlinear dynamic phenomena of the rub-impact rod fastening rotor bearing system with initial <b>permanent</b> <b>deflection</b> were investigated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Bifurcation diagram, vibration waveform, frequency spectrum, shaft orbit and Poincaré map are used to illustrate the rich diversity of the system response with complicated dynamics. The studies indicate that the coupled dynamic responses of the rod fastening rotor bearing system under rub-impact and initial <b>permanent</b> <b>deflection</b> exhibit a rich nonlinear dynamic diversity, synchronous periodic- 1 motion, multiple periodic motion, quasi-periodic motion and chaotic motion can be observed under certain conditions. Larger radial stiffness of the stator will simplify the system motion and make the oil whirl weaker or even disappear at a certain rotating speed. With the increase of initial <b>permanent</b> <b>deflection</b> length, the instability speed of the system gradually rises, and the chaotic motion region gets smaller and smaller.

The deformation/failure procedure and modes of the sandwich panels are identified and analysed. In the uniform loading condition, the effect of core density and face-sheets thicknesses is analysed. Likewise, the influence of pulse shape on the failure modes is investigated by deriving a pressure-impulse (P-I) diagram.

40|$|Metallic {{sandwich}} panels with {{a cellular}} core such as honeycomb or metal foam {{have the capability}} of dissipating considerable energy by large plastic deformation under quasi-static or dynamic loading. The cellular microstructures offer the ability to undergo large plastic deformation at nearly constant stress, and thus can absorb {{a large amount of}} kinetic energy before collapsing to a more stable configuration or fracture. To date, research on the performance of sandwich structures has been centred on their behaviours under quasi-static loading and impact at a wide range of velocities, but work on their blast loading response is still very limited. A series of analytical and computational models have been developed by previous researchers to predict the dynamic response of a sandwich beam or circular sandwich panel. However, no systematic studies have been reported on square sandwich panels under blast loading. In this research, experimental, computational and analytical investigations were conducted on a number of peripherally clamped square metallic sandwich panels with either honeycomb or aluminium foam cores. The experimental program was designed to investigate the effect of various panel configurations on the structural response. Two types of experimental result were obtained: (1) deformation/failure modes of specimen observed in the tests; and (2) quantitative results from a ballistic pendulum with corresponding sensors. Based on the experiments, corresponding finite element simulations have been undertaken using commercial LS-DYNA software. In the simulation work, the explosive loading process and response of the sandwich panels were investigated. A parametric study was carried out to examine the plastic deformation mechanism of the face-sheet, influence of boundary conditions, as well as the plastic energy dissipating performance of the components of the sandwich panels. Two analytical models have been developed in this study. The first model is a design-oriented approximate solution, which is excellent for predicting maximum <b>permanent</b> <b>deflections,</b> but gives no predictions of displacement-time histories. The analysis is based on an energy balance with assumed displacement fields, where either small deflection or large deflection theory is considered, according to the extent of panel deformation. Using the proposed analytical model, an optimal design has been conducted for square sandwich panels of a given mass per unit area. The second analytical model has the ability of capturing the dynamic structural response. A new yield criterion was developed for a sandwich cross-section with different core strengths. By adopting an energy dissipation rate balance approach with the newly developed yield surface, upper and lower bounds of the maximum <b>permanent</b> <b>deflections</b> and response time were obtained. Finally, comparative studies have been conducted for the analytical solutions of monolithic plates, sandwich beams, circular and square sandwich panels...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{solution is}} obtained {{to predict the}} dynamic response of peripherally clamped square metallic sandwich panels with either honeycomb core or aluminium foam core under blast loading. In the theoretical analysis, the deformation of sandwich structures is separated into three phases, corresponding to the transfer of impulse to the front face velocity, core crushing and overall structural bending/stretching, respectively. The cellular core is assumed to have a progressive crushing deformation mode in the out-of-plane direction, with a dynamically enhanced plateau stress (for honeycombs). The in-plane strength of the cellular core is assumed unaffected by the out-of-plane compression. By adopting an energy dissipation rate balance approach developed by earlier researchers for monolithic square plates, but incorporating a newly developed yield condition for the sandwich panels in terms of bending moment and membrane force, "upper" and "lower" bounds are obtained for the maximum <b>permanent</b> <b>deflections</b> and response time. Finally, comparative studies are carried out to investigate: (1) influence {{of the change in}} the in-plane strength of the core after the out-of-plane compression; (2) performances of a square monolith panel and a square sandwich panel with the same mass per unit area; and (3) analytical models of sandwich beams and circular and square sandwich plates...|$|R
40|$|Coupled {{discrete}} particle/continuum {{simulations of}} the normal (zero obliquity) impact of granular slugs against the centre of deformable, end-clamped beams are reported. The simulations analyse the experiments of Uth et al. (2015) enabling a detailed interpretation of their observations of temporal evolution of granular slug and a strong stand-off distance dependence of the structural response. The high velocity granular slugs were generated by the pushing action of a piston and develop a spatial velocity gradient due to elastic energy stored during the loading phase by the piston. The velocity gradient within the “stretching” slug is a strong function of the inter-particle contact stiffness and the time the piston takes to ramp up to its final velocity. Other inter-particle contact properties such as damping and friction are shown to have negligible effect {{on the evolution of}} the granular slug. The velocity gradients result in a slug density that decreases with increasing stand-off distance, and therefore the pressure imposed by the slug on the beams is reduced with increasing stand-off. This results in the stand-off dependence of the beam's deflection observed by Uth et al. (2015). The coupled simulations capture both the <b>permanent</b> <b>deflections</b> of the beams and their dynamic deformation modes {{with a high degree of}} fidelity.
