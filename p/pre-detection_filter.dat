40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{considered}} a 1 Gbit/s multiple pulse position modulation system (MPPM) operating over {{plastic optical fibre}} (POF) while utilising maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) to minimise intersymbol interference (ISI). Here, an original analysis is presented, which significantly simplifies the receiver design by employing raised cosine filtering to eliminate ISI. Practical approximations to the ideal raised cosine filter are examined and it is shown that a very good performance is achieved by using a simple first-order pre-amplifier in cascade with a third-order Butterworth <b>pre-detection</b> <b>filter,</b> both with their bandwidths set at 0. 6 times the MPPM slot rate. When operating with a POF bandwidth of 0. 7 times the data rate, it is shown that both the ideal raised cosine scheme and the simple Butterworth <b>pre-detection</b> <b>filter</b> system offer improvements in sensitivity of 7. 6 and 8 dB respectively, over the more complex MPPM MLD system. A simplified analysis for MPPM that predicts sensitivities to within 0. 5 dB of those determined through the more rigorous treatment is presente...|$|E

40|$|Doppler in a {{communication}} system operating with a multiple differential phase-shift-keyed format (MDPSK) creates an adverse phase shift in an incoming signal. An open loop frequency estimation {{is derived from}} a Doppler-contaminated incoming signal. Based upon the recognition that, whereas the change in phase of the received signal over a full symbol contains both the differentially encoded data and the Doppler induced phase shift, the same change in phase over half a symbol (within a given symbol interval) contains only the Doppler induced phase shift, and the Doppler effect can be estimated and removed from the incoming signal. Doppler correction occurs prior to the receiver's final output of decoded data. A multiphase system can operate with two samplings per symbol interval at no penalty in signal-to-noise ratio provided that an ideal low pass <b>pre-detection</b> <b>filter</b> is employed, and two samples, at 1 / 4 and 3 / 4 of the symbol interval T sub s, are taken and summed together prior to incoming signal data detection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Radio-frequency {{interference}} (RFI) {{present in}} microwave radiometry measurements leads to erroneous radiometric results. Sources of RFI include spurious signals and harmonics from lower frequency bands, spread-spectrum signals overlapping the “protected ” band of operation, or out-of-band emissions not properly {{rejected by the}} <b>pre-detection</b> <b>filters</b> due to its finite rejection. The presence of RFI in the radiometric signal modifies the detected power and therefore the estimated antenna temperature from which the geophysical parameters will be retrieved. In recent years, techniques to detect the presence of RFI in radiometric measurements have been developed. They include time- and/or frequency domain analyses, or time and/or frequency domain statistical analysis of the received signal which, {{in the absence of}} RFI, must be a zero-mean Gaussian process. Statistical analyses performed to date include the calculation of the Kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk normality test of the received signal. Nevertheless, statistical analysis of the received signal could be more extensive, as reported in the Statistics literature. The objective of this work is the study of the performance of a number of normality tests encountered in the Statistics literature when applied to the detection of the presence of RF...|$|R

40|$|The {{bandwidth}} of {{the indoor}} optical wireless Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) {{system can be}} exploited to improve the receiver sensitivity by using Di-code Pulse Position Modulation (Di-PPM) technique. This paper analysis the receiver sensitivity of indoor optical wireless Di-PPM systems, over a slightly dispersive channel, uses a bandwidth-limited PIN-bipolar (PINBJT) optical receiver, zero guard interval and <b>pre-detection</b> <b>filter</b> based on a simple third-order Butterworth filter, that authorizes the receiver to operate over channels with bandwidth as low as 1. 2 times the bit rate. The received pulse shape is a convolution between the impulse response of a diffuse optical wireless link in a ceiling bounce model and rectangular waveform, the operating bit-rate chosen is 100 Mbit/s. In this paper the performance analysis is extended in order to include the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) on error probability and some important errors: wrong slot, erasure and false alarm. A mathematical model is then presented showing how the transfer function of the indoor optical wireless Di-PPM receiver can be calculated. Results are obtained and the pulse shape at input of receiver decision device is illustrated by using MathCAD software...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis investigates techniques for the adjustment of pre-detection filters employed by high speed serial digital modems operating over both time-invariant and timevarying channels. Various techniques for the adjustment of these pre-detection filters have been considered in previous investigations. The more recent ones enable such filters to be adjusted in a simple and accurate way using {{an estimate of the}} sampled impulse response of the linear baseband channel, together with a prior knowledge of the roots that lie outside the unit circle in the z-plane. A root finding algorithm {{is an integral part of}} these techniques. Algorithms for the location of the required roots are presented here, and compared with previous ones in an attempt to optimise the operational speed and accuracy of the adjustment of these filters. Alternative algorithm have also been considered, that operate directly on the sampled impulse response of the linear baseband channel, without the need for locating any roots, thus enabling a faster and more accurate adjustment of the <b>pre-detection</b> <b>filter.</b> The relative performances of all the algorithms are then evaluated over different telephone channels, at transmission rates of 9600 and 19200 bits/sec. The algorithms are also tested over fading channels (such as HF radio links), so as to select the one which offers the best compromise between performance and complexity for hardware implementation. Finally, various aspects of the hardware implementation of the selected algorithm have been considere...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of microwave radiometers can be seriously degraded {{by the presence}} of radio-frequency interference (RFI). Spurious signals and harmonics from lower frequency bands, spread-spectrum signals overlapping the “protected” band of operation, or out-of-band emissions not properly rejected by the <b>pre-detection</b> <b>filters</b> due to the finite rejection modify the detected power and the estimated antenna temperature from which the geophysical parameters will be retrieved. In recent years, techniques to detect the presence of RFI have been developed. They include time- and/or frequency domain analyses, or statistical analysis of the received signal which, in the absence of RFI, must be a zero-mean Gaussian process. Current mitigation techniques are mostly based on blanking in the time and/or frequency domains where RFI has been detected. However, in some geographical areas, RFI is so persistent in time that is not possible to acquire RFI-free radiometric data. In other applications such as sea surface salinity retrieval, where the sensitivity of the brightness temperature to salinity is weak, small amounts of RFI are also very difficult to detect and mitigate. In this work a wavelet-based technique is proposed to mitigate RFI (cancel RFI as much as possible). The interfering signal is estimated by using the powerful denoising capabilities of the wavelet transform. The estimated RFI signal is then subtracted from the received signal and a “cleaned” noise signal is obtained, from which the power is estimated later. The algorithm performance {{as a function of the}} threshold type, and the threshold selection method, the decomposition level, the wavelet type and the interferenceto-noise ratio is presented. Computational requirements are evaluated in terms of quantization levels, number of operations, memory requirements (sequence length). Even though they are high for today’s technology, the algorithms presented can be applied to recorded data. The results show that even RFI much larger than the noise signal can be very effectively mitigated, well below the noise level. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates {{the problem of}} automatic transcription of the Morse signal, and describes and documents several approaches to filtering, processing and decoding it for transcription. The baseband signal is first modeled as a modified random telegraph wave. A discrete Kalman filter and a linear smoother are then used to process the demodulated signal {{in order to gain}} a measure of the effectiveness and applicability of this model. It is shown experimentally that this model and processing yield a significant reduction in the transcription error rate. Next a Viterbi decoder algorithm based on a simple Markov model of the code is incorporated in a more general model for <b>pre-detection</b> Kalman <b>filtering.</b> It is shown that this filter permits acceptable recovery of Morse signals whose average signal-to-noise ration is as low as - 14 dB in a 3 kHz bandwidth.
