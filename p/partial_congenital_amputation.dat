50|$|For {{most cases}} the {{diagnosis}} for <b>congenital</b> <b>amputation</b> is not made until the infant is born. One procedure that is helpful in determining this condition in an infant is an ultrasound examination of a fetus when still in the mother's abdomen as it can reveal {{the absence of a}} limb. However, since ultrasounds are routine they may not pick up all the signs of some of the more subtle birth defects.The most popular method of treatment for <b>congenital</b> <b>amputation</b> is having the child be fit for a prosthesis which can lead to normal development, so the muscles don't atrophy. If there is <b>congenital</b> <b>amputation</b> of the fingers, plastic surgery can be performed by using the big toe or second toes in place of the missing fingers of the hand.In rare cases of amniotic banding syndrome, if diagnosed in utero, fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation.|$|R

5000|$|The exact {{cause of}} <b>congenital</b> <b>amputation</b> is unknown and {{can result from}} a number of causes. However, most cases show that the first three months in a {{pregnancy}} are when most birth defects occur because that is when the organs of the fetus are beginning to form. One common cause is amniotic band syndrome, which occurs when the inner fetal membrane (amnion) ruptures without injury to the outer membrane (chorion). Fibrous bands from the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can get entangled with the fetus, thus reducing blood supply to the developing limbs {{to such an extent that}} the limbs can become strangulated; the tissues die and are absorbed into the amniotic fluid. A baby with <b>congenital</b> <b>amputation</b> can be missing a portion of a limb or the entire limb, which results in the complete absence of a limb beyond a certain point where only a stump is left is known as transverse deficiency or amelia. When a specific part is missing, it is referred to as longitudinal deficiency.

In order to achieve this goal, four interviews were organized with three children with <b>congenital</b> or acquired <b>amputations.</b> These interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the narratives that referred to body image were subjected to enunciation analysis.

Up to 50 % of cases have other congenital anomalies including cleft lip, cleft palate, and clubfoot deformity. The head and face and, in some cases, various internal organs can also be affected.
