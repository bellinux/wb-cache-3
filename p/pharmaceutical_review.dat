40|$|Only 42 of the 116 public {{hospitals}} in Queensland employ qualified pharmacists to staff their pharmacies. We undertook a feasibility {{study to determine}} if <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>reviews,</b> undertaken face-to-face by a visiting pharmacist, could be replicated using telemedicine. The {{study was conducted in}} two phases, with the same pharmacist coordinating the project from the main hospital to two rural hospitals, which relied on supply nurses for all their pharmaceutical services. All inpatients admitted between October 2006 and May 2007 were included in the study. In Phase I the pharmacist made weekly visits to both facilities, to perform face-to-face <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>reviews</b> of the current inpatients. In Phase 2, all <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>reviews</b> were performed remotely by the pharmacist by telephone or videoconference. In Phase 1, 186 pharmaceutical activities were performed (mean 3. 9 per patient). Of these, 78 pharmacist-initiated changes were recommended and 47 (60 %) were implemented. In Phase 2, a total of 296 activities were performed (mean 3. 1 per patient) and of the 140 recommendations made by the remote pharmacist, 74 (53 %) were accepted. Of the accepted recommendations, there were 11 major interventions (those with a potential to prevent harm to the patient) in Phase 1 and 32 in Phase 2. There {{were no significant differences in}} the pharmaceutical activity rates in the two phases. Telepharmacy therefore may be an effective method of providing <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>reviews</b> for patients in rural inpatient facilities, without an on-site pharmacist...|$|R

40|$|Industry-sponsored {{biomedical}} research has grown sub-stantially {{over the past}} few decades and generated in-novations that have materially and positively affected the diagnosis and treatment of myriad human diseases. Much of this research has been done collaboratively with academic investigators. Given the accelerated pace of ther-apeutic innovation arising from post-genomic biotechnol-ogy, the interface between industry and academe is likely to expand and become more complex in the years ahead. On the other hand, industry’s potential steering effects on the clinical literature have become a source of serious con-cern. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>review</b> articles appear to be skewed in favour of specific drugs when authors have financial relation-ships with the relevant companies. 1 As Montaner and col-leagues have noted, 2 the “epidemiology ” of industry-spon-sored clinical research differs from that of research sponsored by peer-reviewed agencies.

40|$|In the United States, Viagra was {{approved}} {{in less than}} 6 months of its application to the Food and Drug Administration, while the medical abortion pill {{was approved}} 4 years after its application, and 17 years after research was first permitted. Congruently, the Ministry of Health in Japan legalized Viagra in 6 months, while oral contraceptives were approved 35 years after the ministry received initial applications. The <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>review</b> agencies in each country are founded on safety and efficacy standards, in which objective decisions arise from science and clinical investigations. Analyses of these recent drug approvals demonstrate that conclusions {{may not have been}} based simply on science and health concerns. Instead, agency actions and application of pharmaceutical law appear to have been influenced by social and political pressures surrounding the products under scrutiny. Pharmaceutical regulations were effectively ignored or manipulated in the United States during the review process for medical abortion, and were applied inconsistently in Japan [...] ultimately yielding results that happened to conform to contemporary sociopolitical beliefs. Such disregard of legislation holds serious ramifications for public health, national consumer trust and the pharmaceutical industry. It is imperative that external pressures remain outside the scope of drug approval processes. Pharmaceuticals Regulation Drug approval Viagra USA Japan Medical abortion Oral contraception...|$|E
