40|$|Accurate and {{efficient}} thermal-infrared (IR) camera calibration {{is important for}} advancing computer vision research within the thermal modality. This paper presents an approach for geometrically calibrating individual and multiple cameras in both the thermal and visible modalities. The proposed technique {{can be used to}} correct for lens distortion and to simultaneously reference both visible and thermal-IR cameras to a single coordinate frame. The most popular existing approach for the geometric calibration of thermal cameras uses a printed chessboard heated by a <b>flood</b> <b>lamp</b> and is comparatively inaccurate and difficult to execute. Additionally, software toolkits provided for calibration either are unsuitable for this task or require substantial manual intervention. A new geometric mask with high thermal contrast and not requiring a <b>flood</b> <b>lamp</b> is presented as an alternative calibration pattern. Calibration points on the pattern are then accurately located using a clustering-based algorithm which utilizes the maximally stable extremal region detector. This algorithm is integrated into an automatic end-to-end system for calibrating single or multiple cameras. The evaluation shows that using the proposed mask achieves a mean reprojection error up to 78 % lower than that using a heated chessboard. The effectiveness of the approach is further demonstrated by using it to calibrate two multiple-camera multiple-modality setups. Source code and binaries for the developed software are provided on the project Web site...|$|R

2500|$|In <b>flood</b> <b>lamps</b> {{used for}} <b>photographic</b> lighting, the {{tradeoff}} {{is made in}} the other direction. Compared to general-service bulbs, for the same power, these bulbs produce far more light, and (more importantly) light at a higher color temperature, at the expense of greatly reduced life (which may be as short as two hours for a type P1 lamp). The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, [...] A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only [...] below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.|$|R
40|$|Depending on your farm operation, {{taking the}} {{following}} actions could reduce your energy consumption. Refer to the references {{at the end}} of the bulletin for more information. Outdoor lighting 1. Ask yourself why am I lighting this area. Is lighting necessary all night? If it’s not needed, turn it off and save. A timer, photo sensor or motion sensor can be used to turn the light off when not needed. 2. Change mercury vapor fixtures to metal-halide or high-pressure sodium fixtures when the lamp needs to be replaced. These provide more efficient lighting and reduce the environmental risk posed by the mercury vapor lamp. Retrofit bulbs are available but are very expensive—about the same cost as replacing the fixture. A 100 -watt high-pressure sodium or 150 -watt metal halide lamp will provide slightly more light than a 175 -watt mercury vapor lamp. 3. Use motion sensors on incandescent or halogen <b>flood</b> <b>lamps</b> to turn on the light only when there is activity in the area. 4. Replace incandescent and halogen <b>flood</b> <b>lamps</b> with highintensity discharge lamps (metal halide or high pressure sodium) in areas with motion more than 30 % of the time during nighttime hours. 5. Install full cut-off reflectors on lights. This reduces light losses to the night sky by more than 20 % and can increase the light level of an intended area by up to 70 %. A 70 w high pressure sodium lamp with a full cutoff reflector will provide the same light as the typical 175 w mercury vapor yard lamp—a 60 % energy savings! 6. Install a DNP half-night photo sensor on yard lights. It shuts off the light halfway through the night reducing the operating cost by half. Payback is typically 2 years or less. 7. Install a clock timer to shut off lighting that is not needed all night. 8. Install photo sensors to turn lights on/off at sunset and sunrise. 9. Keep tree limbs trimmed away from light fixtures. Indoor lighting 1. Provide the proper levels and color of light for the most efficient plant or animal production. 2. Install motion sensors where appropriate so lights are on only when there is activity...|$|R
40|$|The Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art in Eugene, Oregon, {{houses a}} {{remarkable}} permanent collection of Asian art and antiquities, modern art, and sculpture, and also hosts traveling exhibitions. In {{the winter and}} spring of 2011, a series of digital photographs by artist Chris Jordan, titled "Running the Numbers," was exhibited in the Coeta and Donald Barker Special Exhibitions Gallery. These works graphically illustrate waste (energy, money, health, consumer objects, etc.) in contemporary culture. The Bonneville Power Administration and the Eugene Water and Electricity Board provided a set of Cree 12 W light-emitting diode (LED) PAR 38 replacement lamps (Cree LRP 38) for the museum to test for accent lighting in lieu of their standard Sylvania 90 W PAR 38 130 V Narrow <b>Flood</b> <b>lamps</b> (which draw 78. 9 W at 120 V). At the same time, the museum tested LED replacement lamps from three other manufacturers, and chose the Cree lamp as the most versatile and most appropriate color product for this exhibit. The lamps were installed {{for the opening of}} the show in January 2011. This report describes the process for the demonstration, the energy and economic results, and results of a survey of the museum staff and gallery visitors on four similar clusters of art lighted separately by four PAR 38 lamps...|$|R

Prints made from the plates prior to the flood were better quality than the prints made after the flood.

40|$|Urban {{stormwater}} {{models can}} be semi-distributed (SD) or fully distributed (FD). SD models {{are based on}} subcatchment units with various land use types, where rainfall is applied and runoff volumes are estimated and routed. FD models {{are based on the}} two dimensional (2 D) discretization of the overland surface, which has a finer resolution with each grid-cell representing one land use type, where runoff volumes are estimated and directly routed by the 2 D overland flow module. While SD models have been commonly applied in urban stormwater modeling, FD models are generally more detailed and theoretically more realistic. This paper presents a comparison between SD and FD models using two case studies in Coimbra (Portugal) and London (UK). To enable direct comparison between SD and FD setups, a model-building process is proposed and a novel sewer inlet representation is applied. SD and FD modeling results are compared against observed records in sewers and <b>photographic</b> records of <b>flood</b> events. The results suggest that FD models are more sensitive to surface storage parameters and require higher detail of the sewer network representation.

60|$|When he {{returned}} to the door the girl opened it, {{as if she had been}} listening for his step; and she now stood holding it ajar for him to enter, and throwing the light upon the threshold from the lamp, which she lifted high in the other hand. The action brought her figure in relief, and revealed the outline of her bust and shoulders, while the <b>lamp</b> <b>flooded</b> with light the face she turned to him, and again averted for a moment, as if startled at some noise behind her. She thus showed a smooth, low forehead, lips and cheeks deeply red, a softly rounded chin touched with a faint dimple, and in turn a nose short and aquiline; her eyes were dark, and her dusky hair flowed crinkling above her fine black brows, and vanished down the curve of a lovely neck. There was a peculiar charm in the form of her upper lip: it was exquisitely arched, and at the corners it projected a little over the lower lip, so that when she smiled it gave a piquant sweetness to her mouth, with a certain demure innocence that qualified the Roman pride of her profile. For the rest, her beauty was of the kind that coming years would only ripen and enrich; at thirty she would be even handsomer than at twenty, and be all the more southern in her type for the paling of that northern, color in her cheeks. The young man who looked up at her from the doorstep had a yellow mustache, shadowing either side of his lip with a broad sweep, like a bird's wing; his chin, deep-cut below his mouth, failed to come strenuously forward; his cheeks were filled to an oval contour, and his face had otherwise the regularity common to Americans; his eyes, a clouded gray, heavy-lidded and long-lashed, were his most striking feature, and he gave her beauty a deliberate look from them as he lightly stamped the snow from his feet, and pulled the seal-skin gloves from his long hands.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Seven {{methods for}} {{delineating}} flood plains were evaluated. The methods are classified : (1) Geomorphic Technique; (2) Soils Technique; (3) Botanical Technique; (4) Hydrologic Technique; (5) Hydrologic- Hydraulic Technique; (6) Historical Technique; and (7) "Combination Method". All of the methods, except the Botanical Technique and the Hydrologic-Hydraulic Technique, were compared on sample flood plain reaches throughout Oregon. Chronological sequences of natural flood plains {{were identified and}} mapped based on: (1) scarps separating two or more flood plain or terrace geomorphic surfaces and (2) the abundance and degree of <b>photographic</b> expression of <b>flood</b> plain features such as meander scrolls, point bars, oxbows, oxbow lakes, sloughs, old channels, natural levees, and sand splays. Soils were useful in delineating flood plain areas since soils cannot be older than the alluvium in which they form or older than the associated geomorphic surface. Since soils exhibit increasing development of genetic horizons with increasing age, delineation of younger bottomland soils from older soils on higher flood plains or terraces, usually results in the delineation of flood prone areas. Since floods scar bark, or prune branches or the tops of trees, botanical studies can provide information about the flood date, flood stage, and area flooded. The number of annual tree rings that have grown since scarring of the bark, or the age of sprouts that have grown since flood damage occurred, are equal {{to the number of}} growing seasons since the trees were damaged. The thickness of sediment above the base of a tree serves as a measure of the rate of sediment accumulation above the surface on which the tree was located. Historically flood plains have been recognized and delineated by (1) aerial or ground photographs taken during floods; (2) high flood marks such as float debris; and (3) locating flooded areas from field interviews. Previous hydrologic studies have related the stage of rivers at gage locations to the adjacent flood plain areas, and in this manner flood plains have been recognized and delineated. In addition, hydraulic studies have been used to determine flood stages at valley cross sections, for specific flood frequencies. Flood plain width therefore may be determined from the valley cross sections. Use of both the gaging stations and the valley cross sections results in a hydrologic-hydraulic procedure for flood plain identification. The particular flood plain mapping technique that is most applicable in any given study depends on the data available, the purpose and scale of mapping, and the field conditions. Each technique has deficiencies; therefore, the "Combination Method" is introduced to utilize the most useful information from each technique. Collective use of two or more techniques is called the "Combination Method". The relative accuracy of the Geomorphic Technique, Soils Technique, Historical Technique, Hydrologic Technique, and "Combination Method" was determined for some representative stream reaches in Oregon. Areas flooded in a 100 year average recurrence interval event were compared for all methods available in 10 study areas, which ranged from semiarid to humid environments. For the areas compared the "Combination Method" was used as the base method. The Geomorphic Technique was the method most consistently comparable with the "Combination Method". The Soils Technique was generally accurate for delimiting flood plains, with some studies showing excellent correlation. The three study areas with comparisons using the Historic Technique were generally good and most discrepancies occurred where approximate historical flood lines were drawn for inaccessible areas. The Hydrologic Technique showed by fax the poorest correlation with the "Combination Method" as well as with all other methods. The differences between the "Combination Method" and the Hydrologic Technique are explained for specific maps, but in general the major problem was the lack of field correlation of crest staff gage flood elevations, with the general flood plain area away from the river. No independent evaluations were made of the Hydraulic Technique, although the Hydrologic-Hydraulic Technique was included as part of the "Combination Method" in one study...|$|R
