50|$|The {{atmosphere}} within waveguide assemblies {{is often}} pressurized, either {{to prevent the}} ingress of moisture, or to raise the breakdown voltage in the guide and hence increase the power that it can carry. Pressurization requires that all joints in the waveguide be airtight. This is usually achieved {{by means of a}} rubber O-ring seated in a groove in the face of at least one of flanges forming each join. Gasket, gasket/cover or <b>pressurizable</b> <b>flanges</b> (such as that on the right of figure 2), are identifiable by the single circular groove which accommodates the O-ring. It is only necessary for one of the <b>flanges</b> in each <b>pressurizable</b> connection to be of this type; the other may have a plain flat face (like that in figure 1). This ungrooved type is known as a cover, plain or unpressurizable flange.|$|R
