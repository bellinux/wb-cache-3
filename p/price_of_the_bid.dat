The rules are such that they encourage the bidders to submit their prices for the contract within a range desirable by the firm so that these prices not to exceed the (unknown to the bidders) <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> (the ceiling). It is shown that under certain natural assumptions {{on the behavior of}} the bidders, evaluating chances of a firm to award the contract at a price within such a desirable range {{as a result of the}} bid conducted in line with the rules is reducible to solving mathematical programming problems on polyhedral sets. It is also shown that under additional assumptions of the same kind, under the proposed rules, the maximum probability to win the bid at a price within the range is higher for each bidder than that under the rule of awarding the contract to a bidder nominated the lowest price. Thus, while serving the interests of the firm, the proposed rules make the bid more attractive to the potential bidders. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of reports of online auction fraud are of growing concern to auction operators and participants. In this research, we discuss reserve price shilling, where a bidder shills {{in order to avoid}} paying auction house fees, rather than to drive up <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final <b>bid.</b> We examine <b>the</b> effect that premium <b>bids</b> have upon <b>the</b> final selling price, since they are linked with reserve price shill bids. We use 10, 260 eBay auctions during April 2001, and identify 919 auctions involving 322 sellers and 1583 bidders involved in concurrent auctions for the exact same item. We find that premium bidding occurs 23 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, in 263 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 919 auctions.

40|$|<b>The</b> main {{objective}} <b>of</b> this thesis {{is to provide}} a comprehensive understanding of Chinese domestic and cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As), including <b>the</b> merger motives <b>of</b> acquiring firms, stock performance, and key determinants <b>of</b> performance. <b>The</b> key issues and empirical findings are summarised below. Chapter 2 focuses on merger momentum and motives under various market valuation periods for domestic M&As. We demonstrate that there is a form of merger momentum at the market level. <b>The</b> primary motive <b>of</b> mergers and <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> merger momentum is synergy creation, as predicted by neoclassical theory. However, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> merger momentum may be less important when market valuation deviates from its neutral level. Our results suggest that in high-valuation markets, bidding firms’ managers {{are more likely to be}} overconfident and to favour the market-timing strategy, but overly optimistic investors are not evident. In contrast, these managerial incentives are not indicated during low-valuation markets, but investors are found to be overly pessimistic towards any merger announcement. Chapter 3 provides new evidence on <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> investment banks in domestic M&As. Based on a modified reputational measurement, which accounts for the difference between <b>the</b> abilities <b>of</b> small and large bidders to select advisors, we find support for the “superior deal” hypothesis. The overall reputational effect of an investment bank is reflected by an increase in <b>the</b> stock <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> firm in <b>the</b> short term with no long-term reversal. We further find that the deal duration is significantly greater for top-tier investment banks, which supports the “diligent advisor” hypothesis. Additionally, we find that the deal completion rates differ insignificantly between <b>the</b> two tiers <b>of</b> investment banks and that this difference can be explained by the trade-off between the “preventing poor deals” and “better deal completion skills” hypotheses. Overall, our results indicate that the short-term improvement associated with top-tier investment banks stems from their skills, diligence, and trustworthiness. Chapter 4 studies <b>the</b> wealth effects <b>of</b> acquirers that are engaged in cross-border M&As (CBMAs). Specifically, we examine both the short- and long-term abnormal returns of CBMAs that were undertaken after the RMB exchange rate reforms or during the financial crisis period, stratified according to whether the transaction was resource-related. We show that although resource-related CBMAs promote national interests, they are not value-destroying for shareholders. Indeed, such deals are especially welcomed by the market around the deal announcement if they are focussed. Furthermore, currency appreciation increases the relative wealth and decreases <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> capital for acquirers, which allows them to gain significantly higher abnormal returns in both the short and long terms. Finally, the wealth destruction associated with higher managerial risk taking significantly outweighs <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower cost <b>of</b> acquisition for acquirers during the financial crisis period, which leads to significant underperformance over the long term...|$|R

One important aspect of an agent is its ability to predict <b>the</b> closing <b>price</b> <b>of</b> an auction. This is especially useful for <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most profitable auction and <b>the</b> deployment <b>of</b> efficient <b>bidding</b> mechanisms based on <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closing <b>price.</b> Within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> this dissertation several bidding mechanism have been developed. These take into account historical data produced in the auction environment. Specifically, two types of historical data are taken into consideration: a) intermediate data produced while the auction is still in progress and b) data from past auctions. We have developed two classes of forecasting techniques for each one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned data types. These are known as a) short-term and b) long-term forecasting, respectively. Different auction types have been studied and different bidding mechanisms have been developed for each one of them. All mechanisms implement some form <b>of</b> <b>price</b> forecasting based on historical data. To evaluate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a <b>bidding</b> agent, a benchmarking platform is used, which typically calculates the total profit gained in a predefined number <b>of</b> auctions that <b>the</b> agent participates in. In this thesis we have both developed appropriate benchmarking platforms, when necessary, and used already developed and widely adopted benchmarking environments. One such platform is provided by the international Trading Agent Competition. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> these platforms allow <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> our techniques against others, reported in the literature. ...|$|R

The two most available sources for renewableenergy are solar power and wind power. However, these energy sources are unreliablesince they only produce power under certain weather conditions. Among other things,fluctuations in <b>the</b> grid frequency <b>of</b> 50 Hz increases. Primary Frequency Control is partof the toolbox for frequency control. In order to deliver primary frequency control, aplant with a rectifier, an inverter, and a battery package is needed. Eltek is a power elec-tronics company which delivers backup power solutions for sites with communicationantennas or other communication equipment. This thesis will try to develop a con-trol strategy which controls a number of sites used both for backup power and primaryfrequencycontrol. Thiscontrollerneedstofollowtheregulationsgivenbythetransmis-sion system operator. The transmission system operator operates the power grid and isresponsible for primary frequency control. However, private companies may also par-ticipate. This is done by auctions where several stakeholders make a bid for how muchpower can be delivered for a certain <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> winner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> is allowed to de-liver primary frequency control services {{for a certain time}} period. In this thesis, the controller chosen is a model predictive controller. This is an op-timizing control strategy, and the controller should distribute power limits to each site. These limits may be different for up-regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequency and down-regulationof the frequency, and they should be distributed {{in such a way that}} it minimizes thebattery degradation. The models for battery degradation are too complex to be imple-mented in a model predictive controller, hence a simpler model is implemented whichfocuses on one part <b>of</b> battery degradation. <b>The</b> controller developed is simulated ina plant modelled in SIMULINK, which consists of 20 sites with different battery sizes. Eachsiteismodelledafterasitecontrollersuggestedbythedanishtransmissionsystemoperator Energinet. dk. Battery degradation models are also implemented at each site. One for lead-acid batteries and one for lithium-ion batteries. Half the sites uses lead-acid degradation model, and the rest uses the lithium-ion degradation model. Thesemodels are based on part physics part heuristic...|$|R
