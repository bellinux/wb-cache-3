50|$|Theoretical {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} quark stars might not only be produced from neutron stars and powerful supernovas, but they could also be created in the early cosmic phase separations following the Big Bang. If these <b>primordial</b> <b>quark</b> stars transform into strange <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> before the external temperature and pressure conditions of the early Universe makes them unstable, they might turn out stable, if the Bodmer-Witten assumption holds true.

40|$|Macroscopic <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> nuggets are an {{alternative}} explanation for Dark Matter (DM) {{consistent with the}} observa-tional constraints on this mysterious cosmological component. Such <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> theories have strong implications in the formation, development and current behavior of the Solar System, as <b>primordial</b> <b>quark</b> nuggets orbiting the Galaxy {{would be subject to}} capture during planetary formation, leading to the retention of condensed <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> in the centers of the Sun, planets and asteroids today, a possibility that needs to be taken seriously in Solar System Research. As quark nuggets are expected to have a minimum mass set by their physics of their formation, any sufficiently small asteroid with a <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> core would be a strange asteroid, with a high bulk density and strong gravitational binding. Small strange asteroids would be the easiest nugget hosts to detect observationally, and the most accessible source of <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> once detected. Solar System observations of small Very Fast Rotating (VFR) asteroids (those with rotation periods ≤ 1 / 2 hour) support the <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> nugget hypothesis. If VFR asteroids are assumed to be bound by <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> cores, the inferred core mass range peaks at ∼ 1010 kg, consistent with the stable <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> mass range predicted by the detailed theory of Zhitnitsky and his colleagues [1, 2]. As there is a prospect that quark nuggets could be used to produce large amounts of antimatter, the economic benefit from even a single ultra-dense strange asteroid could be little short of astounding. If some of the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) are indeed strange asteroids they would truly constitute a game-change resource for space exploration. It is likely that the quark nugget theory will either be rapidly refuted using Solar System observations, or become a focus of space exploration and development in the remainder of this century...|$|R
