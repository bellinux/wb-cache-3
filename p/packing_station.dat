40|$|Background As low {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} viruses can mutate into high pathogenic viruses the Dutch poultry sector implemented a surveillance system for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) based on blood samples. It {{has been suggested}} that egg yolk samples could be sampled instead of blood samples to survey egg layer farms. To support future decision making about AI surveillance economic criteria are important. Therefore a cost analysis is performed on systems that use either blood or eggs as sampled material. Methodology/Principal Findings The effectiveness of surveillance using egg or blood samples was evaluated using scenario tree models. Then an economic model was developed that calculates the total costs for eight surveillance systems that have equal effectiveness. The model considers costs for sampling, sample preparation, sample transport, testing, communication of test results and for the confirmation test on false positive results. The surveillance systems varied in sampled material (eggs or blood), sampling location (farm or <b>packing</b> <b>station)</b> and location of sample preparation (laboratory or <b>packing</b> <b>station).</b> It is shown that a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the <b>packing</b> <b>station</b> and samples prepared in a laboratory had the lowest total costs (i. e. € 273, 393) a year. Compared to this a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory, and the currently implemented system in which blood is sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory have 6 % and 39 % higher costs respectively. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that surveillance for avian influenza on egg yolk samples can be done at lower costs than surveillance based on blood samples. The model can be used in future comparison of surveillance systems for different pathogens and hazard...|$|E
40|$|NLM is a {{division}} of Necsa. Their primary focus {{is to reduce the}} amount of waste that needs to be cared for in the long run. This includes the reduction of volume by compressing drums containing radioactive waste in a large press. This is done in the VRF. The VRF was operated for several years but became dysfunctional due to outdated technology. Quality is one of the most important aspects of the VRF and therefore the ISO 9001 principles for quality will be applied at the facility. In order to obtain the required level of quality; the existing QMS needs to be amended by creating work instructions, process descriptions and specifications. Work instructions, process descriptions and specifications were developed for use at the VRF. A heuristic to optimise the puck <b>packing</b> <b>station</b> was developed. This will be used to programme the PLC which will control the VRF.

40|$|The {{design work}} that precedes the {{automation}} {{of a process}} {{is not an easy}} job. Each one of the variables and possible risks involved in process must be carefully considered before implement the final design as well the requirements in performance and cost. However automate a dangerous, inefficient or just uncomfortable task entails many benefits that make up for the long period of design process. A well automated line will benefit the production with quality, productivity and capacity among other profits. In this project the immediate objective is to automate the “SANDFLEX Hacksaw blades” packaging process in the plant that SNAEurope owns in Lidköping. Actually the packing is completely manual. One operator packs the blades into the boxes meanwhile one more operator loads and unloads the <b>packing</b> <b>station</b> with empty and full boxes respectively. The task is both, tiring and uncomfortable for the operators as well inefficient for the company since the production rate is limited. Analyzing and observing carefully product and process, different theories and strategies to achieve the goal were developed. Three are the possible solutions to solve the problem, with different levels of automation and technologies. The robotic solution uses an articulated robot to perform all the tasks; the hybrid solution uses pneumatic devices to pack the blades and an articulated robot to support the station loading and unloading the boxes. Finally the pneumatic solution uses only pneumatic devices, which hold, open and close, push box and blades using airpower; a few sensors detect positions and states, since a PLC coordinates and controls all process. By means of discussing these solutions with the company’s engineers and workers, after a deep literature study and two test of performance, was it possible to select the most suitable solution to accomplish the packaging task. The pneumatic solution is cheap and simple, {{but at the same time}} robust and reliable. This design performs the packaging task efficiently and fast. And more important, the operator passes from pack manually the blades to monitor the process...|$|E
50|$|In 1929, Livermore rode a {{motorcycle}} {{up and down}} the Sierra Nevada, searching for a summer job. On the advice of a park ranger in Sequoia National Park, he was hired at a <b>pack</b> <b>station</b> in Mineral King because of his experience with horses and mules. That first summer, he shod mules, helped the camp cook, and did various chores. The following summer, he began leading mule trains into the wilderness of the High Sierra. The Great Depression hit the <b>pack</b> <b>station</b> business hard, and work was negligible the next two summers. He worked a bit in the summer of 1933, and business picked up for the summer of 1934.|$|R

40|$|This master thesis aims {{to enhance}} {{knowledge}} {{on how to}} contribute to an increased sustainability in transport packaging. Five main categories gathering improvement strategy opportunities are developed and illustrated in an Ishikawa diagram. These categories are Process, People, Environment, Unitisation and Material. Empirical data has been collected at company X, both at its headquarters in Gothenburg, and during a one-week visit to its International Distribution Centre in Poland, where interviews to shop floor operators, observations at the <b>packing</b> <b>station,</b> and experiments of different transport packaging alternatives have been carried out. Four initiatives have been undertaken during this study. (1) The layout at the packing area was redesigned to make the material flow more direct and the packing process lean. (2) A guidebook for standardizing operators’ packing methods has been created. (3) Knowledge has been gained from experiments to define best load units across the supply chain. (4) The most valuable packaging materials have been figured {{out to make a}} return flow of packaging material possible. This would reduce raw material consumption as well as reduce the procurement costs of packaging materials. Due to the limitation that only one company has been examined deeply in this master thesis, the result of the study is mainly a good support to the case company focused to work towards sustainable transport packaging. However, the categories of improvement strategy opportunities and the method used in this master thesis can still be a reference to other manufacturing companies in industry. Keywords: transport packaging, sustainability, standardization, process mapping, cyclical packaging.

30|$|The BentoBox, {{designed}} {{within the}} project CityLog [21], {{with the participation}} of TNT Express, has been developed {{with the aim of}} resolving the second disadvantage of <b>pack</b> <b>stations.</b> It is composed of a fixed docking station, and six removable modular trolleys. Trolleys are consolidated at the UDC. A new small container has been proposed within the project CityLog to accommodate the trolleys: BentoBox trolleys are loaded into the small container in the UDC and unloaded at the docking station. The unloading of the BentoBox container is again automatic but the BentoBox trolleys should be manually moved from the unloading unit to the docking station. Therefore the unloading time at the docking station is reduced to the minimum and operative costs are minimized. However, as for <b>Pack</b> <b>stations,</b> the number and the localizations of the BentoBox docking stations are fixed for a given urban area and do not depend on the current freight demand.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{consider}} a pick-and-sort order picking system, in which batches of orders are picked simultaneously from different (work) zones {{by a group of}} order pickers. After picking, the orders are transported by a conveyor to a next station for consolidation and packing. Packing can only occur when an order has been picked completely. For a given number of workers, each assigned to a single zone, a larger number of zones reduces pick time (since travel time reduces), but increases waiting time for completion at the <b>packing</b> <b>stations,</b> because more partial batches needing assembly arrive at the <b>packing</b> <b>stations.</b> Our aim is to determine the optimal number of zones such that the total (picking and packing) time to complete a batch is minimized. We solve this problem by optimally assigning items to pick routes in each zone. We illustrate the method with data taken from a distribution center of one of the largest online retailers in the Netherlands...|$|R
