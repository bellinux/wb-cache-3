500|$|In an {{interview}} with London's Evening Standard in January 2013, Anthony Hopkins (who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock) questioned The Girls portrayal of the director {{and the need for}} a film about that period of Hitchcock's career: [...] "I talked to Tippi Hedren one day...and she never mentioned that...Whatever his obsession was, she didn't want to dwell on it...I don't think it's necessary to put all that into a movie." [...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal {{of a man who was}} a little more complex than that. A lot of <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s the {{derelict}} {{station was}} {{a haven for}} drug addicts, this being alluded to in Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh. In one scene, the character Begbie sees his alcoholic father living in the station. The macabre joke <b>is</b> that the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> all train-spotting, despite the fact of it being abandoned since the early 1970s. The {{title of the book}} comes from the comparison of trainspotting and heroin use, in that only those that do it can understand why they do. The large trainshed was subsequently demolished and all that remains is the terminal building and clock tower.|$|R
500|$|Lennon became {{convinced}} that the Maharishi, {{who said he was}} celibate, had made a pass at Farrow or was having relations with other young female students and later called the Maharishi a [...] "lecherous womaniser". [...] According to Mardas an American teacher named Rosalyn Bonas had told both him and Lennon that the Maharishi had made [...] "sexual advances" [...] towards her. However, Cynthia Lennon said she thought Mardas had put the [...] "young and impressionable" [...] girl up to it. Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. In addition, Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him, and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. At the same time, many of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia Lennon, Mardas' allegations about the Maharishi's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum [...] "without a single shred of evidence or justification." [...] Likewise McCartney said [...] "It was Magic Alex who made the original accusation and I think that it was completely untrue".|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{began to}} pick up small numbers of votes {{although}} not a declared candidate. [...] Hanna became convinced that McKinley was the only Ohioan who could gain the nomination, and by telegram hinted that Sherman should withdraw in the congressman's favor as the only Ohio Republican with a chance at the presidency. [...] Sherman, believing this to be his best chance for election, refused, a decision which Hanna accepted, fighting for Sherman to the end. [...] Hanna was greatly impressed by McKinley's loyal conduct in refusing to begin a run himself. [...] Foraker threw his support to Blaine, though he returned to Sherman when the New Englander did not run. [...] In the end, the nomination fell to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison. Hanna never forgave {{what he saw as}} Foraker's treason. [...] After 1888, there was a strong dislike between the two men, and the separation split the Ohio Republican Party into two factions, a rupture that did not heal until after Hanna's death in 1904. [...] Foraker stated in his memoirs that the break occurred because Hanna bribed black delegates from the South in 1888. [...] However, Ohio newspaper publisher J. B. Morrow contradicted Foraker's account, stating: [...] "I was at the convention in 1888 and know Senator Foraker [...] brought great scandal to the Ohio <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> and to the delegates with his secret work with Mr. Blaine's friends... Mr. Hanna became thoroughly angered at what he thought was Senator Foraker's bad faith." [...] According to Horner, Foraker was the more embittered of the two as the years passed, feeling that {{if it had not been}} for that dispute, Foraker, not McKinley, might have become president.|$|E

5000|$|According to Schur, {{the premise}} and {{idea was to}} include {{religious}} elements into the series after doing research on various faiths and groups, but he decided to scrap the plans, instead going for a concept that included all faiths that was diverse and free of religious views. [...] "I stopped doing research because I realized it’s about versions of ethical behavior, not religious salvation," [...] he says. [...] "The show isn't taking a side, the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> from every country and religion." [...] Schur {{also points out that}} the setting (shot in San Marino, California's Huntington Gardens) already had the feeling of a pastiche of different cultures, stating that the neighborhoods will feature <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> part of nondenominational and interdenominational backgrounds that interact with each other regardless of religion.|$|R

They are almost all English.|$|R
2500|$|The text of Henry's speech first {{appeared}} in print in Wirt's 1817 biography, published 18 years after Patrick Henry's death. Wirt corresponded with men who had heard the speech and others who were acquainted with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> at the time. All agreed that the speech had produced a profound effect, {{but it seems that}} only one person attempted to render an actual text. Judge St. George Tucker, who had been present for the speech, gave Wirt his recollections and Wirt wrote back stating that [...] "I have taken almost entirely Mr. Henry's speech in the Convention of '75 from you, as well as your description of its effect on your verbatim." [...] The original letter with Tucker's remembrances has been lost.|$|E
2500|$|Long ago, it {{must have}} been in the late 18th century, here in the church of Staničenje, all <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> and all present priests were killed, so after that the church was closed in the next 30 years. And it was like this: one year, just for Annunciation, in the time, when the priests {{organized}} a Divine Liturgy, in the church and the churchyard were many people. Suddenly, Kardzhali start attack to the church and churchyard, when began the most horrible killing and slaughering of people and priests. All people and priests were killed that day. Everything was plundered and the church was almost destroyed in that Kardzhali action. And today, when someone starts digging wherever in the churchyard, it revealed the human bones of killed people in that day on the Annunciation. Since then the church in Staničenje could not longer serve to its purpose until the 1829. In that time, church did not have a priest because they were often killed. In [...] that year, 1829. people in Staničenje get one priest and they ask landowner to allow them to recover back the church so it can serve the purpose. Landowner accommodate them under the condition that they must give him, in a name of church holiday which is 26th July, a sterile sheep every year. People of Staničenje recovered the church and it began to serve again to its purpose, and the landowner, since that year, received sterile sheep from the village every year.|$|E

He was conducted by a boy scout into a room {{on the second floor of}} the War Office, within a few minutes of his arrival. A tall, grey-haired man in the uniform of a general looked up and nodded with an air of intimacy as soon as the door had been closed.|$|E
60|$|That is the can-can. The {{idea of it}} is {{to dance}} as wildly, as noisily, as furiously as you can; expose {{yourself}} {{as much as possible}} if you are a woman; and kick as high as you can, no matter which sex you belong to. There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid, respectable, aged <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> that night can testify to the truth of that statement.

5000|$|In 1974-1978 Konkin {{appeared}} in several successful films, including Andrei Konchalovsky's A Lover's Romance, Boris Ivchenko's Marina, and Georgy Kalatozishvili's The Caucasian Story. Konkin has never {{served in the}} Army (due to poor health) but, somewhat ironically, played mostly the military men, invariably romantic, mild and intelligent. The part of Sharapov in Stanislav Govorukhin's The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed (1979) marked the peak of Vladimir Konkin's cinema career. [...] "The character of Sharapov hasn't lost its relevance. Regardless of whether we accept today's 'rules of the game', what we look for is straight honesty in those <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> to protect us," [...] Konkin asserted in a 2002 interview.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{speak in}} enigmas! Come {{back with me}} to the ballroom. Come and dance with me once more. You used to dance with me. Let us have one waltz more, Kew. And then, and then, {{in a day or two}} I shall go back to Monsieur le Duc, and tell him that his filleul is going to marry the fairest of all Englishwomen and to turn hermit in the country, and orator in the Chamber of Peers. You have wit! ah si--you have wit!" [...] And she led back Lord Kew, rather amazed himself at what he was doing, into the ballroom; so that the good-natured <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> and who beheld them dancing, could not refrain from {{clapping}} their hands at the sight of this couple.|$|E

[Sidenote: The folk warn Sir Launcelot] Now {{when the}} people of the town beheld that terrible blow they lifted up their voices in a great outcry, crying out: [...] "Turn back, Sir Knight! Turn back! For this is a very woful thing for thee that thou hast done!" [...] and some cried out: [...] "Thou hast killed the giants' warder of the bridge!" [...] And others cried: [...] "Thou art a dead man unless thou make haste away from this." [...] But to all this Sir Launcelot paid no heed, but wiped his sword and thrust it back into its sheath. Then he went forward upon his way across the bridge as though nothing had befallen, and so came to the farther side. Then, without paying any heed to all the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> he rode {{straight}} to the castle and into the gate of the castle and into the court-yard thereof.|$|E
60|$|I {{believe some}} races were rowed {{while we were}} eating and drinking, {{but we did not}} mind. We were not there for the races, but for the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> for the races; or who were {{apparently}} so. In the mean time, the multitude of them seemed to have increased, and where I had fancied that not one boat more could have been pressed in, half a dozen had found room. The feat must have been accomplished by main strength and awkwardness, as the old phrase is. It was no place indeed for skill to evince itself; but people pushed about in the most incredible way when they tried to move, though mostly they did not try; they let their boats lie still, and sway with the common movement when the water rose and sank, or fluctuated unseen beneath them. There were more and more people of the sort that there can never be enough of, such as young girls beautifully dressed in airy muslins and light silks, sheltered but not hidden by gay parasols floating above their summer hats. It was the fairy multitude of Harvard Class-Day in English terms, and though Henley never came at any moment to that prodigiously picturesque expression which Class-Day used to reach when all its youthful loveliness banked itself on the pine-plank gradines enclosing the Class-Day elm, and waited the struggle for its garlands, yet you felt at Henley somehow in the presence of inexhaustible numbers, drawing themselves from a society ultimately, if not immediately, vaster. It was rather dreadful perhaps to reflect that if all that brilliant expanse of fashion and beauty had been engulfed in the hidden Thames it could have been instantly replaced by as much more, not once but a score of times.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was only}} one person who {{remained}} unmoved. It was de Barral himself. He preserved his serene, gentle, expression, I am told (for I have not witnessed those scenes myself), and {{looked around at the}} people with an air of placid sufficiency which was the first hint {{to the world of the}} man's overweening, immeasurable conceit, hidden hitherto under a diffident manner. It could be seen too in his dogged assertion that if he had been given enough time and a lot more money everything would have come right. And there were some people (yes, amongst his very victims) who more than half believed him, even after the criminal prosecution which soon followed. When placed in the dock he lost his steadiness as if some sustaining illusion had gone to pieces within him suddenly. He ceased to be himself in manner completely, and even in disposition, in so far that his faded neutral eyes matching his discoloured hair so well, were discovered then to be capable of expressing a sort of underhand hate. He was at first defiant, then insolent, then broke down and burst into tears; but it might have been from rage. Then he calmed down, returned to his soft manner of speech and to that unassuming quiet bearing which had been usual with him even in his greatest days. But it seemed as though in this moment of change he had at last perceived what a power he had been; for he remarked to one of the prosecuting counsel who had assumed a lofty moral tone in questioning him, that--yes, he had gambled--he liked cards. But that only a year ago a host of smart people would have been only too pleased to take a hand at cards with him. Yes--he went on--some of the very <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> accommodated with seats on the bench; and turning upon the counsel, [...] "You yourself as well," [...] he cried. He could have had half the town at his rooms to fawn upon him if he had cared for that sort of thing. [...] "Why, now I think of it, it took me most of my time to keep people, just of your sort, off me," [...] he ended with a good humoured--quite unobtrusive, contempt, as though the fact had dawned upon him for the first time.|$|E
