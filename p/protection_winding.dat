Crucial {{for the development of}} the light-weight structures is the precise determination of the maximum loads.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>protection</b> of <b>wind</b> energy systems against the indirect effects of lightning.

Nevertheless, there are still very few studies in Portugal regarding lightning <b>protection</b> of <b>wind</b> energy systems using models of the Electro-Magnetic Transients Program (EMTP). Hence, a new case study is presented in this paper, based on a wind turbine with an interconnecting transformer, considering that lightning strikes the soil near the tower at a distance such that galvanic coupling occurs through the grounding electrode. Computer simulations obtained by using EMTP-RV are presented and conclusions are duly drawn. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the {{lightning}} <b>protection</b> of <b>wind</b> turbine blades in terms of on the layout and location of the down conductor system. Generally, the down conductors of a lightning <b>protection</b> system for <b>wind</b> turbine blades may be installed inside the blade or outside the blade. However, the internal down conductor approach has become a common practice for blade manufacturers. This is presumably due to the preference for the aerodynamic properties of the blades to be maintained. However, by having an internal down conductor, other problems occur (e. g. blade disintegration, burn due to the impact of lightning strikes). This paper discusses the possibility that an external down conductor might be more advantageous and concludes with some recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Wind {{power plants}} {{are one of}} the most crucial types of {{renewable}} energies which are increasingly employed in smart grids with purpose of power generation especially as a distribution generation system. Hence, the proper <b>protection</b> of <b>wind</b> plants is an enormously significant aspect which must be taken into consideration when designing the wind plants to not only provide a suitable protection for the power components but also maintain the power generation perpetually in case of fault. The most important and common protection systems are overcurrent relays which can protect the power systems from impending faults. In order to implement a successful and proper <b>protection</b> for <b>wind</b> power plants, these relays must be set accurately and well coordinated with each other to clear the fault at the system in the shortest possible time. This paper demonstrates how the coordination of overcurrent relays can be successfully achieved in wind power plants in order to maintain the power generation during fault and protect the power components...|$|R
