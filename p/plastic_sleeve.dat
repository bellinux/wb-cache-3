Two experimental studies were carried out to assess the extent of shearing displacement and damage to the sleeves. Various shear displacement tests were carried out. In the first test a sleeved cable was encapsulated in a plastic tube and single sheared up to 43 mm vertical displacement and the same procedure was repeated with the second sleeved cable being subjected to double shearing using a double shear testing Machine MKII. In both tests {{it was found that the}} corrugated <b>plastic</b> <b>sleeves</b> started to be sheared at a maximum displacement of greater than 20 mm, without damage, it was inferred that the corrugated sleeve can withstand shearing displacement without tearing up to maximum of 33 mm. The experimental procedure and the variation in the testing method are described...|$|R

Within the <b>plastic</b> <b>sleeves</b> Cohen Gan raised fish, as a symbol of cultural isolation and in an attempt to integrate essential principles into the landscape. Other projects were of a more sharply political nature. In “Activities in Refugee Camps in Jericho” (February 10, 1974), for example, Cohen Gan erected a tent in a refugee camp near Jericho. In “Touching the Border” (January 7, 1974) Cohen Gan placed demographic information about Israel on steel bars that he placed on four of the country’s borders, in places where security forces stopped him. These activities and others were displayed at an exhibition in the Israel Museum in 1974.|$|R

A variety of treatments could be applied to improve both their appearance and durability, such as clear plastic wrap. Many products have been available for the storage of vinyl albums, often clear <b>plastic</b> <b>sleeves.</b>|$|R
