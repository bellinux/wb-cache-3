5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} <b>phenomenology</b> and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term <b>phenomenology</b> has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics. <b>Phenomenology</b> is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. String <b>phenomenology</b> {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are <b>phenomenology</b> and existentialism. <b>Phenomenology,</b> founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on {{the contents of the}} human mind (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences. Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. See Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's <b>Phenomenology</b> of Perception, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.|$|E

5|$|<b>Phenomenology</b> is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, <b>phenomenology</b> has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, <b>phenomenology</b> largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the <b>phenomenology</b> used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
5|$|René Wellek (1903–1995) was an Austrian-born scholar {{from the}} structuralist Prague school of linguistics, {{studying}} under Vilém Mathesius. Wellek had training in classical literature and was fluent in several European languages, both Romance and Slavic. His theoretical training included the <b>phenomenology</b> of Edmund Husserl, {{as used in}} Roman Ingarden's work, and the psychologically influenced linguistics of Karl Bühler. After Nazi Germany occupied Prague in 1939, Wellek fled London– {{where he had been}} teaching– for the United States, teaching at the University of Iowa under Norman Foerster.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{commonly}} used quadratic Hebbian–anti-Hebbian rules lead to successful models of plasticity and learning, they are inconsistent with neurophysiology. Other rules, more physiologically plausible, fail {{to specify the}} biological mechanism of bidirectionality and the biological mechanism that prevents synapses from changing from excitatory to inhibitory, and vice versa. We developed a synaptic bidirectional Hebbian rule that does not suffer from these problems. This rule was compared with physiological homosynaptic conditions in the hippocampus, with the results indicating the consistency of this rule with long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) <b>phenomenologies.</b> The <b>phenomenologies</b> considered included the reversible dynamics of LTP and LTD {{and the effects of}} N-methyl-D-aspartate blockers and phosphatase inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} a phenomenological historiography of suffering with reference to Welsh as a non-state language. It argues that a phenomenologically informed historical methodology can help to support the preservation of worldwide socio-cultural diversity through its emphasis on multiple and multiplying structures of experience, as manifested in ontological, epistemological and ethical forms. The paper demonstrates how the historicity of translation in the Welsh context is directly mediated through asymmetrical <b>phenomenologies</b> of power. In drawing attention to the notions of asymmetrical <b>phenomenologies</b> of power, interpellation and suffering, the paper demonstrates the transformative role that translation can play in language survival, in acts of naming and in literary-poetic discourse. It suggests that the examination of translation histories involving a non-state language such as Welsh can provide a useful backdrop to the growing historiography on the epistemic violence of hegemonic frames of knowledge. Rather than explore how asymmetrical <b>phenomenologies</b> of power have played out in Welsh translation history through a strictly chronological approach, the paper examines this issue empirically, through specific instantiations of hegemonic practices and forms of resistance. Finally, it argues that a Welsh translation history should refrain from an apolitical attitude...|$|R

5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive <b>phenomenology,</b> which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed {{that the only way to}} comprehend a patient's experience is through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E
5|$|The reentry <b>phenomenology</b> was of {{interest}} {{both to the}} Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was {{a major part of}} ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power radar systems on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. Although the results remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm, {{where he}} married Greta Knutson, {{with whom he}} had a son, Christophe (born 1927). A former student of painter André Lhote, she was known for her {{interest}} in <b>phenomenology</b> and abstract art. Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos, a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris. The rigidly functionalist Maison Tristan Tzara, built in Montmartre, was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of African art. It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (<b>phenomenology,</b> existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E
5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as imperceptible. It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist <b>phenomenology.</b>|$|E
5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, <b>phenomenology</b> and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E
