2500|$|Dean's {{strategy}} used a post-Watergate model {{taken from}} the Republicans of the mid-seventies. Working at the local, state and national level, the GOP built the party from the ground up.

Dean traveled extensively throughout {{the country with the}} plan, including places like Utah, Mississippi, and Texas, states in which Republicans had dominated the political landscape. Many establishment Democrats were at least initially dubious about the strategy's worth—political consultant and former Bill Clinton advisor, <b>Paul</b> <b>Begala,</b> suggested that Dean's plan was [...] "just hiring a bunch of staff people to wander around Utah and Mississippi and pick their nose." [...] Further changes were made in attempting to make the stated platform of the Democratic Party more coherent and compact.
