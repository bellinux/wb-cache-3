Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The <b>photoreactivation</b> process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E

However, the LD 50 values obtained using a UVB lamp were much lower than those elicited by solar UVB radiation. As solar radiation includes intense visible light and UVA, we assumed that a <b>photoreactivation</b> mechanism would play a role to survive under solar radiation. We assessed the capacity for <b>photoreactivation</b> in T. urticae eggs and larvae, and found that the efficacy of <b>photoreactivation</b> was determined by the cumulative irradiance of visible light (VIS) after exposure to UVB radiation. The wavelength range effective for <b>photoreactivation</b> went from UVA to green. Next, we found that an increased time lag between UVB and VIS radiation reduced the <b>photoreactivation</b> efficacy in eggs. In contrast, a time lag ≤ 4  h did not affect that in larvae. We discussed the possibility that the timing of <b>photoreactivation</b> occurs related with phase-specific UVB vulnerability and outbreak symptoms due to UVB-induced DNA damage.

40|$|<b>Photoreactivation</b> of {{microorganisms}} following UV inactivation {{is a well-known}} but complex phenomenon. It {{is believed to be}} affected by several factors, including UV fluence (the effect may be diminished at higher fluences), wavelength, light intensity, and exposure time to photoreactivating light. The effect on <b>photoreactivation</b> of a combined peracetic acid (PAA) /UV process has not been investigated. Accordingly, the primary objective of the current study was to assess the degree of <b>photoreactivation,</b> under both sunlight and artificial lights, following UV and combined PAA/UV inactivation of fecal coliforms (FC). Results of the study indicate that average <b>photoreactivation</b> for UV-treated wastewater samples is 1. 2 logs, compared to 0. 1 logs for the combined PAA/UV treatment. Hence, the use of PAA in combination with UV can significantly reduce the potential for <b>photoreactivation.</b> With respect to photoreactivating light intensity, wastewater samples exposed for 3 hours to both low and high-intensity artificial lights as well as sunlight all resulted in similar <b>photoreactivation</b> levels. Additional experiments determined a threshold value of approximately 700 lux for photoreactivating light intensity, which allowed for a simple model relating <b>photoreactivation</b> with water depth to be developed from Lambert's Law. In addition, experimental results indicate that with respect to <b>photoreactivation,</b> there is no difference between UV fluences of 20 and 40 mJ/cm 2. Finally, in an attempt to recreate the unique <b>photoreactivation</b> conditions of the Montreal Wastewater Treatment Plant effluent (due to a 4 Km outfall tunnel), UV-treated samples were kept in the dark for 3 hours prior to photoreactivating light exposure.

Dependence of the reaction upon (a) wavelength, (b) dose, and (c) dose rate of the reactivating radiation, as well as upon (d) temperature during reactivation treatment, is very similar to that of photoprotection. We conclude that this <b>photoreactivation</b> is similar in mechanism to photoprotection, believed to be an indirect repair process, the initial step of which is non-enzymatic and leads to a growth-division delay. We therefore call the present phenomenon “indirect <b>photoreactivation.</b> ” Similar studies suggest that indirect <b>photoreactivation</b> of killing occurs also in the parent strain, E. coli B (Harm).

40|$|The larvae of most coral species {{spend some}} time in the plankton, {{floating}} just below the surface and hence exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The high levels of UVR are potentially stressful and damaging to DNA and other cellular components, such as proteins, reducing survivorship. Consequently, mechanisms to either shade (prevent) or repair damage potentially play an important role. In this study, the role of <b>photoreactivation</b> in the survival of coral planulae was examined. <b>Photoreactivation</b> is a light-stimulated response to UV-damaged DNA in which photolyase proteins repair damaged DNA. <b>Photoreactivation</b> rates, as well as the localization of photolyase, were explored in planulae under conditions where <b>photoreactivation</b> was or was not inhibited. The results indicate that <b>photoreactivation</b> is the main DNA repair pathway in coral planulae, repairing UV-induced DNA damage swiftly (K= 1. 75 h– 1 and a half-life of repair of 23 min), with no evidence of any light-independent DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER), at work. Photolyase mRNA was localized to both the ectoderm and endoderm of the larvae. The amount of cell death in the coral planulae increased significantly when <b>photoreactivation</b> was inhibited, by blocking photoreactivating light.

The extent of DNA synthesis resulting from transfer of F′ episomes from irradiated donors suggests that a complementary strand is formed on the damaged template. <b>Photoreactivation</b> behavior and sedimentation properties are used to deduce properties of such damaged episomes.

With the exception of S. typhimurium, which showed flattening and tailing, strong first-order relationships between the logarithm of survival and the ultraviolet dose were observed. While S. dysenteriae and S. typhimurium were found to undergo <b>photoreactivation</b> after ultraviolet exposure, the <b>photoreactivation</b> decreased significantly with higher ultraviolet doses.

Whereas <b>photoreactivation</b> and excision repair have been intensely studied during the last few years, recombination repair, its regulation, and its interrelationship with <b>photoreactivation</b> in response to UV-B-induced DNA damage is still poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed somatic homologous recombination in a transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying a β-glucuronidase gene as a recombination marker and in offsprings of crosses of this line with a photolyase deficient uvr 2 – 1 mutant. UV-B radiation stimulated recombination frequencies in a dose-dependent manner correlating linearly with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) levels.
