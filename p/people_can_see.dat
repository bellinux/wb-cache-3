Lady Pole, who is taken away into the fairyland of Lost-Hope every night, appears insane to those around her. She is hidden away, like the character type examined by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in their seminal book The Madwoman in the Attic (1979). Developing a [...] "divided consciousness", she is passive and quiet at home {{at the same time she}} is vengeful and murderous in the fairy land.|$|E

500|$|Although his co-stars Attwater and Kenny were axed {{from the}} cast in May 2010, Norwood {{revealed}} his contract had {{been extended to}} December 2010, saying that the producers saw [...] "some future in Fatboy".

An EastEnders insider is reported to have said [...] "Fatboy has been a real hit with viewers and the bosses have decided that it's now time to bring in his dad so <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> what Fatboy is really all about." [...] Norwood's contract was once again renewed in late 2013 for another year, by the new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who promised [...] "juicy storylines" [...] for the character. One source from the programme said [...] "Fatboy is a popular character and appeals to all ages. He's not had a decent storyline for a while but always provides much-needed humour in Albert Square.

500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." [...] Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: [...] "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]" [...] While Moore {{wanted to write about}} [...] "power politics" [...] and the [...] "worrying" [...] times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would [...] "switch off" [...] if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he [...] "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Knowles said that one of the hardest parts of the tour was [...] "squeezing a decade's worth of hits into a two-hour show" [...] and performing the songs in designer Thierry Mugler's [...] "elaborate" [...] costumes. She elaborated: [...] "I'm never gonna go onstage or do a video and not work until my feet are blistered, and until I'm basically, I can't walk any more. I always give, and I do that because I know how lucky I am, to do my job." [...] She also promised that the tour would be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience because of the [...] "real raw and more sensitive" [...] nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Knowles also expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, [...] "ruining" [...] some of the surprise of the concert experience and possibly convincing some fans not to attend. She went on saying: [...] "It's great because people can get a little sneak peek and say, 'Oh, I wanna come to the show,' or, 'I don't wanna go to that show'... and I'm fans of people so I go on there and check it out too. But you put so much of your heart and time into the wardrobe... it's kind of unfortunate that <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the show months before you get into their city, but that's life." [...] French designer Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the wardrobe and had a creative advisor role, as he also contributed to designing the whole show, from lighting to choreography, production and directing three sequences for the concert. As a creative advisor, Mugler stated about the show: ...|$|E
