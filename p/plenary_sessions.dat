5|$|The Central Committee {{was not a}} {{permanent}} institution. It convened <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions.</b> Seven CC <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions</b> and two <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions</b> held {{in conjunction with the}} convening of the Central Control Commission were held between the 16th Congress and the 17th Congress. When the CC was not in session, decision-making power was vested in the internal bodies of the CC itself; that is, the Politburo, Secretariat and Orgburo. None of these bodies were permanent either; typically they convened several times a month.|$|E

5|$|On 21 June 1958, the Parliamentary Assembly {{recommended}} to the Council that the Assembly should have its {{seat in the}} same place where the other organisations are based, although it accepted that <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions</b> could be held elsewhere. The Assembly also nominated three cities to be the seat of the institutions (Brussels, Strasbourg and Milan), however no permanent agreement was reached.|$|E

5|$|Speakers in the European Parliament are {{entitled}} to speak {{in any of the}} 24 official languages of the European Union, ranging from French and German to Maltese and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions,</b> and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-four languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament {{in the world and the}} biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full-time and 400 free-lancers when there is higher demand). Citizens may also address the Parliament in Basque, Catalan, Valencian and Galician.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{is based}} in three {{different}} cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions</b> be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only assembly {{in the world with}} more than one meeting place {{and one of the few}} that does not have the power to decide its own location.|$|E
5|$|The {{treaties}} of the European Union {{outline the}} locations of the following institutions: The European Parliament has its seat in Strasbourg, hosting twelve monthly <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions</b> (including budget session). Brussels hosts additional sessions and committees (including being used in September 2008 for normal sittings when the Strasbourg chamber was damaged). Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The Council of the European Union has its seat in Brussels, except during April, June, and October, when meetings are held in Luxembourg.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian Parliament publishes all its {{decisions}} in Narodne Novine, the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia. Article 90 {{of the constitution}} requires publication of all acts and other regulations in the gazette before they are legally binding. Narodne Novine is available through a paid subscription as print, or for free online. Parliamentary debates and other proceedings {{are the subject of}} news coverage by media of Croatia, and Saborska televizija was set up in 2007 in addition as an IPTV channel broadcasting all <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions</b> of the parliament. Finally, the Parliament's Public Relations Department publishes a news bulletin available to all institutions and citizens of Croatia through a print paid subscription, and online for free.|$|E
5|$|The Standing Committee is {{the highest}} body when the CCDI is not convened for a plenary session. Elected by the 1st Plenary Session of the CCDI, it {{requires}} approval from the 1st plenary session of the Central Committee to take office. The Standing Committee presents {{a report to the}} CCDI at every plenary session; the latter is the only national-level organisation, with the National People's Congress and the Central Committee, which holds at least one plenary session a year. CCDI <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions,</b> which discuss its past and future work, are usually held in January. The 18th Standing Committee has 19 members, one of whom (Huang Xiaowei) is a woman.|$|E
5|$|Despite the 1965 agreement, the Parliament's seat {{remained}} {{a source of}} contention. Wishing {{to be closer to}} the activities in Brussels and Luxembourg, a few <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions</b> were held by the Parliament between 1967 and 1981 in Luxembourg instead of Strasbourg—against the wishes of France—and in 1981 it returned to holding sessions entirely in Strasbourg. In the previous year it unsuccessfully issued an ultimatum to the national governments, attempting to force them to reach an agreement. Thus, the Parliament moved some of its decision-making bodies to Brussels, along with its committee and political group meetings, and in 1985 it also built a plenary chamber in Brussels for some part-sessions. All the Parliament's attempts in this field were challenged by member states.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{its great}} {{relevance}} in advancing Deng Xiaoping's ideas and leadership, during the Third <b>Plenary</b> <b>Session</b> no critical or substantial reshuffle occurred, {{as opposed to}} the Sixth <b>Plenary</b> <b>Session</b> held in 1981 when Hua Guofeng was removed from his posts. Important additions were made, however.|$|R
50|$|After the Constitutional Amendment of 2001 the <b>Plenary</b> <b>Session</b> (and not the Chambers) is {{the only}} {{competent}} to judge the constitutionality of laws. The <b>Plenary</b> <b>Session</b> is, also, competent: a) for cases of general interest that the President introduces directly into it, b) for cases {{that one of the}} Chambers submits to it. These cases are submitted by the Chambers to the <b>Plenary</b> <b>Session</b> for two reasons: either because they are cases of general interest or because the applicable legislative provision is judged unconstitutional.|$|R

25|$|A special Financial Committee {{is elected}} at each General Assembly to audit {{the budget and}} {{finances}} of the Federation. Other legislative proceedings at the meetings include adoption of reports from the Executive Board members, IFMSA Officials and IFMSA projects, and adoption of official IFMSA Policy Statements. Guidelines on which areas IFMSA should focus on and other important decisions {{for the future of}} the Federation are prepared by the Presidents of the National Member Organizations together with the Executive Board and brought for approval to the <b>Plenary</b> <b>Sessions.</b>|$|E
25|$|The General Assembly {{remains the}} highest {{decision}} making {{body of the}} Federation although the actual program of the meeting has developed into a mixture of training, planning and evaluation sessions in between the legislative <b>Plenary</b> <b>Sessions.</b> The work in the Standing Committees of IFMSA is the essence for most delegates: signing contracts, presenting and planning projects are all in a day's work for the National Officers from the participating organizations. An extensive Training and Resource Development component has been integrated in the program, providing the participants with new skills needed in their work, but seldom found in the regular University curriculum: Lobbying Skills, Group Dynamics and Strategic Planning to name a few.|$|E

The IMF and the World Bank thanked the country for hosting the annual meetings, Mr De Rato mentioned that he had seems thousands of smiles from the Four Million Smiles campaign. He praised Singapore for not only being a city of enterprising people but also a city that makes strangers feel like friends.|$|E
25|$|The 6,000 {{were drawn}} from the 10 tribes (each tribe was {{offering}} 600 members) and they were then divided into chambers of 600 jurymen, 500 or 501 of whom were regular members, with the rest constituting alternate jurors. In exceptional cases the court could go into <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions.</b> Sometimes, the chambers had 201 to 401 members or 1001 to 1501 members. After the selection by lot, the heliasts {{had to take the}} Heliastic Oath once every year. After the swearing-in, the jurors received one box-wood ticket, with their own names and that of their father and deme written on it, and one letter of the alphabet as far as kappa and the jurors of each tribe were divided into ten sections, approximately an equal number under each letter.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{serves as}} de facto {{capital of the}} European Union, hosting the major {{political}} institutions of the Union. The EU has not declared a capital formally, though the Treaty of Amsterdam formally gives Brussels {{the seat of the}} European Commission (the executive branch of government) and the Council of the European Union (a legislative institution made up from executives of member states). It locates the formal seat of European Parliament in the French city of Strasbourg, where votes take place, with the Council, on the proposals made by the Commission. However, meetings of political groups and committee groups are formally given to Brussels, along with a set number of <b>plenary</b> <b>sessions.</b> Three quarters of Parliament sessions now take place at its Brussels hemicycle. Between 2002 and 2004, the European Council also fixed its seat in the city. In 2014, the Union hosted a G7 summit in the city.|$|E
