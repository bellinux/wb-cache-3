5|$|For {{the first}} four seasons, {{prospect}} UFC fighters from two different weight categories were selected to compete. The fighters are divided into two teams, irrespective of weight class, with each team coached by a current UFC headliner. The teams then compete (in a manner which varies by season) with the loser being eliminated from the competition. Often, incentives are provided for the team of a winning fighter. This can include the right for their team to select the next matchup, in order to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> fighters from the opposing team by selecting favourable matchups.|$|E
5|$|When eating snails, this rail will hammer at {{the shells}} to extract them. For berries, it will jump high {{to break off}} {{clusters}} of this fruit. After doing this, it will <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> the berries {{one by one and}} eat them. It uses its partially open bill to probe and move aside debris like leaf litter. It is generally wary and secretive, and selfish when mated. This manifests in warning its partner with threat displays to keep it at a distance. Even so, it has occasionally been seen to openly forage in short grass near thickets and in streams or muddy tracks.|$|E
5|$|Mallards of {{all ages}} (but {{especially}} young ones) and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large fish, felids, and canids, including domesticated ones. The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (which most often <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, i.e. peregrine falcons, Aquila eagles, or Haliaeetus eagles. In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers and short-eared owls (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald and golden eagles, and about a dozen species of mammalian predator, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.|$|E

5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not {{come into contact with}} the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, Frank is shot by Lucas Goodwin, in an {{assassination}} attempt, and {{falls into a}} coma. While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines {{going to the hospital}} in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill {{for the sole purpose of}} creating an atmosphere divisive enough to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working behind the scenes to undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public sympathy from Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates.|$|E

5|$|The Viet Cong {{were able}} to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> one South Vietnamese paratrooper after another, some as they descended and others when their parachutes became stuck in the trees. Those paratroopers who reached the ground and survived tried to move forward, but the Viet Cong {{soldiers}} in defilade position fired on the paratroopers exposed in the open rice paddies. Undeterred, the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion launched small-unit attacks, but on each occasion they were repelled, and sporadic fighting continued until sundown. By {{the end of the}} day, the airborne battalion had lost 19 soldiers killed in action and another 33 wounded. American advisers Captain Fletcher Ware and Sergeant Russell Kopti, who had parachuted in with the South Vietnamese, were also wounded. As night fell, Hoang knew that South Vietnamese forces were closing in from three directions. The eastern flank remained open, and he ordered both elements of the 261st and 514th Battalions, exhausted and low on ammunition, to assemble {{at the south end of}} Ap Tan Thoi. They evacuated through the rice fields, taking their dead and wounded comrades.|$|E
5|$|The {{marines are}} {{overwhelmed}} by the aliens. Scaling cliffs and navigating destroyed buildings, Gordon reaches safety underground. The marines pull out of Black Mesa and begin airstrikes. Gordon goes through underground water channels as aliens <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> the remaining marines. He arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists developed the teleportation technology that allowed travel to Xen. The remaining staff tell Gordon that the satellite failed to reverse {{the effects of the}} resonance cascade as an immensely powerful being {{on the other side of}} the rift is keeping it open. The scientists activate the teleporter to send Gordon to Xen and stop the being. In Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers before him and defeats Gonarch, the huge egg-laying headcrab. At a factory creating alien soldiers, he defeats levitating creatures and enters a giant portal. In a vast cave, Gordon confronts the Nihilanth, the entity maintaining the rift, and destroys it.|$|E
5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E

Rich Gannon had three touchdowns while Drew Bledsoe had two scores but was <b>picked</b> <b>off</b> three times; Phillip Buchanon <b>picked</b> <b>off</b> Bledsoe at the Raiders 19-yard line and scored.|$|R
50|$|Jerry Garvin of the Toronto Blue Jays {{successfully}} <b>picked</b> <b>off</b> 23 {{runners in}} 1977, the single-season MLB record. Garvin (1977, vs Oakland) shares the single game record with Bill Wight (1956, for Baltimore vs the New York Yankees), each having <b>picked</b> <b>off</b> four opposing baserunners. The all-time record holder is Steve Carlton, who had 146 pickoffs during his career.|$|R
25|$|The {{defining}} drive {{came with}} two minutes left, trailing by two points. On a fourth-and-15, Robinson threw a 20-yard strike to tight end Isaac Smolko. Five plays later, Robinson would lob a 36-yard pass out to Derrick Williams who caught the ball, ducked {{to avoid a}} defender, and dashed into the end zone. Anwar Phillips would <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> Northwestern's Brett Basanez to seal the win.|$|E
25|$|After Germany {{declared}} war on the United States on 11 December 1941, German U-boats quickly became a deadly threat on the East Coast. The United States Navy was ill-prepared to defend against submarine warfare, and U-boats found it easy to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> commercial shipping vessels, which traveled unescorted. The onslaught began with Operation Drumbeat when 35 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats off the American coast in January 1942.|$|E
25|$|With Dickon's information, the outlaws finally attack D'Eyncourt Castle during winter. Alan leads Dickon and a {{group of}} outlaws to {{infiltrate}} and capture the castle keep. Taking up positions on its battlements, they <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> D'Eyncourt's defenders with their arrows while Robin launches the main assault on the outer walls. His combined force of outlaws and serfs eventually breaks through and razes the castle. Dickon kills his former bailiff, while Little John kills Sir Rolf.|$|E

On 15 June 1918, he teamed with Antonio Riva to down a Hansa-Brandenburg C.I. Also in June, Mecozzi was noted as {{changing}} his aircraft's insignia from a question mark on a black ball to two blue bands around the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} tactics. Dippers forage {{underwater}} in fast-moving streams. Common grackles {{have been observed}} to follow farmers’ plows to glean the grubs exposed in the fresh soil. Similarly, {{on the island of}} Borneo, the Bornean ground-cuckoo will follow wild pigs and sun bears as they turn up soil while foraging in the forest. Brewer's blackbirds are often seen in parking lots, where they <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> dead insects from car grilles. Some hummingbirds are known to take prey items from spiderwebs.|$|E
25|$|Minkhaung {{was totally}} heartbroken by his eldest son's death. He {{recalled}} Thihathu from Prome, and appointed him heir apparent. The war went on languidly {{for two more}} campaigns. In 1416–1417, Razadarit tried to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> Toungoo (Taungoo) but it was defeated. In the following dry season, Minkhaung ordered a retaliatory invasion. Ava forces led by Thihathu took the delta, and again forced Razadarit to move to Martaban. They remained in the south for nearly a year. But they could not break through towards Pegu, and had to retreat.|$|E

25|$|At Fort Necessity, the {{provision}} hut was depleted, {{and there was}} little shelter from the heavy rain that started to fall on the 2nd. With the rain, the trenches that Washington had ordered to be dug had turned into streams. Washington realized {{that he would have}} to defend against a frontal assault and also realized that it would be difficult because the woods were less than 100 yards away, within musket range, making it possible for a besieging attacker to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> the defenders. To improve the defense, Washington ordered his men to cut trees down and to make them into makeshift breastworks.|$|E
25|$|With {{religious}} approval granted, Saudi forces launched frontal {{assaults on}} {{three of the}} main gates. Again the assaulting force was repulsed as {{they were unable to}} break through the insurgents' defenses. Snipers continued to <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> soldiers who revealed themselves. The insurgents aired their demands from the mosque's loudspeakers throughout the streets of Mecca, calling for the cut-off of oil exports to the United States and the expulsion of all foreign civilian and military experts from the Arabian Peninsula. In Beirut an opposition organization (the Arab Socialist Action Party – Arabian Peninsula) issued a statement on 25 November, alleging to clarify the demands of the insurgents. The party, however, denied any involvement in the seizure of the Grand Mosque.|$|E
25|$|Counter-intuitively, {{the best}} {{approach}} for a fast bowler is not to bowl constantly at the wicket as such predictability allows the batsman to simply defend his or her wicket and <b>pick</b> <b>off</b> the occasional bad ball. A far more effective approach is to introduce variation of line and length, leaving the batsman unsure as to whether to attack, defend or leave. The majority of balls in a well-bowled spell will usually be swinging or seaming balls that pass at waist height, just outside the off stump and {{move away from the}} batsman because this is the area where it is most difficult for the batsman to choose the most appropriate response. Common variations and their tactical application are discussed below.|$|E
