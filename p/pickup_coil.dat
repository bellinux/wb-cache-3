2500|$|Applying such a pulse {{to a set}} {{of nuclear}} spins {{simultaneously}} excites all the single-quantum NMR transitions. In terms of the net magnetization vector, this corresponds to tilting the magnetization vector away from its equilibrium position (aligned along the external magnetic field). The out-of-equilibrium magnetization vector precesses about the external magnetic field vector at the NMR frequency of the spins. This oscillating magnetization vector induces a current in a nearby <b>pickup</b> <b>coil,</b> creating an electrical signal oscillating at the NMR frequency. This signal is known as the free induction decay (FID), and it contains the vector sum of the NMR responses from all the excited spins. In order to obtain the frequency-domain NMR spectrum (NMR absorption intensity vs. NMR frequency) this time-domain signal (intensity vs. time) must be Fourier transformed. Fortunately the development of Fourier Transform NMR coincided with the development of digital computers and the digital Fast Fourier Transform. Fourier methods can be applied to many types of spectroscopy. (See the full article on Fourier transform spectroscopy.) ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{vibrating}} sample magnetometer or VSM is {{a scientific}} instrument that measures magnetic properties. Simon Foner at MIT Lincoln Laboratory invented VSM in 1955 and reported it in 1959. A sample is first magnetized in a uniform magnetic field. It is then sinusoidally vibrated, typically {{through the use of}} a piezoelectric material. Commercial systems use linear actuators of some form. Historically these systems were developed using modified audio speakers, though this approach was dropped due to the interference through the produced in-phase magnetic noise, as the magnetic flux through a nearby <b>pickup</b> <b>coil</b> varies sinusoidally. The induced voltage in the <b>pickup</b> <b>coil</b> is proportional to the sample's magnetic moment, but does not depend on the strength of the applied magnetic field. In a typical setup, the induced voltage is measured with a lock-in amplifier using the piezoelectric signal as a frequency reference. It is also possible to record the hysteresis curve of a material by sweeping the magnetic field.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pickup</b> <b>coil</b> in {{a hearing}} aid {{is known as a}} {{telecoil}} (or T-coil) because its early form was to pick up a magnetic field from coils within a telephone.

5000|$|The device {{works by}} {{hysteresis}} of the magnetization {{in the iron}} wires. [...] The permanent magnets are arranged to create two opposite magnetic fields each directed toward (or away) {{from the center of}} the coils in opposite directions along the wire. This functions to magnetize the iron band along its axis, first in one direction as it approaches the center of the coils, then reverse its magnetism to the opposite direction as it leaves from the other side of the coil. [...] Due to the hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron, a certain threshold magnetic field (the coercive field, Hc) is required to reverse the magnetization. So the magnetization in the moving wires does not reverse in the center of the device where the field reverses, but some way toward the departing side of the wires, when the field of the second magnet reaches Hc. [...] Although the wire itself is moving through the coil, in the absence of a radio signal the location where the magnetization [...] "flips" [...] is stationary with respect to the <b>pickup</b> <b>coil,</b> so there is no flux change and no voltage is induced in the <b>pickup</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} program are to develop and evaluate electromagnetic sensor arrays for use in NDE and robotics.

The previously reported wire-wound coil sensor [2], consisting of a drive coil and several smaller <b>pickup</b> <b>coils,</b> uses a technology that is not well suited for constructing an array.

50|$|VSM (vibrating sample magnetometers) {{detect the}} {{magnetization}} {{of a sample}} by mechanically vibrating the sample inside of an inductive <b>pickup</b> <b>coil</b> or inside of a SQUID coil.

Typically the VSM technique is about {{an order of magnitude}} less sensitive than SQUID magnetometry. VSMs can be combined with SQUIDs to create a system that is more sensitive than either one alone. Heat due to the sample vibration can limit the base temperature of a VSM, typically to 2 Kelvin. VSM is also impractical for measuring a fragile sample that is sensitive to rapid acceleration.|$|E

50|$|A humbucking pickup, {{shown in}} {{the image on the}} right, is {{composed}} of two coils. Each coil is wound reverse to one another. However, the six magnetic poles are opposite in polarity in each winding. Since ambient hum from power-supply transformers, radio frequencies, or electrical devices reaches the coils as common-mode noise, it induces an equal voltage in each coil. Because the windings are reversed in each <b>pickup</b> <b>coil,</b> the induced voltages cancel each other out. However, the signal from the guitar string is doubled, due to the phase reversal caused by the out of phase magnets. The magnets being out of phase in conjunction with the coil windings being out of phase put the guitar string signal from each pickup in phase with one another. Therefore, the voltage of the signal is approximately doubled, if the two coils are connected in series.|$|E

50|$|Inductive pickup coils (also {{referred}} as inductive sensor) measure the magnetization by detecting the current induced in a coil {{due to the}} changing magnetic moment of the sample. The sample’s magnetization can be changed by applying a small ac magnetic field (or a rapidly changing dc field), as occurs in capacitor-driven pulsed magnets. These measurements require differentiating between the magnetic field produced by the sample and that from the external applied field. Often a special arrangement of cancellation coils is used. For example, half of the <b>pickup</b> <b>coil</b> is wound in one direction, {{and the other half}} in the other direction, and the sample is placed in only one half. The external uniform magnetic field is detected by both halves of the coil, and since they are counter-wound, the external magnetic field produces no net signal.|$|E
