50|$|Blastomycosis manifests as {{a primary}} lung {{infection}} in about 70% of cases. The onset is relatively slow and symptoms are suggestive of pneumonia, often leading to initial treatment with antibacterials. Occasionally, if a lesion is seen on X-ray in a cigarette smoker, the disease may be misdiagnosed as carcinoma, leading to swift excision of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobe</b> involved. Upper lung lobes are involved somewhat more frequently than lower lobes. If untreated, many cases progress {{over a period of}} months to years to become disseminated blastomycosis. In these cases, the large Blastomyces yeast cells translocate from the lungs and are trapped in capillary beds elsewhere in the body, where they cause lesions. The skin is the most common organ affected, being the site of lesions in approximately 60% of cases. The signature image of blastomycosis in textbooks is the indolent, verrucous or ulcerated dermal lesion seen in disseminated disease. Osteomyelitis is also common (12-60% of cases). Other recurring sites of dissemination are the genitourinary tract (kidney, prostate, epididymis; collectively ca. 25% of cases) and the brain (3-10% of cases).|$|E
5000|$|In human anatomy, an azygos lobe is a {{congenital}} {{variation of}} the upper lobe of the right lung.It is seen in 1% of the population. Embryologically, it arises from an anomalous lateral course of the azygos vein http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/156/5/931 http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/182/5/1139?ijkey=f810fd0909cbafb8976dd77eabd9657a3ff2fe3b&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha in a pleural septum within the apical segment of the right upper lobe or in other words an azygos lobe is formed when the right posterior cardinal vein, one of the precursors of the azygos vein, fails to migrate over {{the apex of the}} lung and penetrates it instead, carrying along two pleural layers that invaginates into the upper portion of the right upper lobe [...] As it has no bronchi, veins and arteries of its own or corresponding alteration in the segmental architecture of the lung, so it is not a true (misnomer), or even accessory, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobe,</b> but rather an anatomically separated part of the upper lobe. It is usually an incidental finding on chest x-ray or computed tomography and is as such not associated with any morbidity but can cause technical problems in thoracoscopic procedures http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119950409/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0.|$|E
50|$|VATS {{lobectomy}} is {{the same}} as lobectomy performed via thoracotomy in that the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and bronchus to the involved <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobe</b> are individually dissected, ligated and divided. Generally, endoscopic stapling devices are used to ligate and divide the vessels and the bronchus however conventional suture material can also be used. During VATS lobectomy, the structures being operated on are not directly visualized with the naked eye but are visualized solely with a rigid thoracoscope. A camera attached to the thoracoscope transmits the image to a video screen, which allows surgeons and assistants to observe the flow of the operation. Surgical specimens are placed into a water-tight bag and removed from the chest without morcellization (i.e. breaking up the specimen into small pieces before removal); this prevents seeding of the VATS incisions with tumor cells and allows for an intact specimen for pathology examination and cancer staging. Removal of lymph nodes from the mediastinum is not compromised by VATS and remains a cornerstone of the surgical therapy of lung cancer. Visualization is enhanced due to the magnification afforded by the fiberoptic thoracoscope and a 30-degree angle of visualization aids in looking around corners. However, because the incisions are too small to allow passage of the surgeon's hands into the thorax, the surgeon's tactile input is compromised. VATS operations rely on a thorough understanding of pulmonary anatomy to allow for strategically placed incisions (usually 3-5 incisions total). The main advantages of VATS over thoracotomy are that major muscles of the chest wall are not divided and rib spreaders that can lead to rib fractures or costovertebral joint pain are not used. This results in a hospital length of stay after VATS lobectomy generally reported to range from 3-5 days, or roughly half that for lobectomy via thoracotomy.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{segmentation}} {{of structures}} with missing or invisible borders is a challenging task. Since {{structures in the}} lungs are related, humans use contextual and shape information to infer the position of invisible borders. An example of a task in which the borders are often incomplete or invisible is the segmentation of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobes.</b> In this paper, a fully automatic segmentation of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobes</b> in chest CT scans is presented. The method is especially designed to be robust to incomplete fissures by incorporating contextual information from automatic lung, fissure, and bronchial tree segmentations, as well as shape information. Since the method relies on the result of automatic segmentations, {{it is important that}} the method is robust against failure of one or more of these segmentation methods. In an extensive experiment on 10 chest CT scans with manual segmentations, the robustness of the method to incomplete fissures and missing input segmentations is shown. In a second experiment on 100 chest CT scans with incomplete fissures, the method is shown to perform well. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Crenosoma vulpis and Eucoleus aerophilus are {{nematode}} parasites {{that can}} cause verminous pneumonia in wild carnivores. There is a paucity of information regarding the distribution of parasites in the lungs {{and the relationship between}} histopathological and parasitological diagnoses in naturally infected foxes. The objectives of this study were: first, to study the lobar and airway distribution of C. vulpis and E. aerophilus in wild red foxes and second, to investigate the relationship between fecal and histopathological diagnoses. Samples from 6 sites of the lung and fecal contents were obtained from 51 wild foxes in Prince Edward Island. By fecal examination, 78. 4 % of wild foxes tested positive for C. vulpis and 68. 6 % for E. aerophilus. In contrast, 66. 6 % and 49 % of foxes had histopathological evidence of C. vulpis and E. aerophilus in the lungs, respectively. Anatomically, C. vulpis was observed in the small bronchi and bronchioles of all <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobes</b> whereas E. aerophilus was restricted to the large bronchi and the caudal lobes. Affected airways exhibited severe epithelial glandular hyperplasia and bronchiolar mucous metaplasia. It was concluded that C. vulpis is widely distributed in airways of all <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobes,</b> whereas E. aerophilus is mainly restricted to the bronchi of caudal lobes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} an endobronchial blocker (EBB) and to perform selective ventilation during <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobe</b> resection via thoracotomy in a dog and report its accidental stapling in the resection site. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical case report. ANIMAL: One female dog with a suspected abscess or neoplasia of the right caudal <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lobe.</b> METHODS: One-lung ventilation was performed using a wire-guided EBB to seal the contaminated parenchyma and facilitate surgical access. The affected lung parenchyma was resected and the resection site was closed with staples. RESULTS: Lobar resection was performed successfully, but the loop of the EBB guide wire was inadvertently entrapped in the staple line of the lobectomy. Staples were removed to release the wire loop, and the resulting air leak caused loss of ventilation control until the parenchyma was re-sealed. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend removing the wire guide associate with the EBB after successful lung separation to avoid accidents that could have life-threatening consequences if not recognized. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: One-lung ventilation is useful to isolate healthy parenchyma from diseased parenchyma during lobectomy.
