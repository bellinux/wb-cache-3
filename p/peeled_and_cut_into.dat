40|$|Optimization of {{plantain}} {{drying process}} parameters to obtained {{high quality product}} is very vital as improper drying conditions can affect {{the composition of the}} plantain flour and thereby increases the risk of running into deterioration of the nutrient contents of the product and loss. Matured unripe plantains were processed by washing, <b>peeling</b> <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> required size. The samples obtained were analysed in triplicate using different drying oven temperatures (60, 70 and 80 oC) and time (187, 242, and 311 minutes) at pulp size of 3 mm by employing Design of experiment (DOE). Statistical analysis and response surface methodology based on the D-Optimal were carried out. The significant factors on the experimental design response were identified from the analysis of variance. The optimum conditions for the processing of unripe plantain into dry product were obtained by using temperature of 80 oC, time of 187 minutes and pulp size of 3 mm which resulted in final carbohydrate content of 87. 4 %. From these results obtained, the use of response surface methodology in optimizing plantain drying process can be recommended...|$|R

40|$|Summary The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential of turnip extract and xanthan gum in the conservation of minimally processed apples. The apples were washed, sanitized with sodium hypochlorite (200 ppm) for 15 minutes, <b>peeled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> eight pieces prior to being subjected to one of the following treatments in aqueous solution: A – water (control); B – turnip extract; C – turnip extract and CaCl 2; D – xanthan gum, CaCl 2 and glycerol; E – turnip extract, xanthan gum, CaCl 2, and glycerol. Subsequently, the freshly cut apples were dried under ventilation on nylon screens to ensure drying of the coatings, and then packed in polystyrene trays, covered with polyvinylchloride films and stored at 4 ± 1 ° C for 13 days. The following parameters were evaluated: mass loss, firmness, colouration, pH value, soluble solids, and peroxidase/polyphenoloxidase activities. The edible coatings were found to be ineffective with respect to controlling mass loss, but the minimally processed apples coated with turnip extract maintained their initial levels of colouration, firmness and pH value. A considerable increase in peroxidase activity was registered for apples treated with turnip extract, suggesting that this effect may also be responsible for the reduction in browning. No advantage could be observed for the simultaneous presence of turnip extract and xanthan gum or calcium chloride. The turnip extract may represent an interesting alternative for applications to minimally processed apples, especially as it is a natural product, easily obtained, cost effective and contributes to the nutritional quality (e. g. as a source of calcium ions) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the performance of four Kenyan potato cultivars in terms of texture, color and sensory properties when crisps are processed at different slice thickness and frying temperatures. Potato tubers were <b>peeled,</b> washed <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> slices of thickness 1. 0 mm, 1. 5 and 2. 0 mm. Each size was fried at a constant temperature of 170 C for 2 - 5 min. For frying temperature evaluation, the potatoes for all cultivars were <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> a uniform thickness of 1. 5 mm and fried at temperatures of 160, 170 and 180 C for 2 - 5 min. There was no significant (p> 0. 05) variation in crisps texture among the four cultivars at different frying temperatures. Texture significantly (p= 0. 05) increased with increase in frying temperature and slice thickness. Potato cultivar and slice thickness significantly (p= 0. 05) influenced the lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) color parameters. Redness and yellowness parameters significantly (p= 0. 05) decreased with increase in frying temperature. Potato cultivar significantly (p= 0. 05) influenced sensory scores on crisps color, flavor, texture and overall acceptability. Notably, frying temperature did not significantly (p> 0. 05) affect sensory scores. Color scores significantly (p= 0. 05) decreased with increasing slice thickness. The effects of variety, frying temperature and slice thickness on potato crisps quality are apparent and hence the need for crisps processors to properly select not only the cultivars but also the critical processing parameters...|$|R

Half of the kiwifruit samples were soaked for one hour in a 33 % maltodextrin solution, then placed into plastic bags and frozen and the other half (unsoaked) were simply frozen. The two set of samples were subjected to three frying processes and all at 2. 3 kPa vacuum, after which the kiwifruit was removed from the fryer and centrifuged in cheese cloth for four minutes to remove excess surface oil. Generally, the vacuum fried gold kiwifruit samples from the 80 °C for 50 minutes process gave higher moisture content and lower oil content followed by the samples from the 90 °C for 35 minutes process and then the 100 °C for 25 minutes process. The vacuum fried samples from the 100 °C for 25 minutes process gave consistently higher total colour change and browning index, followed by the 90 °C for 35 minutes process and then the 80 °C for 50 minutes process. The unsoaked sample from the 80 °C for 50 minutes process gave significantly lower breaking force than the sample from the 100 °C for 25 minutes process. There was no significant difference in the breaking force of all vacuum fried soaked samples.

40|$|Introduction: Carrot is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used vegetable for human nutrition and is an excellent source of β-carotene, vitamin A and potassium, and contains cholesterol-lowering pectin, vitamin C, vitamin B 6, thiamine, folic acid, and magnesium. Carrots are highly seasonal and abundantly available at particular times of the year. For extending the availability of this root, several preservation processes can be used, but convective drying {{is one of the most}} important since it not only extends vegetable shelf life significantly but also diversifies the offer of foods for consumers. However, convective drying can also give rise to significant chemical changes (non-enzymatic browning, among others), which may affect the quality of the product. Pre-drying treatments of solid food products can be used as a way to augment product quality and to modify the structure of food products so as to improve mass transfer coefficients in drying. In this context, assessments of the physical and chemical properties were made in order to investigate the effects of sodium metabisulphite at different concentration/time combinations prior convective drying of carrots. Materials and methods: The carrots used in this study were purchased in a local market, and hand <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> slices with thickness of 10 mm. Before convective drying at 60 ºC the slices of carrots were submitted to pre-treatments as follows: a) dipping in a water solution of 0. 25 % of sodium metabisulphite for 60 and 90 min. and 1 % of sodium metabisulphite for the same times, at room temperature; b) dipping in an equal mass of plain water for 60 and 90 min at room temperature (as control sample). Some chemical properties of the fresh and dried samples were evaluated, namely moisture content, fibre, ashes and sugars (reducing, total and non-reducing sugars). The physical properties evaluated were color and texture. Results: The main results show that the different combinations concentration/time of sodium metbishulphite dipping have a similar effect on the chemical properties of the dried carrots. Furthermore, the dried slices of carrots with and without pre-treatment originated products with similar nutritional characteristics. With respect of colour, the total difference of colour and browning index was similar to the different solutions of sodium metabishulphite. In addition the browning of the dried carrots was, apparently, independent of the pre-treatment. Similarly, the different combinations of pre-treatment had no visible effect on textural parameters and generally the hardness decreased with the pre-treatments. Conclusions: From the obtained results it was concluded that the different concentration/time combinations of sodium metabisulphite solutions had no visible improvement on the quality of the dried carrots...|$|E
