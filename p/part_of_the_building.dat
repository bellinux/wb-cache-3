5|$|Christchurch, Turnham Green is {{an early}} Victorian Gothic {{building}} of flint with stone dressings. The main <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> by George Gilbert Scott and W. B. Moffat, is from 1843; the chancel and northeast chapel were added in 1887 by J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the National Museum was {{transferred}} from Palazzo Xara to Auberge d'Italie. The museum {{was directed by}} Sir Themistocles Zammit, and it was divided into archaeology, history, arts, natural history and mineralogical sections. The museum closed down during World War II, and the building received two direct hits on 7 April 1942. Part of the façade was destroyed by aerial bombardment, and the natural history collection suffered severe damage since it was located in the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> which was hit. After the war ended, the damaged parts of the auberge were reconstructed, the museum was reopened and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> housed a school of art.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> is a {{distinctive}} conical shape with a spiral walkway and large atrium inside, {{similar to the}} Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Galleries lead off the walkway, mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education.|$|E

5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of the main <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> also burned through and collapsed. Despite {{the fact that there}} were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
5|$|St. John's Orphanage {{is located}} in the {{southern}} suburbs of Goulburn, a town in New South Wales. According to the Goulburn Evening Penny Post, the orphanage looks over one of the finest views of the town. The main front <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> faces north, and the entrance gates are located on Mundy Street. The southern side of the lot connects off Combermere Street. The total size of the lot is 24,000 square metres (2.4 hectares or 5.9 acres).|$|E
5|$|The city of San Francisco {{notified}} the Mallochs {{that they were}} in violation of a building code prohibiting more than three floors above a garage, because the building contained four floors of apartments above the garage. The Mallochs successfully argued that their structure stepped back in progression up the slope of Telegraph Hill so that the top floor was not directly above the garage. No <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was in violation of the code.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> was {{completed}} in 1989 and RWB staff had started occupying completed <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in 1988.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{bell tower}} and <b>the</b> chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary are <b>the</b> oldest <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> choir has a rib vault, {{strengthened}} by liernes in the nave and the aisles.|$|R

5|$|The kitchen {{block was}} {{added in the}} late 15th century or early 16th century and has no direct {{connection}} {{with the rest of}} the house. The Solar Block is the oldest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> dating from around 1250. It has a plate tracery window with a Trefoil cusping surrounded by wall paintings. The solar separated from the hall by a screens passage.|$|E
5|$|The newest of Manor Hall's annexes was {{originally}} {{a row of}} spacious townhouses constructed in the 1780s as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> boom of Clifton in between wars with France. 30-35 Richmond Terrace was a hotel prior before being acquired by the University in 2006. The building underwent a major refurbishment and it now provides self-catered en suite accommodation for 92 students. It was previously managed by University Student Houses and became a Manor Hall annexe in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> between the atrium and the cella, {{and serves as}} {{the lobby of the}} church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.|$|E
50|$|Marble columns, with {{capitals of}} Byzantine type, support the {{galleries}} and other subsidiary <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> marble {{selected for the}} columns were, in some instances, obtained from formations quarried by the ancient Romans, chiefly in Greece.|$|R
50|$|In 1977 <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> were {{occupied}} by the former Senglea Trade School while other sections accommodated a secondary school.|$|R

5|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} vitrified forts, {{the walls of}} which have been subjected to fire, which may date to this period, but an accurate chronology has proven to be evasive. When first noted in the nineteenth century it was assumed that vitrification had been deliberately undertaken as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> process to harden walls, but this hypothesis was rejected by V. Gordon Childe in the 1940s and subsequent excavations have indicated that, since the debris from such walls fell on the deposits of occupation it could not have been <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> process. Reconstructions have indicated the difficulty of deliberately firing timbers in this way, particularly in the prevailing climatic conditions in Scotland, and {{it is more likely that}} this was done as part of a process of fort destruction, either after conquest or when abandoned by the inhabitants. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries BCE, or the mid-first millennium CE. Excavations at Dunnideer, Aberdeenshire indicate a date for its destruction in the period 500–250 BCE.|$|E
5|$|All Hallows Church is {{the oldest}} {{existing}} building in Wellingborough and dates from c.1160. The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church. The earliest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> is the Norman doorway opening in from the later south porch. The church was enlarged {{with the addition of}} more side chapels {{and by the end of}} the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later. The church was restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law. The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the height}} of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> complex {{date back}} to the eighteenth century when they were built as terraced houses in the Georgian period.|$|R

5|$|Bridgwater had {{a series}} of {{swimming}} pools from 1890 until 2009. The first pool, in Old Taunton Road, was replaced by the Bridgwater Lido on Broadway, opened in 1960 by Princess Alexandra. The lido, which had three pools, a diving bay and paddling pool, was demolished in the late 1980s {{to make way for a}} supermarket, and to fund the indoor Sedgemoor Splash swimming pool in Mount Street, which opened in 1991. In 2009, after the local council were unable to raise the funds needed to upgrade the pool, it was closed and demolished to make way for another supermarket. A new pool was planned as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Building</b> Schools for the Future (BSF) rebuild of Chilton Trinity School, however, the government's review of the BSF programme may result in the cancellation of the new school and pool build.|$|E
5|$|Built {{around long}} narrow yards, {{as well as}} serving food and drink and {{providing}} lodgings, these coaching inns also served as temporary warehouses, auction rooms and gambling halls for travellers {{doing business in the}} market. The best known was the Angel, parts of which dated to the 15thcentury. As well as providing the other functions of the Norwich inns, its yard also served as a popular theatre and venue for other performers. (Despite its significance as a city, Norwich did not have a dedicated theatre until 1758.) However, in 1699 <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> collapsed during a performance by Thomas Doggett's troupe of players, killing a woman and injuring many of the audience. The reputation of the Angel was severely damaged, and although still used for small scale entertainments such as puppet shows, it was never again used for full scale theatrical performances.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{the school}} {{underwent}} additional construction to alleviate crowded hallways and rebuild deteriorating <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> reconstruction included a new 5 million dollar library, extended cafeteria, and connected hallways greatly {{opening up the}} campus and improving <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> traffic.|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{if these}} {{historic}} functions, which continues until the 20th century, {{can still be}} seen. Other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> are in commercial use.|$|R
