On 2 June 2009, Ravalomanana was fined 70 million US dollars (42 million British pounds) and sentenced to four {{years in prison for}} alleged abuse of office which, according to HAT Justice Minister Christine Razanamahasoa, included the December 2008 purchase of a second presidential jet ("Air Force II") worth $60 million. Rajoelina sold the controversial jet in 2012 and pursued legal action against Ravalomanana's company Tiko to reclaim 35 million US dollars in back taxes. Additionally, on 28 August 2010, the HAT sentenced Ravalomanana in absentia to hard labor for life and issued an arrest warrant {{for his role in the}} protests and ensuing deaths. Rajoelina likewise sought to distinguish himself from his predecessor in <b>policy</b> <b>choices.</b> One of Rajoelina's first measures as president was to cancel Ravalomanana's unpopular deal with Daewoo Logistics. He also rejected Ravalomanana's medium term development strategy, termed the Madagascar Action Plan, and abandoned education reforms initiated by his predecessor that adopted Malagasy and English as languages of instruction, instead returning to the traditional use of French.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{influence}} of a company 2 ̆ 7 s level of earnings and growth opportunities in determining the dividend <b>policy</b> <b>choice</b> of Malaysian-listed firms. The analysis is based on a sample of 136 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia Index over a period of six years, from 1990 to 1996. The evidence suggests that the payers are more profitable than non-payers. Likewise, investment opportunity, which is measured by (∂At /At- 1) and (Vt /At), differed for both payers and non-payers. The regression estimates from Logit model suggest that the average coefficient for EATA is a significant determinant for firm 2 ̆ 7 s dividend <b>policy</b> <b>choice</b> in Malaysia. This is consistent with the supposition that profitable firms are more likely to pay dividends than less profitable firms.

25|$|German {{newspaper}} publisher and political scientist Josef Joffe suggests five classic {{aspects of the}} phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit {{the influence of the}} United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off from its polluting products and practices. Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous ideological current, comparable to anti-Semitism. Anti-Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U.S. <b>policy</b> <b>choices</b> as evidence of a specifically U.S. moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} and explain the allocation of takeover purchase price to identifiable intangible assets (IIAs), purchased goodwill, and/or target net tangible assets in an accounting environment unconstrained with respect to IIA accounting <b>policy</b> <b>choice.</b> Using a sample of Australian acquisitions during the unconstrained accounting environment from 1988 to 2004, we find the percentage allocation of purchase price to IIAs averaged 19. 09 %. The percentage allocation to IIAs is significantly positively related to return on assets and insignificantly related to leverage, contrary to opportunism. Efficiency suggests an explanation: profitable firms acquire and capitalise a higher percentage of IIAs in acquisitions. The target's investment opportunity set is significantly positively related to the percentage allocation to IIAs, consistent with information-signalling. The paper contributes to the accounting <b>policy</b> <b>choice</b> literature by showing how Australian firms make the one-off accounting <b>policy</b> <b>choice</b> in regards allocation of takeover purchase price (which is often a substantial dollar amount to) in an environment where accounting for IIAs was unconstrained. ...|$|R

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{proposed}} strategies for reducing the federal deficit. These may include <b>policy</b> <b>choices</b> regarding taxation and spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. For example, a fast-growing economy offers the win-win outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie, with higher employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. However, most other strategies represent a tradeoff scenario in which money or benefits are taken from some and given to others. Spending can be reduced from current levels, frozen, or the rate of future spending increases reduced. Budgetary rules can also be implemented to manage spending. Some changes can take place today, while others can phase in over time. Tax revenues can be raised in a variety of ways, by raising tax rates, the scope of what is taxed, or eliminating deductions and exemptions ("tax expenditures"). Regulatory uncertainty or barriers can be reduced, as these may cause businesses to postpone investment and hiring decisions.|$|E
25|$|EU as a {{security}} provider: Management of post Soviet-er{{a security}} tensions in bordering States (Ukraine, Georgia and Balkan States) has exposed deep-rooted structural weaknesses of European Union institutions. European Union's collective response on matters ranging from {{the management of the}} exodus of refugees from war-torn Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, participation in NATO-led interventions, action against non-State entities (Islamic State & Al-Qaeda), etc. suffers from differing priorities of 28 European Union member States. The paucity of strategic vision within the European Council, nationality-quota based allotment of senior bureaucratic positions within the Institutions of the European Union, and the capacity of minor European countries to unduly influence <b>policy</b> <b>choices</b> of the European Union is problematic. Decision taking by Brussels-based European stake-holders is cumbersome and severely limited due to intra-EU politics and the obsession with Byzantine Community method consensus-based decision making procedures. The Ukrainian crisis exposed the shortcomings of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and outlined the limits of German military clout. Public disenchantment with the political outcomes of recent military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has emptied political support for accrued European Union involvement in the Syrian and Ukrainian crisis. Further strengthening of European Union sanctions regime against Russia faces internal dissent from several EU member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Finland) besides being largely ignored by European multinationals (German and Italian companies have most investment exposure in Russia) who bypass the sanctions regime by trading with Russia via third-countries (Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel). A 2015 Pew Research survey indicated that Europeans are by and large not favourable to a military deployment by their country under the terms of NATO Article 5 to protect a fellow member country which comes under attack.|$|E

500|$|After his defeats in 1875, Weaver grew {{disenchanted with}} the Republican party, {{not only because}} it had spurned him, but also because of the <b>policy</b> <b>choices</b> of the {{dominant}} Allison faction. In May 1876, he traveled to Indianapolis to attend the national convention of the newly formed Greenback Party. [...] The new party had arisen, mostly in the West, {{as a response to the}} economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized [...] "greenbacks", a new form of fiat money that was redeemable not in gold but in government bonds. The greenbacks had helped to finance the war when the government's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies. When the crisis had passed, many in both parties, especially in the East, wanted to place the nation's currency on a gold standard as soon as possible. The Specie Payment Resumption Act, passed in 1875, ordered that greenbacks be gradually withdrawn and replaced with gold-backed currency beginning in 1879. At the same time, the depression had made it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Beyond their support for a larger money supply, Greenbackers also favored an eight-hour work day, safety regulations in factories, and an end to child labor. [...] As historian Herbert Clancy put it, they [...] "anticipated by almost fifty years the progressive legislation of the first quarter of the twentieth century".|$|E

The Wall Street Journal described the book as Cowen's most impactful book due to the direction in which he leads the debate. [...] "What is exciting is to imagine students, economists, and scientists across the country reading the book, coming to terms with the depth of our challenge and pursuing new ways of trying to 'fix' things or generally improve our lot." [...] "A small book but a big, worthwhile question", concluded The Economist. In the New York Times, David Brooks praised The Great Stagnation as [...] "the most debated non-fiction book so far this year", which Timothy Noah described as a great favor to the book's marketing though an exaggeration considering the discussion surrounding Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua.|$|E
