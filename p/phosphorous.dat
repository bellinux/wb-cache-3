25|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the correct}} {{spelling}} of the element is phosphorus. The word <b>phosphorous</b> is the adjectival {{form of the}} P3+ valence: so, just as sulfur forms sulfurous and sulfuric compounds, phosphorus forms <b>phosphorous</b> compounds (e.g., <b>phosphorous</b> acid) and P5+ valence phosphoric compounds (e.g., phosphoric acids and phosphates).|$|E
25|$|Dieback is {{notoriously}} difficult to treat, {{although there has}} been some success with phosphite and <b>phosphorous</b> acid, which are currently used to inoculate wild B.brownii populations. However this is not without potential problems as it alters the soil composition by adding phosphorus. Some evidence suggests that <b>phosphorous</b> acid may inhibit proteoid root formation.|$|E
25|$|HPA {{is usually}} {{supplied}} as a 50% aqueous solution. Anhydrous acid cannot {{be obtained by}} simple evaporation of the water, as the acid ready oxidises to <b>phosphorous</b> acid and phosphoric acid and also disproportionates to <b>phosphorous</b> acid and phosphine. Pure anhydrous hypophosphorous acid can be formed by the continuous extraction of aqueous solutions with diethyl ether.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphorous</b> oxoacids are extensive, often commercially important, and {{sometimes}} structurally complicated. They all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms, some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus - phosphorus bonds. Although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed, only nine are important, {{and three of}} them, hypophosphorous acid, <b>phosphorous</b> acid, and phosphoric acid, are particularly important.|$|E
25|$|The {{protonation}} steps {{between the}} arsenate and arsenic acid {{are similar to}} those between phosphate and phosphoric acid. Unlike <b>phosphorous</b> acid, arsenous acid is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH)3.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorus(III) oxide, P4O6 (also called tetraphosphorus hexoxide) is the {{anhydride}} of P(OH)3, {{the minor}} tautomer of <b>phosphorous</b> acid. The structure of P4O6 {{is like that}} of P4O10 without the terminal oxide groups.|$|E
25|$|In {{reactions}} that produce <b>phosphorous</b> acid as a by-product, when working up by distillation {{be aware that}} this can decompose above about 160°C to give phosphine which can cause explosions in contact with air.|$|E
500|$|Pauling's second rule is {{that the}} value of the first pKa for acids of the formula XOm(OH)n depends {{primarily}} on the number of oxo groups m, and is approximately independent of the number of hydroxy groups n, and also of the central atom X. Approximate values of pKa are 8 for m=0, 2 for m=1, −3 for m=2 and < −10 for m = 3. Alternatively, various numerical formulas have been proposed including pKa = 8 − 5m (known as Bell's rule), pKa=7−5m, or pKa=9−7m. The dependence on m correlates with the oxidation state of the central atom, X: the higher the oxidation state the stronger the oxyacid. For example, pKa for HClO is 7.2, for HClO2 is 2.0, for HClO3 is −1 and HClO4 is a strong acid (...) [...] The increased acidity on adding an oxo group is due to stabilization of the conjugate base by delocalization of its negative charge over an additional oxygen atom. This rule can help assign molecular structure: for example <b>phosphorous</b> acid (H3PO3) has a pKa near 2 suggested that the structure is HPO(OH)2, as later confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and not P(OH)3 which would be expected to have a pKa near 8.|$|E

2500|$|Two main {{approaches}} {{are used to}} synthesize glyphosate industrially. [...] The first is to react iminodiacetic acid with <b>phosphorous</b> acid and hydrochloric acid (sometimes formed in situ by addition of phosphorus trichloride) via a modified Mannich reaction. Oxidation then leads to the desired glyphosate product. [...] Iminodiacetic acid is usually prepared on-site, such as by reaction of chloroacetic acid with ammonia and calcium hydroxide to produce the calcium iminodiacetate salt and then acidification of the product.|$|E
2500|$|Lavoisier, {{together}} with Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude-Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François de Fourcroy, submitted {{a new program}} for the reforms of chemical nomenclature to the Academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work, titled Méthode de nomenclature chimique (Method of Chemical Nomenclature, 1787), introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry. The Classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 55 substances {{which could not be}} decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light; caloric (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (nitrogen); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown [...] "radicals" [...] of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), boric acid, and [...] "fluoric" [...] acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as magnesia, barite, and strontia); three alkalies (potash, soda, and ammonia); and the [...] "radicals" [...] of 19 organic acids. The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved {{together with}} the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and <b>phosphorous</b> acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the [...] "ic" [...] termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the [...] "ous" [...] ending. Similarly, salts of the [...] "ic" [...] acids were given the terminal letters [...] "ate," [...] as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the [...] "ous" [...] acids terminated with the suffix [...] "ite," [...] as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name [...] "copper sulfate" [...] with the old term [...] "vitriol of Venus." [...] Lavoisier's new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This {{marked the beginning of the}} anti-phlogistic approach to the field.|$|E

60|$|He now pressed {{with his}} {{knuckles}} upon a certain spot of the carpet {{in one corner}} of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper by means of a <b>phosphorous</b> match, and, placing the light in a dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture being concealed.|$|E

"I {{dare say}} that {{living under the}} very top of the Sierras has an odd effect on the mind; one tends to think of those lonely rocks not as peaks coming to a point, but rather as pillars holding up heaven itself. Straight cliffs sail up and away beyond the hope of the eagles; cliffs so tall that they seem to attract the stars and collect them as sea-crags collect a mere glitter of <b>phosphorous.</b> These {{terraces}} and towers of rock do not, like smaller crests, seem to be the end of the world. Rather they seem to be its awful beginning: its huge foundations. We could almost fancy the mountain branching out above us like a tree of stone, and carrying all those cosmic lights like a candelabrum. For just as the peaks failed us, soaring impossibly far, so the stars crowded us (as it seemed), coming impossibly near. The spheres burst about us more like thunderbolts hurled at the earth than planets circling placidly about it.|$|E

Deputations, three in number, arrive from the Hotel-de-Ville; Abbe Fouchet (who was of one) can say, with what almost superhuman courage of benevolence. (Fauchet's Narrative (Deux Amis, i. 324.).)

60|$|My {{companion}} now {{showed me}} {{that one of the}} ends of the box could be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of tapers and <b>phosphorous,</b> and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on the seventeenth of June.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{we can see}} that, {{while the}} old theory of Kirby and Spence had some facts to support it, the one now in vogue is purely fanciful. Until some better {{suggestion}} is made, it would perhaps be as well to consider the luminous organ as having [...] "no very close and direct relation to present habits of life." [...] About their present habits, however, especially their crepuscular habits, there is yet much to learn. One thing I have observed in them has always seemed very strange to me. Occasionally an individual insect is seen shining with a very large and steady light, or with a light which very gradually decreases and increases in power, and at such times it is less active than at others, remaining for long intervals motionless on the leaves, or moving with a very slow flight. In South America a firefly displaying this abnormal splendour {{is said to be}} dying, and it is easy to imagine how such a notion originated. The belief is, however, erroneous, for sometimes, on very rare occasions, all the insects in one place are simultaneously affected in the same way, and at such times they mass themselves together in myriads, as if for migration, or for some other great purpose. Mr. Bigg-Wither, in South Brazil, and D'Albertis, in New Guinea, noticed these firefly gatherings; I also once had the rare good fortune to witness a phenomenon of the kind on a very grand scale. Riding on the pampas one dark evening an hour after sunset, and passing from high ground overgrown with giant thistles to a low plain covered with long grass, bordering a stream of water, I found it all ablaze with myriads of fireflies. I noticed that all the insects gave out an exceptionally large, brilliant light, which shone almost steadily. The long grass was thickly studded with them, while they literally swarmed in the air, all moving up the valley with a singularly slow and languid flight. When I galloped down into this river of phosphorescent fire, my horse plunged and snorted with alarm. I succeeded at length in quieting him, and then rode slowly through, compelled to keep my mouth and eyes closed, so thickly did the insects rain on to my face. The air was laden with the sickening <b>phosphorous</b> smell they emit, but when I had once got free of the broad fiery zone, stretching away on either hand for miles along the moist valley, I stood still and gazed back for some time on a scene the most wonderful and enchanting I have ever witnessed.|$|E

50|$|Another {{limitation}} that Crocosphaera watsonii encounters is <b>phosphorous</b> limitation. Because Crocosphaera watsonii {{lives in}} oligotrophic waters, {{it can be}} limited {{by a variety of}} nutrients, including dissolved inorganic phosphate. Phosphate is required in many cellular processes including photosynthesis where it {{is an integral part of}} its machinery. <b>Phosphorous</b> is also a key requirement for nitrogen fixation. By looking at the response of Crocosphaera watsonii to <b>phosphorous</b> limitation, the effects on nitrogen fixation can also be examined. Crocosphaera watsonii showed a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency when limited by <b>phosphorous.</b> Unlike most cyanobacteria, Crocosphaera watsonii does not regulate it’s phosphate use and metabolism inside the cell during low phosphate conditions. Instead, Crocosphaera watsonii uses pstS, a protein that has a high affinity to bind to <b>phosphorous.</b> During times of <b>phosphorous</b> stress, Crocosphaera watsonii is shown to have increased levels of pstS transcription. This is the defensive response of Crocosphaera watsonii to lower levels of <b>phosphorous,</b> for more efficient uptake. While increasing pstS levels correspond to a lower concentrations of <b>phosphorous</b> around cells, pstS transcript concentrations have no relationship to phosphorus concentrations. PstS transcript levels in Crocosphaera watsonii instead correspond to the diel cycle, peaking at the end of the light phase. Another method to measure phosphorus stress in Crocosphaera watsonii is to look at arsenic concentrations within the cell. As <b>phosphorous</b> is limited, arsenic is also accumulated inside the cell. As a response, Crocosphaera watsonii will upregulate arsB levels, which will remove the excess arsenic from within the cell. These, when looked at together can tell us the condition of the cells in a given Crocosphaera watsonii population.|$|E
50|$|Phosphites {{have shown}} {{effectiveness}} in controlling {{a variety of}} plant diseases, in particular, treatment using either trunk injection or foliar containing <b>phosphorous</b> acid salts is indicated in response to infections by phytophthora and pythium-type plant pathogens (both within class oomycetes, known as water molds), such as dieback/root rot and downy mildew. Anti-microbial products containing salts of <b>phosphorous</b> acid are marketed in Australia as 'Yates Anti-Rot'; and in the United States of America, for example, aluminum salts of the monoethyl ester of <b>phosphorous</b> acid (known generically as 'Fosetyl-Al') are sold under the trade name 'Aliette'. <b>Phosphorous</b> acid and its salts, unlike phosphoric acid, are somewhat toxic and should be handled carefully.|$|E
