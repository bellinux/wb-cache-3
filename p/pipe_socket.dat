40|$|Unix-based {{operating}} systems feature several forms of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) including <b>pipes,</b> Unix domain <b>sockets,</b> TCP/IP sockets, FIFOs, semaphores, and signals. Although these mechanisms provide similar services, each is designed differently with {{varying levels of}} performance.

The analysis of the IPC mechanisms involved examining the kernel source code of the Linux operating system and developing benchmark utilities to measure their performance.

5000|$|What is the {{difference}} between an [...] "aggregate" [...] and other kinds of [...] "modified versions"?An [...] "aggregate" [...] consists of a number of separate programs, distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media. The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible. The only condition is that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that each program's individual license would grant them.Where's the line between two separate programs, and one program with two parts? This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide. We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.) and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are interchanged).If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are definitely combined in one program. If modules are designed to run linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means combining them into one program.By contrast, <b>pipes,</b> <b>sockets</b> and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are separate programs. But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program.|$|R

40|$|Key words: hybrid vision head, {{infrared}} thermovision, defect detection, {{friction welding}} Summary: The article presents the method for testing {{the propriety of}} joints between the sewage <b>pipes</b> and their <b>sockets,</b> both made of plastics. The joint is made using the friction welding method by rotating the socket and pushing it against the fixed pipe. For testing the propriety of the weld the hybrid vision method was developed, that utilises visible band and infrared band vision tracts. The main element {{of the system is}} the infrared camera equipped with uncooled microbolometric sensor. The infrared camera records the infrared radiation, whose intensity depends on the temperature and the properties of the tested object. For detection of the defects of the joint the variation of velocity of heat diffusion is used that occurs inside the material of the object in proximity of the fault, which appears as a local variation of temperature on the surface. The visible light camera is used as an auxiliary tract to assess the surface state of the coupler and to ease the interpretation of the results obtained with the infrared camera. For testing purposes the experimental stand was made to precisely rotate the welded pipe related to the hybrid vision head. The developed method finds its application for testing the joints of <b>pipes</b> and <b>sockets</b> in the production line...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{arrival of}} the P 2 P model has opened many new avenues for {{research}} {{within the field of}} distributed computing. This is mainly due to important practical features (such as support for volatility, high scalability). Several generic P 2 P libraries have been proposed for building higher-level services. In order to judge the appropriateness of using a generic P 2 P library for a given application type, an experimental performance evaluation of the provided functionalities is unavoidable. Very few analyses of this kind have been reported, as most evaluations are limited to complexity analyses and to simulations. Such experimental analyses are important, especially when using P 2 P software in a grid computing context, where applications may have precise efficiency requirements. In this paper, we focus on JXTA, which provides generic building blocks and protocols intended to serve as a basis for specialized P 2 P services and applications. We perform a performance evaluation of the three communication layers (endpoint, <b>pipe</b> and <b>socket)</b> over a Fast Ethernet local-area network, for recent versions of the J 2 SE and C bindings of JXTA. We provide a detailed analysis explaining the behavior of these three layers and we give hints showing how to efficiently use them. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Causeway {{provides}} runtime {{support for}} the development of distributed meta-applications. These meta-applications control or analyze the behavior of multi-tier distributed applications such as multi-tier web sites or web services. Examples of meta-applications include multitier debugging, fault diagnosis, resource tracking, prioritization, and security enforcement. Efficient online implementation of these meta-applications requires meta-data to be passed between the different program components. Examples of metadata corresponding to the above meta-applications are request identifiers, priorities or security principal identifiers. Causeway provides the infrastructure for injecting, destroying, reading, and writing such metadata. The key functionality in Causeway is forwarding the metadata associated with a request at so-called transfer points, where the execution of that request gets passed from one component to another. This is done automatically for system-visible channels, such as <b>pipes</b> or <b>sockets.</b> An API is provided to implement the forwarding of metadata at system-opaque channels such as shared memory. We describe the design and implementation of Causeway, and we evaluate its usability and performance. Causeway’s low overhead allows it to be present permanently in production systems. We demonstrate its usability by showing how to implement, in 150 lines of code and without modification to the application, global priority enforcement in a multitier dynamic web server. ...|$|R
