50|$|The above {{states that}} there is no change of the energy of the system over the cycle. Ein might be the work and heat input during the cycle and Eout would be the work and heat output during the cycle. The first law of {{thermodynamics}} also dictates that the net heat input is equal to the net work output over a cycle (we account for heat, Qin, as positive and Qout as negative). The repeating nature of the <b>process</b> <b>path</b> allows for continuous operation, making the cycle an important concept in thermodynamics.

50|$|Now let’s {{say that}} the piston {{was not able to}} move {{smoothly}} within the cylinder due to static friction with the walls of the cylinder. Assuming that the temperature was increased slowly, you would find that the <b>process</b> <b>path</b> is not straight and no longer isobaric, but would instead undergo an isometric process till the force exceeded that of the frictional force and then would undergo an isothermal process back to an equilibrium state. This process would be repeated till the end state is reached. See figure 3. The work done on the piston in this case would be different due to the additional work required for the resistance of the friction. The work done due to friction would be the difference between the work done on these two process paths.|$|E
