The new gate can accommodate three <b>Passenger</b> <b>Transfer</b> Vehicles, allowing passengers to be transferred from the terminal to an aircraft parked on a remote stand nearby. When phase II of the expansion began in 2014, this gate was closed to passengers. It was reopened with the inauguration of the extension two years later.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2012, Sydney Airport and MD CEO Kerrie Mather {{announced}} the airport {{had abandoned the}} proposal to create alliance-based terminals in favour of terminals [...] "based around specific airline requirements and (<b>passenger)</b> <b>transfer</b> flows". She stated {{the plan was to}} minimise the number of passengers transferring between terminals. In June 2013 the airport released a draft version of its 2013 Masterplan, which proposes operating domestic and international flights from the same terminals using 'swing gates', along with upgrading Terminal 3 (currently the Qantas domestic terminal) to accommodate the Airbus A380.|$|E
2500|$|Passengers walked {{as little}} as [...] going from the curb to the gate. Once there, {{passengers}} would be transported to their aircraft by <b>Passenger</b> <b>Transfer</b> Vehicles (PTVs), rather than walking through jetways. The PTVs, similar to those at Washington Dulles International Airport, ran from the terminal to the aircraft parking spot on the ramp. It was reported by Radio-Canada/Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{that each of these}} vehicles had cost up to C$ 400,000 at the time. To eventually make connections between flights easier, the terminal also included a few jetways, in a smaller concourse called the Aeroquay, accessible via an underground tunnel and later connected directly to the main concourse.|$|E
