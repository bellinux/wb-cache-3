He is the older brother of Regulus Arcturus Black and a cousin of Narcissa Malfoy, Andromeda Tonks, and Bellatrix Lestrange. He {{rejected}} his family's pure-blood elitism and reverence for the Dark Arts. In contrast to his home life, Sirius greatly enjoyed life at Hogwarts. He was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was the only Black to be sorted into Gryffindor. He was inseparable from his best friend James 'Prongs' Potter and befriended Remus 'Moony' Lupin and Peter 'Wormtail' Pettigrew.

Major Günther Capito had joined the unit in the spring of 1943. Capito was a former bomber pilot who had {{retrained}} on fighters. After scoring his fifth victory, Capito asked to be Hartmann's wingman. Hartmann refused initially, believing Capito was insufficiently trained on Messerschmitts.

500|$|Contraception {{was legal}} in the United States {{throughout}} most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a social purity movement grew in strength, aimed at outlawing vice in general, and prostitution and obscenity in particular.Engelman, pp. 13–14. Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the Victorian-era campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an immoral practice that promoted prostitution and venereal disease. Anthony Comstock, a postal inspector and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law prohibiting mailing of [...] "any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion" [...] as well as any form of contraceptive information. Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the Comstock laws), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the use of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.|$|E
500|$|In March 2013 Mendes said {{he would}} not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as Bond 24; he later recanted and {{announced}} that he would return, as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing. Nicolas Winding Refn would later reveal that he turned down an offer to direct the movie. In directing Skyfall and Spectre, Mendes became the first director to oversee two consecutive Bond films since John Glen directed The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill in 1987 and 1989. Dennis Gassner returned as the film's production designer, while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins. In July 2015 Mendes noted that the combined crew of Spectre numbered over one thousand, making it a larger production than Skyfall. Craig is listed as co-producer. He considered the credit a high point of his career, saying [...] "I'm just so <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> my name comes up somewhere else on the titles." ...|$|E
500|$|Lodge {{compensated}} for the setback by helping secure the position of Assistant Secretary for Theodore Roosevelt, a brash and aggressive New Yorker. Long and Roosevelt did not get along: in addition to personality differences, Roosevelt pushed a view to aggressively modernize and expand the Navy against Long's more studied and conservative approach. He preferred to expand the Navy gradually. As the nation's global interests grew, Long committed himself to the nation's peaceful growth in line with McKinley's policies. As {{a result of his}} disagreements with Roosevelt, Long took steps to control his subordinate. Roosevelt, on the other hand, sought ways to spur Long into action, writing [...] "I only wish that I could poison his mind so as to make him a shade more truculent in international matters". He also chafed against Long's policy of deferring much of the department's work to its permanent bureau chiefs, which resulted in constraints on the flow of information the administration received. Long was somewhat <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he knew little of the detail of naval affairs, commenting that he was [...] "a civilian who does not know the stem from the stern of a ship".|$|E
