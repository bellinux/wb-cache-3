40|$|Happiness in China {{plummeted}} between 1990 and 2000 despite {{rapid economic}} growth. This finding contradicts {{the notion that}} income growth leads to gains in happiness. In sociology, people might mentally benefit from social trust and social mobility but suffer from social anomie in a boom.

Regression model and structural equation model are applied. The results provide strong evidence that economic transition from a command economy to a market economy systematically and substantially influence subjective well-being. Economic inequality and relative deprivation are largely responsible for why happiness has declined in the presence of economic growth.

40|$|Classic “position-effect” {{experiments}} repositioned genes near telomeres {{to demonstrate}} that the epigenetic landscape can dramatically alter gene expression. Here, we show that systematic gene knockout collections provide an exceptional resource for interrogating position effects, not only near telomeres but at every genetic locus. Because a single reporter gene replaces each deleted gene, interrogating this reporter provides a sensitive probe into different chromatin environments while controlling for genetic context. Using this approach, we find that, whereas systematic replacement of yeast genes with the kanMX marker does not perturb the chromatin landscape, chromatin differences associated with gene <b>position</b> <b>account</b> for 35 % of kanMX activity. We observe distinct chromatin influences, including a Set 2 /Rpd 3 -mediated antagonistic interaction between histone H 3 lysine 36 trimethylation and the Rap 1 transcriptional activation site in kanMX.

These findings demonstrate that chromatin regulation is not governed by a uniform “histone code” but by specific interactions between chromatin and genetic factors...|$|E

Accumulation of plasmalogen choline and ethanolamine lysophospholipids (lysoplasme-nylcholine and lysoplasmenylethanolamine) or the effects of exogenous fatty acids on lysoplasmalogen accumulation during ischemia and reperfusion have not been examined. Isolated working rat hearts perfused with buffer containing either 11 mM glucose or 11 mM glucose plus 1. 2 mM palmitate were subjected to aerobic, ischemic, or ischemia/reperfusion protocols.

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{theoretical}} studies (e. g. Browning & Karimi 1994; Karimi 2003; Ghomeshi 1997; Ganjavi 2007) {{claim that}} rā-marked (definite and/or specific) direct objects (DOs) occupy a higher position than their non-rā-marked (indefinite non-specific) counterparts. One {{of the main}} arguments to support this claim is the unmarked relative order between the direct and the indirect object (IO), which is broadly assumed to be IO−DO[-rā]−V and DO[+rā]−IO−V (e. g. Mahootian 1997; Rasekhmahand 2004; Roberts 2009). In this paper, we provide empirical evidence against such a dichotomous view. We have conducted a corpus-based study (Faghiri & Samvelian, 2014) and experimental follow up studies (Faghiri et al., 2014; Faghiri, forthcoming) to investigate ordering preferences between the DO and the IO in the preverbal domain. In addition to {{the realization of the}} DO, we have taken into account other potentially influential factors such as relative length, givenness, collocationality and lexical bias, via mixed-effect regression modeling, in line with key empirical studies on word order variations (e. g. Wasow 2002). The data reveal that while rā-marked DOs show a strong preference to appear before the IO, among different non-rā-marked DOs, i. e. bare nouns ketāb, bare noun with modifiers ketāb-e akkāsi and indefinite/numeral NPs ye ketāb(-i), only bare nouns show a strong preference for adjacency to the verb. Interestingly, indefinite (non-rā-marked) DOs show a clear preference for the inverse, grouping thus with rā-marked DOs. Moreover, extra syntactic factors such as relative length also play a significant role on these ordering preferences. Accordingly, we argue that the ordering preferences observed for different types of DOs is best reflected by a continuum based on the degree of conceptual and/or discourse accessibility. Consequently, any structural account of the latter would lead to wrong predictions. We furthermore examine other arguments provided to support a dual-position account and present some counterexamples that question their validity. Thus, in line with Samvelian (2001), we refute a dual syntactic <b>position</b> <b>account</b> of the DO...|$|E

In addition, {{arguments are}} frequently not overtly expressed, while some arguments may be {{marked with the}} preposed particle si. This paper investigates these issues in terms of information structure by examining each in its discourse context. It concludes that the pragmatically neutral order in Cheke Holo is VSO; that a single preverbal topic <b>position</b> exists, <b>accounting</b> for SVO and OVS; and that focused arguments are located in clause-final <b>position,</b> <b>accounting</b> for VOS. It finds that continued topics are always expressed by topic-drop (that is, elision), and that preverbal position is reserved for contrastive topics and switch topics, although in certain specific contexts, switch topics may instead be dropped. The paper concludes that preposed si is confined to main clauses and is a focus marker for arguments and adjuncts in clause-final position, but that another particle si, with a variant sini, occurs following, not preceding, a sentence-initial focused constituent that can {{range in size from}} an argument to an entire clause.
