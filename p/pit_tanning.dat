50|$|Before {{work began}} on the new Concert Hall, an archaeological dig was carried out. The dig {{uncovered}} evidence of a medieval castle, first documented in the 12th century but destroyed by flood in 1209. Other finds included an arched stone bridge, metal objects, leather, wood, pottery, stone and bones, clay-lined <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> and stone-lined wells.|$|R

2500|$|As the {{redevelopment}} of 2000 began, archaeological excavations {{were conducted on}} the site. Finds dated back to the 12th century; a ditch was discovered where the Selfridges store and Park Street car park are now situated. Archaeologists discovered {{that this was a}} boundary separating houses from a deer park in an area now occupied by Moor Street station. Rubbish [...] discovered in the ditch was found to include fragments of misfired pottery with criss-cross patterns, indicating that pottery kilns had been located there in the 13th century. Many leather <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> dating to the 17th and 18th centuries were found on the Park Street car park site. These contained fragments of crucibles, pottery vessels in which metal was melted. The residues in these were alloys of copper with zinc, lead and tin. On the site where the Indoor Markets are now located, archaeologists discovered further leather <b>tanning</b> <b>pits,</b> these dating from the 13th century.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} after this eclaircissernent [explanation] was completed, {{the progress of}} the multitude brought them opposite to the door of Pavillon's house, in one of the principal streets, but which communicated from behind with the Maes by means of a garden, as well as an extensive manufactory of <b>tan</b> <b>pits,</b> and other conveniences for dressing hides, for the patriotic burgher was a felt dresser or currier.|$|R

A large gray tailings pile of waste rock and an adjacent tailings pond appear {{to the north of}} the Berkeley Pit. Color changes in the tailings pond result primarily from changing water depth. Because its water contains high concentrations of metals such as copper and zinc, the Berkeley Pit is listed as a federal Superfund site.|$|R

Around the same time, Batman's Hill was also {{the site of the}} first cricket match played in Victoria by the founders of the Melbourne Cricket Club. The western slope of Batman's Hill was sold to the government in 1847 and a powder magazine was built. At the foot of the slopes were <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> and melting works.|$|R
2500|$|Life in Medieval Dublin {{was very}} precarious. In 1348, {{the city was}} hit by the Black Death – a lethal bubonic plague that ravaged Europe in the mid-14th century.

Though Archaeological {{excavations}} {{in the past ten}} years have found evidence of a tanning industry in this area, so the name [...] "Blackpitts" [...] may refer to the <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> which stained the surrounding area a deep dark colour.

50|$|Helmshore {{became a}} mill workers' settlement, {{comprising}} an extensive area of woollen and cotton mills and associated workers' housing built along {{the valley of}} the River Ogden. The Turner family, whose <b>tan</b> <b>pits</b> and Hollin Bank mills were built as water-powered mills in the early nineteenth century, first established the settlement. The surviving mills later converted to cotton production. The area expanded {{with the opening of the}} railway in 1848, and includes the Station Hotel and St Thomas's Church (1851/2). The housing is mixed, with some two-up, two-down terraces, top-and-bottom houses and a few surviving back-to-back cottages.|$|R

5000|$|The Littell {{property}} {{includes four}} historically significant sites {{in addition to}} the house. [...] Littell did not originally build a house at the current location: three previous house sites are located on the same property. Moreover, a group of three pits used for drying hides in the tannery is located near the southeastern corner of the property. Also located on the property are a barn, a garage, an outhouse, and two wooden sheds; as all were built or rebuilt in the twentieth century, they do not contribute to the house's significance {{in the way that the}} previous house sites and the <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> do.|$|R
5000|$|Trade and {{industry}} greatly affected Stratton’s popularity; {{it had a}} thriving leather and agricultural trade. During medieval times it dealt in leather, evidence {{of this is the}} road named after the trade; Poundfield area was where the animals were kept, Stratton also housed <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> and a rack park, where the leather was stretched. There is also evidence of farming in the milking parlours, barns and stalls that are made from cob, a traditional building material, and the Old Malt House shows where ale was produced in the church owned brewery. During medieval times herbs and spices were also considered important, for medicinal purposes as well as others, and Stratton was famous for having an abundance of wild garlic.|$|R
2500|$|Smith was {{described}} by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of [...] "inexpressible benignity". He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he {{is reported to have}} had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge <b>tanning</b> <b>pit</b> from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up [...] outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.|$|R
50|$|The date of {{the first}} {{settlement}} in the Upperthorpe area is not clear; the name itself {{is a combination of}} the Danish word “thorpe” meaning “outlying farmstead” and a surname which was the Middle English word for a cooper. This means that the settlement was founded at a time when both Viking and Old English words had been integrated into local speech giving a founding date in the 9th or 10th century. By 1383 the settlement was known as Hoperthorpe which gradually evolved into Upperthorpe over the centuries. By the middle of the 16th century tanning had become a major industry within Upperthorpe with the Rawsons, an ancient Hallamshire family, setting up <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> in the area. Their business flourished over the years and they also established tanneries at nearby Walkley and Philadelphia. The industry started to falter in the 19th century and eventually lost out to more established tanning areas in Walsall and Leeds.|$|R
5|$|The Crow Green tannery was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 <b>tan</b> <b>pits</b> at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|R

40|$|ArchaeoPhysica was {{commissioned}} by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust {{on behalf of the}} Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) to undertake a systematic radar survey inside the building known as ‘The Old Tannery’, located in Maes Glas area and identified as a tannery on the Ordnance Survey 1 st edition map of 1889. The survey was intended to detect and record buried structures related to the tannery, such as pits and drains, before the restoration works in the building start. In addition a radar profile was undertaken outside the building to determine the location of five pits depicted on early mapping. The early mapping depicted an L-shape building, partly enclosing a yard area with five <b>tanning</b> <b>pits,</b> and documentation suggests that it was built c. 1819. The 2 nd edition of the Ordnance Survey map (1901) still depicted the building but did not identify it as a tannery, suggesting that the business had ceased. Today, only the southern range of the building survives. The use of the radar technique permitted the location of anomalies beneath the present floor of the building, identifiable with a previous floor and archaeological structures above and beneath it. Some of these anomalies could be identified with pits used in the tanning industry and two others could be drains. Examination of the external and internal structure of the building, as well a...|$|R
2500|$|Analysis of craftsmen's {{names in}} medieval records {{suggests}} that the major industries of medieval Birmingham were textiles, leather working and iron working, with archaeological evidence also suggesting the presence of pottery, tile manufacture and probably the working of bone and horn. By the 13th century there were <b>tanning</b> <b>pits</b> in use in Edgbaston Street; and hemp and flax were being used for making rope, canvas and linen. Kilns producing the distinctive local Deritend Ware pottery, examples {{of which can be}} seen in The Birmingham History Galleries, existed in the 12th and 13th centuries, and [...] skinners, tanners and saddlers are recorded in the 14th century. The presence of slag and hearth bloom in pits excavated behind Park Street also suggests the early presence of working in iron. The borough rentals of 1296 provide evidence of at least four forges in the town, four smiths are mentioned on a poll tax return of 1379 and seven more are documented in the following century. Although fifteen to twenty weavers, dyers and fullers have been identified in Birmingham up to 1347, this is not a significantly greater number of cloth-workers than that found in surrounding villages and {{at least some of the}} cloth sold on the Birmingham market had rural origins. This was the first local industry to benefit from mechanisation, however, and nearly a dozen fulling mills existed in the Birmingham area by the end of the 14th century, many converted from corn mills, but including one at Holford near Perry Barr that was purpose-built in 1358.|$|R
