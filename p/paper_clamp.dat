In the semi-passive approach, the piezoelectric element is intermittently switched from open-circuit to specific impedance synchronously with the structural vibration. Due to this switching procedure, a phase difference appears between the strain induced by vibration and the resulting voltage, thus creating energy dissipation. By supplying the energy collected from the piezoelectric materials to the switching circuit, a new low-power device using the SSDV technique is proposed. Compared with the original self-powered SSDI (synchronized switch damping on inductor), such a device can significantly improve its performance of vibration control.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{maternal}} and infant effects of delayed cord clamping (≥ 180 seconds, DCC) compared to early (≤ 10 seconds, ECC) in a randomised controlled trial. Practice and guidelines regarding when to clamp the cord vary globally, and different meta-analyses have shown contradictory conclusions on benefits and disadvantages of DCC and ECC. The study population consisted of 382 term infants born after normal pregnancies and randomised to DCC or ECC after birth. The primary objective was iron stores and iron deficiency at 4 months of age, but the thesis was designed to investigate {{a wide range of}} suggested effects associated with cord <b>clamping.</b> <b>Paper</b> I showed that DCC was associated with improved iron stores at 4 months (45 % higher ferritin) and that the incidence of iron deficiency was reduced from 5. 7 % to 0. 6 %. Neonatal anaemia at 2 - 3 days was less frequent in the DCC group, 1. 2 % vs. 6. 3 %. There were no differences between the groups in respiratory symptoms, polycythaemia, or hyperbilirubinaemia. In paper II we demonstrated that DCC versus ECC was not associated with higher risk for maternal post partum haemorrhage and rendered a comparable ratio of valid umbilical artery blood gas samples. In paper III, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire was used to assess neurodevelopment at 4 months. The total scores did not differ, but the DCC group had a higher score in the problem-solving domain and a lower score in the personal-social domain. Immunoglobulin G level was 0. 7 g/L higher in the DCC group at 2 – 3 days, but did not differ at 4 months. Symptoms of infection up to 4 months were comparable between groups. Finally, in paper IV, iron stores and neurodevelopment were similar between groups at 12 months. Gender specific outcome on neurodevelopment at 12 months was discovered, implying positive effects from DCC on boys and negative on girls. We conclude that delaying umbilical cord clamping for 180 seconds is safe and associated with a significantly reduced risk for iron deficiency at 4 months, which may have neurodevelopmental effects at a later age...|$|R
40|$|Background Obesity is {{increasing}} worldwide {{and is a}} major contributor to morbidity and mortality. Notably, abdominal (central) obesity carries a high risk of obesity-related diseases, while peripheral fat accumulation can act in a protective manner. A redistribution of fat from peripheral to central depots is seen after the menopause and is associated with an increasing prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A key mediator may be ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. Our hypothesis was that a Palaeolithic-type diet (PD) consumed ad libitum improves body composition and metabolic risk markers, including liver fat and insulin sensitivity, in obese postmenopausal women. Methods In study I the study subjects (n= 10) used a PD during 5 weeks. In study II and III (n= 70) the effect of a Palaeolithic-type diet (PD) was compared to a diet according to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations diet (NNR) during a 2 -year randomized clinical trial (RCT). Food records and nitrogen excretion in urine validated food intake. Anthropometric measurements were performed in a standardized manner. Body composition was calculated using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Total energy expenditure was calculated by accelerometry (Actiheart®) in combination with indirect calorimetry. Liver and muscle fat content was estimated by magnet resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS). Insulin sensitivity was measured either with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic <b>clamps</b> (<b>paper</b> I) or oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) (paper III). Results In study I a significant weight loss, linked to improved lipid and blood pressure levels, was associated with a 49 % decrease in liver fat. Concomitantly, hepatic insulin sensitivity improved, while peripheral insulin sensitivity (and muscle fat) was unaltered. In study II/III both groups had a significant and sustained weight loss after 2 years. The PD was more effective than the NNR diet regarding loss of weight and fat mass after 6 months, but not after 24 months. Serum triglyceride levels were significantly lower at 24 months in the PD group. Liver fat decreased throughout the study in both groups. Hepatic insulin sensitivity improved during the first 6 months of the study, while peripheral insulin sensitivity did not change. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was associated with liver fat at baseline, but not during the diet intervention. Energy expenditure did not change in any of the study groups. Conclusion Ad libitum diets can have sustained beneficial effects on weight and body composition in obese postmenopausal women, a PD being more effective on short-term than a diet according to the NNR. This is associated with a reduction in liver fat that may reduce the risk of future diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Further studies are needed in order to explore the association between liver fat and metabolic dysfunction, including insulin sensitivity...|$|R
40|$| {{following}} {{describes the}} construction of the measuring system: A LED power supplier controls the voltage signal to a blue LED (503 – 505 nm). A 20 × microscope (Newport, USA) objective focuses light from the LED onto the optical fiber, which is coupled to a blue filter leading the excitation light to the MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor (World Precision Instruments, USA). Fluorescence emission is conducted by the fibers and split by the fiber coupler again. When the red fluorescence signal reaches the PMT (Hamamatsu, Japan), the signals are transformed into electrical signals and conducted into a Lock-in-Amplifier (SRS 530). Then, the phase shift and fluorescence intensities are recorded by the computer and analyzed by imFLUX (YoungerUSA，USA). **PROCEDURE** Experimental measurements 1. Calibration of the optrode: We calibrated the optrode in the calibration medium with two different concentrations of oxygen (0 and 21 % oxygen). The phase angles of the fluorescence signals of these two concentrations were measured and a linear slope was calculated. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Equilibration of plant material: The 4 -day-old seedlings were dipped into the measuring buffer (½ MS liquid medium) for 30 minutes before measuring. - Immobilizing the plant material: The measurement of oxygen flux with the optrode occurs in an aqueous environment; therefore, we needed to immobilize the sample to avoiding unwanted stirring, and movement. The method used to immobilize the sample must be gentle enough to prevent mechanical damage to the tissues and allow free access of the optrode to measure the tissue. As shown in Figure 3 a, we used two small pieces of filter <b>paper</b> to <b>clamp</b> the root of Arabidopsis, leaving about 2 – 3 mm of the root tip free for microsensor measurement. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Adjusting the measuring position of the optrode by a stepper motor: Caution! The tip of the optrode sensor is fragile. Move the optrode gently to avoid breaking the tip. - At each measuring point, the optrode is vibrating between two positions at a distance of 30 μm (Figure 3 a). We set an optimal vibration frequency to avoid stirring and to obtain stable results with 2 seconds of quiet time before measuring and 1. 92 seconds of measurement at each position in our experiments. Thus, time of measurement at each position is 8. 6 seconds at each measuring point. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Start the measurement with a reference measure by placing the optrode in a background place, i. e., in the medium as far away from the sample as possible (Figure 3 b). When the base level of oxygen flux in the environment is steady at a baseline, move the tip of the optrode to a position near (5 μm) the periphery of the sample root (Figure 3 b). Measurement of oxygen flux in the background position and the rhizophere of Arabidopsis are shown in Figure 3 c. - Based on the aim of the experiment, we can adjust control probe positioning and angle of oscillation. As shown in Figure 4 a, we mapped the oxygen flux rate {{on the periphery of the}} root apical region in Arabidopsis. We also analyzed the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on the oxygen flux rate as shown in Figure 4 b. ### Timing - Steps 1 and 2 : 30 minutes to select an optimal vibration frequency and phase angle for measurement. - Step 3 : Equilibration requires 30 minutes. We can perform this step at the same time as steps 1 and 2. - Step 4 : 5 minutes - Step 5 : 20 minutes. - Steps 6 – 7 : 30 – 45 minutes for a single experiment. ### Troubleshooting Step 1 : - Problem: Large differences in empirical values; - Possible reasons: 1. The calibration medium was not bubbled enough. - 2. Contamination or inactivation at the optrode sensor tip. - Solution: 1. Bubble the medium with N 2 or air for a longer time. - 2. Clean the optrode or use a new one. Step 3 : - Problem: Roots are moving during the measurement. - Possible reasons: The access tip region is too long. - Solution: Leave only 2 – 3 mm of the root tip free. Step 5 : - Problem: Unsettled results. - Possible reasons: 1. The optrode is not fixed properly on the stepper motor. - 2. The quiet time for measurement is too short. - Solution: 1. Fix it tightly. - 2. Prolong the quiet time to avoid possible stirring effects. ### Anticipated Results Roots are heterotrophic tissues in plant bodies, taking up oxygen from the environment for growth and metabolism. The rhizosphere oxygen flux results in a net influx value in experiments (Figure 2 C). As shown in Figure 3 A, the peak oxygen influx value occurred 0. 2 mm back from the root tip, coinciding with the root apical transition zone, which has also a peak value of auxin influx and high cell elongation and development rate (18, 19 20). Lack of NADPH-oxidase results in a reduced root elongation and may alter respiratory activity at the rhizophere of the apical root elongation zone (13, 14). The oxygen influx rate is reduced significantly in the atrbohD/F double mutant (Figure 3 A). Dark-grown seedlings have a low respiratory rate and metabolism at the root meristem and elongation zone (15). Thus, the oxygen influx rate in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings is significantly decreased (Figure 3 A). H 2 O 2, a typical ROS signal molecule, also changes the rhizosphere oxygen flux dramatically (Figure 3 B). **CONCLUSION** In conclusion, we describe here a real-time and non-invasive probe system with highly sensitivity for detecting the oxygen flux rate in plant system. ### References 1.

Schematic diagram of the circuit of a SR optrode system**. ![Fig 2]([URL] "Fig 2 ") *Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of the SR optrode system in our study. The software, imFLUX, controls several basic components of this system, including adjusting the power supply, imaging with a digital camera, and managing the main component: the optrode system. We described {{the construction of}} the measuring system here: A LED power supplier controls the voltage signal to a blue LED (503 – 505 nm). An optical fiber coupled with a blue band-pass filter leads this excitation light to the MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor, which has the fluorescence reporter, PtTFPP, on the micro-tip. Fluorescence emission (630 – 640 nm) is conducted by the fibers and split by the fiber coupler again. When the red fluorescence signal reaches the PMT, the signals are multiplied and transformed into electrical signals and conducted into an amplifier. Then, the phase shift and fluorescence intensities are recorded by the computer and analyzed by imFLUX*. **Figure 3 : Setting the measuring chamber and me...|$|R
