We find {{that there are a}} lot of evaporation components in the alkaline <b>phenol</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> bonded sand, and they can be effectively removed by drying or baking. The loss of ignition of the sand before and after the mechanical regeneration can be reduced by the baking of alkaline <b>phenol</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> bonded sand; it also can improve the stripping rate of the reclaimed sand. The acid demand value of the reclaimed sand increases with the increasing of temperature and reaches the maximum at 500 °C, when the alkaline <b>phenol</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> bonded sand is baked below 500 °C, and then the acid demand value of the regenerated sand reduces when the baking temperature increases. The tensile strength of alkaline <b>phenol</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> bonded sand mixed by the regenerated sand obtained by the 360 °C baking and mechanical regeneration is higher than that of the sand mixed by the regenerated sand obtained by other methods in the case that the service time and the molding sand mixed by the base sand are the same, and has the best casting process performance...|$|R

The original porous {{carbon material}} (rice bran carbon, RBC) are manufactured by mixing the defatted rice bran with a <b>phenol</b> <b>resin,</b> pressure forming, drying, and then carbonizing at 900 °C.

In the first strengthening process, the mixture of the carbonized RB carbon particles and a <b>phenol</b> <b>resin</b> are then pressure formed to make a disk-shape RB carbon (CRB). Since the RB carbon particles are brittle and therefore they are broken during the pressure forming, the pore size can be smaller in the CRB than in the RBC.

Therefore, FRP rods have been developed by using high heat resistant resin. The, heat-resistant resin is of two kinds; CP resin and <b>phenol</b> <b>resin.</b> The heat resistance of FRP was evaluated by the pull out test and bending test, test results showed that new FRP rods maintain equal to or more than 50 % of bond strength at the temperature of Celsius. The bond stress of new FRP rod under high temperature showed around 40 % improvement as compared with conventional one. The results from the bending test showed that the reduction of ultimate strength under the temperature of 200 degree Celsius declined by 66 %, 41 % and 28 % in the specimens with epoxy resin, CP resin and <b>phenol</b> <b>resin</b> respectively. However, the ultimate strength at the normal temperature became lower than the design shear strength for the specimens with CP resin and the <b>phenol</b> <b>resin.</b> The bond property of AFRP was mainly influenced by the cut of the resin.

With the increase in bond property, the strength reduction of the specimens reinforced with FRP rods compared with ordinary specimen was found to decrease.
