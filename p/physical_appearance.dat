The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the <b>physical</b> <b>appearance</b> and behavior of characters encountered, and the <b>physical</b> <b>appearance</b> of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E

Trevor is shown to truly care about people very close to him, despite his psychotic actions.|$|E

5|$|The New Testament {{gives no}} {{description}} of the <b>physical</b> <b>appearance</b> of Jesus before his death—it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to {{the features of the}} people it mentions.

5|$|The {{decision}} was also made to bring Freddy's <b>physical</b> <b>appearance</b> {{closer to that}} of an actual burn victim, {{and the use of}} computer-generated imagery was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision.

5|$|The <b>physical</b> <b>appearance</b> of the Sirens is not {{described}} in the Odyssey, and the traditional Greek representation of them was as bird-lion or bird-human chimeras.

5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's <b>physical</b> <b>appearance</b> is not its only stark divergence from Mew.

The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with a male voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E
5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's <b>physical</b> <b>appearance</b> was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E

From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led {{to the production of}} several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.|$|E
