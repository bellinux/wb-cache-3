40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the results from the}} modelling of service life in a concrete structure after 30 years’ exposure under the seawater. Both the DuraCrete model and the ClinConc model were used for prediction of chloride <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles.</b> Actual chloride <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles</b> were measured from the cores taken from the structure. The chloride transport properties in the non-chloride contaminated part of the concrete were measured using the Rapid Chloride Migration Test (NT BUILD 492). The modelled chloride profiles were compared with the measured ones. The results show that the ClinConc model predicted the chloride penetration depths with an adequate accuracy. Based on the modelled results it can be concluded that alkali leaching can dramatically change chloride binding capacity, resulting in flat chloride <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles.</b> When using the DuraCrete model for predicting chloride <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles</b> the parameter for the surface chloride content has to be adjusted from the recommended value of 10. 3 to 3. 4 {{in order to make the}} predicted profiles comparable with the actually measured ones...|$|R

In the latter, the catalyst was exposed to KCl, K 2 SO 4, and ZnCl 2 by both wet impregnation with diluted salt solutions and deposition of generated submicrometer aerosol particles {{by means of an}} electrostatic field. The reactivity of freshly prepared and deactivated catalyst samples was examined in the SCR reaction, for which the influence of the different salts and the method of exposure were explored.

40|$|Field {{investigation}} studies, {{conducted in}} the context of safety analyses of deep geological repositories for nuclear waste, have pointed out that in fractured crystalline rocks sorbing radionuclides can diffuse surprisingly long distances deep into the intact rock matrix; i. e. much longer distances than those predicted by reactive transport models based on a homogeneous description of the properties of the rock matrix. Here, we focus on cesium diffusion and use detailed micro characterisation data, based on micro computed tomography, along with a grain-scale Inter-Granular Network model, to offer a plausible explanation for the anomalously long cesium <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles</b> observed in these in-situ experiments. The sparse distribution of chemically reactive grains (i. e. grains belonging to sorbing mineral phases) is shown to have a strong control on the diffusive patterns of sorbing radionuclides. The computed <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles</b> of cesium agree well with an analytical model based on two parallel diffusive pathways. This agreement, along with visual inspection of the spatial distribution of cesium concentration, indicates that for sorbing radionuclides the medium indeed behaves as a composite system, with most of the mass being retained close to the injection boundary and a non-negligible part diffusing faster along preferential diffusive pathways...|$|R

40|$|Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{to be one of}} the most promising repair materials due to its unique high ductility and tight crack width control. In concrete repairs, the shrinkage of repair materials is restrained by concrete substrate, and the repair material therefore often cracks. When ECC is used as repair material, the crack width is much smaller compared to normal concrete. The tight crack width of ECC retards the penetration of water and harmful substances and thus enhances the durability of concrete repairs. This paper is aimed to explore the chloride penetration in cracked ECC repairs and to assess the service life of the repair systems.

The <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles</b> of the hydrophilic dye fluoresceine and the lipophilic dye curcumin in a standard o/w emulsion were determined by tape stripping, in combination with spectroscopic measurements. Additionally, the penetration was investigated in vivo by laser scanning microscopy. Three different protocols (mode A-C) were used. In mode A, both dyes were applied onto the skin without water filtered infrared radiation. In mode B, the skin surface was irradiated by wIRA for 30 min before application. In case C, formulations were applied onto the skin and immediately irradiated for 30 min. In all cases, tape stripping started 30 min after application of the formulations. Significant differences were obtained for the <b>penetration</b> <b>profiles</b> of the hydrophilic dye in case of treatment or pretreatment with wIRA (modes B and C) compared to the non-irradiated skin areas (mode A).

40|$|To make paper {{products}} water repelling, a hydrophobic chemical, known as size, {{is added to}} the pulp slurry in the wet end of the paper machine. It can be shown that size prevents water from penetrating the fiber structure, by measuring the contact angle between a droplet of water and a sized paper surface. More sizing will result in higher contact angle and thus less penetration. The traditional view on the penetration of water based inks, is that the ink behaves as water in terms of penetration. Thus, it is considered that sizing has the effect of preventing water based inks from penetrating paper. However, studies made by Viet Hoang and Huy Ly at the Australian Pulp and Paper Institute, APPI, revealed that normal sizing had no effect on the penetration of water based inks. The present work was an extended study of the effect of sizing on the ink <b>penetration</b> <b>profile</b> of water based inks. It was decided to study the effect of four levels of sizing on the penetration depth of two water-based inks. As the effect of refining and pressing was also believed to {{have an effect on the}} penetration depth, three levels of each were included in the study. Pulp provided by the Australian Paper’s Maryvale mill was beaten in the Valley Beater to three different Canadian standard freeness values. Unsized and sized hand sheets were made in the Moving Belt Drainage Former and were wet pressed to three different levels. The measured paper properties were contact angle, grammage and thickness. Sheets from different refining and pressing groups were then printed in full tone with yellow Hewlett-Packard and magenta Epson inks. The ink <b>penetration</b> <b>profile</b> was then analyzed using the confocal microscope. The results show that when printing with water-based yellow and magenta inks the effect of sizing on the penetration depth was generally insignificant. This shows that water-based inks do not behave as water when penetrating the paper sheet. Thus, sizing can not be applied to prevent ink from penetrating paper. The only cases where a clear decrease in penetration, due to sizing, could be seen, was for sheets made from pulp with a low level of refining and for highly wet pressed sheets.
