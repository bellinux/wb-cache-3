In the following pages this question was addressed by studying {{the resemblance}} of the surface pressure fields, obtained by NCEP reanalyses, corresponding to ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events over 5 Italian climatic areas. Such ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events were selected by means of 45 daily precipitation records covering the period from 1951 to 2000. Two <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> that resemble one another are termed soft-analogues in this paper. The mathematical measures {{used to assess the}} difference between two <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were: the root-mean-square difference, the correlation, and the S 1 score. The comparison outcomes were categorized into classes according to the previous measures. Once a couple of the <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were found to be good soft-analogues (that was a rare occurrence), these <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were compared with all <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> excluded by the initial selection being not associated with intense precipitation events. The few soft-analogues associated with ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events were found to be also softanalogue to several, and sometimes a great deal of, <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> not associated with the selected ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events...|$|R

The summer 2007 event played an important role in the record low sea ice extent which was recorded in September.

5000|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} tend to {{be smaller}} during the mid-summer, and largest in October in the Northern Hemisphere.

During the mature stage, the broadening <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> leads to some reduction in their maximum sustained wind, but the extent of their tropical storm and hurricane-force winds is the most extensive within the storm's life cycle. [...] An increase in size is also noted as a tropical cyclone gains latitude. [...] As tropical cyclones weaken, their ROCI values diminish. In general, the size of a tropical cyclone shows little relation to its intensity.
