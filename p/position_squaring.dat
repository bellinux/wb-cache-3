30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 8 that among the four {{different}} shape models, the 10 positioning times of the square and circular models are generally relatively small. In this paper, the time average of the positioning calculation of each model is calculated according to the data of Fig.  8. The result shows that the average positioning time of the square is 8850  ms, the average positioning time of the circle is 8860  ms, the average positioning time of the triangle is 9700  ms, and the positioning time of the regular hexagon is 9630  ms. The positioning time of <b>positioning</b> <b>square</b> and circular is smaller. Therefore, when the same size is available, the real time of locating squares and circles is greater than that of triangles and hexagons.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} half-BPS {{sector of the}} AdS/CFT correspondence. In the full sector of the correspondence, on-shell actions in type IIB supergravity have been played crucial roles, for example in the GKP-Witten relation. We derive, {{therefore}} an on-shell action that reproduces a class of half-BPS solutions found by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena. These solutions describe the bubbling geometries in the supergravity. We show that this on-shell action for the LLM solutions is dual to the classical limit of an observable of the N free fermions in a harmonic oscillator potential in 1 + 1 dimensions. The observable consists of three parts: an expectation value of the total energy, matrix elements of the momentum squared, and matrix elements of the <b>position</b> <b>squared.</b> Our results suggest that there exists a holographic correspondence on a two-dimensional surface in the bubbling geometries. ...|$|R

40|$|Inertial {{microfluidics}} is {{a promising}} tool for many lab-on-a-chip applications. Particles in channel flows with Reynolds numbers above one undergo cross-streamline migration to a discrete set of equilibrium <b>positions</b> in <b>square</b> and rectangular channel cross sections. This effect {{has been used}} extensively for particle sorting and the analysis of particle properties. Using the lattice Boltzmann method, we determine equilibrium <b>positions</b> in <b>square</b> and rectangular cross sections and classify their types of stability for different Reynolds numbers, particle sizes, and channel aspect ratios. Our findings thereby help to design microfluidic channels for particle sorting. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an axial control force, which slows down the particles, shifts the stable equilibrium position towards the channel center. Ultimately, the particles then stay on the centerline for forces exceeding a threshold value. This effect is sensitive to particle size and channel Reynolds number and therefore suggests an efficient method for particle separation. In combination with a hysteretic feedback scheme, we can even increase particle throughput...|$|R
