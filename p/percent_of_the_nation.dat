The paper sought out to establish the comparative export performance of Uganda’s main agricultural exports. The paper adopted a Shift Share Analysis (SSA) methodology, where Uganda’s agricultural trade was decomposed into four components (i. e.

The study focused on the top agricultural exports that contribute an average <b>of</b> 35 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> export earnings, thus Coffee, Refined Sugar, Tobacco, Black tea, Palm oil and Vegetable fats &oils. These products were studied at the 6 -digit HS level. The findings revealed that although Uganda gained market share for its main agricultural exports, such growth was marginal, and that much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural export earnings were dominated by one agricultural commodity. The study also revealed that in the BRICs trading Bloc, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural exports were destined for India and the Russian federation, with less destined to high growth markets like China...|$|R
