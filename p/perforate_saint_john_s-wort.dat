50|$|The <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Ponds are a {{chain of}} shallow lakes at the {{headwaters}} of the Baker Branch <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River in the North Maine Woods. The flow sequence is from the Upper First <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, through the Lower First <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, Second <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, Third <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, and Fourth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond to the Fifth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond. Flow from one pond to the next is sometimes called Baker Stream rather than the Baker Branch <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River. Great Northern Paper Company dug a canal from Fifth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond 2 mi eastward to the North Branch Penobscot River in 1939, and built a dam {{at the north end of}} Fifth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond so pulpwood logs harvested in the upper <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River watershed could be floated down the Penobscot River to Millinocket, Maine. The canal and dam have fallen into disrepair so most drainage from the ponds again flows down the <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River. All upstream ponds with the exception of the first had dams to regulate discharge flow for log driving, but those dams have similarly fallen into disrepair. Moose use the ponds as summer refuge from heat and biting insects.|$|R

50|$|The riding {{was created}} in the 1973 {{redistribution}} and was called East <b>Saint</b> <b>John.</b> The riding was created from the two member district of <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> East, which was divided into this riding and Saint John-Fundy. Under the 1994 redistribution the riding was largely unchanged, losing some territory to Saint John-Fundy while gaining other small parts from Saint John-Fundy and <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Park. It was renamed <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Champlain as parts of the City of <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> known locally as East <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> had been moved out of the district. In 2006, the district boundaries were again changed, losing some territory to adjacent districts but taking in all of what is known as East Saint John; as a result, its name was changed to <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> East. At the 2013 redistribution, the riding was altered significantly with nearly half of its population moving to the north to join <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Portland, being replaced by territory gained from the abolished district of Saint John-Fundy.|$|R
