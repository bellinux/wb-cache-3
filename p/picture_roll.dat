During this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Due to his limited joint mobility, Renoir also used a moving canvas, or <b>picture</b> <b>roll,</b> to facilitate painting large works.|$|E
50|$|Since {{picture and}} sound are usually {{recorded}} separately, the editor must synchronize them. The editor loads one <b>picture</b> <b>roll</b> onto a film plate and its corresponding magnetic roll onto a sound plate. Then he advances {{the film to}} find the frame where the {{two parts of the}} Clapperboard came together. The editor repeats the process on the magnetic roll to find the frame with the clap sound. Once found, he marks the frame on both rolls as the synchronization point, and switches the flatbed to interlock mode. From then on, both picture and sound rolls advance or reverse by exactly the same amount to maintain synchronization.|$|E
5000|$|Blair's {{new company}} {{supplied}} European filmmaking pioneers, including Birt Acres, Robert Paul, George Albert Smith, Charles Urban, and the Lumiere Brothers. By 1896 {{the new movie}} projector required a fully transparent film base that Blair's American operation could not supply. Eastman shortly thereafter bought the company out and became the leading supplier of film stock. Louis Lumiere worked with Victor Planchon to adapt the Lumiere [...] "Blue Label" [...] (Etiquette Bleue) photographic plate emulsion for use on celluloid roll film, which began in early 1896. Eastman's first motion picture film stock was offered in 1889. At first the film {{was the same as}} photographic film. By 1916, separate [...] "Cine Type" [...] films were offered. From 1895, Eastman supplied their motion <b>picture</b> <b>roll</b> film in rolls of 65 feet, while Blair's rolls were 75 feet. If longer lengths were needed, the unexposed negative rolls could be cemented in a darkroom, but this was largely undesirable by most narrative filmmakers. The makers of Actuality films were much more eager to undertake this method, however, in order to depict longer actions, and created cemented rolls as long as 1000 feet. American Mutoscope and Biograph was the first known company to use this for the Jeffries-Sharkey fight on November 3, 1899.|$|E

6000|$|Luckily we {{have with}} us among our things Uncle's easel and his paints that he used in Berlin. He had always to have special things because he doesn't use little brushes and tubes of colour as {{ordinary}} artists do, but had a big brush and his paint in a tin can, {{so that he can}} work more quickly. Fortunately {{we have with}} us three of Uncle's <b>pictures</b> <b>rolled</b> up in the bottom of our boxes. He is going to sell these first and after that he says that he will paint one or two every day.

5000|$|The Kiev 60 is {{sometimes}} modified to shoot with a 6&times;4.5 frame size, often called [...] "Kiev 645" [...] or similar, yielding more <b>pictures</b> per <b>roll</b> of film in a [...] "print-friendly" [...] rectangular format versus the original camera's square 6&times;6 format. But since the film feeds sideways, the 6&times;4.5 variant produces photos in the portrait aspect, {{as opposed to}} the landscape aspect seen in most other cameras. The Kiev 88 can shoot the 6&times;4.5 frame size by simply using a different film back. The 6&times;4.5 film back is interchangeable with others for 6&times;6 and other frame sizes, while the Kiev 60 modification is permanent.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} US theatrical {{version of}} the film was significantly shorter than the original version released overseas. About ten minutes were cut. The biggest difference is in the ending. In the American release, the credits roll shortly after the climax, even though <b>picture</b> continues to <b>roll,</b> showing certain conversations with music covering the dialogue. In the longer cut, there are denouement scenes.|$|R
5000|$|When {{they came}} into contact with the Muslims, they learned about the teachings of Islam. Subanens of Lapuyan had early contact with the Spaniards who built a {{garrison}} in Margosatubig during the mid-19th century; a school for the natives was opened by Spanish priests but the Subanens misunderstood the message of Christianity. They were scared to see a stick (the cross) with a dead man (Jesus) on it. The cross, which they called [...] "karehus", was interpreted differently; the early Catholic missionaries were thought of as cannibals. With the coming of the Americans, Protestant missionaries brought big <b>picture</b> <b>rolls</b> showing among others, the baby Jesus and the Mother Mary. The old folks associated these stories with their own tribal beliefs of a “Diwata” or God-child, a savior of mankind. With this understanding, Subanen elders now encouraged their children to go to the mission school run by these American missionaries. In 1912, Mr. & Mrs. David O. Lund opened a mission school in Sunglupa in the village of Thimuay Imbing, now a part of the Municipality of Lapuyan. Thimuay Imbing accepted the new religion, a Protestant denomination of the Christian and Missionary Alliance whose headquarters were located in Nyac, New York, in 1914; they constructed a semi-permanent-building called the Pampang Tabernacle where the Subanen worshipped. Next to the Tetuan Church in Zamboanga City, the Lapuyan Tabernacle became the first Alliance Church in Mindanao, if not the entire Philippines. There were further changes in the way of life of the Subanen in Lapuyan with the opening of government schools in 1919.|$|R

50|$|Half frame {{meant that}} the camera used an 18&times;24 mm {{vertical}} (portrait) format, producing twice the <b>pictures</b> on a <b>roll</b> of 135 film as the regular 36&times;24 mm format. The smaller image format also allowed for a smaller camera and lenses, making the Pen F system {{one of the smallest}} SLR systems ever made; the Pentax Auto 110 was smaller, but with a much more limited range of lenses and accessories, and smaller 110 film.|$|R

5000|$|A {{roll of the}} American Game Boy Printer paper came in red, blue, {{yellow and}} white, with an {{adhesive}} backing. It had a width of 38mm and a diameter of 30mm, with a 12mm cardboard spindle in the centre. A typical roll had 390-400 cm of length. When a picture printed from the Game Boy Camera, it would print with a [...]5 cm margin {{above and below the}} picture and print the picture at a 2.3 cm height. This would give the total of 3.3 cm height per picture. The Game Boy Printer paper refills boasted up to 180 <b>pictures</b> per <b>roll.</b> With the math the typical roll could only take 118 pictures. The paper is now hard to find; it could be substituted with a 1.5 in thermal paper without repercussions on the printer.|$|R

50|$|The Brownie camera, {{introduced}} in February 1900, invented low-cost photography by introducing {{the concept of}} the snapshot to the masses.

50|$|The {{next day}} the Blank {{attempted}} to rob an armored car. One of the guards was prepared with a gas bomb, but the Blank had brought a gas mask. Removing the guard's mask, the Blank knocked him out then took over the controls of the armored truck. However, FBI agents led by Ray Donovan had been monitoring the truck and began to pursue him. Spider-Man had been trailing the FBI and reached the Blank first, knocking over the truck. The Blank emerged from the vehicle for another fight, but Spider-Man dodged his bullets. The Blank knocked over a lamp post to slow Spider-Man down, but the hero saved the bystanders who had been imperiled. Catching up to the Blank, Spider-Man unleashed a torrent of webbing until it became so thick that the Blank was encased within a sphere of webbing. Spider-Man took some <b>pictures</b> and <b>rolled</b> the Blank into the FBI's hands.|$|R

Exeunt the image of Mrs. Kittridge, with her hands floury from the bread she has been moulding, and the dry, ropy, lean Captain, who has been sitting tilting back in a splint-bottomed chair,--and the next scene comes rolling in. It is a chamber in the house of Zephaniah Pennel, whose windows present a blue panorama of sea and sky. Through two windows you look forth into the blue belt of Harpswell Bay, bordered on the farther edge by Harpswell Neck, dotted here and there with houses, among which rises the little white meeting-house, like a mother-bird among a flock of chickens. The third window, {{on the other side of}} the room, looks far out to sea, where only a group of low, rocky islands interrupts the clear sweep of the horizon line, with its blue infinitude of distance.|$|R

50|$|Indang was {{dedicated}} under the chaplaincy of Pope St. Gregory the Great (also San Gregorio Magno). In one incident, the local parish priest found a big <b>rolled</b> <b>picture</b> {{at the back}} of the church together with burnt trash. It was found out to be a painting of the seven archangels. Since then, the devotion to the archangels also grew in the town together with the intercession of St. Gregory the Great making the parish of Indang with eight patrons. The icon of the archangels is currently found at the right side of the altar. Since then, several miracles are attributed to St. Gregory and the seven archangels including the peaceful stay of the Japanese soldiers during the war and a failed attempt to raid the town from bandits.|$|R
50|$|Medium-format film {{is usually}} roll film, {{typically}} allowing 8 to 32 exposures on one {{roll of film}} before reloading is needed. This is fewer than 35 mm cartridges, which typically take 12 to 36 <b>pictures</b> on one <b>roll.</b> This is somewhat offset {{by the fact that}} most medium-format systems used interchangeable film magazines, thereby allowing users to switch rolls quickly, allowing them larger numbers of exposures before needing to load new film, or to change film type. Some companies had bulk film backs that used 70mm double-perforated that allowed up to 75 feet of film to be loaded at one time. While rolls of large format film were produced at one time, their use was specialized, typically for aerial cameras installed in military aircraft or printing industry equipment.|$|R
50|$|The rotary shutter and {{the film}} drive are like those used in cine cameras. When the shutter release is pressed, a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector; when the {{pressure}} is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens, and the spring motor advances the film and recocks the shutter. This is almost instantaneous. With practice a photographer could take 4 or 5 pictures a second. Each winding of the spring motor was good for about 25 <b>pictures,</b> half a <b>roll</b> of film. Shutter speed was determined by spring tension and mechanical delay since the exposure sector was fixed. The Robot I had an exposure range of 1 to 1/500, and provision for time exposures.|$|R
