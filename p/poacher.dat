5|$|Lad: A Dog is a 1962 American drama film {{based on}} the 1919 novel {{of the same name}} written by Albert Payson Terhune. Starring Peter Breck, Peggy McCay, Carroll O'Connor, and Angela Cartwright, the film blends several of the short stories {{featured}} in the novel, with the heroic Lad winning a rigged dog show, saving a handicapped girl from a snake, and capturing a <b>poacher</b> who killed his pups and injured one of his owners. Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for the novel from Vanguard Productions, and acquired the film rights for the other two Lad novels from the late Terhune's wife.|$|E
5|$|R. s. annamiticus, {{known as}} the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros, Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticu or Vietnamese rhinoceros, once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific annamiticus {{is derived from the}} Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range. In 2006, a single population, {{estimated}} at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago. The last individual of this population was shot by a <b>poacher</b> in 2010.|$|E
50|$|When the Warden {{returns to}} his cottage the animals assume that the <b>poachers</b> will not return, {{unfortunately}} the <b>poachers</b> are unaware the Warden is back and decide to hunt foxes {{in areas where the}} deer are not present. Fox then lures the <b>poachers</b> to the Warden's cottage while Tawny Owl tells the Great White Stag about the <b>poachers.</b> The deer then prevent the <b>poachers</b> escaping while the Warden and his guest the Vet detain them.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} the Warden becomes ill so {{both he and}} his cat leave the park. However, in his absence two <b>poachers</b> with {{shotguns}} enter the park and start hunting the white deer. Fox is able to defeat the <b>poachers</b> by 'chasing' the deer near a frozen pond, when the <b>poachers</b> run onto this pond the ice breaks and they lose their shotguns while trying to climb out. However the <b>poachers</b> return with pistols and start shooting every fox they see. This time the deer save the foxes by charging en masse at the <b>poachers.</b>|$|R

5|$|After his return, Lad is bred {{with another}} prize-winning collie, Lady, {{and they have}} two male puppies which are named Little Lad and Wolf. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they {{are old enough to}} leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad. However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a <b>poacher</b> Lad fought and chased off the {{property}} before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy Little Lad, and refuses {{to have anything to do}} with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} <b>poacher.</b> Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E
5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a <b>poacher</b> would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
50|$|Bug <b>poachers</b> {{have demanded}} up to $30,000 to share how they {{breached}} the system. <b>Poachers</b> do not immediately destroy or release stolen data. Some may {{choose not to}} pay bug <b>poachers</b> since they do not typically release the stolen data. However, {{you will need to}} hope that the data is not leaked.|$|R
50|$|In 1851, a gang {{of forty}} or so <b>poachers</b> {{assembled}} in Rufford Park as a mass action against what was {{perceived to be the}} unfair monopolising of game-hunting rights by wealthy landowners. The <b>poachers</b> were attacked by ten gamekeepers and, in the ensuing battle, one of the gamekeepers was badly injured and later died of a fractured skull. Four of the poachers' ringleaders were arrested and each subsequently sentenced to deportation and fourteen years of penal servitude for manslaughter. The incident gave rise to the popular ballad, Rufford Park <b>Poachers</b> (Roud #1759), which depicts the <b>poachers</b> as bold heroes.|$|R
50|$|In late February 2014, Brimob Special Police {{shot dead}} two <b>poachers,</b> when they opened fire with their {{homemade}} firearms. The <b>poachers</b> attempted to hunt {{deer in the}} park which fall prey to Komodo dragons.|$|R
25|$|Since 2008, {{reports of}} {{poaching}} {{had occurred in}} Annaberg, with eight cases of poaching being reported. In March 2011, a <b>poacher</b> {{was caught in the}} act by a hunter, but the <b>poacher</b> attacked the hunter and managed to escape. An investigation was launched, but the identity of the <b>poacher</b> remained unknown. Huber was known to be a <b>poacher</b> and had left dead animal heads on the roads to defy police and legal hunters. His hunting licence was said to have been revoked.|$|E

In the fall of 1962, Sea <b>Poacher</b> was deployed with other Atlantic Fleet units maintaining the quarantine imposed on Cuba during the missile crisis.|$|E
50|$|The park {{had serious}} {{problems}} with <b>poachers</b> in the 1980s and 1990s. George Adamson {{and two of his}} assistants were murdered by <b>poachers</b> in the park in 1989. Adamson is buried in the park.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, <b>poachers</b> {{tried to}} kill the rhinos staying in the forest but failed in their attempt due to Molai who alerted {{department}} officials. Officials promptly seized various articles used by the <b>poachers</b> to trap the animals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{brilliant}} pink {{color of}} the Helonias flowers attracts <b>poachers.</b> Helonias is a perennial and endures the winter, making it more visible to the <b>poachers.</b> This {{is one of the}} reasons why Helonias is considered a threatened species.|$|R

25|$|The North Korean foreign {{language}} service Voice of Korea began to broadcast on the E03 Lincolnshire Poacher's former frequency, 11545kHz, in 2006, possibly to deliberately interfere with its propagation. However, Lincolnshire <b>Poacher</b> broadcasts on three different frequencies, {{and the remaining}} two have not been interfered with. The apparent target zone for the Lincolnshire <b>Poacher</b> signals originating in Cyprus was the Middle East, not the Far East, which is covered by its sister station, E03a Cherry Ripe.|$|E

5000|$|The ride {{originally}} {{included a}} scripted portion where the safari truck - callsign [...] "Simba-1" [...] - would be contacted by a habitat warden and a scientist {{to hunt down}} <b>poachers</b> that had captured a mother elephant and her child - Big Red and Little Red, respectively. The <b>poachers</b> would have been captured at gunpoint by another cast member, a warden. This element of the attraction was eventually eliminated and replaced with scaring off the <b>poachers</b> after a pursuit.|$|R
50|$|Another newly {{realised}} {{danger of}} geotagging is the location information provided to criminal gangs and <b>poachers</b> on {{the whereabouts of}} often endangered animals. This can effectively make tourists scouts for these <b>poachers,</b> so geotagging should be turned off when photographing these animals.|$|R
25|$|In 1988 {{the station}} {{commissioned}} UK jingle producer Alfasound {{to compose a}} jingle package based on the traditional English folk song The Lincolnshire <b>Poacher,</b> continuing on this theme until 2006.|$|E

25|$|Following {{underway}} trials, training, and shakedown in the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, areas, Sea <b>Poacher</b> transited the Panama Canal {{and arrived}} at Pearl Harbor on 25 October 1944. Although her first two war patrols were unproductive, during the third, conducted in the Kuril Islands area, Sea <b>Poacher</b> torpedoed and sank a Japanese trawler and, four days later, sent two fishing boats to the bottom in a surface attack. During the latter action, three crewmen were injured when the 20millimeter gun exploded. Due to the seriousness of their injuries, the patrol was terminated ahead of schedule, and the submarine returned to Midway.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, Sea <b>Poacher</b> {{concluded}} her {{service with}} a -month deployment {{to the eastern}} and northern Atlantic areas to participate in antisubmarine training exercises with units of the Spanish and Portuguese navies. Upon returning to Key West, the submarine operated locally and in the Caribbean until 20 October when she set sail for Philadelphia and in-activation. Sea <b>Poacher</b> was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine AGSS-306 on 1 November, decommissioned on 15 November 1969, and {{was assigned to the}} Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia.
