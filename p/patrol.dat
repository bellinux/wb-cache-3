5|$|First Class : This {{advancement}} badge is {{the first}} advancement badge that places the Scout {{in a position of}} leadership and organisation. A Scout is required to plan and run a wide game for their <b>Patrol,</b> a <b>Patrol</b> camp, an overnight <b>Patrol</b> hike for which a log book must be written, a programme to teach younger Scouts in their <b>Patrol</b> about pioneering, and they need to assist in the planning of a Scouts' Own.|$|E
5|$|Scout Troops {{are divided}} into Patrols of between four and ten Scouts, with six being a common size. The <b>Patrol</b> Leader and Second have many {{responsibilities}} in training younger Scouts and helping plan and run the programme. <b>Patrol</b> Leaders {{are in charge of}} planning and running (often with no adult intervention) <b>Patrol</b> camps and outings, they are also required to assist their <b>Patrol</b> members through the Scout advancement program.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG now began {{a series}} of patrols behind the Axis lines. Near the end of July 'T' <b>Patrol</b> left for the desert to the south of the Gulf of Sirte. One 'T' <b>Patrol</b> truck managed to observe the main coastal road, along which Axis traffic was passing. They were {{followed}} two or three weeks later by 'S' <b>Patrol,</b> who carried out a similar reconnaissance between Jalo oasis and Agedabia. Both patrols returned safely to Kufra without being discovered. In August 1941 'R' <b>Patrol</b> relieved 'G' and 'Y' Patrols at Siwa and was joined by 'T' <b>Patrol</b> in October.|$|E
50|$|Some MAP <b>patrols</b> use a {{combination}} of foot <b>patrols</b> and vehicle <b>patrols</b> depending on the volatility of the area.|$|R
50|$|Originally the Beach was <b>patrolled</b> {{by women}} only. Later on, {{men and women}} <b>patrolled</b> on {{alternate}} weekends and mixed <b>patrols</b> began in the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — in {{the later}} {{traditional}} manual <b>patrolling</b> methods were used for housing security <b>patrolling,</b> traffic <b>patrolling.</b> Such kind of <b>patrolling</b> technologies and management tools are badly lagging behind, {{and it is not}} matched with the status of national cost-effective development. So such areas are required urgently some new type of electronic <b>patrolling</b> techniques and equipment to overcome the traditional method of <b>patrolling.</b> This paper describes a wireless networks based road traffic control system for <b>patrolling.</b> The advanced <b>patrolling</b> system consists of Global Positioning System technology, wireless network technology, consisting of moveable GPS devices, data network Communication systems and information management system components. Such portable GPS device can receive the local GPS information at the time of <b>patrolling,</b> and can upload GPS data or some alarm signals to the information management center using wireless communication network, receiver will received data and were displayed the information on the electronic map, achieving real-time electronic check of the management...|$|R
5|$|The {{youth leader}} of the troop is the senior <b>patrol</b> leader (SPL), elected by the Scouts in the troop. He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of the troop, runs troop meetings and ensures that the program for troop meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. There may also be one or more assistant senior <b>patrol</b> leaders. Each <b>patrol</b> elects a <b>patrol</b> leader who then appoints an assistant <b>patrol</b> leader and other positions within the <b>patrol.</b> Together, the senior <b>patrol</b> leader, assistant senior <b>patrol</b> leader and <b>patrol</b> leaders make up the <b>patrol</b> leaders council (PLC), the group of Scouts that is responsible for developing the troop's program with the advice of the Scoutmaster.|$|E
5|$|After making {{way to the}} {{submarine}} base at Brioni, U-41 set out on another <b>patrol</b> into the Mediterranean on 29 August, but put into Sebenico the next day for engine repairs. Resuming her <b>patrol</b> after a day's delay, U-41 reached her <b>patrol</b> area east of Malta. Wolf and U-41 scored their first success on 13 September, when they torpedoed and sank the steamer Amiral Charner west of Pantellaria. The 4,604-ton French ship was carrying horses and a general cargo from Marseilles for Salonika when she was attacked. Six {{were killed in the}} attack on the French ship. On 26 September, U-41 attacked another steamer west of Kefalonia, but was apparently unsuccessful. U-41 ended her <b>patrol</b> at Cattaro on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|After {{the seizure}} of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air <b>patrol</b> operations {{in support of the}} no-fly zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone <b>patrol</b> in his F-16. While on <b>patrol,</b> O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E
50|$|Venice is <b>patrolled</b> by the Venice Police Department, Tom Mattmuller is {{the current}} Chief of Police. The small {{department}} has special units for bike <b>patrols,</b> traffic <b>patrols,</b> and boat <b>patrols,</b> amongst the normal police services provided. There are a total of 47 sworn officers that protect the citizens of Venice.|$|R
50|$|Ursa {{undertook}} regular anti-gunrunning <b>patrols</b> off Cyprus. <b>Patrolling</b> the island, {{in company}} {{with other members}} of the squadron, the object of the <b>patrols</b> was trying to thwart the efforts of EOKA (terrorist groups who were fighting for independence from British rule). These <b>patrols</b> were generally of six weeks duration, and then a relief.|$|R
25|$|Fieldcraft {{and tactics}} - The {{development}} and practise of the recruit's Individual and Fieldcraft skills continues. Tactical instruction begins with Basic <b>Patrolling</b> Techniques before moving onto Recce <b>Patrols,</b> Observation Posts, Fighting <b>Patrols</b> and Ambushes.|$|R
5|$|As the American {{troops were}} {{attempting}} to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his <b>patrol</b> with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A <b>patrol</b> with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's <b>patrol</b> base.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Ichiki sent forward his own <b>patrol</b> of 38 men, led by his {{communications}} officer, to reconnoiter Allied troop dispositions {{and establish a}} forward communications base. Around 12:00 on August 19 at Koli Point, Brush's <b>patrol</b> sighted and ambushed the Japanese <b>patrol,</b> killing all but five of its members, who escaped back to Taivu. The Marines suffered three dead and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|Carlson's <b>patrol,</b> {{also known}} as The Long <b>Patrol</b> or Carlson's long <b>patrol,</b> was an {{operation}} by the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion {{under the command of}} Evans Carlson during the Guadalcanal Campaign against the Imperial Japanese Army from 6 November to 4 December 1942. In the operation, the 2nd Raiders attacked forces under the command of Toshinari Shōji, which were escaping from an attempted encirclement in the Koli Point area on Guadalcanal and attempting to rejoin other Japanese army units {{on the opposite side of}} the U.S. Lunga perimeter.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Rangers are a {{volunteer}} force {{made up of}} Inuit, First Nations, Métis and non-Aboriginals; however, {{it is a common}} misconception that the organization is a First Nations entity. The ethnic make-up of the numerous <b>patrols</b> across Canada is entirely an element of geography and while there is a heavy First Nations membership in many Canadian Ranger <b>patrols</b> (many being entirely First Nations), there also exist many mixed race <b>patrols</b> and some all-white <b>patrols,</b> simply due to where the <b>patrols</b> reside.|$|R
50|$|<b>Patrolling</b> is {{the most}} common {{infantry}} mission. Full-scale attacks and defensive efforts are occasional, but <b>patrols</b> are constant. <b>Patrols</b> consist of small groups of infantry moving about in areas of possible enemy activity to locate the enemy and destroy them when found. <b>Patrols</b> are used not only on the front-lines, but in rear areas where enemy infiltration or insurgencies are possible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Patrols</b> {{consist of}} four {{different}} Micromasters, each transforming into a vehicle. <b>Patrols</b> are specifically themed.|$|R
5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} <b>patrol</b> duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after positive identification. The aims of her <b>patrol</b> were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general <b>patrol</b> and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a <b>patrol</b> leader elected from within the <b>patrol.</b> <b>Patrol</b> {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each <b>patrol</b> may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E
5|$|Hillcourt {{worked at}} a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in Harriman State Park, New York, in 1926 where he became an {{instructor}} in American Indian dance. He then worked for the BSA Supply Division where he broke his leg when a crate fell on him. He met James West while working at the national office. West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues {{with the lack of}} <b>patrol</b> structure and leadership. He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for <b>patrol</b> leaders, and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a <b>patrol</b> leader and a Scoutmaster. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for <b>Patrol</b> Leaders which was published in 1929.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{immediately}} the <b>patrols</b> began. Operations from Sanderson consisted of <b>patrols</b> west, along the Rio Grande {{as far as}} Lajitas in the Big Bend, then turn and fly back. Eastbound <b>patrols</b> headed {{as far as the}} Devil’s River, then returned.|$|R
50|$|Several obituaries (e.g. The Annapolis Capital, Naval History Magazine) {{confused}} Rindskopf's eleven <b>patrols</b> onboard Drum as eleven <b>patrols</b> {{in command}} of Drum. He was only in command for <b>patrols</b> 10 and 11, yet he {{had a hand in}} every sinking in Drum's history.|$|R
50|$|Garie Beach is a <b>patrolled</b> {{beach in}} the lower Royal National Park, on the {{outskirts}} of southern Sydney, Australia. The beach is one of eleven beaches located within the territory of the Royal National Park. It is also one of three <b>patrolled</b> beaches in the park, with the Garie Surf Life Saving Club <b>patrolling</b> the beach on weekends and volunteer lifesavers from Surf Life Saving Australia <b>patrolling</b> on weekdays.|$|R
5|$|His duties {{included}} {{oversight of}} the Harvard Police <b>Patrol.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Australian and New Zealand Governments, at {{the request}} of Pacific Island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess {{surveillance}} and maritime <b>patrol</b> requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval <b>patrol</b> force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable <b>patrol</b> vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific <b>Patrol</b> Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E
5|$|In October 1967 the <b>Patrol</b> Leader Training Unit {{was formed}} to offer formal Leadership Training courses for Scout <b>Patrol</b> Leaders in the then Natal Division. The nine members {{comprising}} the original Unit were Dudley Forde , Fr Ian Laurenson, Lynn Reynolds, Paddy McDowell, Paul and Helen Bezencon, Ian Hoare, Tony Hornby and Bill Sewell.|$|E
50|$|Foot <b>Patrols</b> UOPD Officers and Community Service Officers conduct regular foot <b>patrols</b> in {{buildings}} and around campus, daily. The focus of these <b>patrols</b> is building security, personal safety {{of students and}} staff, and to maintain an active presence throughout the campus to deter crime.|$|R
5000|$|Deployments have {{included}} OP SHARPGUARD (Yugoslavia blockade), OP SIRIUS (Mediterranean <b>Patrols),</b> OP APOLLO (Persian Gulf region), and counter-narcotics <b>patrols</b> in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific. [...] Through all this, <b>patrols</b> of the Canadian Arctic {{continue to take}} advantage of the airframe's unique abilities.|$|R
500|$|In May, the Committee noted {{an attack}} on the German pocket {{battleship}} [...] Germany and Italy said they would withdraw from the Committee, and from the <b>patrols,</b> unless it could be guaranteed there would be no further attacks. Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and <b>patrols.</b> It continued to be a crime in Germany to mention German operations. Following attacks (attributed to Republicans by Germany, but denied) on the German cruiser [...] on 15 and 18 June, Germany and Italy once again withdrew from <b>patrols,</b> but not from the Committee. Discussions about <b>patrols</b> remained complicated. Britain and France offered to replace Germany and Italy in <b>patrols</b> of their sections, but the latter powers believed these <b>patrols</b> would be too partial.|$|R
5|$|In {{the evening}} of July 23, 1st Battalion sent a 30-man <b>patrol</b> northward to locate the North Koreans. Near Poun, the <b>patrol</b> spotted a North Korean column approaching. The platoon took up {{superior}} positions and ambushed the column as it passed with all its weapons. The North Koreans halted their advance, thinking they had encountered a major position, and held back until daylight. When they turned back, the US <b>patrol</b> returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04:00 on July 24. It suffered six men missing to {{an unknown number of}} North Korean casualties.|$|E
5|$|Local {{units are}} called {{squadron}}s. A squadron is broken into flights. Squadrons {{are the main}} functioning body of Civil Air <b>Patrol.</b> Civil Air <b>Patrol</b> squadrons are designated as either cadet, senior, or composite squadrons. A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and senior members, who {{may be involved in}} any of the three missions of Civil Air <b>Patrol.</b> Composite squadrons have two deputy commanders to assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only senior members, who participate in the emergency services or aerospace education missions of Civil Air <b>Patrol.</b> A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of senior members as necessary for supervision of cadets and the proper execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Mounted {{police have}} been used since the 18th century, and still are used {{worldwide}} to control traffic and crowds, <b>patrol</b> public parks, keep order in processionals and during ceremonies and perform general street <b>patrol</b> duties. Today, many cities still have mounted police units. In rural areas, horses are used by law enforcement for mounted patrols over rugged terrain, crowd control at religious shrines, and border <b>patrol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oakland County Sheriff's Department {{regularly}} <b>patrols</b> Thelma Spencer Park. Staff is {{also involved}} in security, with night <b>patrols</b> and surveillance.|$|R
50|$|Between 12 August 1943 and 27 August 1945 Billfish made eight war <b>patrols</b> out of Pearl Harbor. During these <b>patrols</b> {{she sank}} three freighters totaling 4,074 tons and five smaller craft. Part of her {{seventh and eighth}} <b>patrols</b> were spent on plane guard duty off Japan.|$|R
50|$|Slave <b>patrols</b> called patrollers, patterrollers, pattyrollers or paddy rollers, by the slaves, were {{organized}} groups {{of white men}} who monitored and enforced discipline upon black slaves in the antebellum U.S. southern states. The slave <b>patrols</b> function was to police slaves, especially runaways and defiant slaves. They also formed river <b>patrols</b> to prevent escape by boat. Slave <b>patrols</b> were first established in South Carolina in 1704, and the idea spread throughout the colonies.|$|R
