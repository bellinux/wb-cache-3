40|$|Mastitis is an {{inflammation}} of the mammary glands {{and in most cases}} it is caused by the presence of microorganisms. High mastitis rates in dairy cattle herds can cause an increase in total microorganism counts of bulk tank milk. The present paper was aimed at verifying whether the occurrence of mastitis in dairy cattle herds is reflected in raw-milk indicators of hygienic-sanitary quality. To observe the correlation among the analysed variables, we performed a logarithmical transformation (log 10) of different indicator counts of raw milk and compared them with the occurrence of mastitis in dairy cattle herds. Few correlations were observed among mastitis cases in dairy cattle herds and the raw-milk indicators of hygienic-sanitary quality. We observed a negative correlation between the log 10 of mesophilic aerobic <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> and psychotropic aerobic <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> when compared with the occurrence of no bacterial growth.

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of defoliation on microbial community structure, rhizosphere soil samples were taken pre-, and post-defoliation from the root tip and mature root regions of Trifolium repens L. and Lolium perenne L. Microbial DNA isolated from samples was used to generate polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis molecular profiles of bacterial and fungal communities. Bacterial <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> were also obtained. Neither plant species nor defoliation affected the bacterial and fungal community structures in both the root tip and mature root regions, but there were significant differences in the bacterial and fungal community profiles between the two root regions for each plant. Prior to defoliation, {{there was no difference between}} plants for bacterial <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> of soils from the root tip regions; however, counts were greater in the mature root region of L. perenne than T. repens. Bacterial <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> for T. repens were higher in the root tip than the mature root region. After defoliation, there was no effect of plant type, position along the root or defoliation status on bacterial <b>plate</b> <b>counts,</b> although there were significant increases in bacterial <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> with time. The results indicate that a general effect existed during maturation in the root regions of each plant, which had a greater impact on microbial community structure than either plant type or the effect of defoliation. In addition there were no generic consequences with regard to microbial populations in the rhizosphere as a response to plant defoliation...|$|R

40|$|Of three methods studied, brisk shaking {{of samples}} in {{dilution}} blanks {{by hand and}} homogenization by a stomacher were compared relative to their capacity to recover the endotoxins and viable bacteria; blending with a Waring blender was compared with these two methods only on the recovery of viable cells. Aerobic <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> were essentially the same by the three methods for fresh meats, with the stomacher producing slightly higher aerobic <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> and significantly higher gram-negative counts determined by violet red bile agar.

40|$|Whether Escherichia coli K- 12 strain W 3110 {{can enter}} the "viable but nonculturable" state was studied with sterile and nonsterile water and soil at various temperatures. In nonsterile river water, the <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> of added E. coli cells dropped to less than 10 CFU/ml in less than 10 days. Acridine orange direct counts, direct viable counts, most-probable-number estimates, and PCR {{analyses}} indicated that the added E. coli cells were disappearing from the water in parallel {{with the number of}} CFU. Similar results were obtained with nonsterile soil, although the decline of the added E. coli was slower. In sterile water or soil, the added E. coli persisted for much longer, often without any decline in the <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> even after 50 days. In sterile river water at 37 degrees C and sterile artificial seawater at 20 and 37 degrees C, the <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> declined by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude, while the acridine orange direct counts remained unchanged. However, direct viable counts and various resuscitation studies all indicated that the nonculturable cells were nonviable.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to collect baseline measures of bacteria present in retail ground beef offered for sale in Saskatchewan and to assess differences associated with the licensing or regulatory environment of the packaging and processing facilities as indicated by package labeling. Packages of ground beef (n = 309) were purchased from May 2011 to May 2012. Retail samples were categorized as originating from facilities regulated by the federal government or licensed by the provincial government (n = 126), originating from facilities licensed by local health regions (n = 80), or having no inspection or source information on the package label (n = 103). Total aerobic <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> and total Escherichia coli <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> were determined using 3 M Petrifilm methods. Total bacterial load was estimated using real-time quantitative PCR. The data were analyzed on a log scale using multivariable linear regression, accounting for season and whether the samples were fresh or frozen at purchase. Total aerobic <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> and Escherichia coli <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> were lower in samples from federally regulated or provincially licensed facilities than in samples from locally licensed facilities (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 002, respectively) or in samples with no inspection information on the label (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 011, respectively).

30|$|Some {{optimization}} {{techniques have}} been widely applied for spore fermentation based on the <b>plate</b> <b>counting.</b> This study optimized the culture medium for the spore production of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS- 20 and investigated the feasibility of using a dipicolonic acid (DPA) fluorimetry assay as a simpler alternative to <b>plate</b> <b>counting</b> for evaluating spore yields. Through the single-factor experiment, the metal ions and agro-industrial raw materials that significantly enhanced spore production were determined. After conducting a response surface methodology (RSM) analysis of several metal ions, the combined use of optimum concentrations of Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +, and Ca 2 + in culture media produced a 3.4 -fold increase in spore yields. Subsequently, supplementing soybean meal and corn meal with optimum concentrations determined by another RSM analysis produced an 8.8 -fold increase. The final spore concentration from a culture medium incorporating optimum concentrations of the metal ions and raw materials mentioned above was verified to reach (8.05  ±  0.70) ×  109  CFU/mL by both DPA fluorimetry and <b>plate</b> <b>counting.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} use of DPA fluorescence intensity as an alternative value to colony counting provides a general method for assessing spore yields with less work and shorter time.|$|R
