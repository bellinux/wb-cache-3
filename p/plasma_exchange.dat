5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. <b>Plasma</b> <b>exchange</b> (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, <b>plasma</b> <b>exchange</b> is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, <b>plasma</b> <b>exchange</b> is required to remove the antibodies.|$|E

25|$|The therapy of {{an acute}} TTP episode {{has to be}} started as early as possible.

25|$|Treatments {{that target}} the {{autoimmune}} response are also used. Intravenous immunoglobin {{is the best}} second-line treatment for SPS. It often decreases stiffness and improves {{quality of life and}} startle reflex. It is generally safe, but there are possible serious side effects and it is expensive. The European Federation of Neurological Societies suggests it be used when disabled patients do not respond well to diazepam and baclofen. Steroids, rituximab, and <b>plasma</b> <b>exchange</b> have been used to suppress the immune system in SPS patients, but the efficacy of these treatments is unclear. Botulinum toxin has been used to treat SPS, but it {{does not appear to have}} long-term benefits and has potential serious side effects.

25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite <b>plasma</b> <b>exchange</b> or plasma infusion (PE/PI).|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of eculizumab (INN and USAN, trade name Soliris), a monoclonal antibody that is a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor, management options for patients with aHUS were extremely limited.
