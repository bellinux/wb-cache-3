5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E

40|$|Small {{business}} researchers conjecture {{that there}} is little separation between business <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> risks among small businesses. <b>Personal</b> assets <b>and</b> wealth can be subject to business risks {{in the form of an}} implicit or explicit claim depending on the organizational form <b>and</b> whether <b>personal</b> commitments are pledged by owners. The choice of organizational form can be considered a mechanism to increase the degree of separation; however, lenders 2 ̆ 7 requirements for personal commitments mitigate the benefits of limited liability provisions. This paper examines the role of <b>personal</b> collateral <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> guarantees in augmenting implicit claims on business <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> assets with explicit claims on <b>personal</b> assets <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> wealth. We document the degree of non-separation of business <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> risks for 692 firms. Our results suggests that small business owners have a significant incidence of <b>personal</b> assets <b>and</b> wealth pledged for business loans, even for organizational forms such as S-corporations and C-corporations with limited legal liability. These results confirm the conjecture {{that there is}} a lack of separation between business <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> risks. The lack of separation of business <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> risks has important policy implications for the borrowing patterns and access to credit markets of small businesses...|$|R

Three-wave longitudinal data were collected in a Belgian public institution (N¿=¿ 473). Results confirm the causal effects of job resources, <b>personal</b> resources, <b>and</b> performance expectations on work engagement. Reciprocal relationships are not significant. Results are discussed with regard to the impact of changes in job <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> resources <b>and</b> performance expectations on work engagement.

5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness.

In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> societal issues.|$|E

According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E
