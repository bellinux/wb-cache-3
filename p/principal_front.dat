2500|$|In February 1836, after {{studying}} 97 proposals, the Commission chose Charles Barry's {{plan for a}} Gothic-style palace, awarding him a prize (or [...] "premium") of £1500. Premiums of £500 each were given to David Hamilton, J.C. Buckler and William Railton. The Architectural Magazine summarised Barry's winning plan as [...] "a quadrangular pile, with the <b>principal</b> <b>front</b> facing the Thames, and a tower in the centre, 170ft high". Barry, whose own architectural style was more classical than Gothic, built the new palace upon the neo-classical principle of symmetry. Augustus Pugin was instrumental in helping Barry win the Commission. Pugin's contribution {{can be seen in}} the Gothic detail, the vanes and spires. Pugin also contributed greatly to the distinctive Gothic interiors, including wallpapers, carvings, stained glass, floor tiles, metalwork and furniture.|$|E

They were situated {{in the line of}} building which formed the front of the chateau; and on the front side of each of them were windows looking out upon the lake. Of course these windows formed the range of windows in the second story of the <b>principal</b> <b>front</b> of the edifice.|$|E
60|$|It {{was on the}} 19th of August, 1561, {{that the}} two galleys arrived at Leith. Leith is a small port {{on the shore of}} the Frith of Forth, about two miles from Edinburgh, which is {{situated}} somewhat inland. The royal palace, where Mary was to reside, was called the Palace of Holyrood. It was, and is still, a large square building, with an open court in the center, into which there is access for carriages through a large arched passage-way {{in the center of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>front</b> of the building. In the rear, but connected with the palace, there was a chapel in Mary's day, though it is now in ruins. The walls still remain, but the roof is gone. The people of Scotland were not expecting Mary so soon. Information was communicated from country to country, in those days, slowly and with great difficulty. Perhaps the time of Mary's departure from France was purposely concealed even from the Scotch, to avoid all possibility that the knowledge of it should get into Elizabeth's possession.|$|E

60|$|September 8th.--Yesterday forenoon S-----, the two eldest children, and I went forth into London streets, and {{proceeded}} down Regent Street, and thence to St. James's Park, {{at the entrance}} of which is a statue of somebody,--I forget whom. On the very spacious gravel-walks, covering several acres, {{in the rear of the}} Horse Guards, some soldiers were going through their exercise; and, after looking at them awhile, we strolled through the Park, alongside of a sheet of water, in which various kinds of ducks, geese, and rare species of waterfowl were swimming. There was one swan of immense size, which moved about among the lesser fowls like a stately, full-rigged ship among gunboats. By and by we found ourselves near what we since have discovered to be Buckingham Palace,--a long building, in the Italian style, but of no impressiveness, and which one soon wearies of looking at. The Queen having gone to Scotland the day before, the palace now looked deserted, although there was a one-horse cab, of shabby aspect, standing at the <b>principal</b> <b>front,</b> where doubtless the carriages of princes and the nobility draw up. There is a fountain playing before the palace, and water-fowl love to swim under its perpetual showers. These ducks and geese are very tame, and swim to the margin of the pond to be fed by visitors, looking up at you with great intelligence.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, all Paris {{was busy with}} {{preparations}} for the marriage. The Louvre is upon {{one side of the}} River Seine, its <b>principal</b> <b>front</b> being toward the river, with a broad street between. There are no buildings, but only a parapet wall on the river side of the street, so that there is a fine view of the river and of the bridges which cross it, from the palace windows. Nearly opposite the Louvre is an island, covered with edifices, and connected, by means of bridges, with either shore. The great church of Notre Dame, where the marriage ceremony was to be performed, is upon this island. It has two enormous square towers in front, which may be seen, rising above all the roofs of the city, at a great distance in every direction. Before the church is a large open area, where vast crowds assemble on any great occasion. The interior of the church impresses the mind with the sublimest emotions. Two rows of enormous columns rise to a great height on either hand, supporting the lofty arches of the roof. The floor is paved with great flat stones, and resounds continually with the footsteps of visitors, who walk to and fro, up and down the aisles, looking at the chapels, the monuments, the sculptures, the paintings, and the antique and grotesque images and carvings. Colored light streams through the stained glass of the enormous windows, and the tones of the organ, and the voices of the priests, chanting the service of the mass, are almost always resounding and echoing from the vaulted roof above.|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{other people}} go through the archway, we also went, meeting no {{impediment}} from the sentinels, and found ourselves in a large paved court, in the centre of which a banner was stuck down, with a few soldiers standing near it. This flag was the banner of the regiment of guards on duty. The aspect of the interior court was as naked and dismal as the outside, the brick being of that dark hue almost universal in England. On {{one side of the}} court there was a door which seemed to give admission to a chapel, into which several persons went, and probably we might have gone too, had we liked. From this court, we penetrated into {{at least two or three}} others; for the palace is very extensive, and all of it, so far as I could see, on the same pattern,--large, enclosed courts, paved, and quite bare of grass, shrubbery, or any beautiful thing,--dark, stern, brick walls, without the slightest show of architectural beauty, or even an ornament over the square, commonplace windows, looking down on those forlorn courts. A carriage-drive passes through it, if I remember aright, from the <b>principal</b> <b>front,</b> emerging by one of the sides; and I suppose that the carriages roll through the palace, at the levees and drawing-rooms. There was nothing to detain us here any long time, so we went from court to court, and came out through a side-opening. The edifice is battlemented all round, and this, with somewhat of fantastic in the shape of the clock-tower, is the only attempt at ornament in the whole.|$|E

60|$|Thence {{we drove}} to the Triumphal Pillar which was erected {{in honor of the}} Great Duke, and on the summit of which he stands, in a Roman garb, holding a winged figure of Victory in his hand, as an {{ordinary}} man might hold a bird. The column is I know not how many feet high, but lofty enough, at any rate, to elevate Marlborough far above the rest of the world, and to be visible a long way off; and it is so placed in reference to other objects, that, wherever the hero wandered about his grounds, and especially as he issued from his mansion, he must inevitably have been reminded of his glory. In truth, until I came to Blenheim, I never had so positive and material an idea of what Fame really is--of what the admiration of his country can do for a successful warrior--as I carry away with me and shall always retain. Unless he had the moral force of a thousand men together, his egotism (beholding himself everywhere, imbuing the entire soil, growing in the woods, rippling and gleaming in the water, and pervading the very air with his greatness) must have been swollen within him like the liver of a Strasburg goose. On the huge tablets inlaid into the pedestal of the column, the entire Act of Parliament, bestowing Blenheim on the Duke of Marlborough and his posterity, is engraved in deep letters, painted black on the marble ground. The pillar stands exactly a mile from the <b>principal</b> <b>front</b> of the palace, in a straight line with the precise centre of its entrance-hall; so that, as already said, it was the Duke's principal object of contemplation.|$|E
6000|$|... 37. But {{the spirit}} that was in these Aphrodites of the earth was not then, nor in them, to be restrained. Colonnade rose over colonnade; the {{pediment}} of the western front was lifted into a detached and scenic wall; story above story sprang the multiplied arches of the Campanile, and the eastern pyramidal fire-type, lifted from its foundation, was placed upon the summit. With the superimposed arcades of the <b>principal</b> <b>front</b> arose the necessity, instantly felt by their subtle architects, of a new proportion in the column; the lower wall inclosure, necessarily {{for the purposes of}} Christian worship continuous, and needing no peristyle, rendered the lower columns a mere facial decoration, whose proportions were evidently no more to be regulated by the laws hitherto observed in detached colonnades. The column expanded into the shaft, or into the huge pilaster rising unbanded from tier to tier; shaft and pilaster were associated in ordered groups, and the ideas of singleness and limited elevation once attached to them, swept away for ever; the stilted and variously centered arch existed already: the pure ogive followed--where first exhibited we stay not to inquire;--finally, and chief of all, the great mechanical discovery of the resistance of lateral pressure by the weight of the superimposed flanking pinnacle. Daring concentrations of pressure upon narrow piers were the immediate consequence, and the recognition of the buttress as a feature in itself agreeable and susceptible of decoration. The glorious art of painting on glass added its temptations; the darkness of northern climes both rendering the typical character of Light more deeply felt than in Italy, and necessitating its admission in larger masses; the Italian, even at the period of his most exquisite art in glass, retaining the small Lombard window, whose expediency will hardly be doubted by anyone who has experienced the transition from the scorching reverberation of the white-hot marble front, to the cool depth of shade within, and whose beauty will not be soon forgotten by those who have seen the narrow lights of the Pisan duomo announce by their redder burning, not like transparent casements, but like characters of fire searing the western wall, the decline of day upon Capraja.|$|E

This façade is today the <b>principal</b> <b>front</b> and public face of the palace and shields the inner façades containing friezes and marbles matching and complementing those of the arch.|$|E

40|$|In our {{response}} to Pugh's critique of our work which he rather grandiosly describes as 'Cambridge studies', we take major issue with his arguments on three <b>principal</b> <b>fronts.</b> First, he is very selective in his review of our publications, and in seeking to defend {{the position of the}} World Bank, UNDP, and UNCHS, he fails to acknowledge an extensive debate in which we have already engaged with senior analysts from those institutions. Moreover, his reading of what we do and do not say about World Bank leadership in the housing and land management policy fields is partial and erroneous. Second, his critique that our methodology lacks a strong theoretical and empirical grounding is at best distorted and at worst quite wrong. The methodology has been widely used and applauded, and if it has been criticized in the past it is for being too empirical and overly focused upon household interviews and surveys. He also ignores the context in which several of the methods he criticizes were published: namely in a collection of essays on Methodology for Land and Housing Market Analysis, the express purpose of which was to contrast different approaches. Third, he mistakenly assumes that because we do not cite certain authors we are ignorant of their work, and further, that our analysis fails to privilege neoclassical land economics. This latter point at least is true, but not because we are ignorant of the approach, but because the theoretical aims of our work required that we experiment with other methods. ...|$|R
