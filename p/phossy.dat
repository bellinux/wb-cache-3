2500|$|White {{phosphorus}} is {{a translucent}} waxy solid that quickly becomes yellow {{when exposed to}} light. For this reason it is also called yellow phosphorus. It glows greenish in the dark (when exposed to oxygen) and is highly flammable and pyrophoric (self-igniting) upon contact with air. It is toxic, causing severe liver damage on ingestion and <b>phossy</b> jaw from chronic ingestion or inhalation. The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell, and samples are commonly coated with white [...] "diphosphorus pentoxide", which consists of P4O10 tetrahedral with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. White phosphorus is only slightly soluble in water and can be stored under water. Indeed, white phosphorus is safe from self-igniting only when it is submerged in water. [...] It is soluble in benzene, oils, carbon disulfide, and disulfur dichloride.|$|E
2500|$|Child labour {{existed before}} the Industrial Revolution {{but with the}} {{increase}} in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders, 10–20% of an adult male's wage. Children as young as four were employed. Beatings and long hours were common, with some child coal miners and hurriers working from 4 am until 5 pm. Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions. Many children developed lung cancer and other diseases and died before the age of 25. Workhouses would sell orphans and abandoned children as [...] "pauper apprentices", working without wages for board and lodging. Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters shackling them to prevent escape. Children employed as mule scavengers by cotton mills would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated. Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop <b>phossy</b> jaw. Children employed at glassworks were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at potteries were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.|$|E

50|$|The {{background}} {{to the treaty}} was the extensive medical problems such as <b>phossy</b> jaw facing workers in match production. The treaty was concluded on 26 September 1906. It entered into force on 1 January 1912. The Convention remains in force for 48 states. Switzerland is the depositary for the treaty.|$|E
50|$|The {{strike was}} caused by the poor working {{conditions}} in the match factory, including fourteen-hour work days, poor pay, excessive fines and the severe health complications of working with white phosphorus, such as <b>phossy</b> jaw, but was sparked by the dismissal of one of the workers on or about 2 July 1888.|$|E
5000|$|The {{condition}} {{is similar to}} <b>phossy</b> jaw, an osteoporitic and osteonecrotic illness of matchgirls, brought on by phosphorus ingestion and absorption. The first written reference to the disease was by a dentist, Dr. Theodor Blum (1924), who described an unusual mandibular osteomyelitis in a dial painter, a condition he called [...] "radium jaw".|$|E
50|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the manufacture of}} the new phosphorus matches were afflicted with <b>phossy</b> jaw and other bone disorders, and there was enough white phosphorus in one pack to kill a person. Deaths and suicides from eating the heads of matches became frequent. The earliest report of phosphorus necrosis was made in 1845 by Lorinser in Vienna, and a New York surgeon published a pamphlet with notes on nine cases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phossy</b> jaw, {{formally}} {{phosphorus necrosis}} of the jaw, is {{an occupational disease}} of {{those who work with}} white phosphorus, also known as yellow phosphorus, without proper safeguards. It was most commonly seen in workers in the match-stick industry in the 19th and early 20th century. Modern occupational hygiene practices have eliminated the working conditions which caused this disease. This disease is caused by the vapour of white phosphorus, which destroys the bones of the jaw.|$|E
50|$|The musical {{focuses on}} the {{lifestyle}} of the match cutters at the Bryant and May factory in Bow, London, with strong references to the condition <b>Phossy</b> Jaw and the political climate of the era. With much of the action set in the incongruously named, but fictional, 'Hope Court', the musical portrays Bryant and May as callous and uncaring employers, with factory foreman 'Mr Mynel' representing the threatening and imposing regime in which the girls were forced to work.|$|E
50|$|White {{phosphorus}} was poisonous {{to match}} makers, causing <b>Phossy</b> jaw. Albright and Wilson exhibited amorphous phosphorus at the Great Exhibition of 1851, at The Crystal Palace. A sample {{was taken away}} for testing by the two Swedish brothers Lundström, to make an experimental match composition. In 1855, just before the Paris Exhibition, John Edvard Lundstrom found that the matches were still usable. He placed a large order for amorphous phosphorus with Albright and Wilson and {{this led to the}} foundation of the Swedish Safety Match Industry.|$|E

In 1908 she {{became president of the}} National Federation of Women Workers, and campaigned to protect women from industrial injuries such as <b>phossy</b> jaw. She retired in 1918, but continued to campaigning on public health issues. After Charles Dilke died in 1911, she co-wrote a two-volume biography with Stephen Gwynne.|$|E
50|$|The London matchgirls {{strike of}} 1888 {{started in the}} factory, caused by the poor working conditions; {{including}} fourteen-hour work days, poor pay, excessive fines and the severe health complications of working with white phosphorus, such as <b>phossy</b> jaw. This led {{to the establishment of}} the first British trade union for women. A blue plaque outside the entrance commemorates the role of social pioneer and feminist Annie Besant in leading the demands for better pay and conditions. The result was that some of the first welfare institutions in Britain for industrial workers began on this site, including the provision of a dentist.|$|E
50|$|Long term {{inhalation}} of derivative fumes {{causes a}} condition called <b>phossy</b> jaw or osteonecrosis of the jaw, {{which is a}} painful, debilitating and ultimately lethal condition that afflicted factory workers involved with the manufacture of matches that contained white phosphorus. The mechanism for necrosis is clot formation leading to bone ischaemia or infarction, leading to the putrid rotting of the bone of the lower jaw. For this reason, the Berne Convention (1906) was enacted to forbid the manufacture, sale or purchase of matches containing white phosphorus. This condition may also be caused by high doses of lead, cadmium and bisphosphonate based cancer drugs.|$|E
5000|$|An {{association}} between history of bisphosphonate use and osteonecrosis of the jaw after later surgery was detected {{for several years}} before {{the exact nature of}} the relationship (cause, pathogenesis) could begin to be understood, and it is still not entirely clear, although it has been nicknamed [...] "bis-phossy jaw" [...] based on its similarity with <b>phossy</b> jaw. There is no known prevention for bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw. Avoiding the use of bisphosphonates is not a viable prevention on a general-population basis because the drugs have more benefit throughout the population (preventing osteoporotic fractures and treating bone cancers) than harm (BONJ).|$|E

50|$|White {{phosphorus}} was {{the active}} ingredient of most matches from the 1840s to the 1910s and exposure to the vapour from this caused a deposition of phosphorus in the jaw bones of workers in the industry. Concern over <b>phossy</b> jaw contributed to the London matchgirls strike of 1888, and although this strike did not end the use of white phosphorus, William Booth and The Salvation Army opened a match-making factory in 1891 which used the much safer, though more expensive, red phosphorus. The Salvation Army also campaigned with local retailers {{to get them to}} sell only red phosphorus matches.|$|E
50|$|Those with <b>phossy</b> jaw {{would usually}} begin {{suffering}} painful toothaches and {{swelling of the}} gums. Over time, the jaw bone began to abscess. Affected bones glowed a greenish-white colour in the dark. The condition also caused serious brain damage. Surgical removal of the afflicted jaw bones could save the patient; otherwise, death from organ failure would follow. The disease was extremely painful and disfiguring to the patient, with dying bone tissue rotting away accompanied by a foul-smelling discharge. However, removal of the jaw bone had serious effects on patients' ability to eat, leading to further health concerns including malnutrition.|$|E
50|$|Politically, Nissen {{originally}} {{belonged to}} the Liberal Party. However, {{towards the end of}} the 1880s he aligned more with the fledgling socialist movement. In 1889 he joined the Norwegian Labour Party, founded in 1887. In the same year he marked himself as a supporter of the strike among the match factory workers. It occurred in October 1889 when three hundred match factory workers, all female, laid down their work. They demanded a slight pay raise of 1 øre extra per gross packed as well as better sanitary conditions. Nissen was especially concerned about the danger of contracting <b>phossy</b> jaw, and famously spoke at a public meeting together with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Nonetheless, the strike was given up in December.|$|E

It was associated with localized or generalized deep ache or pain, often of multiple jawbone sites. The teeth often appeared sound and suppuration was not present. Even so, the dentist often began extracting one tooth after another in the region of pain, often with temporary relief but usually to no real effect.|$|E
50|$|Radium dials {{were almost}} always painted by young women, {{who used to}} 'point' their brushes by licking and shaping the {{bristles}} prior to painting the fine lines and numbers on the dials. This practice resulted in the ingestion of radium, which caused serious jaw-bone degeneration and malignancy and other dental diseases reminiscent of <b>phossy</b> jaw. The disease, radium-induced osteonecrosis, was recognized as an occupational disease in 1925 after a group of radium painters, known as the Radium Girls, from the United States Radium Corporation sued. By 1930, all dial painters stopped pointing their brushes by mouth. Stopping this practice drastically reduced the amount of radium ingested and therefore, the incidence of malignancy, to zero by 1950 among the workers who were studied.|$|E
50|$|The {{conditions}} of working class {{women at the}} Bryant & May factories led to the London matchgirls strike of 1888. The strike {{was focused on the}} severe health complications of working with white phosphorus, such as <b>phossy</b> jaw. Social activist Annie Besant published an article in her halfpenny weekly paper The Link on 23 June 1888. A strike fund was set up and some newspapers collected donations from readers. The women and girls also solicited contributions. Members of the Fabian Society, including George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, and Graham Wallas, were involved in the distribution of the cash collected. The strike and negative publicity led to changes being made to limit the health effects of the inhalation of white phosphorus.|$|E

40|$|Recently a few {{reports of}} osteonecrosis of the jaws {{associated}} with a bisphosphonate therapy were published. There seemed to be some clinical commonalities with the old occupational disease "phossy jaws 2 ̆ 7;. We give an historical and medical overview of "phossy jaws 2 ̆ 7;. Because of many industrial changes that old disease has become rare; in Germany there are no cases reported in the years 1998 until 2002 — according to the German Hauptverband der gewerblichen Berufsgenossenschaften.

The causality between phosphorus and <b>phossy</b> jaws was re-cognized in 1845. <b>Phossy</b> jaws are a consequence of endothelium-damage by elemental phosphorus inhaled when working with it.

We report a case of a 68 -year-old female with a spontaneous wide bone sequestration of the left mandibular body onset after infusion of zoledronic acid for 18 cycles for osseous metastasis due to metastatic anaplastic thyroidal carcinoma. Surprisingly the clinical aspects of the patient initially reminded us of the famous pathology described in 1899 called <b>phossy</b> jaw.

40|$|Literature {{reviews of}} {{bio-assay}} methodology and phosphorus toxicology {{are presented as}} part of the introduction to the thesis. A temperature-controlled, serial dilution unit designed to provide eight successive 2 : 1 dilutions and its actual performance are described. Marine organisms were collected in waters free of pollutants and tested at the Marine Sciences Research Laboratory. The three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, were assayed to determine median tolerance limits (TLm) and to compare the effects of two types of colloidal phosphorus formulations: <b>phossy</b> water from the Electric Reduction Company of Canada plant at Long Harbour and, colloidal dispersions of pure phosphorus (P₄) prepared in the laboratory. The 48 hour TLm values for stickleback and cod at 8. 0 °C are 190 ugm/L. and 27 ugm/L. respectively in ERCO <b>phossy</b> water; the 48 and 96 hour TLm's in pure P₄ dispersions at 8. 0 °C are 185 ugm/L. and 68 ugm/L. for stickleback and 28 ugm/L. and 16 ugm/L. P₄ for the cod. In bioassays conducted on the winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, the 48 and 96 hour TLm's are 70 ugm/L. and 25 ugm/L. P₄ respectively. Temperature affects the toxicity of yellow phosphorus to the three-spined stickleback, while particles of P₄ greater than 0. 8 microns have little or no effect on the same species. ERCO <b>phossy</b> water retards the righting response of the northern starfish, Asterias vulgaris, at concentrations lower than those required for lethality. Dispersions of phosphorus affects the hematocrit of the cod and winter flounder as well as the white cell count of the cod.
