50|$|Carduus is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} aster family, Asteraceae, and the tribe Cynareae, one of two genera considered to be true thistles, the other being Cirsium.

This genus is noted for its disproportionately high number of noxious weeds compared to other flowering plant genera.|$|R

5000|$|Carduus argentatus, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the silver thistle, is an annual herb in the family Asteraceae. As {{a member of the}} genus Carduus it is known as a <b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle.</b> [...] It is found throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East. Frequently growing in disturbed habitats, it is often found in sandy and stony desert wadis. It is found in the eastern deserts of Egypt, through the East Mediterranean region and into Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It can be found growing in open woodlands and shrublands, on steppes and semi-steppes as well as in extreme desert conditions. It grows among mountain vegetation on Mount Hermon in the Golan Heights. [...] In Crete it is found at altitudes of up to 1400 m.|$|E
40|$|<b>Plumeless</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus acanthoides L.) is one {{of seven}} noxious weeds in Nebraska. An {{introduced}} invasive broadleaf weed native to Europe and Asia, <b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle</b> currently infests about 65, 000 acres in Nebraska. Infestations of <b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle</b> may reduce productivity of pastures and rangeland, where infestations {{tend to be the}} largest. <b>Plumeless</b> <b>thistle</b> competes with and suppresses growth of desirable species. Heavy infestations prevent livestock from grazing the area and lighter infestations prevent livestock from eating plants growing near the thistle. Estimates place the annual loss in Nebraska agricultural production due to <b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle</b> at $ 162, 000. Although <b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle</b> is more limited in distribution than its close relative the musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.), the infestations require landowners and producers in Nebraska to spend thousands of dollars each year for control...|$|E

Weed Control in New CRP Seedings Successful perennial forage establishment depends on the presence of adequate soil water for seed germination and seedling emergence. Weeds can quickly deplete soil moisture and must be controlled to allow grass and legume seedlings to germinate and emerge. In addition, rapidly growing, uncontrolled weeds can form a canopy which shades slower growing desirable plants. Weeds must be controlled on CRP acres to reduce the risks of seeding failure and eliminate possible reseeding costs. Several herbicides have been labeled for use on CRP situations...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{emphasis in}} the biological control of invasive weeds in Virginia focused on the following weeds: Carduus thoermeri (=nutans) (musk thistle), Carduus acanthoides (<b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle),</b> Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle), Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), and Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife). Besides being effective in the control of musk thistle, T. horridus also successfully controls <b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle.</b> Field nurseries of musk thistle were established for the propagation, collection, and sub-sequent release of Trichosirocalus horridus at other sites where they are not established. The rust fungus, Puccinia carduorum, has also become established on musk thistle. P. carduorum has spread rapidly since its release on musk thistle in Montgomery Co. in southwestern Virginia. Studies {{on the impact of}} Cassida rubiginosa on Canada thistle showed that C. rubiginosa in combination with tall fescue grass was successful in con-trolling the weed. Two Urophora species, U. affinis and U. quadrifasciata, are now well established in Virginia on spotted knapweed. U. affinis has dispersed more slowly than U. quadrifasciata.

No-Till Into Alfalfa Sod Killing alfalfa with herbicides is more economical than plowing, is very effective, and leaves the soil less subject to erOS 10 n. An excellent seedbed results from herbicide-killed sod whether the crop is planted no-till or following light tillage. The most consistent treatment we have evaluated for alfalfa control is 1 qt. 2, 4 -D + 0. 5 pt. Banvell A with 2 qt 2, 4 -D ester/A a close second. The herbicide approach will cost 5. 00 - 6. 00 /A + application compared to 10. 00 - 15. 00 for plowing and seedbed preparation. Alfalfa should be actively growing and have at least 42 ̆ 2 of green growth at treatment. Nebraska Weed Tour Mark your calendar. The 1989 Nebraska Weed Tour will be held the week of June 19.

40|$|The Heliothinae {{complex in}} Argentina {{encompasses}} Helicoverpa gelotopoeon (Dyar), Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), Helicoverpa armigera (Hu &# 776; bner), and Chloridea virescens (Fabricius). In Tucum an, the native species H. gelotopoeon {{is one of}} the most voracious soybean pests and also affects cotton and chickpea, even more in soybean-chickpea succession cropping systems. Differentiation of the Heliothinae complex in the egg, larva, and pupa stages is difficult. Therefore, the observation of the adult wing pattern design and male genitalia is useful to differentiate species. The objective of this study was to identify the species of the Heliothinae complex, determine population fluctuations of the Heliothinae complex in soybean and chickpea crops using male moths collected in pheromone traps in Tucuman province, and update the geographical distribution of H. armigera in Argentina. The species found were H. gelotopoeon, H. armigera, H. zea, and C. virescens. Regardless of province, county, crop, and year, the predominant species was H. gelotopoeon. Considering the population dynamics of H. gelotopoeon and H. armigera in chickpea and soybean crops, H. gelotopoeon was the most abundant species in both crops, in all years sampled, and the differences registered were significant. On the other hand, according to the Sistema Nacional Argentino de Vigilancia y Monitoreo de Plagas (SINAVIMO) database and our collections, H. armigera was recorded in eight provinces and 20 counties of Argentina, and its larvae were found on soybean, chickpea, sunflower crops and spiny <b>plumeless</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus acanthoides).
