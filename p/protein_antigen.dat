A wide range of particulate delivery systems have been proven to be efficient in vaccine delivery in animals and human. Co-administration of suitable immunostimulants with <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> could facilitate and enhance the generation of potent antigen-specific immune protection. Therefore, a successfully designed vaccine therapeutics is always an optimal combination of antigens, immuno-potentiators, vaccine carriers, and an effective formulation of the above, which is delivered through an appropriate administration route.|$|R

No sera reacted with a human serum albumin control antigen. The prevalence of IgG antibodies to wheat <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> was significantly greater in patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy, 12 of 17, (p =. 00011) and in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, 5 of 14, (p =. 046) than in normal control subjects. Strongly positive reactions for IgG antibodies were present only in patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy or dermatitis herpetiformis. IgA antibodies to wheat <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> were found only in gluten-sensitive enteropathy patients. We have found {{this to be a}} sensitive, precise technique for measurement of antibodies to wheat <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> and feel that it will prove useful in evaluation of the role of immune complexes involving wheat <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> and their antibodies in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of antibody-forming cells of different specificities in {{the lymph nodes}} and spleens of guinea pigs immunized with two separate antigens or with antigens bearing two determinants was studied. When animals were immunized with two soluble <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> or antigens {{in which the two}} antigenic determinants were on the same molecule, antibody-forming cells of different specificities were always randomly intermixed. However, when animals were immunized with two heat-aggregated particulate <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> and then boosted with soluble <b>protein</b> <b>antigens,</b> cells of different specificities were often seen to occur in groups. These results suggest that antibody-forming cells may not arise by the antigen-stimulated proliferation of precommitted antibody-forming cells, but rather antibody-forming cells arise by a transformation of uncommitted precursor cells as the result of their interactions with a locally produced material derived from the processing of antigen...|$|R

Genes encoding homologs of M. tuberculosis major <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> were isolated from M. africanum and M. bovis BCG by constructing lambda gt 11 recombinant DNA expression libraries and screening them with murine monoclonal antibodies and DNA probes. The antibodies were directed against four major <b>protein</b> <b>antigens</b> of M. tuberculosis with molecular masses of 71, 65, 19, and 14 kilodaltons. The isolated M. africanum and M. bovis BCG DNA clones were mapped with restriction endonucleases, and the maps of the mycobacterial genes were confirmed by Southern analysis of mycobacterial genomic DNA. The restriction maps of DNA containing the four genes in M. tuberculosis, M. africanum, and M. bovis BCG are identical, indicating that the immunodominant proteins that they encode are highly homologous in the three mycobacteria. Thus, the immunity against tuberculosis engendered by M. bovis BCG vaccination could be provided, at least in part, by the immune response to these homologous antigens...|$|R
