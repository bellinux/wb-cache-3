5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flat {{plate with a}} temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E

5|$|Leo the Wise died in 912, and {{hostilities}} soon resumed as Simeon {{marched to}} Constantinople {{at the head}} of a large army. Though the walls of the city were impregnable, the Byzantine administration was in disarray and Simeon was invited into the city, where he was granted the crown of basileus (emperor) of Bulgaria and had the young emperor Constantine VII marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered Adrianople. The Empire now faced the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> powerful Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople, as well as having to fight on two fronts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|One {{specific}} {{failure in}} the massive operation was the critical lack of transport aircraft for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack of transport aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shortage of transport aircraft meant {{that a third of}} the planned troops to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.|$|E

5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E

25|$|Journalist George Monbiot {{has argued}} for a 5-year freeze on {{biofuels}} while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed.

Some environmentalists are suspicious that second-generation biofuels may not solve the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> potential clash with food as they also use significant agricultural resources such as water.|$|E

25|$|Constans {{left his}} wife and {{household}} at Saragossa {{under the care of}} Gerontius to return to report to Arles. Meanwhile, the loyalist Roman army mutinied at Ticinum (Pavia) on 13 August, which was followed by the execution of the patrician Stilicho on 22 August. As a by-product of these events, the actions of an intrigue within the Imperial court, the general, Sarus, abandoned the western army followed by his men; this left the Emperor Honorius in Ravenna without any significant military power, and also facing the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Gothic army under Alaric roaming unchecked in Etruria. So, when Constantine's envoys arrived to parley at Ravenna, the fearful Honorius eagerly recognized Constantine as co-emperor, and the two were joint consuls for the year 409.|$|E
25|$|When {{the colony}} of New South Wales {{was founded in}} 1788, it ran into the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lack of coinage. Foreign coins – {{including}} British, Dutch, Indian and Portuguese – were common in its early years, but much of this coin left the colony by way of trade with visiting merchant ships. Barter was a necessity amongst the colonists, with the most popular, rum becoming an unofficial currency. One of the first attempts to restrict the practice was by Governor King, who on 19 November 1800 set an arbitrary price for foreign coinage, {{but there was never}} enough of it. To try and resolve the shortage, he requested the supply of sixpences to be used as shillings, but failed to get a hearing. The practice of using rum as a currency was prohibited by Governor Bligh in 1806, eventually culminating in the overthrow of the government in the Rum Rebellion.|$|E
