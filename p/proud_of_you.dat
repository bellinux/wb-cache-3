500|$|After {{the tournament}} ended, Moon was congratulated by {{professional}} poker player Phil Hellmuth, who said, [...] "I'm <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Darvin."

Storms Reback, of All In Magazine, said Moon was [...] "out of his league" [...] at the tournament, and made a number of questionable calls and bets. As an example, Reback cited a hand in which Moon attempted to bluff by re-raising a bet by Begleiter for 15 million chips, then folding when Begleiter went all in for an additional 6 million, even though Moon was getting better than 7-to-1 odds on his money. Moon said he planned to spend some of his World Series winnings on putting relatives through college and charitable contributions to his home town, including a new youth ball field and recreation center.

2500|$|The Rebels {{received}} {{the second half}} kickoff and Flowers and Franklin led a drive down the field. They {{made it to the}} LSU 32-yard line after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty by the Tigers, where the Rebels attempted a field goal.

The Tigers punted but the Rebels were penalized for roughing the kicker, giving the ball back to LSU. To start the fourth quarter, LSU drove down to the 2-yard line, but the Rebels held there and took over on downs. They punted soon after and LSU drove to the Ole Miss 33, where Davis missed his second field goal, followed by another punt by the Rebels. At its own 30-yard line, LSU gained 19 yards on a run by Purvis, and a personal foul on the Rebels put the ball on the Ole Miss 37.
