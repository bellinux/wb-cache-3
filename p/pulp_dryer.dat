50|$|Because of {{lawsuits}} and pressure for the Nampa, Idaho plant to discontinue dumping factory waste into Indian Creek and then Mason Creek, a $1 million <b>pulp</b> <b>dryer</b> {{was constructed in}} late 1955.|$|E
50|$|A large fire {{occurred}} at the dried pulp warehouse in the Nyssa, Oregon factory on May 15, 1952. There were $100,000 in damages. The <b>pulp</b> <b>dryer</b> operation in Nyssa was expanded in 1955, doubling the pulp drying capacity and allowing all of the pulp to be dried, as it was under demand as animal feed. A beet seed development laboratory was also built in Nyssa in 1954. In 1958, Nyssa had a daily capacity of 4000 tons. An upgrade program was begun in 1959, increasing capacity to 6500 tons by 1961.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{integral}} saturation {{that reduces the}} quality of regulation appears with classic PID-controller usage in the real conditions. The <b>pulp</b> <b>dryer</b> of sugar factory as the real object of automation is considered. The impact of integral saturation is demonstrated based on the control processes modeling in <b>pulp</b> <b>dryer.</b> A modern methods to eliminate the integral saturation are considered.  </p...|$|E

In 1978 a 5200 m2 sugar refinery was built in Tell Salhab at a cost of $50 million. The refinery complex boasted a sugar beet silo, a washing plant, <b>pulp</b> presses and <b>dryers,</b> and a water reservoir.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{consumption}} of fresh or industrialized coconut water (Cocos nucifera L.) in Brazil has been increasing. As a consequence, millions {{of tons of}} coconut husk are discarded each year, which constitutes a serious environmental problem. Studies carried out in our laboratories showed that the pulp rejected with the husk presents interesting properties and can be used as an ingredient with potential applications in food formulations. Drying is one possibility to preserve the pulp that is discarded inside the husk. This study aimed to evaluate the processes of drying green coconut <b>pulp</b> in cabinet <b>dryer</b> (CD) and pulsed fluid bed dryer (PFB) at 60, 70 and 80 ° C. The parameters water activity (Aw), lightness (L*), enzyme activity, moisture and crispness were used for choosing the best process conditions for snack producing. Mathematical modeling of drying curves was done using Henderson & Pabis, Lewis and Page models. After 480 minutes at 70 °C, both pieces of equipment succeeded in producing final snack-like products. Snack obtained in CD presented final moisture of 0. 159 ± 0. 004 (db) and in PFB 0. 0400 ± 0. 0004 (db). The choice of the best process depends on the dry product demand. PFB is the most suitable for large demands...|$|R
