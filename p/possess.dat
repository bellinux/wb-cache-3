50|$|It is {{important}} to note that nouns in Wayana fall under three classes, in regards to possessibility: unpossessable, optionally possessable, and inherently <b>possessed.</b> Unpossessable nouns do not take possessive prefixes or suffixes. Optionally <b>possessed</b> nouns are semantically diverse, and can occur in either <b>possessed</b> or unpossessed form (most examples given use optionally <b>possessed</b> nouns). Inherently <b>possessed</b> nouns “denote entities that stand in a stable, intrinsic relationship with another entity” (Tavares, 2005, pp. 136), and must always be <b>possessed.</b> Kinship terms (such as in 5a.) and some body parts fall under this category. Inherently <b>possessed</b> nouns often, but not always, take -ø as the possessive suffix.|$|R
5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous {{and essential}} in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, whereas most bacteria <b>possess</b> heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is not essential in bacteria, and not all bacteria <b>possess</b> it, whereas some protists <b>possess</b> both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also <b>possess</b> other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential.|$|E

25|$|Nouns are {{classified}} as either inalienably or alienably <b>possessed,</b> according to which possessive markers they occur with.
