This type of clay is {{water-soluble}} and unstable. Earthenware is clay that has been fired between 1000-1200°C or 1832°-2192°F. The firing makes the clay water insoluble but does not allow {{the formation of an}} extensive glassy or vitreous within the body. Although water-insoluble, the porous body of earthenware allows water to penetrate. A glaze can be applied that will protect the vessel from water. Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200-1400°C or 2192-2552°F. <b>Porcelain</b> <b>clay</b> mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface. However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.|$|E
