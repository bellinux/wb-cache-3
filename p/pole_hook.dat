40|$|The {{long-term}} {{variability of}} a sample of 180 optically selected QSOs {{in the field of}} the Selected Area 94 has been studied. The relations between variability and luminosity and between variability and redshift have been investigated by means of statistical estimators that are ''robust'' and allow {{at the same time to}} eliminate the influence of the measurement errors. A comparison is carried out with the results of two other samples of QSOs, in the fields of the South Galactic <b>Pole</b> (<b>Hook</b> et al. 1994) and of the Selected Area 57 (Trevese et al. 1994). Merging the three samples provides a total of 486 QSOs. The analysis in the QSOs rest frame of both the ensemble structure function (SF) and the individual variability indices show that: 1) a negative correlation between variability and luminosity is clearly present, in the sense that more luminous QSOs show less variability; 2) a significant positive correlation exists between variability and redshift; 3) such correlations may be equally well parameterized either with a model in which the timescale of the variability is fixed for all the QSOs (tau similar to 2. 4 yr), while the amplitude linearly increases with the absolute magnitude and redshift, or with a model in which the timescale of the variability linearly depends on the absolute magnitude and the amplitude is only a function of the redshift. The same analysis carried out in the observer's frame provides the following results: 1) there is a negative correlation between variability and luminosity; 2) the timescale of variability does not depend significantly either on the absolute magnitude or on the redshift; 3) the ensemble structure function is well represented by a parameterization in which, with a fixed timescale of about 5. 5 yr, the amplitude linearly increases with the absolute magnitude; 4) although the general behaviour of the SF does not show a systematic variation of the timescale and/or amplitude with redshift, if we examine the average variability index for objects with - 25 > M(B) > - 27, we find that below redshift 1 quasars are significantly less variable than at higher redshift. The implications in terms of the black-hole, starburst and microlensing models are briefly discussed...|$|E

5000|$|The camera starts pans {{across a}} lake fence, where signs are posted that say [...] "no fishing", [...] "keep out", [...] "private property", [...] "no trespassing", and [...] "beware of dog". Spike is shown {{guarding}} the fence asleep. Tom shows {{up with his}} fishing gear and he passes through the gate, but Spike just happens to yawn and recline on Tom's leg. Tom tries to get away, but Spike thinks Tom’s leg is a bone and grabs at it a second time. Spike licks the leg and takes a bite into it; it causes the cat to scream. Spike wakes up and looks around, but does not see anyone, as Tom hides behind Spike as the bulldog moves around. When he turns around again, Tom sits {{on top of his}} fishing pole. Spike still does not see him and goes back to sleep. Tom then walks towards the lake, but as he walks, the <b>hook</b> on his <b>pole</b> <b>hooks</b> Spike’s collar and drags him along. As the line tugs, Tom looks back and sees Spike about to fall off a small cliff of dirt. Frantic, the cat catches Spike and props him up with a stick.

5000|$|The {{first ever}} Roman fire brigade {{of which we}} have any {{substantial}} history was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Marcus Licinius Crassus {{was born into a}} wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) [...] "fire and rapine." [...] One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the Vigiles in AD 60 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as <b>poles,</b> <b>hooks</b> and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire.|$|R
40|$|Thaipusam, is {{an annual}} festival {{beginning}} {{on a full}} moon day between January 14 and February 14. This festival is celebrated in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and South Africa. It is celebrated by all Hindu castes, from the highest Brahmin to the lowest Dalit. An important feature of Thaipsam is the kavadi ritual. This follows the myth of Surapadma, the demon, who eventually became Lord Maruga's honest devotee, Idumban. This conversion is represented by purification ceremonies, around which the festival focuses, and in which participants enter a state of trance, in order to carry out physically demanding feats. Kavadi originates from a Tamil (South Indian) word, kavati. It describes {{anything that can be}} suspended on the body (<b>pole,</b> <b>hooks</b> and chains). Today, it is taken to mean a semi-circular structure that is decorated with flowers, peacock feathers and palm leaves. The kavadi is drawn by devotees who have hooks, attached to their skin, with which to pull along the structure. The Brahmin caste, however hook small pails of milk onto their skin instead. The kavadi usually bears a vel (flesh-piercing implement), which represents Lord Maruga's lance. Devotees who 'take kavadi' do so in a higher state of mind or trance. Chanting, music, especially drumming, and incense are used to induce trance. Focusing mainly on fieldwork undertaken around Thaipusam in Kuala Lumpur, this thesis examines the background of the ceremony, its Hindu connections and the different music associated with each caste. The different drumming patterns, of each caste in particular, are transcribed, analyzed and compared, together with the melodic music of the nadaswarum, the instrument associated with the Brahmin music...|$|R
2500|$|For most of {{the first}} film, the 1.21 gigawatts are {{supplied}} by a plutonium-powered nuclear fission reactor and, with the absence of plutonium, {{a bolt of lightning}} channeled directly into the flux capacitor by a long <b>pole</b> and <b>hook</b> in the film's climactic sequence.

50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{catching}} and handing pike {{that are now}} frowned upon are the gaff and the gag.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{air-drying}} {{methods used to}} for different kinds of flowers. The easiest and {{most effective way to}} dry most flowers is to tie them in small bundles with twine, raffia or ribbons, and hang them upside down, out of direct sunlight in a warm, well-ventilated place. Bunches should contain one type of flower. Large flowers are dried individually. The leaves stripped as soon as possible after picking. They retain moisture and slow down the drying process. Wall <b>hooks,</b> <b>poles</b> or wires are placed at least six inches from the ceiling. Heads should be staggered to allow plenty of air to circulate. This prevents mildew and rot. It may be necessary to re-tie bunches or individual flowers half way through the drying process, because the stems tend to shrink as they dry.|$|R
60|$|As the testudo, as it {{was called}} in those days, {{advanced}} toward the castle, the machines upon the walls--catapults, mangonels and arbalasts--poured forth showers of stones and darts upon it, breaking up the array of shields and killing many; and as these openings were made, the archers, seizing their time, poured in volleys of arrows. The mercenaries, however, accustomed to war, advanced steadily, and made good their footing beneath the castle wall, and proceeded to rear their ladders. Here, although free from the action of the machines, they were exposed to the hand missiles, which were scarcely less destructive. In good order, and with firmness, however, they reared the ladders, and mounted to the assault, covering themselves as well as they could with their shields. In vain, however, did they mount. The defenders poured down showers of boiling pitch and oil, which penetrated the crevices of their armor and caused intolerable torment. Great stones were toppled over from the battlements upon them; and sometimes the ladders, seized by the <b>poles</b> with <b>hooks,</b> were cast backward, with all upon them, on the throng below. For half an hour, encouraged by the shouts of Sir Rudolph and their leaders, the soldiers strove gallantly; but were at last compelled to draw off, having lost nigh one hundred men, without one gaining a footing upon the walls.|$|R
