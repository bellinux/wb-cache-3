40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{health and the}} economy is complex and hardly a matter of unidirectional cause and consequence. With health increasingly being understood as a stimulus for the economy, nutrition directly assumes the status of an economic identifier. This paper discusses the growing complexity of the global health field and tries to develop a new way of understanding the role of health and nutrition in the broader global agenda. The objective is to develop sensitive policies that can generate progress around the world. Such policies must be based on scientifically derived evidence. Initially, and with a nutritional perspective, the economic effects resulting from a healthy population are assessed. Next, the {{relationship between}} healthcare systems and economic performance is analyzed. We then describe the health transition in low- and middle-income countries. Finally, we discuss two national social policies (Oportunidades and Seguro Popular) developed in Mexico to confront its health and nutritional challenges as the keystone for economic development.

40|$|How {{should we}} model {{learning}} behaviour in economic agents? This thesis addresses {{this question in}} two distinct ways. In {{the first set of}} chapters the assumption is that agents learn through the observation of others. They use Bayesian updating which together with specific informational assumptions can generate the problem known as herding with the potential for significant welfare losses. In the final set of chapters the agent is instead modelled as learning by example. Here the agent cannot learn by observing others, but has a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> to fall back on. This allows us to examine how an economic agent will perform if he sees a particular economic situation (or game) for the first time, but has experience of playing related games. The tool used to capture the notion of learning through example is a neural network. Throughout the thesis the central theme is that economic agents will naturally use as much information as they can to help them make decisions. In many cases this should mean they take into consideration others' actions or their own experiences in similar but non-identical situations. Learning throughout the thesis will be rational or bounded-rational in the sense that either the best possible way to learn will be utilized (so players achieve full rational play, for example, through Bayesian updating), or a suitable local error-minimizing algorithm will be developed (for example, a rule of thumb which optimizes play in a subclass of games, but not in the overall set of possible games). Several themes permeate the whole thesis, including the scope for firms or planners to manipulate the information that is used by agents for their own ends, the role of rules of thumb, and the realism of current theories of learning in economics. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Working Paper aims to {{contribute}} to a growing <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> of applying power analysis for improving social activism and organisational practice. Over the last decade, an increasing number of practitioners, researchers, NGOs, trusts and development agencies have introduced power frameworks and methods of power analysis into processes of context analysis, programme development and monitoring and evaluation. Power has been examined and addressed in relation to a vast range of development, human rights and social justice issues from women’s empowerment to economic justice and from local governance to HIV/AIDS. Power analysis processes have taken place from the UK to Colombia and from Indonesia to Sierra Leone with much innovation in methods and approaches for introducing ways of examining power with community members, grassroots leaders, NGO staff and donors. This practice paper brings together in a single review documented experiences of applying power analysis for social change. The paper draws emerging lessons from this growing stream of practice by looking across the actors, organisations and methodologies involved in power analysis in a diverse range of contexts and issues. It reviews a significant number of case studies, reports and other documents with particular emphasis on the Powercube framework and related concepts, and provides reflections on the usefulness of these power frameworks and concepts in relation to four areas of application: 1) context analysis; 2) strategy and action; 3) monitoring and evaluation; and 4) facilitation and learning. It further aims to facilitate learning and sharing both between experienced practitioners and new-comers to power analysis and to this end, it provides an annotated list and table of all documents reviewed. Finally, the paper highlights some challenges lying ahead for power analysis and invites the reader to contest emerging lessons and embark on new explorations from which more nuanced and contextualised reflections will emerge.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore an {{innovative}} approach to culture change at NASA that goes beyond reorganizations, management training, and a renewed emphasis on safety. Over the last five years, a technological social revolution has been emerging from the internet. Blogs (aka web logs) are transforming traditional communication and information sharing outlets away from established information sources such as the media. The Blogosphere has grown from zero blogs in 1999 to approximately 4. 5 million as of November 2004 and is expected to double in 2005. Blogs have demonstrated incredible effectiveness and efficiency with regards to affecting major military and political events. Consequently, NASA should embrace the new information paradigm presented by blogging. NASA can derive exceptional benefits from the new technology as follows: 1) Personal blogs can overcome the silent safety culture by giving voice to concerns or questions that are not well understood or seemingly inconsequential to the NASA community at-large without the pressure of formally raising a potential false alarm. Since blogs can be open to Agency-wide participation, an incredible amount of resources from an extensive <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> can focus on a single issue, concern, or problem and quickly vetted, discussed and assessed for feasibility, significance, and criticality. The speed for which this could be obtained cannot be matched through any other process or procedure currently in use. 2) Through official NASA established blogs, lessons learned can be a real-time two way process that is formed and implemented from the ground level. Data mining of official NASA blogs and personal blogs of NASA personnel can identify hot button issues and concerns to senior management. 3) NASA blogs could function as a natural ombudsman for the NASA community. Through the recognition of issues being voiced by the community and taking a proactive stance on those issues, credibility within NASA Management can be restored. For NASA to harness the capabilities of blogs, NASA must develop an Agency-wide policy on blogging to encourage use and provide guidance. This policy should describe basic rules of conduct and content as well as a policy of non-retribution and/or anonymity. The Agency must provide sever space within their firewalls, provide appropriate software tools, and promote blogs in newsletters and official websites. By embracing the use of blogs, a potential pool of 19, 000 experts could be available to address each posted safety issue, concern, problem, or question. Blogs could result in real NASA culture change...|$|E

40|$|The Human Exploration Science Office (KX) {{provides}} {{leadership for}} NASA's Imagery Integration (Integration 2) Team, an affiliation of {{experts in the}} use of engineering-class imagery intended to monitor the performance of launch vehicles and crewed spacecraft in flight. Typical engineering imagery assessments include studying and characterizing the liftoff and ascent debris environments; launch vehicle and propulsion element performance; in-flight activities; and entry, landing, and recovery operations. Integration 2 support has been provided not only for U. S. Government spaceflight (e. g., Space Shuttle, Ares I-X) but also for commercial launch providers, such as Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) and Orbital Sciences Corporation, servicing the International Space Station. The NASA Integration 2 Team is composed of imagery integration specialists from JSC, the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), who have access to a vast <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> and capabilities related to program integration, deployment and management of imagery assets, imagery data management, and photogrammetric analysis. The Integration 2 team is currently providing integration services to commercial demonstration flights, Exploration Flight Test- 1 (EFT- 1), and the Space Launch System (SLS) -based Exploration Missions (EM) - 1 and EM- 2. EM- 2 will be the first attempt to fly a piloted mission with the Orion spacecraft. The Integration 2 Team provides the customer (both commercial and Government) with access to a wide array of imagery options - ground-based, airborne, seaborne, or vehicle-based - that are available through the Government and commercial vendors. The team guides the customer in assembling the appropriate complement of imagery acquisition assets at the customer's facilities, minimizing costs associated with market research and the risk of purchasing inadequate assets. The NASA Integration 2 capability simplifies the process of securing one-of-a-kind imagery assets and skill sets, such as ground-based fixed and tracking cameras, crew-in the-loop imaging applications, and the integration of custom or commercial-off-the-shelf sensors onboard spacecraft. For spaceflight applications, the Integration 2 Team leverages modeling, analytical, and scientific resources along with decades of experience and lessons learned to assist the customer in optimizing engineering imagery acquisition and management schemes for any phase of flight - launch, ascent, on-orbit, descent, and landing. The Integration 2 Team guides the customer in using NASA's world-class imagery analysis teams, which specialize in overcoming inherent challenges associated with spaceflight imagery sets. Precision motion tracking, two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) photogrammetry, image stabilization, 3 D modeling of imagery data, lighting assessment, and vehicle fiducial marking assessments are available. During a mission or test, the Integration 2 Team provides oversight of imagery operations to verify fulfillment of imagery requirements. The team oversees the collection, screening, and analysis of imagery to build a set of imagery findings. It integrates and corroborates the imagery findings with other mission data sets, generating executive summaries to support time-critical mission decisions...|$|E

40|$|MM - P&DMAfter {{the first}} {{democratic}} elections in 1994, the new Administration {{was faced with}} a challenge to broaden access of public services to {{the majority of the population}} which was previously marginalized. This required a change in the culture of the Public officials, from that which was unresponsive to a more developmental, all-inclusive and customer driven culture. There have been various and robust interventions by the South African government in the past decade of Democracy in an effort to embark on a process of fundamental change. It thus became imperative for the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) to develop a support strategy and also build internal capacity to address and support departments faced with similar challenges, by establishing a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> personnel for both long-term and rapid response purposes.
