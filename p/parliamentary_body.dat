500|$|Charles {{had already}} {{stressed}} the treasury to its limit with his extravagant Flemish court, and over 1 million gold florins were spent in bribes for the election. [...] Taxes {{had to be}} raised to cover the debt, but [...] any new taxes {{must be approved by}} the Cortes (Castile's own <b>parliamentary</b> <b>body).</b> [...] Thus, in late March 1520, Charles convened the Cortes in Santiago de Compostela. [...] Charles ensured the Cortes would only have limited power, and further attempted to stack the Cortes with pliable representatives he could bribe. [...] Support for the opposition only increased in response, and the representatives demanded that their grievances be heard first before any new tax was granted.|$|E
500|$|Parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Lesser Poland territories were {{included}} in the Austrian partition as early as the First Partition of Poland in 1772. From about 1775 to 1848, with several gaps, the crown land of Galicia had a relatively powerless <b>parliamentary</b> <b>body,</b> known originally as the Postulate Sejm (...) , and from 1817, as Estates of Galicia (...) [...] The Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria, which was formed in 1861 following the promulgation of the October Diploma by Emperor Franz Joseph I, had more real power than its predecessors. In Polish parliamentary tradition, it is considered to have continued the history of the general sejm and regional sejmiks on the lands of Lesser Poland and Ruthenia.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{government}} was wary of Bottomley it was prepared {{to make use of}} his influence and popularity. In April 1915 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George asked him to speak to shipworkers on the River Clyde, who were threatening industrial action. After Bottomley's intervention the strike was averted. In 1917 he visited the front in France, where after dining with Field-Marshal Haig he was a considerable success with the troops, as he was later when he visited the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow. He hoped that these morale-boosting activities would lead to a formal government position, but although from time to time there were rumours of a Cabinet post, no appointment was announced. In the later stages of the war Bottomley was a regular critic of the National War Aims Committee (NWAC), a cross-party <b>parliamentary</b> <b>body</b> formed in 1917 to revitalise Britain's commitment to victory and to underline the justice of its cause. Bottomley described the committee as [...] "a dodge for doctoring public opinion", and in January 1918 told Lloyd George, who had become prime minister in December 1916, that NWAC had failed in its purpose and should be replaced by a Director of Propaganda—but to no avail.|$|E

500|$|Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., {{argues in}} The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an {{indirectly}} elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional {{checks and balances}} by providing for oversight by a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>body</b> that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, globalization has tended to increase {{the power of the}} executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch; for instance, U.S. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have been given [...] authority to negotiate trade agreements, subject to a [...] "yea or nay" [...] scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal. A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government: [...] "The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate, to help achieve economic growth. In April 1998, a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty, adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones. The United States executive branch agreed to the changes, but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty, even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty. The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval." [...] World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30, however, suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that stand to lose power: [...] "Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA. They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states; whatever action the UN takes is a result of bargaining and compromise among member states".|$|E
2500|$|After further review {{with members}} of his party, Law changed his initial beliefs on tariff reform and {{accepted}} the full package, including duties on foodstuffs. On 29 February 1912 the entire Conservative <b>parliamentary</b> <b>body</b> (i.e. both MPs and peers) met at Lansdowne House, with Lord Lansdowne chairing. Lansdowne argued that although the electorate might prefer the Conservative Party if they dropped food duties from their tariff reform plan, it would open them to accusations of bad faith and [...] "poltroonery". Law endorsed Lansdowne's argument, pointing out that any attempt to avoid food duties would cause an internal party struggle and could only aid the Liberals, and that Canada, the most economically important colony and a major exporter of foodstuffs, would never agree to tariffs without British support of food duties.|$|E
