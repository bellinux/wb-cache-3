The theoretical part concerns itself with importance of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in human life, particularly in a child's life, and point out to the risks and problems connected to a sedentary lifestyle. The practical part focuses on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> of middle school students in chosen parts of the Usti Region. The questionnaire survey in this part of theses detects the extend of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and differences between children living in bigger and smaller towns. Part of this passage is also mapping of current possibilities of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and sports grounds in this region. Finally, there are several recommended changes presented in the paper that would lead to increase in interest of middle school students in <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> namely lowering prices of extracurricular <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and increase in amount of school <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> KEYWORDS: movement, leisure time activities, health, motivatio...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{lifestyles of}} female {{students from the}} whole University of South Bohemia, focusing on <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> their regularity, opinion of negative addictive drugs, relationship towards healthy diet and drinking water habits, and interest in relaxation.

The principal method of this study was by the questionnaire. The questionnaire study of 1, 706 house-wives was conducted by collecting data necessary to construct the analytical theory on the subject. The investigation was conducted in Oct. 1977. The main results obtained was as follows; 1. Most of house-wives are healthy. But, after about forty years old, the number of the unhealthy increases. As for the frequency of house-wives 2 ̆ 7 participation in the <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> most of them conduct the <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> "weekly" or "monthly".

40|$|Regular {{implementation}} of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> {{has a positive}} effect on our health, on both social and emotional area of operation as well as learning since it supports the learning and thinking processes. In the master’s thesis we focused on the {{implementation of}} <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in teaching in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard, attended by children with mild mental disabilities. These children face difficulties in the field of motoric development therefore it is of great importance to promote and implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> In doing so the teacher can help developing the student’s cognitive, emotional and social fields along with the motoric skills. In some cases the implementation of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in the teaching process depends on the teacher’s beliefs on the importance of being physically active. Therefore we examined the teachers’ beliefs on the importance of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> both in everyday life and teaching children in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard, to what measure and in what way do they implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> when teaching children with mild mental disabilities; and what effects they have noticed with their pupils. 97 teachers who teach in the adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard took part in our research. The research data was acquired through a questionnaire. The results have shown that most teachers have positive beliefs on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and their implementation in the teaching process. The majority of teachers often and in diverse ways include <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> while teaching. They also implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> at different school subjects, {{in all parts of the}} lessons and at almost all stages of the learning process. There are however some differences in the frequency of implementing <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> between teachers who teach in the first, second or the third educational cycle. Furthermore the frequency of implementing <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> is different with teachers who teach in homogenous or multi-grade classes. The teachers have indicated positive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> on the students’ motoric, emotional, cognitive and social areas of operation. Most teachers do not have any problems with the implementation of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in their teaching process although some report problems with the children’s behaviour (some students become more difficult to calm down or too lively and thus unpredictable situations arise more quickly), some face time or space constraints or problems connected to teaching in multi-grade classes. The results have shown that teachers who teach in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard have positive beliefs on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and their use in teaching. They often implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in their teaching process and they have indicated positive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> on their students...|$|R

Since <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> impacts all of these important parts of the brain, this form of exercise keeps the neural networks functioning well. Neural networks allow information to process and pass to the hippocampus in order to retain memory. This lets the brain be more efficient in processing and more memories are stored this way.|$|E

Design A sample of forty 4 - to 6 -year-old children from the Illawarra region in New South Wales, Australia were included in data analysis. Methods Participants completed a ∼ 150 -min room calorimeter protocol involving age-appropriate sedentary behaviors, light-intensity <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and moderate-to vigorous-intensity <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> activPAL™ accelerometer counts were collected over 15 s epochs. Energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry and direct observation were used as the criterion measure. Predicted metabolic equivalents were calculated using the activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation (activPAL™ software version 5. 8. 0). Predictive validity was evaluated using dependent-samples t-tests. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups to develop and cross-validate an intensity threshold for moderate-to vigorous-intensity <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> Receiver operating characteristic curve {{analysis was used to}} determine moderate-to vigorous-intensity <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> threshold. The classification accuracy of the developed threshold was cross-validated using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic-curve. Results The activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation significantly overestimated metabolic equivalents during sedentary behaviors and significantly underestimated metabolic equivalents for light-intensity <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> moderate-to vigorous-intensity <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and total metabolic equivalents compared to measured metabolic equivalents (all P 3 ̆c 0. 001).
