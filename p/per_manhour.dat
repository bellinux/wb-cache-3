40|$|This paper uses micro panel data {{to examine}} {{differences}} in the cyclical variability of employment, hours, and real wages for skilled and unskilled workers. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that, at the aggregate level, skilled and unskilled workers are subject to essentially {{the same degree of}} cyclical variation in wages. However, important differences emerge in the patterns of employment and hours variation for skilled versus unskilled workers, especially when a college degree is used as a proxy for skills. We find that the quality of labor input <b>per</b> <b>manhour</b> tends to rise in recessions, thereby inducing a countercyclical bias in aggregate measures of the real wage. We also find substantial differences across industries in the cyclical variation of employment, hours, and wage differentials, which we interpret as indicative of important inter-industry differences in labor contracting. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{of the working}} conditions for those employed {{in the business of}} abrasive blasting. The facilities studied were located in Texas, Alabama, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maine, Washington, and Kansas. Participating workers completed an abrasive blaster respiratory protection survey designed to determine the degree of respiratory protection currently afforded them during their blasting tasks. The returns indicated over 72, 000 <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> month were performed by 1018 workers in 160 reporting establishments. The number of blasters employed by a single firm varied from 1 to 120. Samples of airborne particle sizes taken from the breathing zone of the various workers indicated in all cases particles which were well within the respirable range. The findings of this study suggest there were as many as 100, 000 abrasive blasters with personal exposures to silica (14808607) dust environments up to 60 million <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> year. The protection given to the workers was at best marginal and ranged to poor. In most cases there were deficiencies in equipment and lack of proper maintenance. Threshold limit values for quartz exposure and noise exposure were exceeded in most locations. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Austin Blair. NIOSH survey. Also available via the World Wide Web.

40|$|Municipal unions {{may often}} {{use their own}} votes and those of {{sympathetic}} fellow citizens to promote increases in demand for municipal services. If successful, this strategy can increase member employment levels without sacrificing compensation. Municipal employee unionization significantly increases levels of annual <b>manhours</b> and employment <b>per</b> capita, and reduces annual hours of workper employee. The net effect of average unionization levels is to increase employees per capita by at least 4. 7 %, and <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> capita by at least 3. 3 %, over levels that would prevail {{in the absence of}} municipal unions. These effects occur almost entirely in functions withr ecognized bargaining units.

Property rights arrangement {{is defined as}} rights to residual profits in the forprofit hospitals, and the tax-exemption status {{on the part of}} nonprofit and government hospitals with obligations to serve charitable purposes in the public interest. This dissertation derives and tests implications about differences in behavior in the context of efficiency, equity, and quality of care delivered in nonprofit, government, and forprofit hospitals. Fifty-six hospitals with Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) accreditation were compared on institutional variables (bed size, location 3 Ì†e; efficiency variables (occupancy rates, ancillary expenses, bad debts, <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> patient day, salaries per FTE, length of stay/DRG, charges/DRG, reimbursement/ORB (on twenty DRGs); equity variables (Medicare days, Medicaid days, and uncompensated care); and finally, the quality variable (death rates/DRS on twenty DRGs). The immediate effects of profit maximization is considered as an incentive for managers in the forprofit hospitals. The social obligations attached to the tax-exemption status can be argued as the underlying rationale far output maximization, i. e. maximizing benefits to society by serving more patients in the nonprofit and government hospitals. Using analysis of variance, nonprofit, government, and forprofit hospitals were compared to determine if statistically significant differences were present at the. 05 level of significance. Pairs of hospital types were tested for significant differences using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and multiple regression analysis. The results provided mixed support for the property rights theory. Significant differences were found on institutional variables, bed size and location; efficiency variables, bad debts, <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> patient day, and charges per DRG; equity variables Medicare days, Medicaid days, and uncompensated care. In terms of the quality variable, the death rates per DRG showed no statistical significance. Unexpectedly, nonprofit hospitals were very similar to forprofit hospitals on the variables bad debts and Medicaid days. The relevance of this finding to health policy issues today, particularly tax-exemption privileges, warrant a suggestion for further evaluation of the performance of the nonprofit sector...|$|R

A {{study was conducted}} to determine whether the Maintenance Training Improvement Program (MTIP) has any relation performance of the west coast F- 14 and E- 2 squadrons. Using correlation analysis, the MTIP completion rate was compared with operational measures such as the Full Mission Capable (FMC) rate, the number of no-defect (malfunction code A- 799) maintenance actions, and the Direct Maintenance <b>Manhours</b> <b>per</b> Flight Hour (DMMH/FH). A moderate positive correlation was found between the MTIP completion rate and the FMC rate, and a moderately weak negative correlation was found between the MTIP completion rate and the number of A- 799 maintenance actions. There was no correlation found between the MTIP completion rate and the DMMH/FH. These relationships have provided some insight with encouraging implications for further research to assess the existing training program. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with labour productivity in traditional house building in Scotland. Productivity {{is a measure of}} the effective use of resources and provides vital benefits that can be combined in a number of ways. The introduction gives the background to two Scottish house building sites (Blantyre and Greenfield) that were surveyed by the Building Research Establishment (BEE) activity sampling method to provide the data for the study. The study had two main objectives; (1) summary data analysis in average <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> house between all the houses on the site, and (2) detailed data analysis in average manhours for each house block on the site. The introduction also provides a literature review related to the objectives. The method is outlined in Chapter 2, the sites are discussed in Chapter 3, and Chapter 4 covers the method application on each site and a method development made in the study. The summary data analysis (Chapter 5) compares Blantyre and Greenfield, and two previous BEE surveys in England. The main detailed data analysis consisted of three forms, (Chapters 6, 7 and 8) each applied to a set of operations. The three forms of analysis were variations in average <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> house for each house block on the site compared with; (1) block construction order, (2) average number of separate visits per house made by operatives to each block to complete an operation, and (3) average number of different operatives per house employed on an operation in each block. Three miscellaneous items of detail data analysis are discussed in Chapter 9. The conclusions to the whole study state that considerable variations in manhours for repeated operations were discovered, that the numbers of visits by operatives to complete operations were large and that the numbers of different operatives employed in some operations were a factor related to productivity. A critique of the activity sampling method suggests that the data produced is reliable in summary form and can give a good context for more detailed data collection. For future work, this could take the form of selected operations, with the context of an activity sampling survey, that wuld be intensively surveyed by other methods...|$|R
40|$|It is an axiom of the {{manufacturing}} of any complex product that errors will occur that require repair or discard of said product. In building aircraft, Raptor Aerospace encounters and repairs numerous deviations from the original design drawings. This process is known as rework. Reducing the amount of rework necessary represents a substantial opportunity both for improving quality and for cutting cost. Rework can be further split into several categories, with the simplest repairs referred to as reworkable discrepancies which has been valued at over $ 50, 000, 000 per year. This thesis will present a project that began {{at the start of}} the internship, when the author was paired with a specialist from Raptor Aerospace to lead a team whose purpose was to develop an approach and implement improvements that would generate a significant reduction in rework. This process would include both physical changes to {{the manufacturing}} process and would target specific aspects of the prevailing culture at Raptor. With no existing plan for reducing rework, the two team leaders began the project by conducting a thorough analysis of existing rework data, focusing on the descriptive texts that were provided by inspectors. This analysis generated a pareto of the inspectors' words, enabling the team to identify the most common causes of rework at Raptor. Based on these results, small teams were created to perform root cause and corrective action analyses on the biggest issues. In addition to the small teams, the co-leaders also searched for solutions that would have a systemic impact on the volume of rework. To this end, an automated tool was developed that would report the rework history of every single task completed in final assembly. Within the timeframe of the internship (6. 5 months), the various approaches completed by the project team produced verified annualized savings of over $ 2, 000, 000, as well as time savings of over 40 <b>manhours</b> <b>per</b> week. In addition, other efforts that were begun but not yet completed have anticipated savings of over $ 10, 000, 000. Finally, the project has produced indications of cultural improvements within Raptor Aerospace, as individuals and departments have begun volunteering to contribute and lead improvement efforts. Overall, it appears that the approaches taken by the project team have successfully launched a change initiative which could have substantial and long-lasting value to Raptor Aerospace. by Jeremy A.
