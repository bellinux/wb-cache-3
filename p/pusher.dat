5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a <b>pusher</b> propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a <b>pusher</b> propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the <b>pusher</b> prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|He {{ranks as}} an early pioneer of aviation, having built and flown his own inventions at a time roughly {{contemporaneous}} with the Wright brothers during the heady, pre-World War I era of aeroplane vogue. He was accepted into the exclusive pioneers' club of Early Birds of Aviation soon after its 1928 foundation, and he was formally added to the Kansas Aviation Museum's Hall of Fame in 1997. A single example of Longren's aircraft – the 1914 <b>pusher</b> biplane that he crashed in Abilene – remains on permanent exhibit at the Kansas Museum of History.|$|E

Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal <b>pusher,</b> which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E

He practiced six landings and progressed to the more powerful Avro 504 as the last Farman had been written off by another student.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or <b>pusher.</b> While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E

50|$|<b>Push</b> {{cars were}} {{passenger}} and freight cars powered by human labor. The <b>push</b> cars operated on narrow gauge railways. On Taiwan, the gauge was 18 to 20 inches. The {{design of the}} <b>push</b> cars was simple; {{the foundation of the}} <b>push</b> car was a platform attached to railway wheels. Behind the platform were two raised poles, where <b>push</b> car operators could <b>push</b> the car along the railways.

40|$|Shear wave elastography is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} in which tissue elasticity is estimated by measuring the speed of ultrasound-induced shear waves. This study aimed to implement four shear wave generating <b>pushes</b> and compare their performance according to chosen metrics. The focused <b>push,</b> unfocused <b>push,</b> unfocused comb <b>push</b> and line <b>push</b> were implemented on a Verasonics ultrasound system and tested on a polyvinyl alcohol phantom. Shear wave propagation was imaged using angle-compounded ultrafast imaging. Axial particle velocities were estimated using a 2 D autocorrelator and then cross-correlated to obtain local shear wave speed estimates. The focused <b>push</b> and line <b>push</b> were found to generate shear waves with 1 [...] 3 times higher peak axial particle velocity, implying better signal-to-noise ratios. The focused <b>push,</b> unfocused <b>push</b> and line <b>push</b> were found to exhibit areas 7 mm wide around the <b>pushing</b> beams in which shear wave speed cannot be estimated, whereas the unfocused comb <b>push</b> has no such blind area...|$|R

25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the <b>pusher,</b> and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the <b>pusher</b> forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The <b>pusher</b> can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the <b>pusher</b> when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the <b>pusher</b> is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side.

25|$|An {{implosion}} {{shock wave}} {{might be of}} such short duration that {{only part of the}} pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes through it. To prevent this, a <b>pusher</b> shell may be needed. The <b>pusher</b> is located between the explosive lens and the tamper. It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backwards, thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration. It is made out of a low density metal—such as aluminium, beryllium, or an alloy of the two metals (aluminium is easier and safer to shape, and is two orders of magnitude cheaper; beryllium has high-neutron-reflective capability). Fat Man used an aluminium <b>pusher.</b>|$|E
25|$|Steel is {{classified}} by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation of +1A1 ICE-1A+ <b>Pusher</b> and Pusher/Barge Unit E0. It {{has the highest}} Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, {{which means that the}} <b>pusher</b> is designed to operate in difficult ice conditions both alone and when coupled to a barge mainly without icebreaker assistance. While usually connected to a barge, Steel is also capable of operating independently. However, the low metacentric height of the <b>pusher,</b> only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the vessel very uncomfortable in severe weather. For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it is absolutely necessary.|$|E

Five <b>pushing</b> heights were selected {{as a percentage of the}} subjects shoulder height (61, 69. 5, 78, 86. 5 and 95 %).

When <b>pushing</b> a wheelchair on to a pavement, net moments around wrists, elbows, shoulders compression and shear forces at L 5 -S 1 and external vertical forces were lower using higher <b>pushing</b> heights. When low <b>pushing</b> handles are used, elderly female attendants are at risk of L 5 -S 1 low back pain when lifting and <b>pushing</b> the wheelchair on to a pavement.
