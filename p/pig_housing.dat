The aim of the current work is to numerically model the air speed and temperature in mechanical ventilation <b>pig</b> <b>housing</b> to achieve optimum environment control. The simulation model was assumed as a steady two-dimensional numerical model including the effect of buoyancy, turbulence and heat generated by the pigs. The model was solved using the computational fluid dynamics software, Fluent, {{which is based on}} the integral volume method. Air flow pattern and temperature inside the <b>pig</b> <b>housing</b> and at the pigs' level were predicted for different arrangements of inlet widths and inlet velocities in the range of 1 - 5 ms- 1. Different layouts were set up to determine the optimum design for the thermal comfort zones under daylight situation with ambient temperature of 30 c degrees and night situation with ambient temperature of 26 c degrees. From the analysis, location of inlets and outlets has to be carefully considered in order to enhance the air distribution in the <b>pig</b> <b>housing.</b> The use of water sprayer system during daylight was essential for <b>pig</b> <b>housing</b> in Malaysia to provide thermal comfort for the pigs.

40|$|HOUSING for pigs reared {{for meat}} has been revolutionised {{over the past}} 50 years, and {{modifications}} in flooring have been {{a key component of}} this change. While the introduction of slatted floors that do not require manual removal of soiled bedding and dung has reduced labour requirements and production costs, solid floors are still in use on some commercial farms in Britain, particularly in older or converted buildings, and are more common in Britain than in other European pig-producing countries. Floors in <b>pig</b> <b>housing</b> can impact on the health and welfare of pigs by affecting an animal’s opportunity to engage in normal behaviour and increasing the risk of infectious disease and physical damage due to contact with the floor.

40|$|Abstract Routine Trichinella meat {{inspection}} at the slaughterhouse detected one larva in a pooled batch of 100 pig samples. The larva {{was sent to}} the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) for species identification. Morphological examination revealed that the larva was not Trichinella spp. Molecular analysis was performed. PCR and sequencing of 5 S/ITS identified the larva as Toxocara cati. A second round of digests was carried out at the {{meat inspection}} laboratory, in smaller batches to try to identify the infected animal. No further larvae were detected and {{it was not possible to}} identify which of the 100 animals the larva had come from. This is the first time that Toxocara cati has been reported in slaughterhouse pigs in Norway. Although the infected individual could not be identified, the meat originated from one of six potential farms. A small survey regarding rodent control and cats was sent to each of these farms. Cats had restricted access to food storage areas (two farms reported that cats had access) whilst none of the farms allowed cats into the production housing. Cats were, however, present on all the farms (mostly stray cats of unknown health status). Half of the farms also reported seeing rodents in the <b>pig</b> <b>housing</b> during the previous six months and half reported finding rodents in the feed and straw storage areas.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prove the {{hypothesis}} that the noise emissions from <b>pig</b> <b>housing</b> varies according to the time of day and the season. The measurements were performed in a building for 1150 fattening pigs with a slatted floor during summer and winter. The pigs (average weight 95 kg) were kept in pens under a batch management system. Nine places were the focus of sound intensity measurements (one inside the stable in section 7; eight places outside the building). The measurements were performed during three sets of 5 consecutive days in summer and three sets in winter. On each day the data were obtained during three 30 min periods (before feeding, during feeding and after feeding). The measurement was made inside and outside the building at the same time. The level of noise depends very significantly upon the period of measurement (before feeding, during feeding, after feeding). The following values were recorded inside (place 1) : 65. 5 ± 1. 6 dB before feeding, 72. 0 ± 1. 4 dB during feeding and 63. 4 ± 0. 7 dB after feeding (P < 0. 001). The effect of seasonal noise levels can be seen only in outside measurements (P P < 0. 01).

40|$|In {{recent decades}} pig {{production}} has been intensified in most European countries.

In the Netherlands, Denmark and France approximately 50 % of the ammonia emissions from pig production is from <b>pig</b> <b>housing</b> and slurry storage. Ammonia emissions from pig houses can be reduced by: (1) lowering the concentrations of urea and ammonia in the slurry; (2) lowering the temperature of the slurry; (3) reducing the emitting surface area; (4) reducing the pH of the slurry. Various housing techniques have been developed to reduce ammonia emissions. Most of these techniques are costly but cheaper systems are becoming available. A combination of housing and feeding measures seems most promising to achieve a substantial reduction in ammonia emissions at relatively low costs. Lowering the protein content of the diet, including non-starch polysaccharides and adding acidifying salts instead of CaCO 3 are the main possibilities at the moment to reduce the ammonia emission by dietary means...|$|E

40|$|Dutch {{environmental}} laws are also valid for organic pig farms, however {{for a number}} of laws and regulations an exception is allowed. Due to the increasing farm size it is not always clear how the regulations should be applied. This is especially the case around the availability of pasture for dry sows. This was the reason for organic pig farmers to start this desk study. In this report the existing legislation is clarified and the consequences are pointed out for providing the sows an outdoor area with pasture. An important issue is if the pasture should be considered as part of the pen or not. For emissions of ammonia, odour and dust the outer limits of the <b>pig</b> <b>house</b> are considered as emission points. This is important for the area (circles) around the <b>pig</b> <b>house</b> where it can result in negative effects on neighbours and nature. Based on existing legislation and available knowledge it is described when the pasture could possibly belong to the <b>pig</b> <b>house.</b> The outdoor production of manure and urine as well as rooting behaviour determine the classification of the pasture. A good fine tuning of <b>pig</b> <b>house,</b> outdoor run and pasture the proportion of manure in the pasture can be decreased. This also decreases the leaking of minerals to the ground water. Offering the pigs an attractive lying area is the most important measure. Dunging mainly takes place on a limited distance of the lying area. When the outdoor walking distance between lying area and pasture is long and wide enough the majority of the excretion will take place in this area. Another option is to increase the time after eating before the sows can enter the pasture.
