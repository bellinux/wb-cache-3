40|$|A {{number of}} stylized facts have been {{documented}} about the extensive margin of trade— whether to export or not, and, if so, how many products to how many destinations. We note {{that some of the}} reported facts would be expected to arise if exports shipments were randomly allocated across categories (e. g., <b>product</b> <b>codes,</b> <b>destination</b> countries). They are, thus, not informative of the underlying economic decisions. We formalize the random assignment of shipments to categories as balls falling into bins, reproducing the structure inherent to disaggregate trade data. The balls-and-bins model quantitatively reproduces the prevalence of zero productlevel trade flows across export destinations. The model also accounts for firm-level facts: as in the data, most firms export a single product to a single country but these firms represent a tiny fraction of total exports. In contrast, the balls-and-bins cannot match the small fraction of exporters among U. S. firms and overpredicts their size premium relative to non-exporters. We argue that the balls-and-bins model is a useful statistical tool to discern the interesting facts in disaggregated trade data from patterns arising mechanically through chance. ...|$|R
40|$|Firms {{in local}} {{industries}} maintain their capability to generate new export varieties by simultaneously exploiting {{internal and external}} knowledge resources. The paper introduces the notion variety triplet' to distinguish individual export varieties, where a triplet is a unique combination of a firm, a <b>product</b> <b>code</b> and a <b>destination</b> country. For each date, the set of variety triplets in each local industry records all remaining export varieties introduced in the past. In view of this, the paper examines how internal and external knowledge of local industries influence the industry's scope and value of export varieties. First, the paper contributes by considering a local industry's internal and external knowledge, {{as well as the}} conjunction of its internal and external knowledge sources. Second, the knowledge sources are shown to influence both the stock and the dynamics of a local industry's variety triplets, using firm-level data from Sweden...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{distributed}} coding for sensor networks. We consider energy-and-complexity-constrained sensors that communicate with a distant sink {{at a relatively}} low data rate {{with the help of}} a relay with higher-power and better-processing capabilities. We assume an orthogonal multiple access to the resources. Sources transmit independently and use simple short block codes to limit delay and complexity. The relay performs network encoding of the detected codewords and forwards either partial or complete coded information. The sink jointly decodes observations coming both from sources and relay to simultaneously estimate the information sent by the source nodes. We first analyse the cooperative scheme from an information theoretical point of view in order to determine the resource allocation strategy between the sources and the relay, which maximizes the overall network sum-rate. When a single relay is used and the source-to-relay link is not error-free, occasional detection errors introduce additional errors at the relay output, which, in turn, critically affect decoding performance and yield error-floors at the destination. In the case of a distributed coding scheme based on <b>product</b> <b>codes,</b> we obtain a closed-form asymptotically-tight approximation of the error probability under a minimum-distance decoding of the <b>product</b> <b>code</b> at the <b>destination.</b> The proposed analysis takes explicitly into account the error propagation at the relay output and may be extended to other forms of distributed coding schemes...|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} codes, {{half-product}} <b>codes,</b> derived from <b>product</b> <b>codes,</b> is characterized. These codes have the implementation advantages of <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> and possess a special structural property which {{leads them to}} have larger (at least 3 / 2 times more) minimum distance than <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> With the same length and rate, they have better scaling in the error floor than <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> They also have a larger minimum stopping-set size under iterative decoding which provides better scaling. The main results of this thesis are summarized as follows: 1. Encoding and decoding methods of half-product codes are described. 2. The minimum distance of these codes is derived, and proved {{to be at least}} 3 2 times larger than that of the <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> for the same rate and block length. 3.

40|$|The aim of {{coding theory}} is to design codes which can achieve the {{fundamental}} limits of communication [52] and yet are simple to implement. On average randomly constructed codes can achieve this goal, {{but with a}} decoding complexity that is impractical. Consequently, highly structured codes with practical decoding algorithms have been extensively studied. Unfortunately {{the vast majority of}} these codes do not approach capacity. Recent advances involving simple 'random like' codes with practical iterative decoding algorithms have closely approached capacity as the blocklength increases. This thesis investigates single parity check (SPC) <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> and introduces the class of randomly interleaved (RI) SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> It will be shown that RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> can asymptotically force the probability of error to zero, at code rates up to capacity, for almost all codewords. Furthermore the structure of these codes allows a very simple, sub-optimal, iterative decoding algorithm to be used. This thesis also derives an asymptotic analysis on SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> from the decoding point of view. It is shown that the probability of error can be driven to zero, as the blocklength increases, for signal to noise ratios within 2 dB of capacity on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Simulation results for both SPC and RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> in an AWGN channel are presented. These results indicate that RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> perform very well, typically within 1. 5 dB of capacity over a wide range of blocklengths and code rates. Further analysis on the weight enumerator of finite length RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> is used to confirm the error floor of these codes. Extensions to parallel and serially concatenated SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> are also investigated. Simulation results show an advantageous trade-off between code rate, blocklength and performance for three dimensional parallel concatenated SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> The design of irregular SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> is also considered, and some simulation results are presented...|$|R

40|$|Hyper Codes and Skew Codes are CRC-developed error-correcting code families. They are FEC {{codes that}} employ {{iterative}} decoding. HyperCode technology is {{also referred to}} as eTPC technology- enhanced Turbo <b>Product</b> <b>Codes.</b> HyperCode (eTPC) hardware encoders/decoders are available from AHA [1]- both ICs and cores. HyperCode Concept The basic idea of Hyper Codes is to improve upon the performance of <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> by adding additional coding constraints (often diagonally) to a standard <b>product</b> <b>code.</b> For example, a (17, 16) 3 <b>product</b> <b>code</b> has dmin= 8; an associated HyperCode of size (17, 16) (17, 16) (18, 16) has dmin= 14 - almost doubling the minimum distance of the basic <b>product</b> <b>code,</b> while still maintaining a very regular structure (which is important for high-speed hardware implementations). SkewCode Concept Skew Codes are similar in structure to Hyper Codes. Code constructions derived from standard <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> are augmented with additional sets of parity equations. They feature a great deal of parallelism that can be exploited for highspeed decoding and have straightforward data routing, in contrast to codes that have pseudo-random interleaving or connections. Unlike standard turbo <b>product</b> <b>codes,</b> extremely large minimum distances can be achieved using component codes that are composed of only single-bit parity checks. This means that Skew Codes, like Hyper Codes, may be decoded with very simple, high-speed soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoders...|$|R
