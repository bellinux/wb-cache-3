40|$|United States Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ("US GAAP") {{generally}} requires {{taxes to}} be measured at the rate applicable to distributed profits, while International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") requires the undistributed rate to be used. This current conflict between US GAAP and IFRS has particular relevance in South Africa, which has a dual tax' system as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> Secondary Tax on Companies ("STC") being levied when a company distributes its profits. Currently, under US GAAP, South African companies {{would be required to}} raise a liability for the tax that would become payable' on the future distribution of profits, while under IFRS, this is only recognised when the profits are distributed. The objective of the study is, therefore, to consider the timing of the recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liability for STC. The literature study has indicated strong arguments for both the recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> inability for STC prior to the declaration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> and the non-recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liability for STC prior to the dec 1 aration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend.</b> The empirical study, however, concluded that the recognition of ability prior to the declaration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> is not appropriate, as <b>a</b> majority <b>of</b> the respondents believe that no "past event" has occurred and therefore the definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liability in terms of the IASB Framework is not satisfied. The results of the empirical study, however, also indicate that if the "past event” hurdle could be overcome, uncertainty exists as to whether the recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liability for STC prior to the declaration is appropriate. This is as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> mixed opinions among the respondents as to whether the "probability" and "measurability" criteria, in terms of the IASB Framework, could be satisfied prior to the declaration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} {{corporate}} private information is {{transmitted to the}} market in two complementary phases. The accounting information is released first, followed by <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> change announcement. Hence, investors assess the dividend signal only after consideration of accounting information. The analysis suggests that the dividend signal has three components: the expected favourableness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> signal (good, bad, or ambiguous), the direction of dividend change (+ or -) {{and the role of}} the dividend signal (confirmatory, clarificatory or unclear) in clearing corporate uncertainty. The mechanism of classifying the signal according to the three components is presented and tested. Consistent with the dividend literature, dividend change announcements are found to influence share prices. Also, the role <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signals has <b>a</b> distinguishable effect on the firm's share price. Nevertheless, the expected favourableness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> signal emerges as the dominant factor among the three signalling components. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{incorporation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> yield in {{the classical}} option pricing model of Black- Scholes results in <b>a</b> minor modification <b>of</b> the Black-Scholes formula, since the lognormal dynamic of the underlying asset is preserved. However, market makers prefer to work with cash dividends with fixed value instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> yield. Since there is no closed-form solution for the price <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European Call in this case, many methods have been proposed in the literature to approximate it. Here, we present a new approach. We derive an exact analytic formula for the sensitivity to <b>dividends</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> European option. We use this result to elaborate a proxy which possesses the same Taylor expansion around 0 {{with respect to the}} dividends as the exact price. The obtained approximation is very fast to compute (the same complexity than the usual Black-Scholes formula) and numerical tests show the extreme accuracy of the method for all practical cases. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{reaction}} of marginal investors to the announcement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surprise <b>dividend</b> increase has been measured. Although field research is performed on companies {{listed on the}} Warsaw Stock Exchange, the paper has important theoretical implications. Valuation theory gives many clues for the interpretation of changes in dividends. At {{the start of the}} literature review, the assumption of the irrelevance of dividends (to investment decisions) is described. This assumption is the basis for up-to-date valuation procedures leading to fundamental and fair market valuation of equity (shares). The paper is designed to verify whether the market value of stock is immune to the surprise announcement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> increase. This study of the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surprise <b>dividend</b> increase gives the chance to partially isolate such <b>an</b> event from <b>dividend</b> changes based on long-term expectations. The result of the research explicitly shows that <b>a</b> surprise <b>dividend</b> increase is on average welcomed by investors (an average abnormal return of 2. 24 % with <b>an</b> associated p-value <b>of</b> 0. 001). Abnormal returns are realized by investors when there is a surprise increase in <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> payout. The subsample of relatively high increases in <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> payout enables investors to gain a 3. 2 % return on average. The results show that valuation models should be revised to take into account <b>a</b> possible impact <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> changes on investors behavior. (original abstract...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} hedge fund ownership, mutual fund ownership, board composition and large block ownership on the dividend policy of telecommunications firms. The paper is intended to test the agency cost hypothesis for dividends, in which <b>dividends</b> serve as <b>a</b> substitute control mechanism in circumstances in which shareholder control has been attenuated. The evidence suggests that hedge fund ownership serves as <b>a</b> substitute for <b>dividends</b> as <b>a</b> corporate control mechanism to alleviate agency problems. However, the same case cannot be made for mutual fund ownership. The evidence also suggests that board independence increases the likelihood and the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> payout. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the joint presence of independent boards and large shareholdings reduces the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> payment. The latter two results suggest that greater independent board representation provides an effective medium for shareholders to extract dividends {{as well as a}} complement to top shareholder concentration in relieving agency costs. Overall, the results provide ample support for <b>an</b> agency-theoretic explanation <b>of</b> <b>dividends...</b>|$|R
