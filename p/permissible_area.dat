In addition to legally capping the amount land holding by the government, the voluntary Bhoodan movement of 1950s and 60s also led to the donation of the land ownership from rich owners to the landless tenants. Government also undertook aggressive land consolidation and standardization of killa (agricultural plots of one acre each).|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{residential}} and industrial solid waste, {{and the need}} for landfill sites, is ever growing due to increases in population and industrial production. Land-filling is a widely used method for environmentally safe disposal of solid waste, and the selection of the most suitable landfill site is a very crucial decision. In this study, a new site evaluation method to determine suitable landfill sites, called Landfill Area Quality (LAQ), is introduced. This method is applied in two stages. First, several potential landfill sites, which are within legally <b>permissible</b> <b>areas,</b> are chosen by a general consideration of the relevant site properties. Then, the characteristics of these chosen sites are placed within three-dimensional evaluation spaces. These evaluative dimensions are (1) site suitability, (2) location factors, and (3) public acceptability, and each is defined by a combination of different criteria. The result of this re-evaluation, which provides valuable information to planning engineers and decision makers about the available sites, is reported to decision makers for the final selection. A detailed case study was carried out as part of a residential solid waste disposal project for the city of Isparta in Turkey, (population 150, 000), and was very useful to planners...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Various {{aspects of}} the {{improvement}} of the functioning of grinding accuracy are considered. Active methods of the control of grinding systems are proposed to ensure the quality required for finishing. It is pointed out that the quality of finishing is closely connected with the mutual position of the tool and the work piece in the grinding process. This position is appreciated by <b>permissible</b> state <b>areas</b> of the axis of the tool and the work piece. Analytical expression of this interaction is described by non-traditional mathematical model’s dependences. Mathematical models presented evaluate eccentricity between the tool and the work piece or between other elements of the system and enable one to better understand the appearance of the second and higher harmonics on the work piece processed or on the tool. They allow one to simulate the finishing not only of the cylindrical, but also of non-round profile work pieces, such as cams, eccentrics, etc. The mathematical dependences worked out allow one to build various modifications of the grinding systems and to evaluate the quality of their functioning. A circuit for the active control of the tool position is proposed, with the goal of quality improvement of finishing. For this purpose the usage of the adaptive spindle with tilting-pad journal bearings is suggested...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{concentration}} of selected trace elements in organic soils used as a source to obtain a unique peat extract for cosmetics production. Peat material for laboratory analysis were collected from fen peatland located in the Prosna River Valley (Borek village). Studied peatland is managed by “Torf Corporation” company as a source of material to obtain peat extract for cosmetics production. In the collected soil samples (four soil profiles) Zn, Cu and Pb concentrations were determined by using atomic absorption spectrometer SpectraAA 220 (Varian), after acid digestion. Obtained results showed that the highest concentrations of selected trace elements were recorded in the surface horizons of organic soils. This fact might be the results of Prosna river flooding or air deposition. Howevere, according to the new Polish regulations (Ordinance of the Minister for Environment 01. 09. 2016 - the way of conducting contamination assessment of the earth surface), the content of trace elements in the examined soils was greatly belowe the <b>permissible</b> limit for <b>areas</b> from group IV (mine lands).

In these industries cement dust emitted contains traces of hexavalent chromium and lead well above <b>permissible</b> limit in <b>area</b> under investigation. However, cadmium and nickel were found below limits prescribed. To analyse heavy metals viz, Cr + 6, lead, Cadmium and nickel {{one hundred and}} twenty samples were collected from four directions on surface and 20 cm depth, and analyzed on atomic absorption spectrophotometer. From the above study {{it is clear that}} in case of Sarvottam cement works only lead content was higher in all directions and depths than other two plants. At tiger and Nokha cement works contamination of lead was more over limited in the first 1 km except in east direction. Mobility of lead was relatively more on top soil than 20 cm depth. Hexavalent chromium content in south western direction was more for Nokha cement. Whereas, it was more in east direction in case of tiger cement. This indicated influence of prevailing direction of wind on distribution of heavy metals present in cement dust. Heavy metal toxicity results in reduction in plant height, burning of leaf margins and tip, slow leaf growth and over all wilting of Prosopis cineraria, Pearlmillet and clusterbean plants, when this metal deposits in Human body results in genetic disorders.

40|$|In 1996, Government {{directives}} began {{a transition}} to conform logging in Western Australia 2 ̆ 7 s State forests to principles of ecologically sustainable forest management (ESFM). To place this in a historical context, we reviewed {{the history of the}} logging of jarrah Eucalyptus marginata forests to determine whether the volume of timber extracted and the main forest management practices employed was consistent with components of ESFM. While quantitative assessment proved difficult, usually the timber cut considerably exceeded the estimated annual increment of forested lands. Overcutting often distressed professionals, who strove to regulate logging despite social, political and economic pressures. Furthermore, despite recent major reductions in <b>permissible</b> timber cut, <b>areas</b> of productive State forest have declined after conversion to alternative vestings. Thus, overcutting may continue in the remaining production forests. Too few data exist on the health or condition of forest ecosystems before logging to document subtle impacts. However, overcutting has interacted with broad-scale threatening processes in their impacts on forest fauna. These changes are all associated with reluctance to invoke effective adaptive management in association with the precautionary principle. The historical survey suggests that ESFM cannot be achieved without a socio-political will to assert long-term sustainable practice in the face of short-term goals. This could be achieved in the current preparation of a new forest management plan for Western Australia...|$|R

40|$|M. B. A. The South African Minister of Health has, {{in terms}} of Section 2 of the South African Tobacco Products Control Act, 1993 (Act No. 83 of 1993), as amended, {{declared}} the public places specified in the Regulations as <b>permissible</b> smoking <b>areas,</b> subject to the conditions also specified in the Regulations. "Swanepoel et al., (2000 : 597) argues that it is common knowledge today that smoking causes health problems. These problems can basically be categorised into two groups: The health implications for the employee who smokes; and The health and other implications for non-smoking employees who become passive smokers {{as a result of}} their colleagues' smoking habits. Apart from the implications for the smoker, there are also major implications for the non-smoking employees and for the organisation as a whole. It follows that, if cigarette smoke is a health risk for the smoker, it must also be so for the non-smoker. The breathed-out smoke contains the same harmful ingredients (such as carbon monoxide and recognised carcinogens — in other words, chemicals that cause cancer) to which the smoker is exposed. In addition, smoking often bothers non-smokers, causing conflict, hostility, negative feelings, deteriorating interpersonal relations — all of which may impact negatively on workforce morale and productivity. There is no single approach and policy for all organisations. The general principles, however, are that a working party should be established, the issue should be raised, the workforce should be consulted and the policy must then be formulated and implemented. It is in the interest of good industrial relations to work out an agreed policy between the company, employees and their representative trade unions (if any), taking into account the interest of smokers and non-smokers, rather than merely imposing an immediate and total ban. The control of smoking in the workplace through a professional process of formulating and implementing an appropriate non-smoking policy will enhance the healthiness or wellness of both smoking and non-smoking employees". The aim of this research is to assess the perceptions of smoking as well as nonsmoking employees of the said regulations of the Act and to assess if the targeted companies adhered to the new Regulations. Employees of three different companies in the Johannesburg in the Gauteng area in South Africa will be ask to complete questionnaires regarding the New Smoking Regulations in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT As {{technologies}} {{continue to}} shrink and sizes of chips {{continue to get}} larger, the transistor budget available for design is growing rapidly. Accurate area and delay estimates for the various structures would help in estimating the approximate area and delay estimates for blocks {{which could be used}} to make preliminary analysis of new designs. In this work, we identify some of the basic architecture building blocks and provide area and delay estimates for them. Published die photos of various processors were analyzed to make area estimates which were converted to technology independent * 2 units considering the process parameters used for the chip fabrication. Using those estimates, a number of design configurations have been analyzed and projections about the area and delay of future designs are made. 1 Introduction As the technologies continue to shrink and the sizes of the chips continue to get larger, the transistor budget available for design is growing rapidly. It is projected that a few years down the line we will have a billion transistors at our disposal for designing a single chip. To utilize this area budget effectively, a lot of aggressive design techniques will have to be employed. If accurate area and delay estimates for the various structures were available, {{it would be possible to}} evaluate new ideas fairly quickly. From the straw-man architecture, rough area and delay estimates for the various blocks could be calculated and then the feasibility of the proposed design could be measured by putting those blocks together and seeing if they fall within the <b>permissible</b> delay and <b>area</b> ranges. This methodology would help to trim down the huge design space and provide some insight into what future designs might look like...|$|R
