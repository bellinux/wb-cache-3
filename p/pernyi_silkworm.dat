40|$|Silk fibres from {{different}} {{components of the}} Antheraea <b>pernyi</b> <b>silkworm</b> cocoon, namely peduncle, outer floss, and cocoon shells (outermost layer and pelade layer) were studied in detail to gain insights into the structure-property-function relationship. Among the fibres {{from different}} components, peduncle fibres are the softest with the largest viscoelastic lag, which may reduce the oscillation amplitude when a cocoon hangs on a twig. Fibres from the outermost layer are the toughest and have the largest breaking energy. Outer floss fibres have the highest content of sericin (about 11. 98 %) but their hardness and elasticity are intermediate. Pelade fibres are shape - preservable and stable with superior hardness and elasticity. The understanding of the properties of different silk fibres is essential for understanding their respective roles in the function of a silk cocoon and will also inspire new designs of protective materials under stringent environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Biomacromolecules {{have been}} used as {{templates}} to grow hydroxyapatite crystals (HAps) by biomineralization to fabricate mineralized materials for potential application in bone tissue engineering. Silk sericin is a protein with features desirable as a biomaterial, such as increased hydrophilicity and biodegradation. Mineralization of the silk sericin from Antheraea pernyi (A. <b>pernyi)</b> <b>silkworm</b> has rarely been reported. Here, for the first time, nucleation of HAps on A. pernyi silk sericin (AS) was attempted through a wet precipitation method and consequently the cell viability and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs on mineralized AS were investigated. It was found that AS mediated the nucleation of HAps in the form of nanoneedles while self-assembling into β-sheet conformation, leading to the formation of a biomineralized protein based biomaterial. The cell viability assay of BMSCs showed that the mineralization of AS stimulated cell adhesion and proliferation, showing that the resultant AS biomaterial is biocompatible. The differentiation assay confirmed that the mineralized AS significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs when compared to nonmineralized AS as well as other types of sericin (B. mori sericin), suggesting that the resultant mineralized AS biomaterial has potential in promoting bone formation. This result represented the first work proving the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs directed by silk sericin. Therefore, the biomineralization of A. pernyi silk sericin coupled with seeding BMSCs on the resultant mineralized biomaterials is a useful strategy to develop the potential application o...|$|E
40|$|Silk fibroin (SF) hydrogels were {{obtained}} from both domestic (Bombyx mori) and wild (Antheraea <b>pernyi)</b> <b>silkworms</b> from aqueous silk fibroin solutions at room temperature. The gelation time of the Antheraea pernyi (A. pernyi) SF solution was significantly shorter {{than that of the}} Bombyx mori (B. mori) SF solution. The secondary structures of the two kinds of hydrogels were also compared. In order to further reduce the gelation time, various amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG) were blended with the silk fibroins of A. pernyi and B. mori. The gelation time of both A. pernyi SF and B. mori SF decreased with the increased amount of PEG. After freeze-drying, the hydrogels were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that the addition of polyalcohol did not change the main secondary structure of the hydrogels. However, the addition of polyalcohol did reduce the gelation time and triggered additional formation of β-sheets...|$|R
30|$|Fibroin {{proteins}} {{isolated from}} the cocoons of certain silk-producing insects have been widely investigated as biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. In this study, fibroins were isolated from cocoons of domesticated Bombyx mori (BM) and wild Antheraea <b>pernyi</b> (AP) <b>silkworms</b> following a degumming process. The object {{of this study was}} to obtain an assessment on certain properties of these fibroins in order that a concept might be had regarding the feasibility of using their blends as biomaterials. Membranes, 10 – 20  μm thick, which are water-insoluble, flexible and transparent, were prepared from pure fibroins and from their blends, and subjected to water vapor annealing in vacuum, with the aim of providing materials sufficiently strong for manipulation. The resulting materials were characterized by electrophoretic analysis and infrared spectrometry. The tensile properties of the membranes were measured and correlated with the results of infrared analysis. At low concentrations of any of the two fibroins, the mechanical characteristics of the membranes appeared to be adequate for surgical manipulation, as the modulus and strength surpassed those of BM silk fibroin alone. It was noticed that high concentrations of AP silk fibroin led to a significant reduction in the elasticity of membranes.|$|R
