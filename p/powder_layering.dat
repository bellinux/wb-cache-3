Present study aim is to prepare controlled release multiparticulate of Ketoprofen by drug <b>powder</b> <b>layering</b> technology using two different release retardant (Ethyl Cellulose & Cellulose Acetate) in five different drug: release retardant concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % & 40 %). The most widely used multiparticulate system in pharmaceutical industries is Dry <b>Powder</b> <b>Layering</b> Technique. <b>Powder</b> <b>layering</b> involves the deposition of successive layers of dry powder(s) and excipients on preformed nuclei or cores with the help of binding liquids. The prepared multiparticles were evaluated for friability, drug content uniformity, density and percentage yield. The release rate was evaluated by dissolution studies. To establish drug polymer compatibility DSC and FT IR was done. Study concluded that Dry <b>Powder</b> <b>Layering</b> of Ketoprofen can be effectively used for drug loading on non-pareil seeds. It was also found that formulation having Ethyl Cellulose have more retarding capacity than the Cellulose Acetate in both formulations and drug release follows Zero order kinetics.

The as-fabricated samples were investigated using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The interaction between laser beam and powder particles was studied by both high speed imaging observation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. It was found that at a high laser power and a fixed <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> thickness (20 μm), the samples contain particularly low porosity when the laser scanning speeds are below 2700 mm/s.

40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, pellets {{can be defined}} as small, free-flowing, spherical particulates manufactured by the agglomeration of fine powders or granules of drug substances and excipients using appropriate processing equipment. Pelletization has gained a great interest in recent years due to its various advantages over other similar techniques; such as uniformity of dose and flexibility in dosage form design. There are a number of pelletization techniques currently used by pharmaceutical industry. Among them Extrusion-spheronization and solution/suspension layering are most commonly used in pharmaceutical industries.

Extrusion–spheronization is a multistep process involving dry mixing, wet granulation, extrusion, spheronization, drying, and screening; whereas solution or suspension layering involves deposition of successive layers of drug and binder solution/ suspension on started seeds, which can be either an inert material or granules of same drug.

This induces mismatch strain between two layers that can be harmful for the co-sintering process. The amount of strain incompatibility is noticeably higher in vacuum sintering compared to hydrogen sintering.

40|$|The {{material}} properties and dimensional accuracy of metal tooling {{produced by the}} Three Dimensional Printing process can be enhanced by increasing the green density of the 3 D printed part. Green density is the ratio of metal powder volume to the external volume of the printed part, and {{is a measure of}} how tightly packed the powder particles in the printed part are. The central goal of this thesis was to increase the green density of metal parts from the current level of 58 % to levels greater than 75 %. Two approaches were taken for increasing green density. The first was to utilize bimodal mixtures of metal powders which could be packed to significantly higher densities than the monomodal powders which had been previously used. Three bimodal powder mixtures, with tap densities near 80 %, were studied. The second approach was to develop a new <b>powder</b> <b>layering</b> device which could pack these bimodal powders to the tap density during layer creation. New understandings about the relationship between the stresses applied to the powder layer and the resulting packing density changes were required to design this device. Shear cell and unconfined compression tests were performed to characterize the metal powder stress / strain behavior. Particulate stress / strain models, such as the Mohr-Coulomb failure law and the Jenike yield locus theory, were used to interpret the packing behavior of the metal powders under various stress conditions. (cont.) A simple frictional model of powder behavior was proposed for the low stress levels permissible in the 3 DP process. The application of a small static normal stress, in combination with an oscillatory horizontal shear stress, was found to be the most effective means of reducing particle interlocking and provided the best layer densification results. A new layer densification mechanism was constructed and successfully used to generate printed parts with green densities in excess of 75 %. Photographic analysis techniques used to analyze part microstructures indicated significant improvements in packing homogeneity. Packing defects between the printed layers were reduced or eliminated. Compositional analysis indicated no significant segregation of the bimodal components during layer spreading. by Steven Joseph Gregorski. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Multiple Unit Pellet Systems, {{widely known}} as MUPS, are tablets {{consisting}} of spherical, granular subunits (pellets). Thanks to their prompt disintegration into the single subunits immediately after administration, they transit shortly in stomach and promptly disperse across the huge {{surface area of}} the small intestine stabilizing the overall bioavailability and {{reducing the risk of}} dose dumping and local irritations. If until two decades ago pellets were exclusively filled into hard gelatine capsules, they represent nowadays the ideal subunits for multiparticulate tablets. In fact, MUPS present all the advantages of the production of tablets compared to capsules: lower production costs, higher production rates, reduced risk of tampering, lower tendency of adhering to oesophagus during swallowing and better patient compliance. Despite this, the compaction of pellets into tablets is a complex technology: MUPS must be robust enough but still disintegrate into their subunits within short time, and, not less importantly, they should retain the dissolution profile of the original subunits. At this scope, the pellets should undergo a soft compaction, without breakage of the pellet coating layer nor formation of matrix tablets. Such ideal MUPS may be strived optimizing the proportions between three crucial factors: the pellet cores, the coating materials and the embedding excipients. Not many studies have focused so far on the simultaneous optimization of these three variables. Cellulose, and in particular microcrystalline cellulose, {{is one of the major}} excipients in solid dosage formulations. It presents four polymorphic forms, out of which the form I and II have pharmaceutical relevance. The form I, which behaves plastically when compressed, is extremely widespread as a filler-binder for MUPS. Unfortunately, it does not possess prevalent disintegration properties, so that a disintegrant must be added if prompt disintegration is strived. Kumar et al. developed a new Cellulose II pharmaceutical aid named UICEL-A/ 102 through alkali treatment of Avicel PH 102 and successive hydrolysis with ethanol and oven dry. So far, UICEL-A/ 102 has been extensively studied as potential multifunctional excipients (filler and disintegrant) in tablet formulations, whereas its employing as a multifunctional excipient in MUPS has been not yet investigated. The aim of this study was on the one hand the multifactorial investigation of crucial parameters involved in the compaction of pellets into MUPS, on the other hand the evaluation of the suitability of UICEL-A/ 102 as filler in two different kind of pellets formulations for MUPS (homogeeous pellets from direct pelletization, inhomogeneous pellets from dry <b>powder</b> <b>layering).</b> In the end, a robust technology for UICEL-A/ 102 MUPS production was suggested and discussed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the formulation {{and application of}} a comprehensive heat flow model of the continuous casting process for steel slabs, focusing on phenomena in the mold region. The model includes a 1 -D transient finite-difference calculation of heat conduction within the solidifying steel shell coupled with 2 -D steady-state heat conduction within the mold wall. The model features a detailed treatment of the interfacial gap between the shell and mold, including mass and momentum balances on the solid and liquid <b>powder</b> <b>layers.</b> The model predicts the solidified shell thickness down the mold, temperature in the mold and shell, thickness of the resolidified and liquid <b>powder</b> <b>layers,</b> heat flux distribution down the mold, mold water temperature rise, ideal taper of the mold walls, and other related phenomena. The important effect of non-uniform distribution of superheat is incorporated using the results from previous 3 -D turbulent fluid flow calculations within the liquid cavity. The effects of oscillation mark shape and mold curvature on heat transfer and the <b>powder</b> <b>layers</b> are also included. The FORTRAN program, CON 1 D, has a user-fliendly interface and executes {{in less than a}} minute on a personal computer. Calibration of the model with experimental measurements on an operating slab caster is presented along with several example applications. 1...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{procedure for}} the production of a component (1) based on three-dimensional data of the component under use of powder materials, comprises dividing a section of the component that represents a related component volume, into a covering area out of hot-work steel and a core area out of heat conducting material, allocating a construction platform that represents a construction plain in x-y-direction in a right-angled x-y-z-coordination system, and subjecting a <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> on the platform in z-direction to each other. Each <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> is solidified by energy radiation in a defined cross-section area that corresponds to a cross-section area corresponding to the data of the component. The cross-section area corresponding to the component to be constructed is connected to the cross-section area of the further <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> with the hardened cross section area. The covering area of the component volume based on the data is constructed as strong cover. The powder material collected in the core area of the component volume that is surrounded by the strong cover is removed and subsequently the empty core area is filled up with a further material. The powder material is removed from an opening that is subsequently used for filling the material. The component is subdivided into several sections that form a related area of the component. The core area surrounded by the cover area is filled with the material. Separating walls are arranged in single core areas that are constructed together with the cover area out of hardened <b>powder</b> <b>layer.</b> Metal <b>powder</b> with a grain size of 5 - 100 mu m is used as a powder material. The <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> is subjected with a layer thickness of 10 - 400 mu m. A metal is used as casting material. The covering area serves as cool channels (3). USE - Procedure {{for the production of}} a component based on three-dimensional data of the component useful as molding insert for injection molding machine (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The procedure ensures production of a component based on three-dimensional data of the component with high surface quality, different functional properties, high wear resistance and high thermal conductivity in less time-consuming manner...|$|R

Previous studies have shownthatthe control of powder particle shape and size distribution can increase the density of non-packed powder beds.

The purpose ofthis study. is to determine if,and to what extent, the density of thin <b>powder</b> <b>layers</b> can be ineteased. Experiments show that the density of thin layers increases from 53 % to 63 % when adding 30 % fine powder to the coarse powder,/with a coarse-to-fine ratio of 1 : 10.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Direct Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an emerging technology of Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) that 3 -D parts are built from the metal-based powder bed with CAD data. A one-dimensional analytical model of melting in a two-component <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> with finite thickness subjected to a constant heat flux heating and a two-dimensional numerical model of SLS of a two-component <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> with a moving laser beam scanning were developed consecutively. Three-dimensional modeling of laser sintering of a two-component metal powder mixture under a moving Gaussian laser beam was investigated numerically at last. The effects of the moving heat source intensity, the scanning velocity, the thickness of the <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> and the number of existing sintered layers underneath on the sintering depth, the configuration of the heat affected zone (HAZ) and the temperature distribution are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} computational materials science approach for {{selective laser melting}} (SLM) at the mesoscale is presented. A particle dropping model was developed to simulate the representative powder-bed particle distribution of a measured titanium alloy powder. Thermal fluid flow and resulting microstructural evolution {{of a set of}} laser scanned single tracks with different <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses and scanning speeds during SLM were also studied using both computational and experimental approaches. The simulated powder particle distribution was found to be consistent with experimental measurement. The thermal fluid flow model predicts that single laser scanned tracks become increasingly irregular-shaped with increased <b>powder</b> <b>layer</b> thickness and increased laser scanning speed. These findings were reinforced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The more dispersed dissipation of the localised heat for thicker <b>powder</b> <b>layers</b> is understood to cause increased melting and evaporation. This can lead to increased Marangoni force and recoil pressure which in turn destabilises the melt flow. The use of an argon atmosphere speeds up the solidification process when compared with air but does not affect the morphology of single tracks significantly. The predicted microstructure was consistent with the electron backscattered diffraction data. The microstructure-based modelling methodology considering the representative powder size distribution provides a good predictive capability for the laser-powder interaction behaviour, surface structure and porosity development...|$|R
