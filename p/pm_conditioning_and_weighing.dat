40|$|Motor and {{galvanic}} skin potential (GSP) activity {{were investigated}} during the <b>conditioning,</b> extinction, <b>and</b> reconditioning of motor responses under a differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) schedule of reinforcement. Interresponse time (IRT) distributions for motor responses during <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> reconditioning gradually stabilized at a peak {{just beyond the}} minimal IRT required for reinforcement. Few unreinforced motor responses and “bursts” of motor responses were observed during <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> reconditioning. Relative to <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> reconditioning, extinction effected larger IRTs and smaller GSP amplitudes. GSP amplitudes were greater for unreinforced than for reinforced motor responses during <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> reconditioning. However, GSP amplitudes associated with the unreinforced extinction responses were smaller than either the reinforced or unreinforced responses during <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> reconditioning...|$|R
