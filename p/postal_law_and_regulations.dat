40|$|Fraud {{investigation}} {{units have}} sprung up within insurance companies across the United States to counter corporate losses due to fraud and the restrictions imposed on the industry by government regulations. This paper looks at the birth, operating strategies, and effectiveness of these units in three automobile insurance com-panies in Massachusetts. Because fraud cases are rarely brought to court, these units operate {{as a kind of}} private police. They exchange information with the public police and other companies and circumvent judicial control, often using in-vestigative procedures which would render the evidence they collect inadmissible in court. Recent legislation has strengthened their power and cut off avenues of redress once available to wronged policyholders. Federal government control of insurance fraud in the United States has existed since the mail fraud statute was added to the <b>postal</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> in 1872 (Comstock, 1969). Since most insurance claims are handled by mail, the statute controls fraud by prohibiting use of the mails to carry schemes to defraud. In addition, over the past century a number of states have enacted their own statutes designating insurance fraud as illegal. Yet because of the circumstantial natur...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Government, in the {{exercise}} of its exclusive constitutional jurisdiction over aeronautics, has adopted <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> that address the various aspects of the aviation system. These <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> have evolved significantly from the first piece of Federal legislation passed in 1919. Some of those <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> have as their objective achieving and maintaining an adequate level of aviation safety, while others are intended to ensure that Canadians have access to an efficient and reliable national air transportation system. On the safety side, there are <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> that establish standards of quality for the aircraft, standards of competence for air carriers and standards of competence and medical fitness of the personnel. There are also regulations that specify the conditions that must be met in order to register an aircraft in Canada. On the economic side, there are <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> that set the terms and conditions for the operation of domestic and international air services. In the domestic context, such <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> have gone from strict and almost complete government intervention, to giving effect to recent policies of less <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> more competition. These same <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations,</b> while providing the regulatory authority with the necessary enforcement tools, also recognize the need to ensure that it does not act improperly or abusively.
