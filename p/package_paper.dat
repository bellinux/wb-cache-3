This study aimed to determine the harvest stage of P. angulata L. seeds according to the fruit calyx color, as well as evaluating their storage viability. For that, fruits were harvested from matrix plants, considering three maturity stages, according to the calyx color (green, yellow and yellow-brownish). A completely randomized design was used, in a factorial arrangement comprising two kinds of <b>package</b> (<b>paper</b> bag and glass container) and four evaluation periods (after harvesting and at 45, 90 and 135 days after storage - DAS), being isolated the factor storage environment. It was concluded that P. angulata seeds should be collected from fruits with a green calyx and used soon after being harvested, since seed germination sharply decreases after 45 DAS, both in the storage chamber and in the refrigerated environment, regardless of whether glass or paper is used...|$|E
40|$|Avaliou-se o efeito de temperatura de estocagem e tipo de embalagem, na qualidade interna de ovos de codornas japonesas (Coturnix japonica, Temminck & Schlegel, 1849), no 5 º, 10 º, 15 º e 20 º dias experimentais. Utilizaram-se 192 ovos de codornas japonesas em delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado e esquema de parcelas subdivididas, com vinte e quatro tratamentos e oito repetições de um ovo por unidade experimental. Os tratamentos foram constituídos pela combinação de duas temperaturas de estocagem (ambiente e sob refrigeração) versus três tipos de embalagem (papel, isopor e plástico), casualizada nas parcelas, versus quatro tempos (5 º, 10 º, 15 º e 20 º dias de estocagem), alocados nas subparcelas. As variáveis estudadas foram perda de peso (PP), em porcentagem, altura de albume (AA), em milímetros, e unidade Haugh (UH). Com o aumento do tempo de estocagem, houve redução da altura de albume e da unidade Haugh e aumento da perda de peso de ovos de codornas japonesas, armazenados sob temperatura ambiente. No decorrer do período de estocagem, os valores médios de altura de albume e unidade Haugh de ovos de codornas japonesas, estocados sob refrigeração foram maiores do que as respectivas médias de altura de albume e unidade Haugh de ovos estocados sob temperatura ambiente. O uso da embalagem de isopor proporcionou menor perda de peso dos ovos do que o uso das embalagens de papel e de plástico, independente do tempo e da temperatura de estocagem. The {{effect of}} storage temperature {{and kind of}} package on the internal quality of eggs from japanese quails (Coturnix japonica, Temminck & Schlegel, 1849) on the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 20 th experimental days were evaluated. One hundred and ninety two eggs from japanese quails were used in a completely randomized outline and splitplot scheme, with twenty four treatments and eight replicates of one egg per experimental unit. The treatments were consisted from the combination of two storage temperatures (room temperature and under refrigeration) versus three kind of <b>package</b> (<b>paper,</b> isopor and plastic), randomized to the plots, versus four times (5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 20 th days of storage), allotted to the splitplots. The studied traits were weight loss, in percentage, albumen height, on millimeter, and Haugh unit. As long as storage time increased, albumen height and Haugh unit decreased and weight loss japanese quail eggs stored at room temperature increased. During the storage time, the average values of albumen height and Haugh unit of japanese quail eggs stored under refrigeration were higher than respective means of albumen height and Haugh unit eggs stored at room temperature. The use of isopor package allowed smaller weight of loss of eggs than the use of paper and plastic packages, independently of time and storage temperature...|$|E

40|$|Background: Drowning is {{a global}} public health problem of children. Children of low- and middle-income {{countries}} are the most susceptible victims. Prevention measures implemented in high-income countries have effectively reduced drowning. However, in low- and middle-income countries, due to a severe lack of information, drowning has not been recognized as a child survival issue. Moreover, prevention efforts remain non-existent {{as there is no}} proven effective measure applicable for these countries, including Bangladesh. Objectives: The objectives of the research activities were to determine the current child drowning situation and risk-factors in rural areas of Bangladesh (Paper I); to understand the community perception of drowning problems and the possible solutions for designing a preventive programme in the rural area of Bangladesh (Paper II); to develop, pilot and assess initial community response to an intervention package in terms of acceptability, feasibility and sustainability (Paper III) and to evaluate the package for its effectiveness (Paper IV). Methods: A cross sectional survey and a case-control study were conducted to determine the magnitude and identify risk-factors of child drowning respectively (Paper I). Community perception on drowning prevention was explored by using a qualitative method (Paper II). Intervention measures were identified through workshops with the relevant stakeholders. Utilizing qualitative methods community acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention package were initially assessed (Paper III). A quasi-experimental design was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the intervention <b>package</b> (<b>Paper</b> IV). Two sub-districts were selected each having a population of 200, 000. One was allocated as an intervention area and the other as a comparison area. Quantitative data was collected through structured pre-tested questionnaires and the qualitative data was gathered through Focus Group Discussions (FDGs) and in-depth interviews. Results: The drowning rate of Bangladeshi rural children aged 1 - 4 years was found to be 156. 4 per 100, 000 (95 % CI 138. 5 - 176. 6 per 100, 000). The proportional mortality due to drowning in the children was about 28. 0 percent. Natural water bodies were the most frequent places of drowning, and over 40 percent occurred in ponds. The child's sex, mother's age and literacy, family income and ownership of agricultural land by the families were identified as risk factors (Paper I). Community people wrongly perceive that children 5 - 10 years are at the greatest risk of drowning. Participants of the FGDs, parents, adolescents and community leaders, knew the common causes of drowning and were able to mention a few preventive measures. However, they do not act on this knowledge (Paper II). Increased supervision of children through the creation of drowning-safe homes and the establishment of community crèches, raising water safety awareness, and educating the community on first response skills were the three core aspects identified through workshops to include in the intervention package. Qualitative study revealed that these measures are accepted by the community, feasible and sustainable (Paper III). After three years of implementation of the intervention package the evaluation showed that 36 percent of households became drowning safe and through 100 community crèches 2, 680 children aged 1 - 4 years were kept safe under direct supervision. Nearly all the population of the intervention area were reached through various behaviour change communication materials. In the intervention area fatal drowning rate declined from 120. 8 to 53. 7 per 100, 000; however, in the comparison area the rate remained the same in the base-line and the end-line data (Paper IV). Conclusion: Drowning is one of the major survival issues among children aged 1 - 4 years in rural Bangladesh. The intervention model developed through these research activities was found to be effective in reducing child drowning. Improved supervision, creating a heightened water safety culture of the community and utilizing low cost locally available resources are the fundamental intervention strategies identified in reducing child drowning in rural Bangladesh. This model is developed in such a way that it could be applicable in similar low-income settings...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of {{computer}} usage on the demand for paper and paperboard products. A log-linear model is developed to analyze the effect of computer usage on the demand for four categories of paper, newsprint, printing/writing <b>paper,</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>paper</b> and household/sanitary paper. The analysis is divided into two parts. The first part is US monthly analysis. We create computer number index as a measurement for computer usage. Monthly data (from Jan 1992 to Jun 2005) are collected to estimate the effect for four categories of paper. The monthly estimation results support the hypothesis that the increasing usage of computer has a significantly negative effect on the demand for printing/writing paper, and a significantly positive effect on the demand for <b>packaging</b> <b>paper.</b> But it doesn't provide enough evidence for the effect on the demand for newsprint. The second part is the yearly analysis on 16 main countries, which constitute the major demand for paper/paperboard products and are countries with widespread usage of computer. Using the yearly data from 1961 to 2002 and applying fixone model, we find that computer usage has a significantly positive effect on demand for <b>packaging</b> <b>paper.</b> The small difference in US monthly analysis and 16 countries yearly analysis may arise from the different measures in computer usage, prices of paper/paperboard products, and income.

40|$|Brown {{packaging}} linerboard, made {{entirely from}} recovered pulp, {{was subjected to}} deinking flotation for evaluating the possible improvements in its chemical, optical and mechanical properties. The increase {{in the rate of}} recovered paper utilisation, along with the tendency towards lower basis weights, in the <b>packaging</b> <b>paper</b> production, has created a growing need for the utilisation of secondary fibers of improved quality. To attain better quality fibers, flotation deinking of brown grades is being considered, along with the addition of primary fibers to recovered paper furnish. Numerous conducted studies, in which the flotation technology was used in the treatment of brown grades, support this idea. Most of them show that the quality of fibers is improved after flotation deinking, resulting in higher mechanical properties of the deinked handsheets and in lower amounts of chemical contaminants. As to food and human health safety, <b>packaging</b> <b>paper</b> has to meet specific requirements, to be classified as suitable for its direct contact with foods. Recycled paper and board may contain many potential contaminants, which, {{especially in the case of}} direct food contact, may migrate from packaging materials into foodstuffs. In this work, the linerboard sample selected for deinking was made from recycled fibers not submitted previously to chemical deinking flotation. Therefore, the original sample contained many noncellulosic components, as well as the residues of printing inks. The studied linerboardsample was a type of <b>packaging</b> <b>paper</b> used for contact with food products that are usually peeled before use, e. g. fruits and vegetables.
