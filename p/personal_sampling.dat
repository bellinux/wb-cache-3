Estimating historical skin exposures of farmers dipping sheep in pesticide solutions for an epidemiological study proved particularly challenging, but this research demonstrated a strong association between concentrated organophosphate pesticides and neurological symptoms. As a consequence the UK government withdrew these pesticides from the market until safer handling systems were devised. In addition, new sampling instruments to measure dermal exposure to chemicals and new theoretical models to help understand how skin exposure may arise. These instruments and models may in the future help provide more reliable assessments of the risks from chemicals to the skin.

The standard does not specify the technique {{to be used for}} sample collection, therefore allowing industrial hygienists to use their discretion in choosing the best method for the particular situation. It is assumed that personal breathing zone samples provide the most accurate measurement of worker exposure, whereas fixed sampling techniques are used to indicate the average room concentration. In multiple machine operations, the use of <b>personal</b> <b>sampling</b> units to monitor worker exposure levels would take considerable time and money if performed on a monthly basis. In this situation it would be valuable to utilize fixed head sampling techniques which would monitor all machining processes simultaneously. An experiment was designed to determine if {{there was a significant difference}} between sampling techniques applied to a particular beryllium operation. Simultaneous samples were collected using both a <b>personal</b> <b>sampling</b> unit and a fixed sampling system. Prior testing and sample collection were used to determine the location for the fixed sampling head. A personal sampler was used to monitor the operator's breathing zone as specified in the NIOSH Analytical Methods. The mean concentrations obtained by both sampling techniques were then subjected to statistical analysis for determination of significant difference. The results of the comparison indicated that the mean concentration obtained using the fixed sampling system was significantly different from the mean concentration obtained using the <b>personal</b> <b>sampling</b> unit. Variables considered responsible for the difference in results include placement of the fixed head, worker mobility, other sources of contaminant generation within the room, type of fixed system, filter media and flowrate.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize UV light exposure in nursery and grow rooms in two medical cannabis production facilities using area and <b>personal</b> <b>sampling.</b> Methods: Three different light spectrums were assessed: UV-Broadband (180 to 400 nm), UVA (315 to 400 nm) and blue light (305 to 700 nm). The radiometer hub supported one spectral sensor at a time, therefore the spectrums were assessed consecutively rather than simultaneously. Area surveys were accomplished by consecutively mounting the spectral sensors on a tripod at a fixed height of 1. 6 meters for several minutes per sample. In grow rooms, the tripod was systematically moved to 32 to 37 locations; in nurseries samples were taken from 4 to 6 locations. <b>Personal</b> <b>sampling</b> utilized sensors consecutively mounted on a helmet worn by the worker. In each facility, one worker wore each sensor for 20 minute periods in the grow room. Results: In both area and <b>personal</b> <b>sampling,</b> the ACGIH TLV (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Threshold Limit Value) for UV Broadband exposure was exceeded. For area sampling in grow rooms, 8 of 69 (12 %) samples exceeded the UV Broadband TLV of 0. 003 J/m 2 in under 8 hours, and all (n= 10) area nursery room samples exceeded this TLV. In area grow room and nursery samples, the average number of exposure-minutes resulting in a TLV exceedance was 318 and 61 minutes, respectively. Personal grow room sampling in the UV Broadband spectrum resulted in a mean (SD) effective irradiance of 0. 0001 (3. 807 e- 5) Eff mW/cm 2 over a 20 minute interval. At this mean exposure level, the worker did not exceed the UV Broadband TLV during the 20 minute sample but would be projected to exceed the TLV in 446 minutes (less than 8 hours). No sample from any facility or room type exceeded the ACGIH TLVs for UVA or blue light. Conclusion: While data is limited for the three light spectrums surveyed, the UV Broadband spectrum did have samples that exceeded the ACGIH TLV. Nurseries had more UV Broadband exposure than grow rooms. Additional assessment, particularly <b>personal</b> <b>sampling,</b> is needed to more fully characterize cannabis workers’ exposure to UV light.

Furthermore, a true portability of the present devices is not given due to their size and power consumption. However, there is an urgent need due to the expected toxicity of nanofibres to control workplace environments with a robust and mobile device {{to ensure the safety of}} the working personnel as soon as possible. To meet these challenges, a suitable <b>personal</b> <b>sampler</b> together with a corresponding reading device is under development in the NANODEVICE-project, funded by the European Commission under grant agreement FP 7 - 211464 - 2. A pre-prototype <b>personal</b> <b>sampler</b> for CNT sampling, the used Raman-spectroscopic inspection of deposited CNTs and a possible approach in determining the qualitative presence of CNTs will be shown. Additionally, it seems even possible to distinguish between carbon nanofibers from different manufacturers based on Raman spectroscopy and data analysis...|$|R
40|$|Aims Rapid {{and precise}} {{bioaerosol}} detection in different environments {{has become an}} important research and technological issue over last decades. Previously, we employed a real-time PCR protocol in conjunction with <b>personal</b> bioaerosol <b>sampler</b> for rapid detection of airborne viruses. The approach has been proved to be specific and sensitive. However, {{a period of time}} required for entire procedure was in manner of hours. Some new developments are required to decrease the detection time down to real-time protocols. Methods and Results Presently, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) -based immunosensor that coupled with a specific antigen-antibody reaction could offer sensitive, specific, rapid and label-free detection. This study describes the possibility of combining the <b>personal</b> <b>sampler</b> with SPR technology for qualitative and extremely rapid detection of airborne micro-organisms. Common viral surrogate MS 2 bacteriophage, frequently used in bioaerosol studies, was employed as a model organism. The results of the sensor functionalizing procedure with monoclonal anti-MS 2 antibody and optimization of the chip performance are presented. The SPR-based detection of the airborne virus was found to be very fast; the viral presence was detected in less than 2 min, and the entire procedure (sampling and analysis) was undertaken in 6 min, which could be considered as real-time detection for this type of measurements. Conclusions The combination of SPR with the <b>personal</b> <b>sampler</b> targeted towards bioaerosol detection was proven to be feasible. The SPR sensor was found to be highly stable and suitable for multiple utilizations without significant decrease in response. The suggested approach opens new possibilities for the development of portable and rapid (almost real time) bioaerosol monitors. Significance and Impact of the Study This technology is the first in the world real-time bioaerosol monitor. This outcome would be of strong interest to individuals representing public health, biosecurity, defence forces, environmental sciences and many others.
