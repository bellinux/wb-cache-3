5|$|The tribe {{resolved}} {{to place the}} site on the National Historic Registry. In 1976, the National Park Service designated the site as a National Historic Site. By 1993, the tribe had adopted a master plan to try to preserve the buildings and commissioned a study to determine what the cost would be to restore the property. The U.S. government acknowledged {{that some of the}} thirty-five buildings were in poor shape, but maintained that the rest were <b>properly</b> <b>maintained.</b> In 1998, the site was designated by the World Monuments Fund as one of the 100 most endangered sites.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the act, the canal company {{inherited}} the debts of the Conservators, and paid them an additional £2,000. They were required to rebuild part of the North Town Bridge in Taunton, and to return the Tone Navigation to good order. The Conservators were empowered to carry out an annual inspection, and to re-possess the river if the canal was not <b>properly</b> <b>maintained.</b> The £2,000 was held by the Conservators until 1838, when they applied for an order to dispose of it, {{but it was not until}} 1843 that the order was granted. £1,000 was used to build a new wing for the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, and £1,000 was invested in the Taunton Market Trust, in line with the intentions of the 1699 act.|$|E

25|$|The new gear {{had several}} {{advantages}} over all mechanical gears: {{the rate of}} fire was greatly improved, the synchronization was much more accurate, and above all it was readily adaptable to any type of engine and airframe, instead of needing a specially designed impulse generator {{for each type of}} engine and special linkages for each type of aircraft. In the long run (provided it was <b>properly</b> <b>maintained</b> and adjusted) it also proved far more durable and less prone to failure.|$|E
5000|$|Walter Muller, {{a former}} chief of the Policy Analysis Division of the Federal Aviation Administration, {{filed a lawsuit against}} Lockheed, Saudia, and Trans World Airlines, an American airline that trained Saudi pilots and {{supervised}} the Saudi maintenance program. Muller's brother, Jack A. Muller, and his sister in law, Elizabeth S. Muller, died in the fire. Muller's suit stated that Lockheed allowed for [...] "dangerous materials to be incorporated in the fuselage," [...] that there was no vent system to distribute the gases away from the passengers, and that a sufficient oxygen system did not exist. Muller's suit accused Saudia of not <b>properly</b> <b>maintaining</b> the aircraft and providing safety for passengers, and accused TWA of not <b>properly</b> <b>maintaining</b> the Saudia aircraft and not properly training crew.|$|R

25|$|Christian {{metalwork}} {{can take}} {{a vast number of}} forms, from a tiny Crucifix to a large statue or elaborate tomb or screen. The metals used can range from the finest gold leaf or silver filigree to cast bronze and wrought iron. Metal was commonly used for Communion vessels, for candelabra and all types of small fittings, and lent itself to being richly decorated by a number of techniques. It can be moulded, hammered, twisted, engraved, inlaid and gilded. If <b>properly</b> <b>maintained,</b> metal is extremely durable. Most metal articles appearing to be gold are Silver-gilt or gilt bronze.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised about safety in {{operating}} the aircraft; there have been 337 fatalities from MU-2 crashes. As of October 2005, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) undertook a safety evaluation of the aircraft. It concluded that the aircraft has met its certification requirements: It is safe when operated by properly trained pilots who operate <b>properly</b> <b>maintained</b> aircraft. The FAA {{is in the process}} of mandating training specific to the MU-2, as it has in the past for other aircraft. When such mandated training was required outside of the U.S., the MU-2 accident record was vastly improved.|$|E
25|$|Stained {{glass windows}} {{are created by}} cutting pieces of {{coloured}} glass to match a drawn template and setting them into place in a mesh of lead cames and supporting the whole with rigid metal bars. Details such as facial features can be painted {{on the surface of}} the glass, and stains of bright yellow applied to enliven white areas. The effect is to add an appearance of brilliance and richness to a church interior, while the media lends itself to narratives. If the lead is <b>properly</b> <b>maintained,</b> stained glass is extremely durable and many windows have been in place for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Despite Myanmar's {{possession}} of {{large amounts of}} historical material, many of the records have not been <b>properly</b> <b>maintained,</b> or used for research. The National Library of Myanmar holds 10,000 bundles of palm-leaf manuscripts, which have been collected from private donations and monasteries. Many more rolls of palm-leaf manuscripts remain uncollected, and are moldering in monasteries across the country without proper care as well as under attack by unscrupulous treasure hunters. Efforts to digitise the manuscripts have not materialised. Few have been studied systematically since the Burma Research Society closed the doors in 1980. The society had published the Journal of the Burma Research Society (JBRS) over (1300 articles in 59 volumes) between 1910 and 1980.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{real estate}} {{is seen as a}} {{long-term}} investment to most buyers. Especially in the developed world, most landlords will <b>properly</b> <b>maintain</b> their properties even when doing so proves costly in the short term, in order to attract higher rents and more desirable tenants in the long run. A well-maintained property is worth more to potential buyers.|$|R
25|$|Renovation of the 922 {{windows in}} the palace started at the {{beginning}} of the 1990s. The age of the windows varies from the mid 18th century to the 1970s. The reason for the renovation was that the windows had not been <b>properly</b> <b>maintained</b> during a number of years. The windows on the south side were the most exposed and the sun had burned the surface causing rot. The renovation of the windows was carried out in collaboration with the National Property Board of Sweden, the Office of the Governor of the Royal Palaces, the Swedish National Heritage Board and the Royal Architect at that time, Ove Hidemark. The work was done in a workshop at the Inner Courtyard and took about ten years. Each window was custom made for the opening where it was originally placed, making the size and shape of each window unique.|$|E
25|$|The main way {{to prevent}} malaria is through vector control. There are mostly three main forms that the vector can be controlled: (1)insecticide-treated {{mosquito}} nets, (2)indoor residual spraying and (3)antimalarial drugs. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLNs) are the preferred method of control {{because it is the}} most cost effective. The WHO is currently strategizing how to ensure that the net is <b>properly</b> <b>maintained</b> to protect people at risk. The second option is indoor residual spraying and has been proven effective if at least 80% of the homes are sprayed. However, such method is only effective for 3-6months. A drawback to these two methods, unfortunately, is that mosquito resistance against these insecticides has risen. National malaria control efforts are undergoing rapid changes to ensure the people are given the most effective method of vector control. Lastly, antimalarial drugs {{can also be used to}} prevent infection from developing into a clinical disease. However, there has also been an increase resistance to antimalarial medicine.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} cracks formed {{along the southern}} part of the embankment, allowing the acidic tailings solution to penetrate and weaken the embankment. A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not <b>properly</b> <b>maintained.</b> Prior to the collapse, the level of the tailings solution in the holding pond had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the sand beach no longer provided the dam protection. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential settlement of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure. United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J. David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the bedrock beneath the embankment, which he said acted as a fulcrum and weakened the dam.|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 2007, the victim's family filed {{a lawsuit}} for {{unspecified}} damages, claiming that the park did not <b>properly</b> <b>maintain</b> the ride. On November 29, 2007, a judge in the Jefferson Circuit Court said that Six Flags could dismantle the ride beginning February 1, 2008. [...] As of December 1, 2007, the ride's cable was still in storage awaiting lab tests. On May 30, 2008, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture released their report on the accident, concluding that the accident was due to a faulty cable, as well as poor operator training in that if the ride operators had acted {{to shut down the}} ride in a timely manner, guests would only have suffered minor cuts. The report also stated that the park was fined $1,000 for not <b>properly</b> <b>maintaining</b> the ride. On November 21, 2008, a settlement to [...] "provide lifetime care" [...] was reached between Kentucky Kingdom and the victim's family.|$|R
