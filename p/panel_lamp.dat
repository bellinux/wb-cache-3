40|$|Abstract: A xenon gas {{discharge}} flat <b>panel</b> <b>lamp</b> is {{made and the}} influence factors: the gas pressures, the gas compositions and gas gap on the luminous efficacy of the xenon {{gas discharge}} flat panel lamps were investigated. Marked increments of the luminous efficacy of the lamps were observed by optimizing the structures and the discharge conditions. The {{results showed that the}} xenon gas discharge flat panel lamps with a luminance of above 10, 000 cd/m 2, a luminous flux of above 450 lm, a size of 126 × 87 mm and an luminous efficacy of about 43 lm/W could be attained at about 450 torr xenon, 0. 71 mm gap distance and 2. 8 mm front glass layer thickness. The factors which influenced the luminous efficacy were discussed in the end. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} project {{was designed to}} repair and optimize the performance of a. prototype Ansco Model 4 Microdensitometer which had been inoperative for several years. Repairs {{were made in the}} start circuit of the control <b>panel,</b> <b>lamp</b> voltage control and the 2 nd cut-in potentiometer to make the instrument operative. Calibrations and alignments were made and an apparatus was designed and implemented to facilitate lateral slit alignment. The original objective of optimization was not met due to insufficient time but the instrument was made operative and accurate to less than 2 % over the 0 - 3. 0 density range and 15 % above 3. 0. Recommendations have been made within the project report whose implementation would further improve the performance of the instrument. It was strongly recommended that this project be continued as another senior {{research project}} during the next academic year...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiant heat}} test {{facility}} develops test sets providing well-characterized thermal environments, often representing fires. Many {{of the components}} and procedures have become standardized {{to such an extent}} that the development of a specialized design tool to determine optimal configurations for radiant heat experiments was appropriate. SPLASH (Single <b>Panel</b> <b>Lamp</b> and Shroud Helper) is that tool. SPLASH is implemented as a user-friendly, Windows-based program that allows a designer to describe a test setup in terms of parameters such as number of lamps, power, position, and separation distance. This document is a user manual for that software. Any incidental descriptions of theory are only for the purpose of defining the model inputs. The theory for the underlying model is described in SAND 2005 - 2947 (Ref. [1]). SPLASH provides a graphical user interface to define lamp panel and shroud designs parametrically, solves the resulting radiation enclosure problem for up to 2500 surfaces, and provides post-processing to facilitate understanding and documentation of analyzed designs...|$|E

SPLASH (Single <b>Panel</b> <b>Lamp</b> and Shroud Helper) is that tool. SPLASH is implemented as a user-friendly program that allows a designer to describe a test setup in terms of parameters such as lamp number, power, position, and separation distance. Thermal radiation is the dominant mechanism of heat transfer and the SPLASH model solves a radiation enclosure problem to estimate temperature distributions in a shroud providing the boundary condition of interest. Irradiance distribution on a specified viewing plane is also estimated. This document provides the theoretical development for the underlying model. A series of tests were conducted to characterize SPLASH's ability to analyze lamp and shroud systems. The comparison suggests that SPLASH succeeds as a design tool. Simplifications made to keep the model tractable are demonstrated to result in estimates that are only approximately as uncertain as many of the properties and characteristics of the operating environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The global {{need for}} energy savings {{requires}} {{the usage of}} renewable sources in many applications. Solar energy {{can be used for}} street lighting usually in cases of low consumption applications because of the low efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) panels. This research aims to illuminate a low traffic road according to CIE M 5 Class requirements, using solar energy as more as it is possible. The objective is to decrease the energy consumption and also to use the appropriate lamp for the lighting of low traffic roads. According to recent studies in the mesopic region, the ideal lamp for this application is a metal halide lamp. In this study, a specific methodology is developed, which calculates the annual solar energy and the annual power output that the whole system can use. The calculations can be optimized throw a specific methodology that converts the potential of the system according to the tilt angle of the system’s PV panel. The PV lighting system is an integrated unit with a PV <b>panel,</b> <b>lamp,</b> battery, inverter, charger etc. As a result of low power efficiency of PV panel energy losses and unstable weather conditions the system should not be full-autonomous. For this reason an interconnection to the local network is necessary, so a control unit is also developed. The autonomy of the whole system, as it calculated, is approximately 315 days per year. The energy savings of the proposed system is finally calculated...|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, people in {{academic}} or research institutions {{had the opportunity}} for single-person use of a computer system in interactive mode for extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person. Early personal computersgenerally called microcomputerswere often sold in a kit form and in limited volumes, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. Minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions, and output was provided by front <b>panel</b> <b>lamps.</b> Practical use required adding peripherals such as keyboards, computer displays, disk drives, and printers. Micral N was the earliest commercial, non-kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor, the Intel 8008. It was built starting in 1972 and about 90,000 units were sold. This had been preceded by the Datapoint 2200 in 1970, for which the Intel 8008 had been commissioned, though not accepted for use.

50|$|Indium is a metal {{softer than}} lead (hardness of 0.9 HB), {{permitting}} {{it to be}} scratched by a nail. It is also malleable, ductile and has a thermal conductivity value of 0.78 W/m°C (85 °C). It also has the capacity of wetting glass, quartz and other ceramic materials. It maintains the plasticity and ductility when exposed to cryogenic environments and has a big gap between the melting point and the boiling point (156.6 °C and 2080 °C respectively). Under compression, it has high plasticity that allows almost unlimited deformation (2.14 MPa of compression resistance) and under tensile it has low elongation (4 MPa of tensile resistance). Indium is used in dental alloys, semiconductor components, nuclear reactor <b>panels,</b> sodium <b>lamps,</b> strengthening factor in lead-based welds and low melting temperature welds.

50|$|In large {{electric}} power systems, Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) {{is used for}} tasks such as switching on generators, controlling generator output and switching in or out system elements for maintenance. The first supervisory control systems implemented consisted of a <b>panel</b> of <b>lamps</b> and switches at a central console near the controlled plant. The lamps provided feedback {{on the state of}} plant (the data acquisition function) and the switches allowed adjustments to the plant to be made (the supervisory control function). Today, SCADA systems are much more sophisticated and, due to advances in communication systems, the consoles controlling the plant no longer need to be near the plant itself. Instead it is now common for plants to be controlled with equipment similar (if not identical) to a desktop computer. The ability to control such plants through computers has increased the need for security—there have already been reports of cyber-attacks on such systems causing significant disruptions to power systems.|$|R
50|$|Some M4 Enigmas {{used the}} Schreibmax, a small printer that could print the 26 letters {{on a narrow}} paper ribbon. This {{eliminated}} {{the need for a}} second operator to read the lamps and transcribe the letters. The Schreibmax was placed on top of the Enigma machine and was connected to the <b>lamp</b> <b>panel.</b> To install the printer, the lamp cover and light bulbs had to be removed. It improved both convenience and operational security; the printer could be installed remotely such that the signal officer operating the machine no longer had to see the decrypted plaintext.|$|R
25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office.

The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing <b>lamp</b> <b>panels</b> at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|R

40|$|Daylight-mediated {{photodynamic}} therapy (daylight PDT) {{is a simple}} and pain free treatment of actinic keratoses. Weather conditions may not always allow daylight PDT outdoors. We compared the spectrum of five different lamp candidates for indoor “daylight PDT” and investigated their ability to photobleach protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Furthermore, we measured the amount of PpIX activating daylight available in a glass greenhouse, which can be an alternative when it is uncomfortable for patients to be outdoors. The lamps investigated were: halogen lamps (overhead and slide projector), white light-emitting diode (LED) <b>lamp,</b> red LED <b>panel</b> and <b>lamps</b> used for conventional PDT. Four of the five light sources were able to photobleach PpIX completely. For halogen light and the red LED lamp, 5000 lux could photobleach PpIX whereas 12, 000 lux were needed for the white LED lamp. Furthermore, the greenhouse was suitable for daylight PDT since the effect of solar light is lowered only by 25 %. In conclusion, we found {{four of the five}} light sources and the greenhouse usable for indoor daylight PDT. The greenhouse is beneficial when the weather outside is rainy or windy. Only insignificant ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) radiation passes through the greenhouse glass, so sun protection is not needed...|$|R
