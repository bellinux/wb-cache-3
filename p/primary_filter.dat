50|$|Power {{supplies}} {{designed for}} worldwide use were {{equipped with an}} input voltage selector switch that allowed the user to configure the unit for use on local power grid. In the lower voltage range, around 115 V, this switch is turned on changing the power grid voltage rectifier into a voltage doubler in delon circuit design. As a result, the large <b>primary</b> <b>filter</b> capacitor behind that rectifier was split up into two capacitors wired in series, balanced with bleeder resistors and varistors that were necessary in the upper input voltage range, around 230 V. Connecting the unit configured for the lower range to a higher-voltage grid usually resulted in an immediate permanent damage. When the power factor correction (PFC) was required, those filter capacitors were replaced with higher-capacity ones, together with a coil installed in series to delay the inrush current. This is the simple design of a passive PFC.|$|E
50|$|While regular vacuum {{cleaners}} {{are designed to}} simply contain visible dirt and debris, hypoallergenic vacuums are designed to trap {{almost all of the}} smaller particles which in a regular vacuum are simply re-circulated into the ambient air. While this is not an issue for most people who do not suffer allergies, many with particular sensitivities to allergens (including asthma) can find that this not only does not help their condition, but stirring the dust into the air can make the condition worse.Most modern hypoallergenic {{vacuum cleaners}} use a system consisting of four primary components: the final output filter (generally a HEPA or similar filter), the motor and fan or impeller assembly, secondary particle filter to protect the motor assembly, and a <b>primary</b> <b>filter</b> - a bag, cup or wet filter bucket (each of which provide the initial filtration and retention of most dust and contaminants). Modern high quality hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners generally use HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrestor) filters to trap the vast majority (at least 99.97%) of very small particles that other vacuum cleaners would simply re-emit into the ambient air - ideally specifying a recognised and independently tested HEPA filter grade (see HEPA article) rather than just using the term. Recently many cheaper 'HEPA type' filters have appeared on the market attempting to capitalise on the term, these are generally inferior and do not meet the stringent requirements set by the US Dept of Energy (or in Europe EN 1822) to call themselves HEPA, and have not been independently tested to assess their ability to stop dust egress. While many dry bagless systems include HEPA grade filtration, the user is generally exposed to the very dust and allergens they are trying to avoid during emptying/cleaning the system. Anti-allergy bagged systems avoid most of this risk with a bag that will contain dirt and contaminants, and wet filter bagless systems also allow emptying without exposure to airborne particles as it is contained in a 'mud'. While Wet filter systems do avoid the cost and environmental waste of needing new bag for every filling, like wet/dry and shampooing machines they do generally require a very small amount of anti foaming agent, though this is generally environmentally benign. Some Hypoallergenic vacuum bags differ a great deal from non-hypoallergenic bags. Hypoallergenic bags often come in two pieces, an inner and outer bag. The inner bag (which captures the dirt) will be disposable and completely contained. Outer bags will sometimes take the place of a filter all together filtering out dust and allergens out of the air. Some modern hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners will use the two bag system with the outer bag made up of high-performance filtration material treated with antimicrobials to impede the growth of mold, bacteria and other parasites. A two bag system will still require a final HEPA filter to be able to comply with the standards of HEPA filtration. All good Hypo-allergenic systems are designed, not just to contain 99+% of containments (99.97% in the case of HEPA systems), but to clean the air while cleaning the floors, some, including water filter models, achieving retention of particles over 0.3 micrometer diameter of 99.99% (1 particle in 10,000 released).|$|E

40|$|Pilot scale {{studies of}} high rate {{filtration}} were initiated to assess its potential {{as either a}} primary 'roughing' filter to alleviate the seasonal overloading of low rate filters on Hereford sewage treatment works - caused by wastes from cider production - or as a two stage high rate process to provide complete sewage treatment. Four mineral and four plastic <b>primary</b> <b>filter</b> media and two plastic secondary filter media were studied. The hydraulic loading applied to the primary plastic media (11. 2 m 3 /m 3. d) was twice that applied to the mineral media. The plastic media removed an average around 66 percent and the mineral media around 73 percent of the BOD applied when the 90 percentile BOD concentration was 563 mg/ 1. At a hydraulic loading of 4 m 3 /m 3. d the secondary filters removed most of the POD from partially settled <b>primary</b> <b>filter</b> effluents, with one secondary effluent satisfying a 25 mg/ 1 BOD and 30 mg/ 1 SS standard. No significant degree of nitrification was achieved. Fungi dominated the biological film of the primary filters, with invertebrate grazers having little influence on film levels. Ponding did not arise, and modular media supported lower film levels than random-fill types. Secondary filter film levels were low, being dominated by bacteria. The biological loading applied to the filters was related to sludge dewaterability, with the most readily conditionable sludges produced by filters supporting heavy film. Sludges produced by random-fill media could be dewatered as readily as those produced by low rate filters treating the same sewage. Laboratory scale studies showed a relationship between log effluent BOD and nitrification achieved by biological filters. This relationship {{and the relationship between}} BOD load applied and removed observed in all filter media could he used to optimise operating conditions required in biological filters to achieve given effluent BOD and ammoniacal nitrogen standards...|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} computational algorithm for {{estimating the}} noise covariance matrices of large linear discrete stochatic-dynamic systems is presented. Such systems arise typically by discretizing distributed-parameter systems, and their size renders computational efficiency a major consideration. The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm {{is based on}} the ideas of Belanger, and is algebraically equivalent to his algorithm. The earlier algorithm, however, has computational complexity proportional to p to the 6 th, where p is the number of observations of the system state, while the new algorithm has complexity proportional to only p-cubed. Further, the formulation of noise covariance estimation as a secondary filter, analogous to state estimation as a <b>primary</b> <b>filter,</b> suggests several generalizations of the earlier algorithm.

40|$|A weakly dicomplemented lattice is a bounded lattice L {{equipped}} with two unary operations 4 and 5 (called weak complementation and dual weak complementation) satisfying for all x, y ∈ L the following equations: (1) x 44 ≤ x, (2) x ≤ y = ⇒ x 4 ≥ y 4, (3) (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ y 4) = x, (1 ’) x 55 ≥ x, (2 ’) x ≤ y = ⇒ x 5 ≥ y 5, (3 ’) (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ y 5) = x.

Two interactive particle filters are used for this purpose, one for the closed eyes {{and the other one}} for the open eyes. Each particle filter is used to track the eye locations as well as the scales of the eye subjects. The set of particles that gives higher confidence is defined as the primary set and the other one is defined as the secondary set. The eye location is estimated by the <b>primary</b> particle <b>filter,</b> and whether the eye status is open or closed is also decided by the label of the <b>primary</b> particle <b>filter.</b> When a new frame comes, the secondary particle filter is reinitialized according to the estimates from the <b>primary</b> particle <b>filter.</b> We use autoregression models for describing the state transition and a classification-based model for measuring the observation. Tensor subspace analysis is used for feature extraction which is followed by a logistic regression model to give the posterior estimation. The performance is carefully evaluated from two aspects: the blink detection rate and the tracking accuracy. The blink detection rate is evaluated using videos from varying scenarios, and the tracking accuracy is given by comparing with the benchmark data obtained using the Vicon motion capturing system. The setup for obtaining benchmark data for tracking accuracy evaluation is presented and experimental results are shown. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the capability of the algorithm.|$|R
