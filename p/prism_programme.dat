5000|$|In June 2013, a DA-Notice {{was issued}} asking {{the media to}} refrain from running further stories related to the U.S. <b>PRISM</b> <b>programme,</b> and British {{involvement}} therein.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of such {{insights}} {{include the}} following. State users generally viewed [...] "Facebook as a whole" [...] negatively while {{opinions of the}} company's new Paper app were overwhelmingly positive. Regarding the surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden, some people held conflicted opinions towards Edward Snowden and the <b>Prism</b> <b>programme.</b> As Asseily explained, [...] "In general terms, some people who thought Snowden was a villain, also thought Prism was bad and likewise, some thought Snowden was a hero but that Prism was a good thing".|$|E
40|$|The {{revelation of}} the top-secret US intelligence-led <b>PRISM</b> <b>Programme</b> has {{triggered}} wide-ranging debates across Europe. Press reports have shed {{new light on the}} electronic surveillance ‘fishing expeditions’ of the US National Security Agency and the FBI into the world’s largest electronic communications companies. This Policy Brief by a team of legal specialists and political scientists addresses the main controversies raised by the PRISM affair and the policy challenges that it poses for the EU. Two main arguments are presented: First, the leaks over the <b>PRISM</b> <b>programme</b> have undermined the trust that EU citizens have in their governments and the European institutions to safeguard and protect their privacy; and second, the PRISM affair raises questions regarding the capacity of EU institutions to draw lessons from the past and to protect the data of its citizens and residents in the context of transatlantic relations. The Policy Brief puts forward a set of policy recommendations for the EU to follow and implement a robust data protection strategy in response to the affair...|$|E
50|$|Following revelations by Edward Snowden {{about the}} {{activities}} of the United States' National Security Agency, and their <b>PRISM</b> surveillance <b>programme,</b> rising concerns about misuse of data led to various proposals to enable citizens and consumers outside of the US to enjoy protection through technological sovereignty.|$|R
25|$|GCHQ {{also has}} {{had access to}} the US {{internet}} monitoring <b>programme</b> <b>PRISM</b> since at least June 2010. PRISM is said to give the National Security Agency and FBI easy access to the systems of nine of the world's top internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, and Skype.|$|R
25|$|The Investigatory Powers Tribunal {{ruled in}} December 2014 that GCHQ does not breach the European Convention of Human Rights, {{and that its}} {{activities}} are compliant with Articles 8 (right to privacy) and 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention of Human Rights. However, the Tribunal stated in February 2015 that one particular aspect, the data-sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance <b>programmes</b> <b>Prism</b> and Upstream, had been in contravention of human rights law prior to this until two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed {{to the public in}} December 2014.|$|R
40|$|The {{uncovering}} of the <b>PRISM</b> <b>programme</b> has concerned {{many that}} the UK authorities are circumventing {{the legal framework}} and gathering data on its own citizens via US surveillance agencies. Orla Lynskey describes the statutory controls that exist regarding data sharing with the US and explores whether they are adequate to protect UK citizens’ privacy. She concludes that there are little safeguards and redress opportunities for non-US persons, and that EU Data Protection regulation is, at present, toothless once international data transfers have been made. On the bright side, the revelation has brought the issue of government surveillance to the fore...|$|E
30|$|Organisations such as Europol [10] are {{increasingly}} acknowledging growing criminal {{dependence on the}} internet and the increasingly trans-European perspective of serious and organised crime. These changes in the way that information is created and shared, combined with the diversity in the way that existing forms of criminality are being conducted provides the opportunity, and desire, for the development of new means to assist law enforcement in combating it. To provide one such approach to enable this, the tools described here facilitate the identification, extraction, processing, analysis and presentation of data from open sources, such as social media, that can reveal insight into the emergence and presence of crime both in an operational sense; by identifying specific phenomena that are linked to discrete types of crime, and from a strategic perspective in the identification and visualisation of strategic trends through the corroboration of different crime indicators. While {{at one end of the}} scale international intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency’s (NSA) <b>PRISM</b> <b>programme</b> are facilitating the acquisition, fusion and analysis of vast amounts of data from disparate sources [11], the (known) resources and capability of law enforcement agencies (both locally, regionally and even internationally) are recognised to be much more modest—with the use of data from open sources and social media often a manual task, and the remit of just a few specialist analysts and officers within each force [12].|$|E
40|$|Wine {{contains}} organic acids, which {{determine its}} final quality. Tartaric and malic acids {{are found in}} dominant concentrations. Also present are citric, lactic and succinic acids, and some volatile acids such as formic and acetic acid. The process of winemaking is associated with changes in the concentration of wine acids. The composition of acids in wine is also affected by the type, quality and ripeness of grapes, grape manufacture and wine production. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the concentrations of tartaric, malic, citric, lactic, succinic, formic and acetic acid during the winemaking process in different press fractions of 8 varieties of white wines from the Vineyard centre Mělník - Chloumek and in 5 commercially purchased red wines, using HPLC with DAD detection, and to analyse the trend of changes in different phases of the winemaking process. The white wine press fractions were supplied following the wine press (A), settling of juice (B), in the phase of partially fermented juice (C) and during the maturation of young wine (D-G.). The samples were taken within 2 - 3 days. There were no red wine press fractions available from the vineyard. 5 bottles of different varieties of red wine were thus purchased from the shop and analysed. The GraphPad <b>Prism</b> <b>programme</b> was used to perform statistical analyses (ANOVA). The hypothesis suggesting that tartaric acid would be the dominant acid was confirmed in 5 varieties of white wine and in all red wines. The hypothesis suggesting a difference between red and white wines was also confirmed. There were significant differences in the concentration and composition of acids between young white wines and red wines. The hypothesis that the concentration of all acids would increase was not confirmed. Tartaric acid showed the most linear trends of decrease, followed by malic acid. The trend of change in the concentrations of succinic, lactic, citric and formic acid increased in some varieties and it decreased in others. The grape variety, weather during summer and autumn and the manufacturing processes all influence the acid composition in wine. These factors can explain the differences seen between different varieties of wine...|$|E

However, in February 2015, the Tribunal refined its earlier judgement and ruled that aspects of the data-sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance <b>programmes</b> <b>Prism</b> and Upstream did contravene said Articles and, as such, were illegal between - at least - 2007, when Prism was introduced, and 2014, when two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed {{to the public in}} December 2014.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} strengthening of wood beams under bending loads {{through the use of}} very high strength steel cords. The study also presents the results of 21 double shear push-out tests conducted to determine the strength of Steel fiber Reinforced Polymers (SRP) bonded to wood <b>prisms.</b> An experimental <b>programme</b> based on a four-point bending test configuration is proposed to characterize the stiffness, ductility and strength response of strengthened wood beams. Mechanical tests on the strengthened wood showed that external bonding of steel fibers produce high increases in flexural stiffness and capacity. Finally experiment results are used to calibrate existing analytical formulations for capacity prediction. This economic and effective technique may be an interesting alternative to glass or carbon fibers or other expensive retrofitting methods...|$|R
40|$|V magistrski nalogi smo testirali 27 vrst nanodelcev cinkovega oksida (ZnO) glede toksičnosti in vitro. V ta namen smo izmerili vpliv nanodelcev različnih velikosti in oblik na proliferacijo normalnih črevesnih epitelnih celic linije H 4 in makrofagne linije TLT. Z eksperimentom smo želeli dokazati, da je toksičnost nanodelcev ZnO na celice odvisna od velikosti, oblike in njihove koncentracije. Preživetje celic po izpostavitvi nanodelcem smo ugotavljali s testom kristal vijolično in reagentom MTT. S programom GraphPad Prism smo določili inhibitorno koncentracijo nanodelcev ZnO, pri kateri dosežemo 50 -odstotni inhibitorni učinek glede na kontrolo (IC 50). Ugotovljene IC 50 vrednosti so bile v razponu do 1, 295 mg/l do 141, 2 mg/l za celice H 4 in od 1, 467 mg/l do 190, 9 mg/l za celice TLT. Ugotovili smo, da so za isto vrsto nanodelcev imele celice TLT v 12 -ih primerih nižje vrednosti (višja toksičnost) IC 50 kot celice H 4, v 15 -ih primerih pa višje vrednosti. S programom SPSS korelacije med obliko in toksičnostjo nanodelcev nismo zaznali. Ugotovili smo, da obstaja korelacija med velikostjo in toksičnostjovečji kot so delci manjša je vrednost IC 50. In {{the present}} master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis we {{analysed}} the in vitro toxicity of 27 types of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. For this purpose we analysed {{the effect of}} nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes on the proliferation of normal cells of the H 4 intestinal epithelial cell line and TLT macrophage cells. Our objective was {{to prove that the}} toxicity of the ZnO based nanoparticles depends on their size, shape and concentration. We determined the survival of cells after exposure to the nanoparticles by performing a crystal violet test, {{as well as with the}} use of the MTT reagent. Using the GraphPad <b>Prism</b> <b>programme</b> we determined the inhibitory concentration of ZnO nanoparticles on viability of cells at which we obtained a 50 percent inhibitory effect in relation to the control (IC 50). The IC 50 values were in the range between 1. 295 mg/l to 141. 2 mg/l for H 4 cells and from 1. 467 mg/l to 190. 9 mg/l for TLT cells. Using the same type of nanoparticles we found that in 12 cases TLT cells had a lower IC 50 value (higher toxicity) than H 4 cells and in 15 cases the values were higher. Using the SPSS programme a significant correlation between the shape and toxicity of nanoparticles has not been detected. It can be concluded that there is a negative correlation between the size and toxicity, since larger particles were less toxic...|$|E
40|$|PRISM (Polarized Radiation Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) was {{proposed}} to ESA {{in response to}} the Call for White Papers for the definition of the L 2 and L 3 Missions in the ESA Science <b>Programme.</b> <b>PRISM</b> would have two instruments: (1) an imager with a 3. 5 m mirror (cooled to 4 K for high performance in the far-infrared [...] -that is, in the Wien part of the CMB blackbody spectrum), and (2) an Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) somewhat like the COBE FIRAS instrument but over three orders of magnitude more sensitive. Highlights of the new science (beyond the obvious target of B-modes from gravity waves generated during inflation) made possible by these two instruments working in tandem include: (1) the ultimate galaxy cluster survey gathering 10 e 6 clusters extending to large redshift and measuring their peculiar velocities and temperatures (through the kSZ effect and relativistic corrections to the classic y-distortion spectrum, respectively) (2) a detailed investigation into the nature of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) consisting of at present unresolved dusty high-z galaxies, where most of the star formation in the universe took place, (3) searching for distortions from the perfect CMB blackbody spectrum, which will probe a large number of otherwise inaccessible effects (e. g., energy release through decaying dark matter, the primordial power spectrum on very small scales where measurements today are impossible due to erasure from Silk damping and contamination from non-linear cascading of power from larger length scales). These are {{but a few of the}} highlights of the new science that will be made possible with PRISM. Comment: 20 pages Late...|$|R
