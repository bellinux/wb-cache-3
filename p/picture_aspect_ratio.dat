50|$|DAR is {{also known}} as image aspect ratio and <b>picture</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> though the latter can be {{confused}} with pixel aspect ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Pixel Aspect Ratio {{is often}} {{confused}} with {{different types of}} image aspect ratios; {{the ratio of the}} image width and height. Due to non-squareness of pixels in Standard-definition TV, {{there are two types of}} such aspect ratios: Storage Aspect Ratio (SAR) and Display Aspect Ratio (abbreviated DAR, also known as Image Aspect Ratio and <b>Picture</b> <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio).</b> Note that both <b>Picture</b> <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> and Pixel Aspect Ratio can be abbreviated into PAR. This article reserves the acronym PAR for Pixel Aspect Ratio and instead, uses the term [...] "Display Aspect Ratio" [...] and the acronym [...] "DAR" [...] where appropriate.|$|E
30|$|To place {{a picture}} in a placeholder, one of the picture’s {{dimensions}} (width or height) is scaled {{to that of the}} placeholder, and the other dimension is set so that the <b>picture’s</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is preserved and no part of it is clipped. Automatic cropping of the picture is not attempted, although {{it would be possible to}} integrate such a feature.|$|R
50|$|The Ten Commandments premiered at New York City's Criterion Theatre on November 8, 1956. Among {{those who}} {{attended}} the premiere were Cecil B. DeMille and his daughter Cecilia DeMille Harper, Charlton Heston and his wife Lydia Clarke, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo and her husband Bob Morgan, Martha Scott and her husband and son, John Wayne and his wife Pilar Pallete, Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, and Barney Balaban. It played on a roadshow basis with reserved seating until mid-1958, when it finally entered general release. It was re-released in 1966 and 1972, and one more time in 1989. The 1972 and 1989 re-issues included 70mm and 35mm prints that reframed the <b>picture's</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> to 2.20:1 and 2.35:1, respectively, cropping {{the top and bottom}} of the <b>picture's</b> original 1.85:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> The Ten Commandments was released on DVD on March 30, 1999; March 9, 2004, as a Special Collector's Edition; and March 29, 2011, as a Special edition and Standard edition.|$|R
5000|$|Most digital point & shoot cameras have an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.33 (4:3), {{the same}} as analog {{television}} or early movies. However, a 35 mm <b>picture's</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is 1.5 (3:2). Several digital cameras take photos in either ratio, and nearly all digital SLRs take pictures in a 3:2 ratio, as most can use lenses designed for 35 mm film. Some photo labs print photos on 4:3 ratio paper, {{as well as the}} existing 3:2. In 2005 Panasonic launched the first consumer camera with a native <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 16:9, matching HDTV. This is similar to a 7:4 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> which was a common size for APS film. Different <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> {{is one of the reasons}} consumers have issues when cropping photos. An <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4:3 translates to a size of 4.5"x6.0". This loses half an inch when printing on the [...] "standard" [...] size of 4"x6", an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3:2. Similar cropping occurs when printing on other sizes, i.e., 5"x7", 8"x10", or 11"x14".|$|R
5000|$|... 625-line {{analogue}} video contains 575 {{active video}} lines (this includes two half lines). When the half lines are rounded up to whole lines {{for ease of}} digital representation, this gives 576 lines, {{which is also the}} nearest mod(16) value to 575. To maintain the same <b>picture</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> the number of active pixels could be increased to 703.2, which can be rounded up to 704.|$|E
5000|$|... 525-line {{analogue}} video contains 485 {{active video}} lines (this include two half lines, though typically only 483 picture lines are present due to Closed Captions data {{taking up the}} first [...] "active picture" [...] line on each field). The nearest mod(16) value is 480. To maintain the same <b>picture</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> the number of active pixels could be decreased to 706.2, which can be rounded down to 704 for mod(16).|$|E
50|$|As Super 8 {{progressed to}} be used in HD and {{theatrical}} applications, a need arose for widescreen compatibility without having to use expensive optical adapters or excessive cropping. Since magnetic sound-striped film was no longer available, that area of the film could be used to expand the <b>picture</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> in a process similar to the creation of Super 16 from standard 16mm film. The creators of Sleep Always experimented with widening the camera gate to expose into the sound track region to achieve this.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} shot in three main locations: Edgefield, South Carolina; Augusta, Georgia and Aiken, South Carolina. Animal Makers created the animatronic version of the cat. It was filmed using a 35mm camera for both the {{coloured}} moving and black and white still <b>pictures.</b> The <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of the film was 1.85/1. The Title sequences were produced by Pacific Titles & Optical.|$|R
50|$|An RCA TK-1 {{test pattern}} {{generator}} (monoscope) is a 19-inch rack-mounted chassis, which contains a monoscope tube housed inside an anti-magnetic steel shield and associated electronic circuits for driving it. The monoscope tube is constructed similarly {{to a small}} cathode ray tube (CRT), but instead of displaying an image, it scans a built-in image, producing a video signal. The tube has a perfectly proportioned copy of the test pattern master art inside, permanently deposited as a carbon image on an aluminum target plate or slide. This perfect copy allowed all of the television studio and production control room video monitors, and home television sets, to be identically adjusted for minimum distortions such as ovals instead of circles. When the monitor or TV set was correctly adjusted to show test pattern circles, the received <b>picture's</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> was exactly four units wide by three units high. The 4 by 3 standard was chosen by the National Television System Committee (NTSC) for analog television, so that film movies would be compatible with TV broadcasting. 4:3 is the same <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> used by 16mm and classic 35mm motion picture film frames.|$|R
5000|$|This requirement, however, had {{implications}} for PAL motion <b>pictures.</b> PAL Pixel <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratios</b> for standard (4:3) and anamorphic wide screen (16:9), respectively 59:54 and 118:81, were awkward for digital image processing, especially for mixing PAL and NTSC video clips. Therefore, video editing products chose the almost equivalent values, respectively 12:11 and 16:11, which were more elegant and could create PAL digital images at exactly 704 pixels wide, as illustrated: ...|$|R
50|$|Some film {{directors}} and enthusiasts disapprove of pan and scan cropping, {{because it can}} remove up to 45% of the original image on 2.35:1 films or up to 53% on earlier 2.55:1 presentations, changing the director or cinematographer's original vision and intentions. The most extreme examples remove up to 75% of the original <b>picture</b> on such <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> as 2.75:1 or even 3:1 in epics such as Ben-Hur, King of Kings or Lawrence of Arabia.|$|R
5000|$|The terms [...] "tuner" [...] and [...] "receiver" [...] {{are used}} loosely, {{and it is}} perhaps more {{appropriately}} called an ATSC receiver, with the tuner {{being part of the}} receiver (see Metonymy). The receiver generates the audio and video (AV) signals needed for television, and performs the following tasks: demodulation, error correction, MPEG transport stream demultiplexing, decompression, AV synchronization, and media reformatting to match what is optimal input for one's TV. Examples of media reformatting include: interlace to progressive scan or vice versa, <b>picture</b> resolutions, <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> conversions (16:9 to or from 4:3), frame rate conversion, even image scaling. Zooming is an example of resolution change. It is commonly used to convert a low-resolution picture to a high-resolution display. This lets the user eliminate letterboxing or pillarboxing by stretching or cropping the picture. Some ATSC receivers, mostly those in HDTV TV sets, will stretch automatically, either by detecting black bars, or reading the Active Format Descriptor (AFD).|$|R
50|$|Many Android tablets have 16:10 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> because 16:10 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{suitable}} for reading books, and many papers have an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> close to 16:10 (e.g. ISO 216 papers use the 1:1.414 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio).</b> The iPad uses a 4:3 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> for similar reasons. Both formats come significantly closer to emulating the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of A4 paper (210 × 297 millimeters or 8.27 × 11.69 inches) and {{has been attributed to}} the success of 16:10 and 4:3 tablets.|$|R
5000|$|Modified <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> is a {{home cinema}} term for the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> or {{dimensions}} in which a film was modified to fit {{a specific type of}} screen, as opposed to original <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> Modified <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> are usually either 1.3:1 (historically), or (with the advent of widescreen television sets) 1.7:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> 1.3:1 is the modified <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> used historically in VHS format. A modified <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> transfer is achieved by means of pan and scan or open matte, the latter meaning removing the cinematic matte from a 1.85:1 film to open up the full 1.3:1 frame. Another name for it is [...] "prescaled" [...] aspect ratio".|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{elements}} is of great importance in solving the CFD problems. They are typically based on <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> i.e. the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of element decide whether a particular element {{would be good to}} use or we should go for another element with different <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> For example, if the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is large the speed of solver reduces while if this ratio is small the solver speed increases. Large <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> has another limitation of leading to interpolation errors. But if the results vary with direction then we use large <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R

50|$|Powers cut out {{rectangles}} {{with equal}} areas, shaped to match {{each of the}} popular <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios.</b> When overlapped with their center points aligned, he found that all of those <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> rectangles fit within an outer rectangle with an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.7:1 {{and all of them}} also covered a smaller common inner rectangle with the same <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> 1.7:1. The value found by Powers is exactly the geometric mean of the extreme <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios,</b> 4:3 (1.3:1) and 2.35:1 (or 64:27, see also 21:9 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> for more information), √ ≈ 1.770 which is coincidentally close to 16:9 (1.7:1). Applying the same geometric mean technique to 16:9 and 4:3 yields the 14:9 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> which is likewise used as a compromise between these ratios.|$|R
50|$|The {{geometric}} mean {{has been used}} in choosing a compromise <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> in film and video: given two <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios,</b> the {{geometric mean}} of them provides a compromise between them, distorting or cropping both in some sense equally. Concretely, two equal area rectangles (with the same center and parallel sides) of different <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> intersect in a rectangle whose <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is the geometric mean, and their hull (smallest rectangle which contains both of them) likewise has <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> their geometric mean.|$|R
40|$|We {{study in}} this paper the {{influence}} of the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of an axisymmetric drop on the spreading rate. For very small values of <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> the spreading rate is proportional to the cube of the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> as stated by Tanner's law. However, as the value of the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, the proportionality constant shows a weak dependence on the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> first decreasing and then increasing after reaching a minimum. Due {{to the fact that the}} <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of the drop decreases with time in the spreading drop, its influence decreases as time increases. [S 1063 - 651 X(98) 09109 - 0]...|$|R

50|$|Storage <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> is {{the ratio}} of the image width to height in pixels, and can be easily {{calculated}} from the video file. Display <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> is {{the ratio of}} image width to height (in a unit of length such as centimeters or inches) when displayed on screen, and is calculated from the combination of Pixel <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> and Storage <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the {{transverse}} direction, {{significant increase}} was observed for the deck displacements at nodes 90 and 74, while as the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> increases - although small - {{the displacement of}} node 64 (at abutment; Figure 17) increased with skew angle. As the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, the transverse deck displacement increases. Also, the transverse deck displacement becomes smaller from the bent location to the abutments for all <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios.</b> For all <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios,</b> there {{is an increase in}} the transverse displacement with the skew, especially, for bridges with skew larger than 30 °. Nonetheless, at abutment location (node 64), deck displacement with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.54 was slightly larger than that with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.3, whereas that with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.1 was significantly larger by about 300 % regardless of the skew angle. This {{can be attributed to the}} failure of the shear keys for bridges with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.1.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{electrically}} heated tube experiments {{was performed to}} investigate the effect of high <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> on curvature heat transfer enhancement in uniformly heated rectangular cooling passages. Three hardware geometries were tested: a baseline straight <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> 10 tube, an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 (square) tube with a 45 deg. curve, and an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> 10 tube with a 45 deg. curve. Gaseous nitrogen with the following properties {{was used as the}} coolant: ambient inlet temperature, pressures to 8. 3 MPa, wall-to-bulk temperature ratios less than two, and Reynolds numbers based on hydraulic diameter ranging from 250, 000 to 1, 600, 000. The measured curvature enhancement factors were compared to values predicted by three previously published models which had been developed for low <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> tubes. The models were shown to be valid for the high <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> tube as well the low <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> tube, indicating that <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> had little impact on the curvature heat transfer enhancement in these tests...|$|R
50|$|Widescreen {{images are}} a variety of <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> used in film, {{television}} and computer screens.

50|$|Cinematographic <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> {{are usually}} denoted as a (rounded) decimal {{multiple}} of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height.

50|$|On a {{widescreen}} television set, a 1.78:1 image {{fills the}} screen, however, 2.39:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> films are letterboxed with narrow mattes. Because the 1.85:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> {{does not match}} the 1.78:1 (16:9) <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of widescreen DVDs and high-definition video, slight letterboxing occurs. Usually, such matting of 1.85:1 film is eliminated to match the 1.78:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> in the DVD and HD image transference.|$|R
50|$|Original <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> (OAR) is a {{home cinema}} term for the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> or {{dimensions}} in which a film or visual production was produced - as envisioned by {{the people involved in}} the creation of the work. As an example, the film Gladiator was released to theaters in the 2.39:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> It was filmed in Super 35 and, in addition to being presented in cinemas and television in the Original <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio</b> of 2.39:1, it was also broadcast without the matte, altering the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> to the television standard of 1.3:1. Because of the varied ways in which films are shot, IAR (Intended <b>Aspect</b> <b>Ratio)</b> is a more appropriate term, but is rarely used.|$|R
5000|$|Tablets {{started to}} enjoy {{mainstream}} popularity beginning late 2010/early 2011 and remain popular to present day. <b>Aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> for tablets typically include 16:10, 16:9 and 4:3. Android tablets typically use 16:10 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios,</b> which outsell their 16:9 counterparts, where the iPad uses a 4:3 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> Tablets {{have caused a}} shift in production away from purely 16:9 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios,</b> and a resurgence of [...] "productivity" [...] <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> (including 16:10 and 4:3) in place of [...] "media" [...] <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> (16:9 and ultra wide screen formats). 16:9 is less suited for laptops, PC monitors and tablets.

40|$|The {{effect of}} nozzle <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> (w/H) (major axis to minor axis ratio) on the {{velocity}} field of a turbulent plane jet is investigated using a hot-wire anemometer. The <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> investigated {{were in the}} range 10 < w/H < 60. The initial turbulence intensity proles exhibit a lower intensity at higher <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> although this is probably caused by the nozzle whose proles change with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> The length of the potential core and the normalized mean and rms velocities are all {{found to be a}} function of wH, in both the near and far field. Lower <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> leads to faster decay of the mean velocity. Most investigations on <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> effects have been on rectangular jets, hence this work is unique in its own right. Overall, the dependence of the current plane jet on <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is quite significant...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{deformations}} recorded at the abutments for U+, all models followed similar trend as the response decreases when the skew angle increases {{except for the}} <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.1 and when the shear keys are removed. The similar response was achieved by bridges with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0.54 and 0.3, while abutment-soil springs of bridges with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.1 experienced larger response values {{for most of the}} cases. Also, yielding of abutment-soil springs was observed for all of the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios.</b> In-plane rotations became more pronounced as the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, especially, for without shear key cases. For U[*]−[*](Figure 18), the gap opening tends to decrease with the skew, while the bridges with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.54 show larger gap opening than those with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.3 especially for large skew angles. Gap opening response for bridge with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.54 tends to level out with the skew for some of the cases and constantly increases with the skew for bridge with <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.1. The constant increase {{can be attributed to the}} loss of shear keys. But more importantly, it is evident that the in-plane rotation of the deck becomes more pronounced for larger skew angles and larger <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios.</b> For without shear key case, the gap opening increases with the skew regardless of the aspect ratio; however, as the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, the gap opening increases accompanied with more pronounced in-plane rotations.|$|R
