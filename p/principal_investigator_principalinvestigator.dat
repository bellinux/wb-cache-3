40|$|The <b>Principal</b> <b>Investigator</b> Microgravity Services {{project at}} the NASA Glenn Research center {{supports}} <b>Principal</b> <b>Investigators</b> of the microgravity science community as they evaluate the effects of acceleration on their experiments. The <b>Principal</b> <b>Investigator</b> Microgravity Services' primary responsibility is to support NASA sponsored investigators {{in the area of}} acceleration data analysis, interpretation and the monitoring of the microgravity environment on-board various carriers. The microgravity environment is a rich and very complex dynamic one. It is subject to quasi-steady accelerations, higher frequency acceleration, and transient disturbances. With the advent of the International Space Station operation, a significant amount of data is expected to be downlinked and processed for both the space station microgravity environment characterization (verification) and scientific experiments. Therefore, to help <b>principal</b> <b>investigator</b> teams monitor the microgravity environment on-board the International Space Station in order to avoid negative impact on their experiment, when possible, the NASA Glenn <b>Principal</b> <b>Investigator</b> Microgravity Services project is currently developing an artificial intelligence monitoring system, which will notify the <b>principal</b> <b>investigator</b> teams in near real time of any change in the microgravity environment susceptible to affect their experiments...|$|R
