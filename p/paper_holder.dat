This machine requires less than 4 amperes at 115 VAC 60 Hz. The recommended operating environment is a temperature of 40 °F to 110 °F (4 °C to 43 °C), a relative humidity of 2 to 95 percent and an altitude of 0 to 10,000 feet (3050 m). The printing paper is an 8.44 inch by 4.5 inch diameter roll and the paper tape is a one inch by 1000 foot roll. Ribbons are 0.5 inch wide by 60 yards long with plastic spools and eyelets for proper ribbon reverse operation.|$|E

Later on, CDTS was discarded for an environmental friendly alternative, [...] "Bio-Toilet", designed in collaboration with DRDO. Both eastern (squat) and western styles of toilets are provided. One side of the toilet is provided with a wash basin with water tap and sensor button, a soap dispenser, a mirror, an ash tray and a waste bin. On the other side there is the toilet itself, a water tap with mug, a handhold, the toilet <b>paper</b> <b>holder</b> and the sensor button for the toilet flush. The window in the toilet can be opened in the upper half. The toilet doors are of folding type to use the available space to an optimum.|$|E

40|$|Establishing {{a strong}} {{link between the}} paper medium and the data {{represented}} on {{it is an interesting}} alternative to defeat unauthorised copy and content modification attempts. Many applications would benefit from it, such as show tickets, contracts, banknotes or medical prescripts. In this study, the authors present a low-cost solution that establishes such a link by combining digital signatures, physically unclonable functions and fuzzy extractors. The proposed protocol provides two levels of security that can be used according to the time available for verifying the signature and the trust in the <b>paper</b> <b>holder.</b> In practice, this solution uses ultra-violet fibres that are poured into the paper mixture. Fuzzy extractors are then used to build identifiers for each sheet of paper and a digital signature is applied to the combination of these identifiers and the data to be protected from copy and modification. The authors additionally provide a careful statistical analysis of the robustness and amount of randomness reached by the extractors. The authors conclude that identifiers of 72 bits can be derived, which is assumed to be sufficient for the proposed application. However, more randomness, robustness and unclonability could be obtained at the cost of a more expensive process, keeping exactly the same methodology. Anglai...|$|E
40|$|In {{attempt to}} {{influence}} how {{a product is}} experienced, designers can manipulate all aspects of a product, including odor. The effect odor has on a consumer’s experience of the product is still not yet understood. Two experiments were conducted in order to shed more light on the influence odor has on consumers. In Experiment 1, differences in people’s reactions to congruent and incongruent odors for products that normally have an odor (e. g., lemons) and for products that normally {{do not have an}} odor (e. g., kitchen <b>paper</b> <b>holder)</b> were investigated. All scented products were found to be surprising, and were evaluated moderately positively. In Experiment 2, the effects of the degree of inappropriateness of odors on the evaluations of products that normally do not have an odor were investigated. Although ratings for degree of fit obtained in a pre-study showed that our manipulations were successful, no significant effects were found for the degree of inappropriateness on overall product evaluations in the main study. This may stem from the fact that because scent is a relatively unimportant attribute for the products used in our experiment, its contribution to the overall evaluation is difficult to measure on rating scales. However, participants ’ comments suggest that odors do play a role in their evaluations. Therefore, this investigation sets forth that product designers should not ignore the potential effects of odors...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} fast and {{accurate}} acquiring of large 3 D spatial data {{is the main}} benefit for consideration of a terrestrial laser scanner in deformation monitoring. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discuss this technique with support of practical experiments performed inside a laboratory. It also includes measuring changes from millimetre to sub millimetre level and a comparison of measurements from a terrestrial laser scanner with measurements of other instruments. Various areas of applications are reviewed. The report discusses a surface modeling method to estimate deformation parameters of objects, such as planar, spherical and cylindrical surface representations. Illustrative numerical examples are performed by simulating randomly generated sample point coordinates for estimation of changes of modeled planar and cylindrical surfaces. The practical experiments were performed using a scan of a carton box, a ball and a rounded <b>paper</b> <b>holder,</b> which correspond to the planar, spherical and cylindrical surfaces, respectively. Independent measurements were performed using a total station and a measuring tape to make a comparison with the scanner measurements. A statistical test was performed independently for the changes obtained from each type of modeled surface in order to check whether the movement is real or due to measurement noises.  A significant change of the normal of a plane was detected between epochs, and similar results were obtained from both scanner and total station measurements. The normal of the plane was rotated by  between scan epochs. A translation of 3. 2 and 3. 7 millimetres were detected between scan epochs for the center of the sphere and axis of the cylinder, respectively. Only the scanner data was used in this case. From the scanner measurement changes in radii of the sphere and the cylinder were obtained as 1. 6 and 3. 1 millimetres, respectively between scan epochs. The measurement of the scanner was verified by performing independent measurements using measuring tape. And hence the change in radii of the sphere and the cylinder were obtained as 2. 5 and 4 millimetres, respectively. ...|$|E

Accordingly, the strong duality between them is revealed by duality theorems. Following that, shakedown analysis is performed by the primal-dual algorithm provided by the computing tool MATLAB.
