The characteristic length associated with this form of distribution was found to be the period of the distribution. This work showed that while a capacitance distribution causes frequency dispersion, this effect is seen only at frequencies that are much higher than those associated with the disk-geometry-induced frequency dispersion.

A coherent notation is proposed for local and global impedance which accounts for global, local, local interfacial, and both global and local ohmic impedances. The local and ohmic impedances are shown to provide insight into the frequency dispersion associated with the geometry of disk electrodes. The high-frequency global impedance response has the appearance of a constant-phase element CPE but can be considered to be only an apparent CPE because the CPE exponent is a function of frequency...|$|R

The characteristic length associated with roughness was found to depend on the width or period of the roughness as well as the roughness factor. The characteristic dimension associated with a rough disk was shown to be the disk radius multiplied by the roughness factor. This work shows that for small roughness factors, while roughness causes frequency dispersion, the frequency dispersion is seen only at frequencies that are much higher than those associated with the disk geometry.

Previous disk observations have focused mainly on the outer disk, which is cleared inward of similar to 50 au. The planet candidates, on the other hand, reside at orbital radii around 15 au, where disk observations have been unreliable until recently. Here, we present new J-band imaging polarimetry of LkCa 15 with SPHERE IRDIS, yielding the most accurate and detailed scattered-light images of the disk to date down to the planet-hosting inner regions. We find what appear to be persistent asymmetric structures in the scattering material at the location of the planet candidates, which could be responsible at least for parts of the signals measured with sparse-aperture masking. These images further allow us to trace the gap edge in scattered light at all position angles and search the inner and outer disks for morphological substructure. The outer disk appears smooth with slight azimuthal variations in polarized surface brightness, which may be due to shadowing from the inner disk or a two-peaked polarized phase function. We find that the near-side gap edge revealed by polarimetry matches the sharp crescent seen in previous ADI imaging very well.

40|$|We present H-band {{observations}} of β Pic with the Gemini Planet Imager's (GPI's) polarimetry mode that reveal the debris disk between 0. 3 " (6 AU) and 1. 7 " (33 AU), while simultaneously detecting β Pic b. The <b>polarized</b> <b>disk</b> image was fit with a dust density model {{combined with a}} Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase function. The best fit model indicates a disk inclined {{to the line of}} sight (ϕ= 85. 27 ^+ 0. 26 _- 0. 19) with a position angle θ_PA= 30. 35 ^+ 0. 29 _- 0. 28 (slightly offset from the main outer disk, θ_PA≈ 29), that extends from an inner disk radius of 23. 6 ^+ 0. 9 _- 0. 6 AU to well outside GPI's field of view. In addition, we present an updated orbit for β Pic b based on new astrometric measurements taken in GPI's spectroscopic mode spanning 14 months. The planet has a semi-major axis of a= 9. 2 ^+ 1. 5 _- 0. 4 AU, with an eccentricity e≤ 0. 26. The position angle of the ascending node is Ω= 31. 75 ± 0. 15, offset from both the outer main disk and the inner disk seen in the GPI image. The orbital fit constrains the stellar mass of β Pic to 1. 60 ± 0. 05 M_. Dynamical sculpting by β Pic b cannot easily account for the following three aspects of the inferred disk properties: 1) the modeled inner radius of the disk is farther out than expected if caused by β Pic b; 2) the mutual inclination of the inner disk and β Pic b is 4, when it is expected to be closer to zero; and 3) the aspect ratio of the disk (h_ 0 = 0. 137 ^+ 0. 005 _- 0. 006) is larger than expected from interactions with β Pic b or self-stirring by the disk's parent bodies...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{electrochemical}} microscopy (SECM) in surface generation/tip collection mode is investigated as {{an assessment}} tool {{for studying the}} corrosion behaviour of magnesium in simulated biological fluid. The technique provides a local map of hydrogen (H 2) evolution which alone {{can be used as}} a direct measure of corrosion. The H 2 generated during corrosion of magnesium is oxidized at the probe(i. e. a Pt ultra micro-electrode);with the magnitude of the current generated due to oxidation being indicative of the intensity of H 2 evolution at a local scale on the magnesium surface. This method was calibrated using a cathodically <b>polarized</b> Pt <b>disk</b> to simulate H 2 evolution in a controlled condition on a homogeneous surface. Potential interference from dissolving Mg or high local pH was also investigated. The technique was implemented for studying H 2 evolution at the surface of AZ 31 as a model Mg alloy.

The solutions are obtained using a time domain Green's function method {{that leads to}} an exact analytical recursive procedure which is applicable {{for a wide variety}} of boundary conditions including nonlinear cases. A nonlinear damper boundary condition is considered in more detail. The corresponding nonlinear relationship between stresses and velocities at a current time moment is used in the recursive procedure. In addition to the exact recursive procedure that is effective for calculations, some new practically important explicit exact solutions are presented. Several examples of the time behavior of the output electric potential difference are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed exact approach. Comment: Published: April 30, 201...|$|R
40|$|We present H-band polarimetric {{imagery of}} UX Tau A taken with HiCIAO/AO 188 on the Subaru Telescope. UX Tau A has been {{classified}} as a pre-transitional disk object, with a gap structure separating its inner and outer disks. Our imagery taken with the 0. 15 " (21 AU) radius coronagraphic mask has revealed a strongly <b>polarized</b> circumstellar <b>disk</b> surrounding UX Tau A which extends to 120 AU, at a spatial resolution of 0. 1 " (14 AU). It is inclined by 46 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees as the west side is nearest. Although SED modeling and sub-millimeter imagery suggested {{the presence of a}} gap in the disk, with the inner edge of the outer disk estimated to be located at 25 - 30 AU, we detect no evidence of a gap at the limit of our inner working angle (23 AU) at the near-infrared wavelength. We attribute the observed strong polarization (up to 66 %) to light scattering by dust grains in the disk. However, neither polarization models of the circumstellar disk based on Rayleigh scattering nor Mie scattering approximations were consistent with the observed azimuthal profile of the polarization degrees of the disk. Instead, a geometric optics model of the disk with nonspherical grains with the radii of 30 micrometers is consistent with the observed profile. We suggest that the dust grains have experienced frequent collisional coagulations and have grown in the circumstellar disk of UX Tau A...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new method of {{analysis}} for determining the surface geometry of five protoplan-etary disks observed with near-infrared imaging polarimetry using Subaru-HiCIAO. Using as inputs the observed distribution of <b>polarized</b> intensity (PI), <b>disk</b> inclination, assumed properties for dust scattering, and other reasonable approximations, we calculate a differential equation to derive the surface geometry. This equation is numerically integrated along {{the distance from the}} star at a given position angle. We show that, using these approximations, the local maxima in the PI distribution of spiral arms (SAO 206462, MWC 758) and rings (2 MASS J 16042165 – 2130284, PDS 70) are associated with local concave-up structures on the disk surface. We also show that the observed presence of an inner gap in scattered light still allows the possibility of a disk surface that is parallel to the light path from the star, or a disk that is shadowed by structures in the inner radii. Our analysis for rings does not show the presence of a vertical inner wall as often assumed in studies of disks with an inner gap. Finally, we summarize the implications of spira...|$|R
40|$|Whether BP Piscium (BP Psc) {{is either}} a pre-main {{sequence}} T Tauri star at d ~ 80 pc, or a post-main sequence G giant at d ~ 300 pc is still not clear. As a first-ascent giant, {{it is the first}} to be observed with a molecular and dust disk. Alternatively, BP Psc would be among the nearest T Tauri stars with a protoplanetary disk (PPD). We investigate whether the disk geometry resembles typical PPDs, by comparing polarimetric images with radiative transfer models. Our VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations allow us to perform Polarimetric Differential Imaging; Reference Star Differential Imaging; and Richardson-Lucy deconvolution. We present the first visible light polarization and intensity images of the disk of BP Psc. Our deconvolution confirms the disk shape as detected before, mainly showing the southern side of the <b>disk.</b> In <b>polarized</b> intensity the <b>disk</b> is imaged at larger detail and also shows the northern side, giving it the typical shape of high inclination flared disks. We explain the observed disk features by retrieving the large-scale geometry with MCMax radiative transfer modeling, which yields a strongly flared model, atypical for disks of T Tauri stars.

We describe the design, data re-duction methods, and performance of polarimetry with GPI. Point spread function subtraction via differential polarimetry suppresses unpolarized starlight {{by a factor of}} over 100, and provides sensi-tivity to circumstellar dust reaching the photon noise limit for these observations. In the case of the circumstellar disk around HR 4796 A, GPI’s advanced adaptive optics system reveals the disk clearly even prior to PSF subtraction. In <b>polarized</b> light, the <b>disk</b> is seen all the way in to its semi-minor axis for the first time.

Forward scattering by relatively large silicate dust particles leads to the strong polarized intensity on the west side, and the ring must b...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} of 850 gm sub-mm polarization from T-Tauri disks {{open up the}} possibility of studying the magnetic eld structure within protostellar disks. The degree of polarization is around 3 % and the direction of polarization is perpendicular to the disk. Since thermal emission from dust grains dominates the spectral energy distribution at sub-mm/far-infrared (FIR) wavelengths, dust grains {{are thought to be}} the cause of the polarization. We discuss grain alignment by radiation and we explore the efficiency of dust alignment in T-Tauri disks. The calculations show that dust grains located far away from the central proto-star are more efficiently aligned. In the presence of a regular magnetic eld, the aligned grains produce polarized emission in sub-mm/FIR wavelengths. The direction of polarization is perpendicular to the local magnetic eld direction. When we use a recent T-Tauri disk model and take a Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck-type distribution with maximum grain size of 500 { 1000 -m, the degree of polarization is around 2 { 3 % level at wavelengths larger than - 100 gm.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a large displacement, piezoceramic and metal composite-based actuator, named drum piezoceramic-actuator. The drum actuator {{consists of a}} short, thick-walled steel cylinder sandwiched by two thin composite disks, which are fabricated from a brass disk bonded with one piezoceramic disk. The piezoceramic <b>disk</b> <b>polarized</b> in its thickness direction is of a large diameter to thickness ratio, thus, produces a large radial displacement under an applied voltage in the thickness direction, and consequently results in a large transverse deflection of the composite disks in the drum. Some original results are obtained in the drums with the geometrical changes in the short, thick-walled steel cylinder. The drum (outer diameter: 12. 0 mm) demonstrates displacement output 7 times as large {{as that of a}} cymbal actuator with the same ceramic material and comparable dimensions under the same DC driving voltage of 78 V. The effective piezoelectric charge coefficient d 33 of the drum is measured and is about 3 times as large as that reported for the cymbal. The drums also showed first resonance frequency of the transducer from 15. 68 to 32. 57 kHz and faster response time of about tens microseconds which are mainly based on the dimensions of the short, thick-walled steel cylinder.

40|$|The {{structure}} of magnetic fields within protostellar disks may be studied via polarimetry provided that grains are aligned {{in respect to}} magnetic field within the disks. We explore alignment of dust grains by radiative torque in T Tauri disks and provide predictions for <b>polarized</b> emission for <b>disks</b> viewed at different wavelengths and viewing angles. We show that the alignment is especially efficient in outer part of the disks. In the presence of magnetic field, these aligned grains produce polarized emission in infrared wavelengths. We consider a simple model of an accretion disk and provide predictions for polarization that {{should be available to}} both instruments that do not resolve the disks and future instruments that will resolve the disks. As the surface magnetic field and the bulk magnetic field play different roles for the disk dynamics, we consider separately the contributions that arises from the surface areas of the disk and its interior. We find that the polarized emission drops for wavelengths shorter than ∼ 10 µm. Between ∼ 10 µm and ∼ 100 µm, the polarized emission is dominated by the emission from the surface layer of the disks and the degree of polarization can be as large as ∼ 10 % for unresolved disks. We find that the degree of polarization at these wavelengths is very sensitive to the size distribution of dust grains in disk surface layer, which should allow testin...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} dynamic {{processes}} that drive {{the evolution of}} planet-forming disks is fundamental to understand the origin and diversity of planetary systems. This requires observations at high spatial resolution and sensitivity, which nowadays typically reveal intriguing disk substructures including gaps, rings, spirals, and shadows. This thesis investigates the capability of polarization observations at multiple wavelengths to trace the earliest stages of planet formation. In-depth radiative transfer calculations are carried out in order to link numerical simulations of dust and gas evolution in disks with their observational indicators. This approach demonstrates that measuring polarization is a powerful tool to identify the shaping effects that possible embedded planets have on the density distribution of different dust grain sizes. On the observational part, this work presents several case studies of individual planet-forming disks that were observed with polarimetric imaging by the VLT/SPHERE instrument and subsequently modeled to quantify their structure. A particular focus is the characterization of spiral and ring/gap structures {{in the context of}} dust growth, planet-disk interactions, and dust dynamics near ice lines. Furthermore, a modeling study of marginally gravitationally unstable disks is presented to study the influence of the disk self-gravity on the shape and contrast of planet-induced spiral arms in scattered light images. Additionally, it is demonstrated that <b>polarized</b> emission of <b>disks</b> at millimeter wavelengths can be caused by self-scattered thermal dust emission. It is shown that the latter is a viable method to constrain grain properties and identify dust concentrations of different origin.
