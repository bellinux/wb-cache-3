After being picked, the materials are dried, cleaned, split, soaked, and dyed. Sometimes the materials are also boiled over a fire and set in the sun to dry.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture is {{the most}} {{essential}} and profitable industry in the Matupi Township, employing more than 90% of the population. The usual crops include rice, wheat, corn, millet, pulses, oilseeds, coffee, oranges, damson, potatoes, and natural fibers. However, Matupi still depends on the import of rice supplies from the lowlands. Although the primary occupation is agriculture, it is not well developed due to the scarcity of large valleys and plains. Shifting cultivation is still prevalent. Terraced cultivation is slowly being introduced along the hillsides. Due to difficult terrain human labor is the main driving force of work done. Teak and other hardwoods are found at elevation below 900 meters. Above 900 meters there are oaks and <b>pines.</b> Teak, <b>pines,</b> <b>canes,</b> resin and turpentine are important forest products. Since electricity is not available in most villages people depend on the wood for cooking. Forestry is also an imperative resource of income.|$|R

40|$|Sugarcane {{has been}} {{produced}} as a sole crop {{for at least}} 30 years in the Midlands area of KwaZulu-Natal and for more than 75 years on the coast. On poor soils a yield decline or plateau has been observed, despite the release of new sugarcane varieties with increased yield potential. Soil surveys conducted in the sugar industry have shown a steady deterioration of soil chemical, physical and biological properties as the period under sugarcane cultivation has increased. Proactive growers have used a range of organic amendments to improve and sustain soil quality, including filtercake, flyash, <b>pine</b> bark, <b>cane</b> trash, poultry and cattle manures, and the incorporation of a fallow crop (green manuring,). A survey conducted in 2001 to determine the efficacy of these amendments, in particular on the biological properties of soils, found that filtercake and green manuring had the greatest effect on improved soil biological properties, as indicated by microbial biomass carbon and metabolic quotient...|$|R

2500|$|In 1995, Foley went to Japan and {{wrestled}} in International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan), {{where he}} engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki.

Funk returned to {{team up with}} Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus with a Singapore <b>cane</b> forty-six times. <b>Cactus</b> Jack then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he fought Sandman for the ECW championship. During the match, Cactus Jack knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} an ecofriendly solution to treat automobile service stations effluents with {{high concentrations of}} oily substances, surfactants, organic matter and heavy metals. Bioadsorption using sawdust from <b>pine</b> trees, sugar <b>cane</b> bagasse and coconut coir without any chemical modification removed colloidal contamination up to 70 %. Polyaluminium chloride, ferric chloride and polyacrylamide were applied to remove dissolved and colloidal pollutants under saline conditions without change of initial pH. Both bioadsorption and coagulation-flocculation removed up to 97. 8 % of BOD, COD, surfactants and heavy metals at a saline concentration of 1. 5 % NaCl. The increase of ionic strength promoted a high sludge index and a representative cost saving in chemicals consumption of almost 70 %.

We {{know that the}} neighbourhood of the Isle of Sheppey, {{at the mouth of the}} Thames, was covered with rich tropic vegetation; with screw <b>pines</b> and acacias, <b>canes</b> and gourds, tenanted by opossums, bats, and vultures: that huge snakes twined themselves along the ground, tortoises dived in the pools, and crocodiles basked on the muds, while the neighbouring seas swarmed with sharks as huge and terrible as those of a West Indian shore.|$|R
40|$|Las coberturas evaluadas fueron Aserrín de pino semidescompuesto, Bagazo de caña seco y Casulla de arroz semiquemada, plástico negro, plástico gris y un testigo relativo incorporando trifluralina presiembra, aporcando y controlando malezas manualmente.

La mayor incidencia de malezas se dio en las coberturas orgánicas, e influyó en un menor rendimiento de frutos. Las coberturas plásticas mostraron la mayor rentabilidad. Three organic mulches were evaluated: <b>pine</b> sawdust, sugar <b>cane</b> dry-bagasse, rice chaff, {{along with}} two plastic coverings: Black plastic, gray plastic and a relative control. Trifluralin was applied in pre-sowing. Hilling was applied 15 days-after treatment and weeds were controlled manually 50 days-after treatment. Seedings from Peto 98 were obtained from a greenhouse. A completely randomized block design with four repetitions was used. The higher incidence of weeds was found when using organic mulches this affected the yields of fruits. The higher return was obtained with the plastic coverings...|$|R
