The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth's legislative powers {{for the purposes of}} post-war reconstruction. The widening of powers would sunset after five years. One of the measures in the package was to extend Section116 so that it prohibited the states, not merely the Commonwealth, from making the laws proscribed by the section. The package's 14 measureswhich included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for [...] "national health"were bound together in a single question. H. V. Evatt, the Labor Attorney-General, argued that freedom of religion was [...] "fundamental to the whole idea of democracy" [...] and that the suppression of civil rights by dictatorships in Europe demonstrated the need for Australia to have a strong Constitutional guarantee of the freedom. The conservative Coalition, then in opposition and led by Robert Menzies, campaigned against the package. Arthur Fadden, leader of the Country Party (the junior member of the Coalition), claimed a [...] "yes" [...] vote would permit the government to implement a [...] "policy of socialisation". The package was rejected: the national [...] "yes" [...] vote was less than 46 per cent, and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia. One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question: voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed, giving them reason to vote against the entire package.|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency <b>of</b> an extended <b>package</b> <b>of</b> preventive <b>measures</b> on the incidence of nosocomial respiratory infections in surgical patients at an intensive care unit (ICU). Subjects and methods. The study included 809 patients aged 35 to 80 years. A study group comprised 494 patients in whom an extended <b>package</b> <b>of</b> preventive <b>measures</b> was implemented during 7 months (March-September). A control group consisted of 315 patients treated in 2004 {{in the same period}} of time (March-September). The groups were stratified by age, gender, underlying diseases, and APACHE- 2 and SOFA scores. The extended <b>package</b> <b>of</b> anti-infectious <b>measures</b> involved a high air purification in ICUs («Flow-M» technology), routine use of ventilatory filters, closed aspiration systems with a built-in antibacterial filter under artificial ventilation for over 2 days. Results. The proposed technologies could reduce the frequency of tracheobronchitis and ventilator-associated pneumonias in the groups of patients at high risk for nosocomial infections substantially (by more than twice). Conclusion. The findings have led {{to the conclusion that the}} extended <b>package</b> <b>of</b> preventive <b>measures</b> is effective in preventing respiratory infections in ICU patients. Of special note is the proper prevention of upper airway contamination with pathogenic microorganisms, by employing the closed aspiration systems with a built-in antibacterial filter. The routine use of high-tech consumables in the intensive care of surgical patients causes a considerable decrease in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and purulent tracheobronchitis and a reduction in the number of microbiological studies.
