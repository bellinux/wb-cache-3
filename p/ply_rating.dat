40|$|This {{investigation}} was performed {{during the summer}} and autumn in 1984. The purpose was to investigate factors on low profile implement tyres affecting the coefficient of rolling resistance. The following factors were studied: - inflation pressure - width - diameter - construction - <b>ply</b> <b>rating</b> - aspect ratio - tread pattern Tests wars performed on concrete, harrowed fields, ploughed fields and stubble. Important factors when reducing the CRR when driving on concrete are: - increase the diameter and width - higher <b>ply</b> <b>rating</b> - decrease in aspect ratio - less aggressive tread pattern - choice of particular constructions (Garden Tractor or Steel Belt). The most important factor in reducing rolling resistance on soft ground is to ensure that the tyre size is adequate to carry the vertical load at as low inflation pressure as possible. A big soft tyre with low inflation pressure giving no or little sinkage is desirable. Choice of aggressive tread patterns will lead to an increase in rolling resistance because of the energy losses produced by the high compaction under the lugs. The relation between diameter and width must be large enough to ensure no or a minimum of bulldozing resistance. Reducing rolling resistance will lead to a number of advantages. The low inflation pressures will cause a decrease in soil compaction, and there will be an increase in yields. Lower railing resistance will also result in savings in fuel and time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The vertical, {{longitudinal}} {{and lateral}} dynamic behaviour of road vehicles is largely inu-enced by the dynamic characteristics of tyres. The tyre characteristics have been modelled by research-ers as {{functions of the}} tyre elastic properties which are characterized by tyre vertical, lateral, longitudinal and torsional stiVnesses. Design details of an experimental rig for measurement of tyre static stiVnesses are presented, and experimental data on these stiVness values {{in the form of}} a power law as functions of tyre size, <b>ply</b> <b>rating,</b> normal load and ination pressure are reported. Using tyre models, the tyre force and moment characteristics necessary for vertical dynamic simulation can be predicted...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} feasibility of determining the mechanical properties of aircraft tires from small-scale model tires was accomplished. The theoretical {{results indicate that the}} macroscopic static and dynamic mechanical properties of aircraft tires can be accurately determined from the scale model tires although the microscopic and thermal properties of aircraft tires can not. The experimental investigation was conducted on a scale model of a 40 x 12, 14 <b>ply</b> <b>rated,</b> type 7 aircraft tire with a scaling factor of 8. 65. The experimental results indicate that the scale model tire exhibited the same static mechanical properties as the prototype tire when compared on a dimensionless basis. The structural modeling concept discussed in this report is believed to be exact for mechanical properties of aircraft tires under static, rolling, and transient conditions...|$|R

40|$|Introducing loads {{onto the}} soil via {{pneumatic}} tyred equipment {{is the major}} cause of compaction of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The degree of soil compaction is largely influenced by the loads applied to the soil and resulting surface and subsurface pressure. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} in order to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic agricultural tyres on a hard surface and in the soil profile. As a result of this, it has been possible to evaluate the influence of tyre inflation pressure, load, <b>ply</b> <b>rating</b> and tread pattern on the resulting pressure. Also, the carcass stiffness of the tyres studied was determined and alternative methods to predict the carcass stiffness were evaluated and an improved technique was developed. Cont/d.

40|$|Various {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on a 49 x 17 / 26 PR aircraft tire that had been designed as a lightweight tire for use on the C- 5 A military transport. This tire is approximately 25 per cent lighter than a tire {{of the same size}} and <b>ply</b> <b>rating</b> that would be used in commercial airline service. The tires were tested at 40 per cent, 37 per cent, and 35 per cent deflections. These deflections were obtained by adjusting the inflation pressure while the load on the tire remained constant at 60, 000 pounds. It was determined that the tire would operate successfully under the test conditions at 35 % deflection. Prior to testing, the tires were subjected to conditions of high vacuum and low temperature. It was determined that the tires were not adversely affected by these conditions...|$|E

Both deflection and contact area varied linearly with inflation pressure {{in the range of}} normal loads selected for the study. The empirical equations were developed to predict the deflection and contact area of the tyre. Further, the power tiller tyre considered for the study followed the modified universal characteristics of a tyre. However, both empirical equations and universal characteristics equation of tyres could be used to predict tyre behaviour under various operational parameters...|$|E

40|$|A {{method used}} to measure the radial {{suspension}} properties of agricultural tractor tyres is described. The stiffness and damping of a range of tyres have been measured. The effects on tyre stiffness and damping coefficient of rolling speed, inflation pressure, load, amplitude, frequency of vibration, driving torque, surface type, tyre size, <b>ply</b> <b>rating,</b> construction, wear and age are reported. A relationship is developed which enables the stiffness of a rolling tyre to be estimated from the tyre size, age and inflation pressure. It is shown that this is a more accurate estimate of rolling tyre stiffness than measurement of the stiffness of a stationary tyre. The measured tyre characteristics are used to predict the vibration of a single degree of freedom system and of a four wheel tractor. Significant improvements in accuracy are found when the results are compared with those obtained using stationary tyre characteristics. The frequencies of the natural pitch and vertical modes of vibration are usually predicted to within ± 10 %. Predictions of rms acceleration levels are less accurate. Further improvements in modelling accuracy should be achieved by more accurate measurement and modelling of the suspension characteristics of the drive wheels in the longitudinal direction...|$|E
