5|$|Factors {{indicating}} infection include {{movement of}} fluid in the tissues during <b>palpation</b> (fluctuance), {{swollen lymph nodes}} in the neck, and fever with an oral temperature more than 37.7°C.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including <b>palpation</b> thyroiditis.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} clinical {{consequences of the}} presence of an axillary arch including confusing the identification and <b>palpation</b> of enlarged or tumorous lymph nodes, the trapping of axillary structures including the axillary nerve and the axillary vein and causing potential problems in axillary surgery or breast reconstruction. There have also been reported instances of the axillary arch being involved in the development of deep vein thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to <b>palpation</b> over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to <b>palpation</b> along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (<b>palpation)</b> and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, <b>palpation</b> and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and <b>palpation</b> of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Palpation</b> which {{includes}} feeling {{the body for}} tender A-shi points, and the <b>palpation</b> of the wrist pulses as well as various other pulses, and <b>palpation</b> of the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|In TCM, {{there are}} five {{diagnostic}} methods: inspection, auscultation, olfaction, inquiry, and <b>palpation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Liver may be pulsatile, and the RUQ may be {{tender to}} <b>palpation.</b> Ascites {{may be present}} in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination is {{the examination of}} the patient for medical signs of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable. The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of {{physical examination}}: inspection, <b>palpation</b> (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and <b>palpation</b> for abdominal assessments.|$|E
25|$|With <b>palpation,</b> the {{veterinarian}} or breeder manually feels {{inside the}} llama {{to detect a}} pregnancy. Some risks to the llama exist, {{but it can be}} an accurate method for pregnancy detection.|$|E
25|$|Examination of the vulva {{is part of}} the {{gynecologic}} {{evaluation and}} should include a thorough inspection of the perineum, including areas around the clitoris and urethra, and <b>palpation</b> of the Bartholin's glands.|$|E
25|$|The {{normal human}} spleen {{measures}} about 125 millimeters in length, and splenomegaly {{is an important}} clinical sign. There are 2 possibilities to evaluate splenomegaly in the clinical examination: percussion and <b>palpation.</b> Percussion {{can be done in}} this space.|$|E
25|$|Interoceptive {{exposure}} is sometimes used for panic disorder. People's interoceptive triggers of anxiety are evaluated one-by-one before conducting interoceptive exposures, such as addressing <b>palpation</b> sensitivity via light exercise. Though {{this practice is}} used in 12-20% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Psoas can be palpated {{with active}} flexion of the hip. A {{positive}} psoas contracture test and pain with <b>palpation</b> {{reported by the}} patient indicate clinical significance. Care should be taken around the abdominal organs, especially the colon when palpating deeply.|$|E
25|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} staged by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, {{which is based}} on {{clinical}} examination, rather than surgical findings. It allows only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: <b>palpation,</b> inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), <b>palpation</b> (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. <b>Palpation</b> can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E
25|$|External {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} are constipation of very long duration, abdominal bloating, abdominal tenderness and tympany, abdominal pain, <b>palpation</b> of hard fecal masses and, in toxic megacolon, fever, low blood potassium, tachycardia and shock. Stercoral ulcers are sometimes observed in chronic megacolon, which may lead to perforation of the intestinal wall in approximately 3% of the cases, leading to sepsis and risk of death.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} risk of {{recurrence}} and ensuing problems, close monitoring of dogs undergoing chemotherapy is important. The {{same is true for}} dogs that have entered remission and ceased treatment. Monitoring for disease and remission/recurrence is usually performed by <b>palpation</b> of peripheral lymph nodes. This procedure detects gross changes in peripheral lymph nodes. Some of the blood tests used in diagnosing lymphoma also offer greater objectivity and provide an earlier warning of an animal coming out of remission.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{factors that}} {{influence}} a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not include: cost of the test, availability of additional tests, potential interference with subsequent test (such as an abdominal <b>palpation</b> potentially inducing intestinal activity whose sounds interfere with a subsequent abdominal auscultation), time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful {{for the establishment of}} statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} taken to {{diagnose}} this condition are {{consideration of the}} signs and symptoms, and a medical history (the detailed medical review of past health state) to evaluate any risk factors. Based on the symptoms presented, a range of biochemical tests (using blood and/or urine samples) may also be considered {{as part of the}} screening process to provide sufficient quantitative analysis of any differences in electrolytes, renal and liver function, and blood clotting times. Upon physical examination, <b>palpation</b> of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or an organ enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Genital {{reconstructive}} surgery was pioneered between 1930 and 1960 by urologist Hugh Hampton Young and other surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore {{and other major}} university centers. Understanding of intersex conditions was relatively primitive, based on identifying the type of gonad(s) by <b>palpation</b> or by surgery. Since ability to determine even the type of gonads in infancy was limited, sex of assignment and rearing were determined mainly {{by the appearance of}} the external genitalia. Most of Young's intersex patients were adults seeking his help with physical problems of genital function.|$|E
25|$|The {{radial artery}} {{is the easiest}} to use to check the heart rate. However, in {{emergency}} situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are carotid arteries. This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is {{not strong enough to}} be detected by <b>palpation</b> on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.|$|E
25|$|The major {{bones of}} the leg are the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and {{adjacent}} fibula, and these are all long bones. The patella (kneecap) is the sesamoid bone {{in front of the}} knee. Most of the leg skeleton has bony prominences and margins that can be palpated and some serve as anatomical landmarks that define the extent of the leg. These landmarks are the anterior superior iliac spine, the greater trochanter, the superior margin of the medial condyle of tibia, and the medial malleolus. Notable exceptions to <b>palpation</b> are the hip joint, and the neck and body, or shaft of the femur.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{the lower}} {{extremities}} begins with a visual inspection. Color, presence of hair, visible veins, size and any sores or ulcerations are noted. Lack of hair may indicate an arterial circulation problem. Given swelling, the calf circumference is measured for reference as time continues. Elevating the legs may reduce or eliminate the swelling. <b>Palpation</b> of the ankle can determine the degree of swelling. Assessment includes {{a check of the}} popliteal, femoral, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses. The inguinal nodes may be enlarged. Enlargement of the nodes lasting more than three weeks may indicate infection or some other disease process requiring further medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Some {{children}} {{may have a}} slightly raised temperature; high fever and general malaise point to other, more serious conditions. On clinical examination, the child typically holds the hip slightly bent, turned outwards {{and away from the}} middle line (flexion, external rotation and abduction). Active and passive movements may be limited because of pain, especially abduction and internal rotation. The hip can be tender to <b>palpation.</b> The log roll test involves gently rotating the entire lower limb inwards and outwards with the patient on his back, to check when muscle guarding occurs. The unaffected hip and the knees, ankles, feet and spine are found to be normal.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} the appropriate location for injection of local anesthetic, which is typically lateral to (outside) the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and above the clavicle, with the first rib generally considered to represent the limit below which the needle must not be directed (the pleural cavity and uppermost part of the lung are located at this level). <b>Palpation</b> or ultrasound visualization of the subclavian artery just above the clavicle provides a useful anatomic landmark for locating the brachial plexus, which is lateral to the artery at this level. Proximity to the brachial plexus can be determined using by elicitation of a paresthesia, use of a peripheral nerve stimulator, or ultrasound guidance.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by rectal <b>palpation.</b> Treatment {{includes}} fluid therapy and analgesics, but surgery is indicated {{if there is}} severe distention of the cecum or if medical therapy does not improve the situation. Surgery includes typhlotomy, and although cecal bypass has been performed {{in the past to}} prevent reoccurrence, a recent study suggests it is not necessary. Surgery has a good prognosis, although rupture can occur during surgical manipulation. The cause of cecal impactions are not known. Cecal impassion should be differentiated from large colon impaction via rectal, since cecal impaction has a high risk of rupture even before developing severe pain. Overall prognosis is 90%, regardless of medical or surgical treatment, but rupture does occur, often with no warning.|$|E
25|$|Tactile imaging is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} that translates the sense of touch into a digital image. The tactile image {{is a function of}} P(x,y,z), where P is the pressure on soft tissue surface under applied deformation and x,y,z are coordinates where pressure P was measured. Tactile imaging closely mimics manual <b>palpation,</b> since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination, slightly deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern. Figure on the right presents an experiment on a composite tissue phantom examined by a tactile imaging probe illustrating the ability of tactile imaging to visualize in 3D the structure of the object.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine fibroid versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may {{be mistaken for a}} fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While <b>palpation</b> used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Spit testing with {{an intact}} male is {{generally}} free {{and is usually}} accurate. However, some hormonal conditions in females can make them reject a male {{when they are in}} fact not pregnant, and, more rarely, accept a male when they are pregnant. Progesterone tests can give a high reading in some females with a hormonal problem that are in fact not pregnant. Neither of the previous methods, nor <b>palpation,</b> can give a reasonably accurate idea of the age of the fetus, while an ultrasound procedure can. In addition, an ultrasound procedure can distinguish between pregnancy and misleading physical conditions, or between a live and dead fetus. The disadvantages of an ultrasound procedure are cost, some training in the use of ultrasound equipment is required, and not all veterinarians have the equipment needed to perform the examination.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{established}} the age ranges for women seeking breast implants; for breast reconstruction, silicone-gel filled implants and saline-filled implants were approved {{for women of}} all ages; for breast augmentation, saline implants were approved for women 18 {{years of age and}} older; silicone implants were approved for women 22 years of age and older. Because each breast implant device entails different medical risks, the minimum age of the patient for saline breast implants is different from the minimum age of the patient for silicone breast implants—because of the filler leakage and silent shell-rupture risks; thus, periodic MRI screening examinations are the recommended post-operative, follow-up therapy for the patient. In other countries, in Europe and Oceania, the national health ministries' breast implant policies do not endorse periodic MRI screening of asymptomatic patients, but suggest <b>palpation</b> proper—with or without an ultrasonic screening—to be sufficient post-operative therapy for most patients.|$|E
25|$|Rectal {{examinations}} are {{a cornerstone}} of colic diagnosis, as many large intestinal conditions can be definitively diagnosed by this method alone. Due {{to the risk of}} harm to the horse, a rectal examination is performed by a veterinarian. Approximately 40% of the gastrointestinal tract can be examined by rectal <b>palpation,</b> although this can vary based {{on the size of the}} horse and the length of the examiner's arm. Structures that can be identified include the aorta, caudal pole of the left kidney, nephrosplenic ligament, caudal border of the spleen, ascending colon (left dorsal and ventral, pelvic flexure), the small intestine if distended (it is not normally palpable on rectal), the mesenteric root, the base of the cecum and the medial cecal band, and rarely the inguinal rings. The location within the colon is identified based on size, presence of sacculations, number of bands, and if fecal balls are present.|$|E
25|$|Radioiodine (radioactive iodine-131) was {{developed}} in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on <b>palpation</b> or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.|$|E
