50|$|In {{computer}} science, a readers-writer (RW) or shared-exclusive lock (also {{known as}} a multiple readers/single-writer lock or multi-reader lock, or <b>push</b> <b>lock)</b> is a synchronization primitive that solves one of the readers-writers problems. An RW lock allows concurrent access for read-only operations, while write operations require exclusive access. This means that multiple threads can read the data in parallel but an exclusive lock is needed for writing or modifying data. When a writer is writing the data, all other writers or readers will be blocked until the writer is finished writing. A common use might be to control access to a data structure in memory that cannot be updated atomically and is invalid (and should not be read by another thread) until the update is complete.|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and <b>push</b> <b>lock</b> keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A locking knob is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|E

50|$|Memory {{pages in}} working sets are trimmed more {{efficiently}} for multiprocessor systems {{depending on how}} recently they were accessed. Lock contention is reduced, {{as a number of}} unnecessary locks used in resource synchronizations (RAM allocation and mapping through Address Windowing Extensions, system page table entries, charging non-paged/paged pool quotas, charging commitment of pages) have been removed. The dispatcher lock contention has been reduced and the Page Frame Number (PFN) lock has been optimized for increased parallelism and granularity. Windows XP uses <b>push</b> <b>locks</b> on the event synchronization object if there is no contention as they support shared and exclusive acquisition. <b>Push</b> <b>locks</b> are used to protect handle table entries in the Executive, and in the Object Manager (to protect data structures and security descriptors) and Memory Manager (to protect AWE-related locks). Windows XP uses the SYSENTER/SYSEXIT mechanisms which require fewer clock cycles to transition to and from user mode to kernel mode to speed up system calls.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 Bell Canada {{decided they}} needed {{to get away from}} using keys, and had a {{requirement}} for a <b>push</b> button <b>lock.</b> Fish then promptly moved from being a distributor to a being a developer, and created the first <b>push</b> button <b>lock</b> in North America.

50|$|The Tower crown {{representing}} the bent of a striped ribbon façade {{consists of two}} big 41m span twisted steel arches with interim steel supports cantilevered from the central cylindrical RC core walls and 4 smaller arches-props supporting the white steel ribbons-stripes (tubular frames filled with perforated steel sheets). The twisted steel arches were designed and manufactured in Piedmont, Italy , and then delivered to Moscow in pieces by trucks and then finally assembled on the roof (bolted from inside). The parapet glazing surrounding roof open observation deck on Level 52 is made of cold bent (tempered triplex) glass with motorized foldable top elements for easy access of the BMU cradle over the parapet. The bespoke BMU system with three articulated arms crane and 300kg auxiliary hoist follows the complex twisting form of the façade in order to guarantee the proper access for maintenance and cleaning of the curtain wall. The special cradle {{has been designed to}} reach all the positions along the façade without physical impact on the curtain wall with support of safety straps, <b>push</b> <b>locks</b> and sockets incorporated in each curtain wall unit, special sticks and soft rubber rollers preventing any scratches or other damage from cradle contacts with fragile envelope of glass, pressure caps and soft aluminum cladding.|$|R

50|$|The MP35 was a {{blowback}} operated, selective fire SMG which {{fired from}} an open bolt. The weapon featured a non-reciprocating cocking handle placed {{at the rear of}} the receiver, which was operated in a similar fashion to bolt-action on a Mauser rifle. This involved the weapon carrier to manually pull the handle up, pull backwards, <b>push</b> forwards and <b>lock</b> back down. When the gun was then fired the cocking handle remained stationary.|$|R

After a three-hour firefight, the Iranians were <b>pushed</b> back and <b>locked</b> themselves in its fortress, while the Russian troops surrounded the town and opened their cannonfire.|$|R
50|$|The German police {{asked for}} an {{external}} safety on their MP 18s, and a universal bolt-locking safety was added on all the submachine guns used by the police. Later submachine gun designs like the Sten and the MP 40 were modified to allow the cocking handle to be <b>pushed</b> inwards to <b>lock</b> the closed bolt to the tubular receiver casing. This design change prevented accidental discharges when the bolt was left forward and a loaded magazine was inserted.|$|R
50|$|CubeSat {{integration}} {{begins with}} unpacking the CSD from the shipping container and then removing the Base Plate Assembly {{from the rear}} of the CSD. Next, the CubeSat is inserted from the rear and is slid up snug against the doors. Additional CubeSats are then inserted from the rear in the same progress. The Base Plate Assembly is then reinstalled. Four jack screws are then adjusted with the <b>Pusher</b> Plate and <b>locked.</b> The Containment Bolt is then removed, and the deployer is packed for shipment.|$|R
30|$|The {{proximal}} compression tube nail {{system has}} two distal and one proximal locking screws 5  mm in diameter.

As the central screw {{at the top of}} the compression tube system rotates, the compression tube moves downward <b>pushing</b> the proximal <b>locking</b> screw distally through the oblong hole of the nail creating a compressive force on the fracture site (Fig.  1).|$|R
50|$|The M79 {{is easy to}} operate. To load, the {{grenadier}} <b>pushes</b> {{the barrel}} <b>locking</b> latch on the receiver group to the right. Gravity will pull down the barrel, opening the action and exposing the breech. The hammer is cocked when the breech is opened. A round then may be loaded. The break action must then be closed manually. Closing the breech will cause the barrel locking latch to return to center. The safety must then be pushed to the forward position in order to ready the weapon for firing.|$|R
2500|$|Mark III (Referred to as [...] "All New War" [...] by Privateer Press) {{is another}} {{reworking}} of the game. As with MK II all models and point levels of army lists have been updated. Additionally, many legacy rules have changed, specifically {{in regards to}} targeting one's own models with power attacks and charges (no longer allowed), warjacks that begin in their controlling warcaster's control range now [...] "power up" [...] or receive a free focus point during the control phase of the game, and some power attacks such as the <b>push,</b> head <b>lock,</b> and weapon lock have been removed. Also guidelines for terrain have been changed and Privateer Press has begun the Community Integrated Development or CID process to involve players {{in the development of}} errata, new releases, and theme forces as a quality control mechanism in what they are calling a [...] "continuous development" [...] goal. The idea of this process is to avoid new version releases following Mark 3. As a result, all model cards and the base rules set are available on the Privateer Press website.|$|R
50|$|The Weatherby Mark V {{action has}} {{remained}} virtually unchanged {{from the original}} design of Fred Jennie and Roy Weatherby which {{is a testament to}} the longevity of the design. Nevertheless, some refinement to the design has occurred over time. The Mark V action is a front <b>locking,</b> <b>push</b> feed, bolt action repeater. The lug arrangement allows for 54° bolt lift. This shorter bolt lift allows for increased clearance between the bolt handle and any accessories such as scopes that may be mounted on the rifle and arguably provides for faster cycling of the action. This compares favorably with the Mauser style rifles which have a 90° bolt lift.|$|R
50|$|A {{tubular lock}} pick is a {{specialized}} lockpicking tool used for opening a tubular pin tumbler lock. Tubular lock picks {{are all very}} similar in design and come in sizes to fit all major tubular locks, including 6, 7, 8, and 10-pin locks. The tool is simply inserted into the lock and turned clockwise with medium torque. As the tool is <b>pushed</b> into the <b>lock,</b> each of the pins is slowly forced down until they stop, thus binding the driver pins behind the shear line of the lock. When the final pick is pushed down, the shear plane is clear and the lock opens. This can usually be accomplished {{in a matter of}} seconds.|$|R

50|$|First marketed in 1972, {{this was}} an all-steel variant of the PP {{chambered}} for the 9×18mm Ultra cartridge. Designed as a police service pistol, it was a blowback operated, double-action pistol with an external slide-stop lever and a firing-pin safety. A manual decocker lever was {{on the left side}} of the slide; when <b>pushed</b> down, it <b>locked</b> the firing pin and released the hammer. When the 9×19mm Parabellum was chosen as the standard service round by most of the German police forces, the experimental 9mm Ultra round fell into disuse. Only about 2,000 PP Super pistols were sold to German police forces in the 1970s, and lack of sales caused Walther to withdraw the PP Super from their catalogue in 1979.|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the output of a 2. 45 -GHz magnetron operated as a current-controlled oscillator through its <b>pushing</b> characteristic can <b>lock</b> to injection signals in times {{of the order of}} 100 - 500 ns depending on injection power, magnetron heater power, load impedance, and frequency offset of the injection frequency from the natural frequency of the magnetron. Accordingly, the magnetron can follow frequency and phase modulations of the injection signal, behaving as a narrow-band amplifier. The transmission of phase-shift-keyed data at 2 Mb/s has been achieved. Measurements of the frequency response and anode current after a switch of phase as a function of average anode current and heater power give new insight into the locking mechanisms and the noise characteristics of magnetrons...|$|R
5000|$|Considered {{as a state}} machine, the {{turnstile}} has {{two possible}} states: Locked and Unlocked. [...] There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and pushing the arm (<b>push).</b> In the <b>locked</b> state, <b>pushing</b> on the arm has no effect; {{no matter how many}} times the input push is given, it stays in the locked state. Putting a coin in - that is, giving the machine a coin input - shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a push input, shifts the state back to Locked.|$|R
25|$|The props (1 and 3) bind {{on either}} side of the hooker (2) to form the front row of the scrum. The two locks (4 and 5) bind {{together}} and push on the props and the hooker. The flankers (6 and 7) bind to the side of the scrum and the number eight (8) <b>pushes</b> on the <b>locks</b> or a lock and a flanker. Once each team has formed its half of the scrum, the two front rows are brought together under the command of the referee. The scrum-half puts the ball into the middle of the scrum and then retrieves it from under the number eight's feet if it is won. The remainder of the team must be positioned at least five metres back from the scrum.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the larger}} M-10, the M-11 has open sights with the rear pinhole sight welded to the receiver. These sights are {{for use with}} the folding stock, as using them without the stock is nearly useless because of the initial jump of the weapon due to its heavy, open-bolt design. The M-11A1 also has two safety {{features}} which are also found on the Model 10A1. The charging handle rotates to 90 degrees to lock the bolt in the forward position thus preventing the weapon from being cocked. The second safety is a slider which is <b>pushed</b> forward to <b>lock</b> the trigger, which in turn pins the bolt to the rear (cocked) position. This prevents the weapon from discharging even when dropped, which is not uncommon with an open-bolt design.|$|R
