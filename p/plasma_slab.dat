50|$|Plasmas {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} values in both {{temperature}} and density; plasma temperatures range from close to absolute zero and to well beyond 109 kelvins (for comparison, tungsten melts at 3700 kelvins), and plasma may contain less than one particle per cubic metre, or be denser than lead. Electron temperature is usually expressed as electronvolt (eV), and 1 eV is equivalent to 11,604 K. Common plasmas temperature and density in fluorescent light tubes and semiconductor manufacturing processes are around several eV and 109-12per cm3. For a wide range of parameters and frequencies, plasma is electrically conductive, and its response to low-frequency electromagnetic waves {{is similar to that of}} a metal: a plasma simply reflects incident low-frequency radiation. Low-frequency means it is lower than the characteristic electron plasma frequency. The use of plasmas to control the reflected electromagnetic radiation from an object (Plasma stealth) is feasible at suitable frequency where the conductivity of the plasma allows it to interact strongly with the incoming radio wave, and the wave can either be absorbed and converted into thermal energy, or reflected, or transmitted depending on the relationship between the radio wave frequency and the characteristic plasma frequency. If the frequency of the radio wave is lower than the plasma frequency, it is reflected. if it is higher, it transmit. If these two are equal, then resonance occurs. There are also another mechanism where reflection can be reduced. If the electromagnetic wave passes through the plasma, and is reflected by the metal, and the reflected wave and incoming wave are roughly equal in power, then they may form two phasors. When these two phasors are of opposite phase they can cancel each other out. In order to obtain substantial attenuation of radar signal, the <b>plasma</b> <b>slab</b> needs adequate thickness and density.|$|E

40|$|Two {{critical}} {{issues in the}} amplification of laser pulses by backward Raman scattering in <b>plasma</b> <b>slabs</b> are the saturation mechanism of the amplification effect (which determines the maximum attainable output intensity of a Raman amplifier) and the optimal plasma density for amplification. Previous investigations [V. M. Malkin, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 82 (22) : 4448 - 4451, 1999] identified forward Raman scattering and modulational instabilities of the amplifying seed as the likely saturation mechanisms and lead to an estimated unfocused output intensities of 10 {sup 17 }W/cm{sup 2 }. The optimal density for amplification {{is determined by the}} competing constraints of minimizing the plasma density so as to minimize the growth rate of the instabilities leading to saturation but also maintaining the plasma sufficiently dense that the driven Langmuir wave responsible for backscattering does not break prematurely.

We perform parametric studies of sausage oscillations of <b>plasma</b> <b>slabs,</b> aiming to determine the dependence of the oscillation period on its parameters, and the onset of leaky and trapped regimes of the oscillations. Methods. Slabs with smooth transverse profiles of the density of a zero-beta plasma are perturbed by an impulsive localised perturbation of the sausage symmetry. In particular, the slab can contain an infinitely thin current sheet in its centre. The initial value problem is then solved numerically. The numerical results are subject to spectral analysis. The results are compared with analytical solutions for a slab with a step-function profile and also with sausage oscillations of a plasma cylinder. Results. We established that sausage oscillations in slabs generally have the same properties as in plasma cylinders. In the trapped regime, the sausage oscillation period increases {{with the increase in}} the longitudinal wavelength. In the leaky regime, the dependence of the period on the wavelength experiences saturation, and the period becomes independent of the wavelength in the long-wavelength limit. In the leaky regime the period is always longer than in the trapped regime. The sausage oscillation period in a slab is always longer than in a cylinder with the same transverse profile. In slabs with steeper transverse profiles, sausage oscillations have longer periods. The leaky regime occurs at shorter wavelengths in slabs with smoother profiles...|$|R
40|$|In this {{manuscript}} the dispersion relations of streaming instabilities, {{by using the}} unique property (neutralized in charge and current by default) of plasma shells colliding, have been generalized and studied. This interesting property for interpenetrating beams enables one to find the general dispersion relations without any restrictions used in the previous works in this area. In our previous work [H. Mehdian et al., ApJ. 801, 89 (2015) ], employing the plasma shell concept and boost frame method, the general dispersion relation for filamentation instability has been derived in the relativistic classical regime. But in this paper, using the above mentioned concepts, the general dispersion relations (for each of streaming instabilities, filamentation, two-stream and multi-stream) in the non-relativistic quantum regime have been derived by employing the quantum fluid equations together with Maxwell equations. The derived dispersion relations enable to describe any arbitrary system of interacting two and three beams, justified neutralization condition, by choosing the inertial reference frame embedded on {{the one of the}} beams. Furthermore, by the numerical and analytical study of these dispersion relations, many new features of streaming instabilities (E. g. their cut-off wave numbers and growth rates) in terms of all involved parameters have been illustrated.

It is crucial that two evanescent waves have certain phase shift to provide non-zero energy flux through non-transparent region. The required phase shift is obtained at the exact resonance and corresponds to the absolute transparency. In a warm plasma case, the excitation of the propagating longitudinal (electrostatic) modes becomes possible.

We developed an improved clean setup that uses the collision of two <b>plasma</b> <b>slabs</b> with different density and velocity, leading {{to the development of}} two distinctive shocks and a contact discontinuity. The shock formation is mediated by Weibel-type filamentation instabilities that generate magnetic turbulence. Cyclic reformation is observed in both shocks with similar period, for which we note global variations on account of shock rippling and local variations arising from turbulent current filaments. The shock rippling occurs on spatial and temporal scales given by gyro-motions of shock-reflected ions. The drift motion of electrons and ions is not a gradient drift, but commensurates with E x B drift. We observe a stable suprathermal tail in the ion spectra, but no electron acceleration because the amplitude of Buneman modes in the shock foot is insufficient for trapping relativistic electrons. We see no evidence of turbulent reconnection. A comparison with other 2 D simulation results suggests that the plasma beta and the ion-to-electron mass ratio are not decisive for efficient electron acceleration, but pre-acceleration efficacy might be reduced with respect to the 2 D results once three-dimensional effects are fully accounted for. Other microphysical factors may also be at play to limit the amplitude of Buneman waves or prevent return of electrons to the foot region.

We conclude that when calculating the Casimir force at non-zero temperature, fluctuations inside the conductors can not be ignored. Casimir showed in 1948 [1] that the zero-point energy of the quantum electromagnetic field generates an attractive force between two perfectly conducting metallic plates at distance d and zero temperature. In his calculation, the microscopic structure of the conductors is not taken into account. The latter are merely treated as macroscopic boundary conditions for the electromagnetic fields requiring the vanishing of the tangential electric field. This geometrical constraint modifies the field eigenmodes depending on d. The d-dependence of the modified zero-point energy {{is the source of the}} well known Casimir force f vac (d) = − π 2 ¯hc 240 d 4 (1) (¯h denotes Planck’s constant, c the speed of light). The generalisation of Casimir’s calculation to thermalized fields was given some years later in [2, 3], see [4] for a recent account. When the temperature T is different from zero, one can form the dimensionless parameter α = βπ¯hc/d (the ratio of the thermal wave length of the photon to the conductors separation; β is the inverse temperature). A large value of α (low temperature, short separation) characterizes the quantum regime whereas a small value of α (high temperature, large separation) yields a purely classical asymptotic result (independent of ¯h and c) f = − ζ(3) 4 πβd 3 + O(e−b/α), α → 0, b> 0 (2...|$|R
