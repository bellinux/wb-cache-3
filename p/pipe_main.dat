40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} {{strategy}} for rehabilitation and expansion of water distribution network (WDN) in developing countries. The main framework of the pipe network rehabilitation is formulated based on the “selection and concentration” of trunk/limb mains pipe strategy. The strategy is to select more appropriate pipeline, diameter and material of pipe mains to ensure cost effectiveness and adequate water pressure. Meeting {{the objective of the}} strategy, this study developed Hybrid Genetic Algorithm(HGA) model. HGA-I is applied considering rapid growth of the future water demand. HGA-IIa focuses on selection and concentration of trunk/limb mains pipelines, and HGA-IIbis applied to determine appropriate diameters for water demand in interim plan years. Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is applied to identify the potential cost of a project alternative. This analysis proposes the most effective combination of pipe material and diameter of each <b>pipe</b> <b>main.</b> The application of this method may be appropriate for water authorities in planning rehabilitation and expansion of a WDN. They can easily clarify the optimal combination of pipeline, diameter, and material of trunk/limb mains pipes in the network that will result in the minimum life cycle cost over the entire upgrading project period...|$|E
40|$|Bypass {{pneumatic}} conveying systems provide a passive capability to reduce conveying velocity and therefore reduce attrition and abrasion {{in the process}} of conveying many fragile and erosive particulate solids. Because of these capabilities, bypass {{pneumatic conveying}} systems have been used in coal-fired power stations for removing fly ash {{for the last couple of}} decades. In bypass systems, the differential pressure between bypass <b>pipe</b> and <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> as well as the pipeline pressure drop are two of most significant parameters as differential pressure represents the aeration mechanism within the pipeline while pressure drop is an essential parameter for bypass pneumatic conveying system design. In bypass systems, these two parameters are determined not only by the turbulent mode of the gas solids two-phase flow but also by the bypass configurations. The objective of this study was to experimentally investigate the differential pressure between bypass <b>pipe</b> and <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> as well as the pressure drop during the bypass pneumatic conveying of fly ash. Pneumatic conveying tests in bypass systems and a conventional pipeline were carried out in this study. The bypass pipeline was a 79 mm diameter <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> with a 27 mm inner diameter bypass pipe with orifice plate flute arrangement. Fly ash was discharged to the system from the bottom of a positive pressure blow tank. The receiving bin was mounted on load cells for measuring the mass accumulation.

Therefore, air came into <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and aerated the material continuously. The differential pressure also illustrated that the particulate may go into the bypass pipe as pressure in the bypass pipe after orifice plate is lower than that in <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> The pipeline pressure drop results also showed that pressure drop was higher than in the conventional system when using the same operating parameters due to the increase of friction.

Numerical {{simulations}} {{were conducted}} to investigate the bearing behaviour of steel foot <b>pipe.</b> <b>Main</b> mechanical affections occur at the lateral zone, and the maximal stress occurs at the lateral end of the pipe. With the increase of cross direction load, the maximal stress increases and exceeds the strength of material, and the pipe is pulled out. The influencing factors of bearing capacity of the steel foot pipe were studied. Some important results different from engineering experiences are as following: 1) to steel foot pipe that can not penetrate the soft base, its reasonable dip angle is very small for its low longitudinal bearing capacity; 2) steel pipe with diameter of 42 mm is unsuitable for foot steel pipe because its low cross bearing capacity; 3) to a given geological condition and pipe parameter, the reasonable length of steel pipe is certain, extra longer pipes can’t obtain larger capacity; 4) surrounding rock near the support structure should be especially reinforced by drilling grouting holes along the whole steel pipe. Steel foot pipe and its application Lots of tunnels built in soft surround rock underwent great settlement for the poor bearing capacity of the base rock [1 - 2]. To prevent or treat the immoderate settlement, a kind of reinforcement named steel foot pipe are widely used in China for its great rigidity, quick and convenient construction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studied a}} new type of flowmeter, the bypass flowmeter. It is {{suitable}} for large-scale pipes. The principle of bypass flowmeter is studied by analyzing flowing in parallel pipes and carrying out experiments at a modified performance test system for centrifugal pumps. The study results showed that the flowrate ratio between the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and the bypass pipe is determined by the geometric structures of pipes and the flowing states in the pipes. The flowrate ratio varies greatly when the Reynolds numbers are relatively lower both in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and the bypass pipe. The flowrate ratio keeps constant when the Reynolds number in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> is larger than 120000. The head loss becomes smaller when the bypass pipe is connected to the <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> The percentage of head loss decrease is from 7. 64 % to 9. 34 %. The results indicate that bypass flowmeter is suitable for flowrate measuring in large scale pipes. It will not cause additional head loss to the flow...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} to locate leaks in buried water pipes. However, difficulties are often encountered when attempting to detect a leak in a plastic pipe, as the leak noise signals attenuate very rapidly away from the leak. Identifying suitable sensors which can be easily deployed and are sufficiently sensitive has been problematic. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) wire ring sensors have been proposed and demonstrated successfully in laboratory conditions previously. Here it is proposed that the ring sensor is used in a modified configuration: a flexible hose instrumented with the ring sensor {{is connected to the}} pipe, via a fire hydrant or other standard access point. Some theoretical modelling has been carried out, which predicts that the acoustic pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> transmits well into the sidebranch, whilst the pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> is largely unaffected. This suggests that PVDF wire located on the sidebranch will effectively monitor the pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> Moreover, if the sidebranch is sufficiently flexible, substantial sensitivity gains can be made using this configuration compared with locating the wire on the <b>main</b> <b>pipe.</b> Measurements made in the laboratory on a medium density polyethylene (MDPE) finite pipe with a polythene sidebranch connected to it confirm that the acoustic pressure in the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> can indeed be measured on the sidebranch. The expected sensitivity gains were not fully realized, and a number of different reasons for this are proposed...|$|R

In order tostudy the internal flowsand hydraulic loss of reducing cross, numerical simulation {{was carried out}} on a horizontally installedreducing cross. Three schemes of pipe diameters were studied. The time-averaged N-S equations of three-dimensional steady flows in the reducing pipe were calculated by CFX 14. 5 based on the standard k-ε two equation turbulence model together with standard wall function. The {{results show that the}} higher the inlet velocity, the hydraulic loss become larger when the split ratios are same for the reducing cross. With the uniform inlet velocities the higher the inlet velocity, the quicker the increasing rate of the hydraulic loss in <b>main</b> <b>pipe,</b> as well as the branch pipe. The integral change rules of hydraulic loss are similar with the condition of uniform flow rate inflow when the flow patterns at inlet are uniform. But with the same spilt ratio, the hydraulic loss of uniform velocity inflow is markedly less than that of uniform flow rate inflow in both <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> and branch pipe.
