These included the Charing Cross Hotel, attached to the station itself. Today, there are several luggage outlets and tourist agents on the Strand, as well as old postage stamp dealers. The <b>philatelist</b> Stanley Gibbons opened a shop at No.435 in 1891. It moved to No.391 in 1893, and is now currently based at No.399.|$|E

25|$|Stamp {{collecting}} {{is generally}} accepted {{as one of}} the areas that make up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. A <b>philatelist</b> may, but does not have to, collect stamps. It is not uncommon for the term <b>philatelist</b> to be used to mean a stamp collector. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies.|$|E
