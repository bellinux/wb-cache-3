40|$|International audienceThe <b>pyrolite</b> {{model is}} one of the {{possible}} compositions of the Earth's lower mantle. The lower mantle's composition is generally modelled by comparing seismic observations with mineral physics data of possible lower mantle end-member phases. Here, we report the compression behavior of a natural KLB- 1 peridotite (a representative composition of the <b>pyrolite</b> model) in a quasihydrostatic environment at simultaneous high pressure (P) and temperature (T), covering the entire range of lower mantle P-T conditions up to 112 GPa. This is the first experimentally determined density profile of <b>pyrolite</b> under the lower mantle conditions. The results allow us to directly compare the measured density of peridotite mantle along the geotherm with the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) derived from seismic observations, without extrapolation. The comparison shows significant mismatch between the two, which calls for a re-evaluation of the PREM density model or a non-pyrolite lower mantle composition. Citation: Ricolleau, A., et al. (2009), Density profile of <b>pyrolite</b> under the lower mantle conditions, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L 06302, doi: 10. 1029 / 2008 GL 036759. 1. Introduction [2] There is a general consensus that the Earth's upper mantle is peridotitic (the <b>pyrolite</b> model), based on direct geological observations of upper mantle rocks and magmatic processes at high pressure [Ringwood, 1975]. A common approach to determine the composition of the lower mantle is to compare laboratory experimental data with seismic observations. The question of compositional stratification between upper and lower mantle remains open. Previous studies of the lower mantle composition were based on thermoelastic modeling of the two major phases in the lower mantle, Mg-perovskite and ferropericlase, using existing thermoelastic parameters derived from experimental data across a limited pressure and temperature range. These studies have been inconclusive, with some authors [e. g., Jackson and Rigden, 1996; Stacey, 1996] arguing that the pyrolitic composition matches the seismic data, whereas others [e. g., Stixrude et al., 1992; Murakami et al., 2007] disagree and propose more silicic models (a perovskitic lower mantle). None of these studies investigated a realistic multi-component mantle composition and instead drew their conclusions from a three-component system model (SiO 2 - MgO-FeO). Few experiments have been carried out under lower mantle conditions for the multi-component system [Lee et al., 2004; O'Neill and Jeanloz, 1990] but none has covered the P-T range of the entire lower mantle with highprecision data under hydrostatic conditions. [3] In this study, we performed compression experiments on a natural KLB- 1 peridotite [Takahashi, 1986] (similar in composition to the <b>pyrolite</b> model [Ringwood, 1975; McDonough and Sun, 1995]) under lower mantle pressure and temperature conditions, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and laser-heating diamond-anvil cell techniques. The experiments allowed us to establish a reference density profile for a peridotitic mantle and compare it to seismic observations of the lower mantle...|$|E
40|$|The various {{existing}} garnet-orthopyroxene geobarometers calibrated {{based on}} the Al 2 O 3 or Cr 2 O 3 components in orthopyroxene buffered by coexisting garnet for mantle xenoliths, abbreviated as Al 2 O 3 -barometer and Cr 2 O 3 -barometer, respectively, have been extensively studied, to test their precision by applying them to phase equilibrium experimental data, and to evaluate their validity by applying them to natural <b>pyrolites.</b> The Cr 2 O 3 -barometers failed in reconstructing the experimental pressures due to imprecise description of activities of garnet and orthopyroxene end members. Several of the Al 2 O 3 -barometers showed perfect ability in reproducing the experimental pressures and successfully discerned the garnet-facies and garnet-spinel transition facies lherzolites {{as well as the}} graphite- or diamond-bearing mantle xenoliths. It is recommended that pressure and temperature estimation of mantle xenoliths may be best determined simultaneously by combining the garnet-orthopyroxene barometer and the two-pyroxene thermometer of Taylor (1998). Orthopyroxenes containing Al 2 O 3 contents of less than 0. 37 wt. % should not be used in the pressure estimation in order to avoid significant P-T errors propagated from analytical errors. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the early}} Earth was partially molten (if not completely) due to the high energy dissipated by terrestrial accretion [1]. After core formation, subsequent cooling of the magma ocean has led to fractional crystallization of the primitive mantle. The residual liquid corresponds {{to what is now}} called the fertile mantle or <b>pyrolite.</b> Melting relations of silicates have been extensively investigated using the multi-anvil press, for pressures between 3 and 25 GPa [2, 3]. Using the quench technique, {{it has been shown that}} the pressure affects significantly the solidus and liquidus curves, and most probably the composition of the eutectic liquid. At higher pressures, up to 65 GPa, melting studies were performed on <b>pyrolite</b> starting material using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) technique [4]. However, the quench technique is not ideal to define melting criteria, and furthermore these studies were limited in pressure range of investigation. Finally, the use of <b>pyrolite</b> may not be relevant to study the melting eutectic temperature. At the core-mantle boundary conditions, melting temperature is documented by a single data point on (Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 olivine, provided by shock wave experiments at around 130 - 140 GPa [5]. These previous results present large uncertainties of 1 ̃ 000 K. The aim of this study is to determine the eutectic melting temperature in the chemically simplified syste...|$|E
40|$|Seismic anisotropy, the {{dependence}} of velocity on direction, is often induced by mantle flow. Here, I studied {{the influence of a}} proposed mantle plume beneath Hawaii on the azimuth dependence of Rayleigh wave phase velocity. I used a two-layer forward modeling code to explore how the orientation of a transversely isotropic <b>Pyrolite</b> mantle model controls the fast direction and strength of azimuthal anisotropy. Two layers are assumed because plate motion of the Pacific plate rearranged about 45 Million years ago. It is thought that the fossil spreading direction was ‘frozen’ into parts of the lithosphere while the asthenosphere below carries the signature of current mantle flow. Depending on how different the horizontal orientation of <b>Pyrolite</b> is in both layers, the strength of anisotropy can vanish for some frequencies but not others. This can ultimately be used to estimate the thickness of the anisotropic layers and the orientation of <b>Pyrolite.</b> In the second part, I forward-modeled data collected for the Hawaiian PLUME project. At high frequencies, the overall pattern of azimuthal anisotropy follows the fossil spreading direction while this coherency breaks down at low frequencies. I find that anisotropy in the upper lithosphere is largely intact, but the pattern is incoherent in the lower lithosphere and asthenosphere. These results provide strong evidence for the presence of a mantle plume beneath Hawaii...|$|E

Between 400 and 670 km depth an eclogitic assemblage yields a superior match to velocities and velocity gradients. The 400 km seismic discontinuity may represent a chemical boundary between <b>pyrolite</b> and picritic eclogite (“piclogite”) or phase transformations in the olivine + orthopyroxene components of a piclogitic assemblage containing about 16 % olivine.

40|$|A 1 -D {{reference}} {{model for}} the mantle that is physically meaningful would be invaluable both in geodynamic modelling and for an accurate interpretation of 3 -D seismic tomography. However, previous {{studies have shown that}} it is difficult to reconcile the simplest possible 1 -D physical model - 1300 °C adiabatic <b>pyrolite</b> - with seismic observations. We therefore generate a set of alternative 1 -D thermal and chemical mantle models, down to 900 km depth, and compare their properties with seismic data. We use several different body and surface wave data sets that provide complementary constraints on mantle structure. To assess the agreement between our models and seismic data, we take into account the large uncertainties in both the elastic/ anelastic parameters of the constituent minerals, and the thermodynamic procedures for calculating seismic velocities. These uncertainties translate into substantial differences in seismic structure. However, in spite of such differences, subtle trends remain. We find that models which attain (1) higher velocity gradients between 250 and 350 km; (2) higher velocity gradients in the lower transition zone; and (3) higher average velocities immediately beneath the 660 -discontinuity, than 1300 °C adiabatic pyrolite-either via a temporary shift to lower temperatures, and/or a change to a seismically faster chemical composition-provide a significantly better fit to the seismic data than adiabatic <b>pyrolite.</b> This is compatible with recent thermochemical dynamic models by Tackley et al. in which average thermal structure is smooth and monotonous, but average chemical structure deviates substantially from <b>pyrolite</b> above, in, and below the transition zone. Our results suggest that 1 -D seismic reference models are being systematically biased by a complex 3 -D chemical structure.

By using these updated thermoelasticity data for these phases, velocity and density profiles for a <b>pyrolite</b> model are constructed and compared with radial seismic models. We conclude that <b>pyrolite</b> provides an adequate explanation of the major seismic discontinuities at 410 - and 660 -km depths, the gradient in the transition zone, as well as the velocities in the lower mantle, if the uncertainties in the modeling and the variations in different seismic models are considered.

40|$|In this paper, the {{simplest}} average physical {{model of a}} mantle convecting as a whole (i. e., following an adiabatic temperature gradient) with a single composition (<b>pyrolite</b> with phase transitions) is tested directly against global seismic data, instead of against spherically symmetric seismic models. Constraints from seismic data on average velocities and lower mantle velocity gradients are hard to reconcile with an adiabatic pyrolitic mantle, given {{the current state of}} knowledge of elastic and anelastic mineral parameters at high pressure and temperature. This physical model generally gives (a) a stronger baseline offset between upper and lower mantle average travel-time residuals than allowed by the data and (b) an insufficient decrease in velocity with depth in the lower mantle (above 2500 km). We tested 105 upper and 105 lower mantle models that were selected randomly within the mineral parameter uncertainties. Only 2 lower mantle models and 24 upper mantle models yield whole mantle seismic structures that are compatible with global ISC P and S travel times and central frequencies of toroidal and spheroidal fundamental modes with angular order higher than 18. To improve the fit to the seismic data, the physical model would require (a) a lower velocity transition zone composition than dry <b>pyrolite</b> (at least around continents and subduction zones) as well as (b) a gradual change in physical state of the lower mantle that decreases the velocity-depth gradient, e. g., a superadiabatic temperature gradient. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a phase transition in Mg-silicate perovskite (Pv) to postperovskite (pPv) at lowermost mantle pressure-temperature (P - T) conditions may provide {{an explanation for the}} discontinuous increase in shear wave velocity found in some regions at a depth range of 200 to 400 km above the core-mantle boundary, hereafter the D′′ discontinuity. However, recent studies on binary and ternary systems showed that reasonable contents of Fe[superscript 2 +] and Al for <b>pyrolite</b> increase the thickness (width of the mixed phase region) of the Pv - pPv boundary (400 – 600 km) to much larger than the D′′ discontinuity (≤ 70 km). These results challenge the assignment of the D′′ discontinuity to the Pv - pPv boundary in <b>pyrolite</b> (homogenized mantle composition). Furthermore, the mineralogy and composition of rocks that can host a detectable Pv → pPv boundary are still unknown. Here we report in situ measurements of the depths and thicknesses of the Pv → pPv transition in multiphase systems (San Carlos olivine, pyrolitic, and midocean ridge basaltic compositions) at the P - T conditions of the lowermost mantle, searching for candidate rocks with a sharp Pv - pPv discontinuity. Whereas the pyrolitic mantle may not have a seismologically detectable Pv → pPv transition due to the effect of Al, harzburgitic compositions have detectable transitions due to low Al content. In contrast, Al-rich basaltic compositions may have a detectable Pv - pPv boundary due to their distinct mineralogy.

40|$|Two basalt {{flows and}} an {{andesite}} fissure eruption {{occur in the}} Rozel Hills - Black Mountain area in Box Elder County, Utah. Both basalt flows are aphanitic, and contain olivine, plagioclase, augite, and opaque oxides. They may be distinguished both chemically and {{on the basis of}} their textures. Unit 2 basalt is finer grained, and appears to be associated with a fault in the Black Mountain area. Chemically, it is similar to high-iron lavas in the Craters of the Moon, Idaho area. It has higher alkali, total iron, and titanium contents that Unit 1 basalt. Unit 1 basalt is similar to other tholeiitic basalts in the Basin and Range province. It is coarser-grained and has higher silicon, magnesium, aluminum, and calcium contents than Unit 2 basalt. While the basalts have characteristics of alkali-olivine basalts, such as absence of calcium-poor pyroxene, and a high alkali to silica ratio, both units are hypersthene- and olivine-nonnative and classified as olivine tholeiites. Subsurface basalt in the area appears to represent both lava types, but extensive alteration makes comparison difficult. Andesite from the area is aphanitic, and contains plagioclase, orthopyroxene, and opaque oxides. Temperatures of equilibration calculated from co-existing magnetite and ilmenite range f rom 1148 °C to 745 °C for basalt. Temperatures calculated from co-existing olivine and clinopyroxene range from 1009 °C to 994 °C. While the two basalt units cannot be related by fractional crystallization at surface conditions, some parent - daughter relations are likely within each unit, and the andesite is most likely a differentiation product of Unit 1 basalt. Partial melting of <b>pyrolite</b> and spinel lherzolite mantle compositions to produce Unit 1 and Unit 2 basalts was investigated. Since no unique temperature and pressure of equilbration for these melts and residu~l material from each mantle type was found, it is concluded that partial melting of a mantle of <b>pyrolite</b> or spinel lherzolite composition did not produce these lavas. Unit 2 basalt may be derived from Unit 1 basalt by fractionation of high pressure (8 kb) phases. This mechanism, similar to that proposed for the Craters of the Moon - Snake River Plain system, may account for an evolved basalt (Unit 2) with a lower silica content than a less differentiated basalt (Unit 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The mantle {{structures}} {{observed by}} seismic tomography {{can only be}} linked with convection models by assuming some relationships between tempera-ture, density and velocity. These relationships are complex and non linear even if the whole mantle has a uniform composition. For example, the density variations are not only related to the depth dependent thermal expansivity and incompress-ibility, {{but also to the}} distribution of the mineralogical phases that are themselves evolving with temperature and pressure. In this paper, we present a stoichiometric iterative method to compute the equilibrium mineralogy of mantle assemblages by Gibbs energy minimization. The numerical code can handle arbitrary elemental composition in the system MgO, FeO, CaO, Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and reaches the thermodynamic equilibrium by choosing the abundances of 31 minerals belonging to 14 possible phases. The code can deal with complex chemical activities for min-erals belonging to solid state solutions. We illustrate our approach by computing the phase diagrams of various compositions with geodynamical interest (<b>pyrolite,</b> harzburgite and oceanic basalt). Our simulations are in reasonable agreement wit...|$|E
40|$|Imposing {{a thermal}} and {{compositional}} {{significance to the}} outcome of the inversion of seismic data facilitates their interpretation. Using long-period seismic waveforms and an inversion approach that includes constraints from mineral physics, we find that lateral variations of temperature can explain {{a large part of the}} data in the upper mantle. The additional compositional signature of cratons emerges in the global model as well. Above 300 km, we obtain seismic geotherms that span the range of expected temperatures in various tectonic regions. Absolute velocities and gradients with depth are well constrained by the seismic data throughout the upper mantle, except near discontinuities. The seismic data are consistent with a slower transition zone and an overall faster shallow upper mantle, which is not compatible with a homogenous dry <b>pyrolite</b> composition. A gradual enrichment with depth in a garnet-rich component helps to reduce the observed discrepancies. A hydrated transition zone would help to lower the velocities in the transition zone, but it does not explain the seismic structure above it. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA...|$|E
40|$|Previous inversions of sea-floor magnetotelluric (MT) {{sounding}} {{data have}} predicted upper mantle electrical conductivities {{which are more}} than {{an order of magnitude}} higher than laboratory measurements of the conductivity of olivine would suggest, and controlled source-field electromagnetic (CSEM) soundings require a lithos-pheric mantle conductivity of 3 x lop 5 Sm-’, which is so low that the electromag-netic (EM) coast effect would produce more anisotropy in MT soundings than is observed. We address these issues by constructing an olivine mantle model for conductivity and examining the inversion of MT data from three sea-floor sites, and show that the incompatibilities can be largely resolved if the effects of oceans and coastlines are considered. Our mantle model is based on recent measurements of olivine conductivity, the conductivity of tholeiite melt, a thermal model for the upper mantle based on lithospheric cooling and the temperature of a+ a + / 3 olivine transition, the <b>pyrolite</b> model of mantle petrology, and conductivities derived from CSEM sounding. We propose Archie’s Law with exponent 2 and intercon-nected tubes as realistic lower and upper bounds for the effect of partial melt o...|$|E
40|$|Parts I and II are an {{experimental}} study {{concerned with the}} current controversy regarding the evolved versus primary nature of primitive MORB glasses. In part I equilibrium partial melt compositions under anhydrous conditions are presented on four peridotite compositions at 10 kbar. The four peridotite compositions are: 'MORB pyrolite', 'Hawaiian pyrolite', Tinaquillo lherzolite and the spinel lherzolite KLB- 1. In part II equilibrium partial melt compositions are presented for MORB <b>pyrolite</b> from 8 to 35 kbars and for Tinaquillo lherzolite at 15 to 20 kbars. The equilibrium liquids were determined by 'sandwich' experiments. The results of the experiments are used to test a 10 kbar melt model for the generation of primitive MORB glasses. The melt compositions from the four peridotites at 10 kbar are significantly different from primitive MORB glasses in major element chemistry and plot away {{from the field of}} primitive MORB glasses in the CIPW molecular normative 'Basalt tetrahedron'. The results suggest primary MORB melts segregate from source diapirs at pressures of 8 to 25 kbars in equilibrium with either lherzolite or harzburgite residues. MgO contents of primary MORB melts range from 10 - 17 wt...|$|E
40|$|Magmas {{which have}} equilibrated with the Earth's upper mantle are {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} compositionally buffered by spinel lherzolite as represented by Cr-diopside series xenoliths found in alkaline lavas. The fact that the mineral equilibria preserved in such xenoliths typically reflect re-equilibration at sub-solidus mantle conditions, however, has discouraged attempts to use the compositional variation observed in spinel lherzolite xenoliths to constrain the compositions of melts extracted from the upper mantle. A suite of mantle-derived xenoliths from the Alligator Lake volcanic center in the southern Yukon, Canada, exhibits a bimodal xenolith population consisting of lherzolites, the most fertile of which approach <b>pyrolite</b> in composition, and relatively depleted harzburgites. If a source-residue relationship is assumed between the two, then the extracted melt was a picritic magma (c; 17 wt. per cent MgO, 23 Mg cation units) with low Fe but relatively high Si contents, similar to picritic lavas associated with subduction margins. The compositional variation within the lherzolite xenoliths, however, is not towards {{the majority of the}} harzburgite xenoliths, but towards relatively rare, Fe-rich harzburgites. Reactions observed between the xenoliths and their alkaline host lavas may provide an analogue for the upper mantl...|$|E
40|$|Fe and Al {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{important}} rock-forming elements other than Mg, Si, and O. Their presence in the lower mantle’s most abundant minerals, MgSiO 3 bridgmanite, MgSiO 3 post-perovskite and MgO periclase, alters their elastic properties. However, knowledge on the thermoelasticity of Fe- and Al-bearing MgSiO 3 bridgmanite, and post- perovskite is scarce. In this study, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics to calculate the elastic and seismic properties of pure, Fe 3 +- and Fe 2 +-, and Al 3 +-bearing MgSiO 3 perovskite and post-perovskite, over a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and Fe/Al compositions. Our results show that a mineral assemblage resembling <b>pyrolite</b> fits a 1 D seismological model well, down to, at least, a few hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary, i. e. the top of the D′′ region. In D′′, a similar composition is still an excellent fit to the average velocities and fairly approximate to the density. We also implement polycrystal plasticity with a geodynamic model to predict resulting seismic anisotropy, and find post- perovskite with predominant (001) slip across all compositions agrees best with seismic observations in the D′′...|$|E
40|$|The early {{evolution}} of the Moon {{and its implications for}} the early {{evolution of}} the Earth was studied. The study is divided into two parts: (1) studies of core formation. Cosmochemical studies strongly favor a near-homogeneous accretion of the Earth. It is shown that core segregation probably occurred within the first 10, 000 years of Earth history. It is found that dissipative heating may be a viable mechanism for core segregation if sufficiently large bodies of liquid iron can form; (2) early thermal {{evolution of the}} Earth and Moon. The energy associated with the accretion of the Earth and the segregation of the core is more than sufficient to melt the entire Earth. The increase in the mantle liquidus with depth (pressure) is the dominant effect influencing heat transfer through the magma ocean. It is found that a magma ocean with a depth of 100 km would have existed as the Earth accreted. It is concluded that this magma ocean zone refined the earth resulting in the simultaneous formation of the core and the atmosphere during accretion. The resulting mantle was a well-mixed solid with a near <b>pyrolite</b> composition...|$|E
30|$|Na is {{considered}} to be a minor element in the upper mantle; Na contents in average mantle peridotite (<b>pyrolite)</b> were estimated as no higher than 0.4  wt% Na 2 O by Ringwood (1975). Bishop et al. (1978) describe garnet-lherzolite xenoliths in African kimberlites containing Na-poor (0.017 – 0.038  wt% Na 2 O) garnet coexisting with Na-rich clinopyroxene (2.01 – 4.66  wt% Na 2 O), Na-poor orthopyroxene (0.053 – 0.181  wt% Na 2 O), and Na-poor olivine (0 – 0.013  wt% Na 2 O). The results of Bishop et al. (1978) suggest that most of Na is partitioned into clinopyroxene rather than garnet at upper mantle conditions. It is likely that the absence of clinopyroxene is one of the keys for growth of Na-rich garnet. Among our hydrous Na-garnet (subgroups B 1, B 3, and B 4), subgroup B 4 garnet apparently formed without coexisting with clinopyroxene (see Table  1). In contrast, for subgroups B 1 and B 3, the occurrence of trapped inclusions of clinopyroxene in garnet (Table  1) indicates that clinopyroxene was present during garnet growth. The second key for growth of Na-rich garnet is perhaps locally high concentration of Na in the upper mantle; subgroups B 1 and B 3 garnet likely formed under Na-concentrated environments at upper mantle depths.|$|E
40|$|Archaean ferropicrites {{have been}} under-appreciated {{in the past}} {{because they have been}} {{frequently}} misidentified as enriched koma-tiites or Al-depleted komatiites. To investigate the nature of Archaean ferropicrite magmatism, we sampled ferropicrites from the Steep Rock, Lumby Lake, Grassy Portage Bay, and Dayohessarah Lake greenstone belts in the Western Superior Province, Ontario, Canada. Ferropicrite samples that are thought to approximate liquid compositions have 18 wt % Fe 2 O 3 at 19 wt % MgO, and frequently contain less than 5 wt % Al 2 O 3. They are enriched inTi and high field strength elements relative to koma-tiites, and have fractionated trace element profiles (La/Yb 11). These distinctive geochemical characteristics require that ferropi-crites and komatiites have different mantle sources, with that of the ferropicrites being Fe- and incompatible element-enriched compared with that of komatiites. A consideration of recent 5 GPa melting experiments on <b>pyrolite</b> and Fe-rich Martian mantle compositions indicates that Archaean ferropicrites could be generated by melting of an olivine-dominated mantle source with a Mg-number of 85 at 5 GPa. The high densities calculated for the ferropicrite magmas (e. g. 333 g/cm 3) suggest that more Fe-rich magmas would have difficulty rising to the Earth’s surface and would tend to stagnate or sink within the mantle.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 Using teleseismic {{network data}} and new signal {{processing}} techniques, I investigated mantle {{structure in the}} vicinity of subduction zones. The 660 -km seismic discontinuity in the Izu-Bonin region is depressed by up to 80 km, indicative of material 1000 ∘K colder than ambient mantle. A broad depression of the discontinuity near 33 ∘N suggests that the subducting slab extends to the west upon the discontinuity from 139 ∘E to at least 135 ∘E. Farther to the south near 26 ∘N, a narrow and confined discontinuity depression suggests local penetration. Along the entire Mariana-Bonin-Izu-Japan-Kuril Trench, the dip of the slab changes to vertical at the deepest earthquake, regardless of the depth of the earthquakes. This observation implies that the slab loses strength at the seismicity cutoff. A grain size reduction due to the olivine to spinel phase change would create a weak zone within the slab, eliminate the slab membrane strength, and thus provide a mechanism allowing the slab to fall vertically downward. The 660 -km discontinuity is less than 3 km thick and the shear wave jump across the discontinuity is. 40 km/sec ±. 05 km/sec. This jump agrees with the velocity jump predicted of a <b>pyrolite</b> mantle containing 4...|$|E
