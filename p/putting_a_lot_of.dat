His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He {{is not going to}} make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received {{a score of}} 75 based on 13 reviews (categorised as [...] "generally favorable reviews"). Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk praised the album in an eight-out-of-ten review: [...] "The quartet has a much bigger goal than just getting kids to dance to their breakdowns, rather they focus on <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> substance into each track, hoping to inspire this generation {{to take a stand}} and make change amongst the broken systems throughout the world".|$|E

500|$|There {{were other}} factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, {{much of it}} self-imposed. After she reached the {{pinnacle}} of her profession, [...] "That’s when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pressure on myself." [...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got {{to a point where}} I had so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Windows and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of The Orange Box were developed {{and published by}} Valve, {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts. In an interview with Edge magazine before the game's release, Valve co-founder Gabe Newell commented, [...] "I think the people who have The Orange Box on the PS3 are going to be happy with their game experience. We've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version– and they'll make the PS3 version a good product; EA got the job done in <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people with PS3 experience on the project. But I think it's harder to get it to the same standard as the 360 and PC versions". Despite this, he noted that Valve will probably handle PlayStation 3 {{versions of}} its products in the future.|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E

[...] The Los Angeles Times explained they did not give writer approval. [...] The editor of Premiere noted that the request created internal discussions that resulted in changes at the magazine: [...] "Had we {{had a history of}} <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> black writers on stories about the movie industry we'd be in a stronger position. But we didn't. It was an interesting challenge he laid down. It caused some personnel changes. We've hired a black writer and a black editor." ...|$|E
