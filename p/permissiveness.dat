5|$|A prince {{noted for}} the <b>permissiveness</b> {{of his private}} life, Louis I's prodigality was notorious. While visiting England in 1677 he {{incurred}} the ire of King Charles II by showering expensive gifts on Hortense Mancini, the king's mistress. The English and Prince Louis later became political enemies when Louis {{took part in the}} Anglo-Dutch Wars against England, leading his own Monaco Cavalry into battles in Flanders and Franche-Comté. These acts earned Louis the gratitude of Louis XIV who made him ambassador to the Holy See, charged with securing the Spanish Succession. However, the cost of upholding his position at the papal court caused him to sell most of his grandfather Honoré II's art collection, denuding the palace he had earlier so spectacularly enhanced. Louis died before securing the Spanish throne for France, an act which would have earned the Grimaldi huge rewards. Instead Europe was immediately plunged into turmoil as the War of the Spanish Succession began.|$|E

25|$|Spock was {{an activist}} in the New Left and anti Vietnam War {{movements}} during the 1960s and early 1970s. At the time, his books were criticized for propagating <b>permissiveness</b> and an expectation of instant gratification which allegedly led {{young people to}} join these movements—a charge that Spock denied. Spock also won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1924 while attending Yale University.|$|E
25|$|The third {{reign of}} an-Nasir Muhammad {{also saw a}} {{departure}} from the traditions of succession and administrative elevation of his predecessors since he observed in his first two reigns that such traditions had been ignored anyway, while sultans were being assassinated and mamluks were abusing other mamluks in bids for power. Moreover, an-Nasir Muhammad's being the son of a mamluk instead of a mamluk himself risked undermining his position among the largely mamluk elite. This partially explains his purges of the thousands of mamluks purchased by his predecessors. Amid conditions that stemmed the flow of mamluks from the Mongol-held lands to the sultanate, an-Nasir Muhammad resolved {{to make up for the}} loss of the purged mamluks by adopting new methods of training and military and financial advancement that introduced a great level of <b>permissiveness.</b> This <b>permissiveness,</b> which manifested in far more relaxed conditions for new mamluks, encouraged the pursuit of military careers in Egypt by aspiring mamluks outside of the country, to the point that parents would sell their children as mamluks with the belief the children would enjoy an improved standard of living.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} constraints {{gave way}} to more liberal conditions for women. Patriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their spouses and more often used birth control to regulate {{the size of their}} families. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic value systems. There was more <b>permissiveness</b> in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.|$|E
25|$|The communists' {{selective}} <b>permissiveness</b> took {{a toll on}} Aderca's legacy. During the 1950s, {{only his}} biography of Christopher Columbus was available in bookstores, with younger readers seemingly convinced that Aderca was a one-book author. After his death, other works were published individually or collectively: Murmurul cuvintelor ("The Murmur of Words", collected poems, 1971), Răzvrătirea lui Prometeu ("Prometheus' Rebellion", 1974), Teatru ("Drama", 1974), Contribuții critice ("Contributions to Criticism", 1983 and 1988), Oameni și idei ("Men and Ideas", 1983). In 1966, Orașele înecate was reprinted as Orașe scufundate, following Aderca's own command. Translated into German, it became somewhat familiar to an international public.|$|E
25|$|Flower {{power was}} a slogan {{used during the}} late 1960s and early 1970s {{as a symbol of}} passive {{resistance}} and non-violence ideology. It is rooted in the opposition movement to the Vietnam War. The expression was coined by the American beat poet Allen Ginsberg in 1965 as a means to transform war protests into peaceful affirmative spectacles. Hippies embraced the symbolism by dressing in clothing with embroidered flowers and vibrant colors, wearing flowers in their hair, and distributing flowers to the public, becoming known as flower children. The term later became generalized as a modern reference to the hippie movement and the so-called counterculture of drugs, psychedelic music, psychedelic art and social <b>permissiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beginning after World War II, the Methodist {{churches in}} the United States {{continued}} developing, at a much greater pace, ministries on Universities, Colleges, Junior Colleges and other higher education institutions, on campuses of both church-owned and state schools throughout the United States and Canada, {{and to a lesser}} degree in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Methodism boasts the largest number of higher education ministries, including teaching positions, of any Protestant denomination in the world in close competition with the Southern Baptist Convention. This emphasis is, in part, a reflection of the Methodist movement's earliest roots in The Oxford Holy Club, founded by John Wesley, his brother Charles, George Whitefield and others as a response to what they saw as the pervasive <b>permissiveness</b> and debauchery of Oxford University, and specifically Lincoln College when they attended. It is from the Holy Club that the earliest Methodist societies were formed and spread.|$|E
25|$|Ideologically {{positioned}} {{on the extreme}} or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or neo-fascist by political scientists. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as Neo-Nazi. The party is ethnic nationalist, and it espouses the view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls {{for an end to}} non-white migration into the UK and the removal of settled non-white populations from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although it has since advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes biological racism and the white genocide conspiracy theory, calling for global racial separatism and condemning mixed-race relationships. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised anti-semitism and Holocaust denial, although Griffin switched the party's focus on to Islamophobia. It promotes economic protectionism, Euroscepticism, and a transformation away from liberal democracy, while its social policies oppose feminism, LGBT rights, and societal <b>permissiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} emphasized, {{to a level}} {{never before}} seen, the supposed sexual undercurrents {{of the story of}} Titania's infatuation with Bottom after he turns into an ass. Brook was influenced by Jan Kott's study of the play in Shakespeare Our Contemporary, in which Kott notes the phallic properties of the donkey, and argues that Oberon deliberately degrades Titania by exposing her to this monstrous sexuality. In Brook's staging, Bottom entered Titania's bower carried by the fairies, one of whom thrust his upraised arm between Bottom's legs to represent a phallus. In a jab at more traditional stagings, the sequence was accompanied by Mendelssohn's Wedding March, a piece of music originally written to be played as an intermezzo between Acts IV and V, but often used in more genteel productions for the final marriage scene of the play. Despite the disturbing undercurrents of this view of sexuality, many audience members found the play witty and affectionate in its treatment of sex, in tune with the spirit of 1960s <b>permissiveness.</b>|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{response}} to the shooting he had witnessed in Vienna, Reich, then 30, opened six free sex-counselling clinics in the city in 1927 for working-class patients. Each clinic was overseen by a physician, with three obstetricians and a lawyer on call, and offered what Reich called Sex-Pol counselling. Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Reich offered a mixture of [...] "psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives," [...] Danto writes, and argued for a sexual <b>permissiveness,</b> including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help.|$|E
500|$|Porphyry was {{somewhat}} restrained in {{his criticism of}} Christianity, at least in his early works, On the Return of the Soul and Philosophy from Oracles. He had few complaints about Jesus, whom he praised as a saintly individual, a [...] "humble" [...] man. Christ's followers, however, he damned as [...] "arrogant". Around 290, Porphyry wrote a fifteen-volume work entitled Against the Christians. In the work, Porphyry expressed his shock at {{the rapid expansion of}} Christianity. He also revised his earlier opinions of Jesus, questioning Jesus' exclusion of the rich from the Kingdom of Heaven, and his <b>permissiveness</b> in regards to the demons residing in pigs' bodies. Like Hierocles, he unfavorably compared Jesus to Apollonius of Tyana. Porphyry held that Christians blasphemed by worshiping a human being rather than the Supreme God, and behaved treasonably in forsaking the traditional Roman cult. [...] "To what sort of penalties might we not justly subject people," [...] Porphyry asked, [...] "who are fugitives from their fathers' customs?" ...|$|E
500|$|Tyndall did his {{national}} service in West Germany from 1952 to 1954. A {{member of the}} Royal Horse Artillery, he achieved the rank of lance-bombardier. On completion, he returned to Britain and {{turned his attention to}} political issues. Initially interested in socialism, he attended a world youth festival held in the Soviet Union in 1957. He nevertheless began to regard left-wing politics as being infused with [...] "anti-British attitudes", moving swiftly to the political right. He had a devotion to the preservation of the British Empire and a hostility to what he regarded as the growing <b>permissiveness</b> of British society, stating that [...] "the smell everywhere was one of decadence". During that decade he read Mein Kampf, the autobiography and political manifesto of the late Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, growing sympathetic to Hitler's own political beliefs and Nazism. Tyndall approved in particular of [...] "the descriptions of the workings of certain Jewish forces in Germany, which seemed uncannily similar to what I had observed of the same kinds of forces in Britain." [...] He concluded that Britain's {{decision to go to war}} against Nazi Germany was ultimately the result of a conspiracy headed primarily by Jews, a conspiracy which he thought had also masterminded non-white immigration into Britain after the war.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the precise}} {{form of the}} {{original}} holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts {{provide insight into the}} festival as it was practiced at that time. Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual <b>permissiveness</b> encouraged {{on the eve of the}} fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an [...] "orgy") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom. On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to anoint the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year. Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as jaka, a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with suet in a decorative clay jar. The confit would then be conserved in an underground pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.|$|E

[...] Idle originally wrote [...] "Nudge, Nudge" [...] for Ronnie Barker, but it was rejected because there was 'no joke in the words'.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, the {{complete}} edition of Lost Girls was published, as a slipcased {{set of three}} hardcover volumes. The same year Moore published an eight-page article tracing out the history of pornography in which he argued that a society's vibrancy and success are related to its <b>permissiveness</b> in sexual matters. Decrying that the consumption of contemporary ubiquitous pornography was still widely considered shameful, {{he called for a}} new and more artistic pornography that could be openly discussed and would have a beneficial impact on society. He expanded on this for a 2009 book-length essay entitled 25,000 years of Erotic Freedom, which was described by a reviewer as [...] "a tremendously witty history lecture – a sort of Horrible Histories for grownups." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{rapidly growing}} <b>permissiveness</b> in film content that was general {{in much of}} the world {{affected}} Hong Kong film as well. [...] A genre of softcore erotica known as fengyue became a local staple (the name is a contraction of a Chinese phrase implying seductive decadence). [...] Such material did not suffer as much of a stigma in Hong Kong as in most Western countries; it was more or less part of the mainstream, sometimes featuring contributions from major directors such as Chor Yuen and Li Han Hsiang and often crossbreeding with other popular genres like martial arts, the costume film and especially comedy [...] (Teo, 1997; Yang, 2003). [...] Violence also grew more intense and graphic, particularly at the instigation of martial arts filmmakers.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{activity}} of the New Left became Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War as conducted by liberal President Lyndon Johnson. The anti-war movement escalated the rhetorical heat, as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came in sustained protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Liberals fought back, with Zbigniew Brzezinski, chief foreign policy advisor of the 1968 Humphrey campaign, saying the New Left [...] "threatened American liberalism" [...] in a manner reminiscent of McCarthyism. While the New Left considered Humphrey a war criminal, Nixon attacked him as the New Left's enabler—a man with [...] "a personal attitude of indulgence and <b>permissiveness</b> toward the lawless". Beinart concludes that [...] "with the country divided against itself, contempt for Hubert Humphrey {{was the one thing}} on which left and right could agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|His notion {{was that}} Western society has become [...] "sick" [...] and is {{undergoing}} a [...] "healing process", {{in the same way}} that the human body begins to produce antibodies when it feels itself to be sick, humanity as a collective whole (in the Jungian, sense) was creating [...] "strategies for overcoming the condition of dis-ease" [...] and trying to cure itself, by what he termed as [...] "a reversion to archaic values." [...] McKenna pointed to phenomena including surrealism, abstract expressionism, body piercing and tattooing, psychedelic drug use, sexual <b>permissiveness,</b> jazz, experimental dance, rave culture, rock and roll and catastrophe theory, amongst others, as his evidence that this process was underway. This idea is linked to McKenna's [...] "stoned ape" [...] theory of human evolution, with him viewing the [...] "archaic revival" [...] as an impulse to return to the symbiotic and blissful relationship he believed humanity once had with the psilocybin mushroom.|$|E

[...] The song's lyrics is about [...] "taunting a hapless man with the lyrics, [...] "Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me / Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me". The chorus of the song is based on Sir Mix A Lot's song [...] "Swass" [...] (1988). Maeve McDermott distinguished [...] "Don't Cha" [...] from other girl group songs like [...] "Wannabe", [...] "Independent Women" [...] and [...] "No Scrubs" [...] which promote female camaraderie. Marisa Meltzer of The Daily Beast felt that the song's lyrics [...] "put forward the belief that a woman's worth lies solely in her appearance and sexual <b>permissiveness</b> and just furthers the notion that women are in competition with one another over men." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stagg {{addresses}} {{the question of}} why so much of the Christian Household Code is found in what is generally recognized as the Pauline tradition. He points to a seeming irony that the Code in the New Testament is associated with the apostle who fought so openly and suffered such personal sacrifice for both freedom and equity for Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female. Citing the complexities with which Paul had to deal after his historic proclamation in Galatians 3:28, Stagg concludes that the New Testament Household Code was not a simple situation in which one man [...] "single-handedly imposed male chauvinism on Gentile churches." [...] He suggests that Paul's strong emphases stemmed from the [...] "perennial tension between freedom and order." [...] Pointing out that freedom is ever at the risk of its abuse in terms of <b>permissiveness,</b> disorder, anarchy, or chaos, [...] "the twin threats of legalism and libertinism are ancient and recurrent". Stagg notes that various New Testament books reflect [...] "this ongoing struggle for a proper relationship between law and grace, gift and demand, freedom and responsibility". He conjectures that this situation must have become acute in the early churches, especially among women and slaves who had suffered most under the heaviest restraints. Therefore, they understandably would want {{to make the most of}} their new freedom [...] "in Christ", and Stagg concludes that Paul found himself at the center of the battle.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they probably would be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of <b>permissiveness</b> extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of a man who knows a whole lot more about things than you do and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E

6000|$|Only {{an evening}} {{or two after}} that {{encounter}} in the Park, there was a grand concert at Klesmer's, who was living rather magnificently now {{in one of the}} large houses in Grosvenor Place, a patron and prince among musical professors. Gwendolen had looked forward to this occasion as one on which she was sure to meet Deronda, and she had been meditating how to put a question to him which, without containing a word that she would feel a dislike to utter, would yet be explicit enough for him to understand it. The struggle of opposite feelings would not let her abide by her instinct that the very idea of Deronda's relation to her was a discouragement to any desperate step towards freedom. The next wave of emotion was a longing for some word of his to enforce a resolve. The fact that her opportunities of conversation with him had always to be snatched in the doubtful privacy of large parties, caused her to live through them many times beforehand, imagining how they would take place and what she would say. The irritation was proportionate when no opportunity came; and this evening at Klesmer's she included Deronda in her anger, because he looked as calm as possible at a distance from her, while she was in danger of betraying her impatience to every one who spoke to her. She found her only safety in a chill haughtiness which made Mr. Vandernoodt remark that Mrs. Grandcourt was becoming a perfect match for her husband. When at last the chances of the evening brought Deronda near her, Sir Hugo and Mrs. Raymond were close by and could hear every word she said. No matter: her husband was not near, and her irritation passed without check into a fit of daring which restored the security of her self-possession. Deronda was there at last, and she would compel him to do what she pleased. Already and without effort rather queenly in her air as she stood in her white lace and green leaves she threw a royal <b>permissiveness</b> into her way of saying, [...] "I wish you would come and see me to-morrow between five and six, Mr. Deronda." ...|$|E
