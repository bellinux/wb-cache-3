If the <b>penetrants</b> are mounted to and hung off the drywall assembly itself during the test, this does not constitute a realistic deflection exposure insofar as the firestop is concerned. In reality, on a construction site, <b>penetrants</b> are hung off the ceiling above. <b>Penetrants</b> may increase in length, push and pull as a result of operational temperature changes (e.g., hot and cold water in a pipe), particularly in a fire. But it is a physical impossibility to have the <b>penetrants</b> follow the movement of drywall assemblies that they penetrate, since they are not mounted to the drywalls in a building.|$|R

Mutations that cause the skin condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly <b>penetrant</b> (the chances of a carrier to express the phenotype is high).|$|E

Furthermore, episodic memory is enhanced through AZD3480, a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor, which is developed by the company Targacept. Currently, {{there are several other}} products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving episodic memory.

50|$|It is, therefore, {{counterproductive}} {{to suspend}} <b>penetrants</b> from the drywall assembly during a fire test. As downward deflection of the drywall assembly and buckling towards the fire occurs, {{the top of}} the firestop is squeezed and the bottom of the firestop is pulled. This is motion above that caused by expansion of metallic <b>penetrants</b> due to heat exposure in a fire. Both types of motion occur because metal first expands in a fire, and then softens once the critical temperature has been reached, as is explained under structural steel. To simulate the drywall deflection effect, one can simply mount the <b>penetrants</b> to the steel frame holding the test assembly. The operational and fire-induced motion of the <b>penetrants,</b> which is independent of the assemblies penetrated, can be separately arranged.|$|R

500|$|Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are {{unstable}} during replication, {{and this}} instability increases {{with the number}} of repeats present. This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass (dynamic mutations) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat. This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an [...] "intermediate" [...] number of repeats (28–35), or [...] "reduced penetrance" [...] (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with {{an increase in the number}} of repeats that produces fully <b>penetrant</b> HD. Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation. Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length. It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a new mutation, where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.|$|E

The majority of tested individuals have moderate to severe autistic symptoms and do not display high levels of intellectual disability. [...] Additionally, autistic individuals from enrolled SSC families exhibit genetic deletions, duplications, and copy number variants (CNVs) that are not present in unaffected family members. [...] Siblings serve as ideal control groups to identify unique CNVs associated with autism. [...] Although CNVs are rare and are found in only up to 1% autistic individuals, the presence of multiple CNVs in autistic individuals may account for a larger fraction of autism cases. Ultimately, the goal of the SSC is to expand the number of individuals enrolled in the program in hope of identifying <b>penetrant</b> CNVs, small de novo mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to a higher risk of autism.|$|E

We have used hydrophilic <b>penetrants</b> (water, ethanol, mannitol, and paraquat) to study the in vitro permeability of skin from marmoset (eight body sites), man, and rat. Skin structure (stratum corneum thickness and number of cell layers; epidermal and dermal thickness; number and area of hair follicle openings per mm 2) was compared with permeability. There was no apparent relationship between skin structure and permeability to the most rapid <b>penetrants,</b> water and ethanol. Follicle area opening was the structural feature that varied most between species and between body sites.

40|$|The {{transport}} of small molecules across a phospholipid membrane is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of size, hydrophobicity, and asphericity of the <b>penetrants</b> on the permeation process are investigated. For this purpose, permeability coefficients of oxygen and ammonia are computed using an inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model and {{compared to the}} previously computed results of the permeation of water. Furthermore, solubility and diffusion data are computed {{for a series of}} Lennard-Jones particles that differ in size and shape. The results are discussed {{within the framework of the}} four-region model and are especially related to the free volume characteristics of the membrane. It is concluded that the free energy of solvation mainly determines the shape of the permeation resistance profile. For hydrophobic particles the membrane interior will act as a trap instead of a barrier. Moderately hydrophilic and hydrophilic <b>penetrants</b> experience the largest resistance to permeation in the dense part of the lipid tail region. This region is therefore most important in discriminating between various <b>penetrants.</b> ...|$|R

For instance, polymorphism has been identified in genes associated to the metabolism of estrogens and/or carcinogens (Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1, CYP1B1, CYP17A1, CYP19, Catechol-O-methyl transferase, N-acetyltransferase 2, Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1, GSTP1, GSTT, [...] [...] [...] [...] ), to estrogen, androgen and vitamin D action (ESR1, AR, VDR), to co-activation of gene transcription (AIB1), to DNA damage response pathways (CHEK2, HRAS1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC5). Sequence variants of these genes that are relatively common in the population {{may be associated with}} a small to moderate increased relative risk for breast cancer. Combinations of such variants could lead to multiplicative effects. Sporadic cancers likely result from the complex interplay between the expression of low penetrance gene(s) (risk variants) and environmental factors. However, the suspected impact of most of these variants on breast cancer risk should, in most cases, be confirmed in large populations studies. Indeed, low penetrance genes cannot be easily tracked through families, as is true for dominant high-risk genes.|$|E

Chapter of the second Book of his Observations, which containing a very remarkable Story I have here transcrib'd: Cum Chamæleonis nigri radices (says he) apud Pagum quendam Livadochorio nuncupatum erui curaremus, plurimi Græci & Turcæ spectatum venerunt quid erueremus, eas vero frustulatim secabamus, & filo trajiciebamus ut facilius exsiccari possent. Turcæ in eo negotio occupatos nos videntes, similiter eas radices tractare & secare voluerunt: at cum summus esset æstus, & omnes sudore maderent, quicunque eam radicem manibus tractaverant sudoremque absterserant, aut faciem digitis scalpserant, tantam pruriginem iis locis quos attigerant postea senserunt, ut aduri viderentur. Chamæleonis enim nigri radix ea virtute pollet, ut cuti applicata ipsam adeo inflammet, ut nec squillæ, nec urticæ ullæ centesima parte ita adurent: At prurigo non adeo celeriter sese prodit. Post unam aut alteram porro horam, singuli variis faciei locis cutem adeo inflammatam habere cæpimus ut tota sanguinea videretur, atque quo magis eam confricabamus, tanto magis excitabatur prurigo. Fonti assidebamus sub platano, atque initio pro ludicro habebamus & ridebamus: at tandem illi plurimum indignati sunt, & nisi asseverassemus nunquam expertos tali virtute eam plantam pollere, haud dubie male nos multassent, Attamen nostra excusatio fuit ab illis facilitus accepta, cum eodem incommodo nos affectos conspicerent. Mirum sane quod in tantillo radice tam ingentem efficaciam nostro malo experti sumus.|$|E
60|$|But to proceed; I observ'd several kind of hairs {{that had}} been Dyed, and {{found them to be}} a kind of horny Cylinder, being of much about the {{transparency}} of a pretty cleer piece of Oxe horn; these appear'd quite throughout ting'd with the colours they exhibited. And 'tis likely, that those hairs being boyl'd or steep'd in those very hot ting'd liquors in the Dye-fat, And the substance of the hair being much like that of an Oxes Horn, the <b>penetrant</b> liquor does so far mollifie and soften the substance, that it sinks into the very center of it, and so the ting'd parts come to be mix'd and united with the very body of the hair, and do not (as some have thought) only stick on upon the outward surface. And this, the boiling of Horn will make more probable; for we shall find by that action, that the water will insinuate it self to a pretty depth within the surface of it, especially if this penetrancy of the water be much helped by the Salts that are usually mix'd with the Dying liquors. Now, whereas Silk may be dyed or ting'd into all kind of colours without boiling or dipping into hot liquors, I ghess the reason to be two-fold: First, because the filaments, or small cylinders of Silk, are abundantly smaller and finer, and so have a much less depth to be penetrated then most kind of hairs; and next, because the substance or matter of Silk, is much more like a Glew then the substance of Hair is. And that I have reason to suppose: First, because when it is spun or drawn out of the Worm, it is a perfect glutinous substance, and very easily sticks and cleaves to any adjacent body, as I have several times observed, both in Silk-worms and Spiders. Next, because that I find that water does easily dissolve and mollifie the substance again, which is evident from their manner of ordering those bottoms or pods of the Silk-worm before they are able to unwind them. It is no great wonder therefore, if those Dyes or ting'd liquors do very quickly mollifie and tinge the surfaces of so small and so glutinous a body. And we need not wonder that the colours appear so lovely in the one, and so dull in the other, if we view but the ting'd cylinders of both kinds with a good Microscope; for whereas the substance of Hair, at best, is but a dirty duskish white somewhat transparent, the filaments of Silk have a most lovely transparency and cleerness, the difference between those two being not much less then that between a piece of Horn, and a piece of Crystal; the one yielding a bright and vivid reflection from the concave side of the cylinder, that is, from the concave surface of the Air that incompasses the back-part of the cylinder; the other yielding a dull and perturb'd reflection from the several Heterogeneous parts that compose it. And this difference will be manifest enough to the eye, if you get a couple of small Cylinders, the smaller of Crystal Glass, the other of Horn, and then varnishing them over very thinly with some transparent colour, which will represent to the naked eye much the same kind of object which is represented to it from the filaments of Silk and Hair by the help of the Microscope. Now, since the threads of Silk and Serge are made up of a great number of these filaments, we may henceforth cease to wonder at the difference. From much the same reason proceeds the vivid and lovely colours of Feathers, wherein they very farr exceed the natural as well as Artificial colours of hair, of which I shall say more in its proper place.|$|E
60|$|This[5] is the {{appearance}} of a piece of very fine Taffety-riband in the bigger magnifying Glass, which you see exhibits it like a very convenient substance to make Bed-matts, or Door-matts of, or to serve for Beehives, Corn-scuttles, Chairs, or Corn-tubs, it being not unlike that kind of work, wherewith in many parts in England, they make such Utensils of Straw, a little wreathed, and bound together with thongs of Brambles. For in this Contexture, each little filament, fiber, or clew of the Silk-worm, seem'd about the bigness of an ordinary Straw, as appears by the little irregular pieces, ab, cd, and ef; The Warp, or the thread that ran crossing the Riband, appear'd like a single Rope of an Inch Diameter; but the Woof, or the thread that ran the length of the Riband, appear'd not half so big. Each Inch of six-peny-broad Riband appearing no less then a piece of Matting Inch and half thick, and twelve foot square, a few yards of this, would be enough to floor the long Gallery of the Loure at Paris. But to return to our piece of Riband: It affords us a not unpleasant object, appearing like a bundle, or wreath, of very clear and transparent Cylinders, if the Silk be white, and curiously ting'd; if it be colour'd, each of those small horney Cylinders affording in some place or other of them, as vivid a reflection, {{as if it had been}} sent from a Cylinder of Glass or Horn. In-so-much, that the reflexions of Red, appear'd as if coming from so many Granates, or Rubies. The loveliness of the colours of Silks above those of hairy Stuffs, or Linnen, consisting, as I else-where intimate, chiefly in the transparency, and vivid reflections from the Concave, or inner surface of the transparent Cylinder, as are also the colours of Precious Stones; for most of the reflections from each of these Cylinders, come from the Concave surface of the air, which is as 'twere the foil that incompasses the Cylinder. The colours with which each of these Cylinders are ting'd, seem partly to be superficial, and sticking to the out-sides of them; and partly, to be imbib'd, or sunck into the substance of them: for Silk, seeming to be little else then a dried thread of Glew, may be suppos'd to be very easily relaxt, and softened, by being steeped in warm, nay in cold, if <b>penetrant,</b> juyces or liquors. And thereby those tinctures, though they tinge perhaps but a small part of the substance, yet being so highly impregnated with the colour, as to be almost black with it, may leave an impression strong enough to exhibite the desir'd colour. A pretty kinde of artificial Stuff I have seen, looking almost like transparent Parchment, Horn, or Ising-glass, and perhaps some such thing it may be made of, which being transparent, and of a glutinous nature, and easily mollified by keeping in water, as I found upon trial, had imbib'd, and did remain ting'd with a great variety of very vivid colours, and to the naked eye, it look'd very like the substance of the Silk. And I have often thought, that probably there might be a way found out, to make an artificial glutinous composition, much resembling, if not full as good, nay better, then that Excrement, or whatever other substance it be out of which, the Silk-worm wire-draws his clew. If such a composition were found, it were certainly an easie matter to find very quick ways of drawing it out into small wires for use. I need not mention the use of such an Invention, nor the benefit that is likely to accrue to the finder, they being sufficiently obvious. This hint therefore, may, I hope, give some Ingenious inquisitive Person an occasion of making some trials, which if successfull, I have my aim, and I suppose he will have no occasion to be displeas'd.|$|E
