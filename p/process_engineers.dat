25|$|A unit {{operation}} {{is a physical}} step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a {{unit operation}}. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as nitration and oxidation) involve the conversion of material by biochemical, thermochemical and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called <b>process</b> <b>engineers.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} {{impediment to}} third-party software on the Lisa {{was the fact}} that, when first launched, the Lisa Office System {{could not be used}} to write programs for itself: a separate development OS, called Lisa Workshop, was required. During this development <b>process,</b> <b>engineers</b> would alternate between the two OSes at startup, writing and compiling code on one OS and testing it on the other. Later, the same Lisa Workshop was used to develop software for the Macintosh. After a few years, a Macintosh-native development system was developed. For most of its lifetime, the Lisa never went beyond the original seven applications that Apple had deemed enough to [...] "do everything", although UniPress Software did offer Unix for $495.|$|E

2500|$|While the [...] "corporate scorecard" [...] {{terminology}} {{was coined}} by Art Schneiderman, {{the roots of}} performance management as an activity run deep in management literature and practice. [...] Management historians such as Alfred Chandler suggest the origins of performance management {{can be seen in}} the emergence of the complex organisation – most notably during the 19th Century in the USA. [...] More recent influences may include the pioneering work of General Electric on performance measurement reporting in the 1950s and the work of French <b>process</b> <b>engineers</b> (who created the tableau de bord – literally, a [...] "dashboard" [...] of performance measures) in the early part of the 20th century. [...] The tool also draws strongly on the ideas of the 'resource based view of the firm' proposed by Edith Penrose. [...] However it should be noted that none of these influences is explicitly linked to original descriptions of balanced scorecard by Schneiderman, Maisel, or Kaplan & Norton.|$|E
