2500|$|The hip joint, an enarthrodial joint, can be {{described}} as a ball and socket joint. The femur connects at the acetabulum of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three degrees of freedom, it is still stable due to the interaction of ligaments and cartilage. The labrum lines the circumference of the acetabulum to provide stability and shock absorption. Articular cartilage covers the concave area of acetabulum, providing more stability and shock absorption. [...] Surrounding the entire joint itself is a capsule secured by the tendon of the psoas muscle and three ligaments. The iliofemoral, or Y, ligament is located anteriorly and serves to prevent hip hyperextension. The <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligament</b> is located anteriorly just underneath the iliofemoral ligament and serves primarily to resist abduction, extension, and some external rotation. Finally the ischiofemoral ligament on the posterior side of the capsule resists extension, adduction, and internal rotation. When considering the biomechanics of hip fractures, it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>{{ligament}}</b> (pubocapsular ligament) is a ligament on {{the inferior}} {{side of the}} hip joint.|$|E
50|$|In {{the upright}} position, it {{prevents}} the trunk from falling backward {{without the need}} for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligament</b> restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.|$|E
50|$|The extracapsular ligaments are the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral, and <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligaments</b> {{attached}} to {{the bones of the}} pelvis (the ilium, ischium, and pubis respectively). All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.|$|R
50|$|In humans, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that it is not the ligamentum teres but the hip capsule (specifically the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral and <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligaments)</b> that provides the primary resistance to dislocation in the extended hip. However, recent research has suggested the ligamentum teres of the femur may have a number of functions, including a significant biomechanical role on the basis of cadaveric studies where increases of range of motion were seen after sectioning of the ligament.|$|R
5000|$|The three extracapsular ligaments of the {{hip joint}} — the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral, and <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligaments</b> — form a {{twisting}} mechanism encircling {{the neck of the}} femur. When sitting, with the hip joint flexed, these ligaments become lax permitting a high degree of mobility in the joint. When standing, with the hip joint extended, the ligaments get twisted around the femoral neck, pushing the head of the femur firmly into the Acetabulum, thus stabilizing the joint. [...] The zona orbicularis assists in maintaining the contact in the joint by acting like a buttonhole on the femoral head. [...] The intracapsular ligament, the ligamentum teres, transmits blood vessels that nourish the femoral head.|$|R
50|$|The pelvis and femur are the {{two main}} bones that form the hip joint. There is an {{articulation}} {{of the head of}} the femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis. Together, they make the hip joint an enarthrodial joint. There are two pelvic bones (right and left), each consisting of the Ilium, ischium, and the pubis. They connect to form the symphysis pubis on the anterior side, while the posterior side connects with the sacrum and coccyx to form sacroiliac joints. These bones are joined with help of strong ligaments, making them slightly movable joints. There are five strong and dense ligaments that help to reinforce the hip joint. They include the iliofemoral ligament, the teres ligament, the <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligament,</b> the ischiofemoral ligament, and the zona orbicularis ligament.|$|E

40|$|The study ???Contribution of the <b>Pubofemoral</b> <b>Ligament</b> to Hip Stability: A Biomechanical Study??? by Martin, Khoury, Schr??der, Johnson, G??mez-Hoyos, Campos, and Palmer {{found that}} cutting the hip capsular {{ligament}} allowed a large increase in femoral internal rotation, {{particularly in the}} flexed hip, causing subluxation to occur. In addition to providing new data {{on the role of}} the <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligament,</b> it raises the question of whether hip joint surgeons should repair the capsuledwhat are the likely consequences?dand whether any beneficial effects persist in long-term clinical follow-ups.

40|$|Background: The ligaments in {{coherence}} {{with the}} capsule {{of the hip}} joint are known to contribute to hip stability. Nevertheless, {{the contribution of the}} mechanical properties of the ligaments and gender- or side-specific differences are still not completely clear. To date, comparisons of the hip capsule ligaments to other tissues stabilizing the pelvis and hip joint, e. g. the iliotibial tract, were not performed. Materials & Methods: Hip capsule ligaments were obtained from 17 human cadavers (9 females, 7 males, 13 left and 8 right sides, mean age 83. 65 ± 10. 54 years). 18 iliofemoral, 9 ischiofemoral and 17 <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligaments</b> were prepared. Uniaxial stress-strain properties were obtained from the load-deformation curves before the secant elastic modulus was computed. Strain, elastic modulus and cross sections were compared. Results: Strain and elastic modulus revealed {{no significant differences between the}} iliofemoral (strain 129. 8 ± 11. 1 %, elastic modulus 48. 8 ± 21. 4 N/mm 2), ischiofemoral (strain 128. 7 ± 13. 7 %, elastic modulus 37. 5 ± 20. 4 N/mm 2) and pubofemoral (strain 133. 2 ± 23. 7 %, elastic modulus 49. 0 ± 32. 1 N/mm 2) ligaments. The iliofemoral ligament (53. 5 ± 15. 1 mm 2) yielded a significantly higher cross section compared to the ischiofemoral (19. 2 ± 13. 2 mm 2) and pubofemoral (15. 2 ± 7. 2 mm 2) ligament. No significant gender- or side-specific differences were determined. A comparison to the published data on the iliotibial tract revealed lower elasticity and less variation in the ligaments of the hip joint...|$|R

A comparison to the published data on the iliotibial tract revealed lower elasticity and less variation in the ligaments of the hip joint. Comparison of the mechanical data of the hip joint ligaments indicates that their role may likely exceed a function as a mechanical stabilizer. Uniaxial testing of interwoven collagen fibers might lead to a misinterpretation of the mechanical properties of the hip capsule ligaments in the given setup, concealing its uniaxial properties. This underlines the need for a polyaxial test setup using fresh and non-embalmed tissues...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{analyze the}} anatomy and {{quantitative}} {{contributions of the}} hip capsular ligaments. Methods: The stabilizing roles of the medial and lateral arms of the iliofemoral ligament, <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligament,</b> and ischiofemoral ligament are examined in 12 matched pairs of fresh frozen cadaveric hips 6 male and 6 female hips. The motion at the hip joint was measured in internal and external rotation through ranges of motion from 30 degrees flexion to 10 degrees extension along a neutral swing path. The motion was standardized via frame stabilization and motion tracking. Results: There is a clear and consistent ligamentous pattern within the hip corresponding to a distinct function and contribution to internal and external rotation. Upon releasing the ischiofemoral ligament, the greatest gain in range of motion was that of internal rotation. The largest increase of motion by releasing the <b>pubofemoral</b> <b>ligament</b> was observed in external rotation, especially during extension. The release of the medial and lateral arms of the iliofemoral ligament each gave the greatest increase of motion in external rotation, with the lateral arm release providing more range of motion in flexion and in a neutral position. The lateral arm release also demonstrated significant motion increase in internal rotation...|$|E
