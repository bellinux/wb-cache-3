5|$|Through {{the rest}} of the 1970s, other {{possible}} designs were looked at but never implemented, while <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on the construction site resumed. On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued over whether to build an arched or straight-axis gravity dam. Some favored the latter design because it would have greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Walton was {{presented}} with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> {{came to a halt}} in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>work</b> in the {{planning}} of ESRO operations concluded that the ESTRACK network would initially consist of four radio tracking and telemetry stations and three optical tracking stations. In addition to Svalbard, tracking and telemetry stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the Svalbard location, as Norway was {{not a member of}} ESRO. The ESRO secretariat wanted to quicken the location decision, as it was necessary to have all four in operation before the launch of the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on L.A. Noire {{began after}} the {{founding}} of developer Team Bondi in 2003. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, work was shared between the core team and multiple other studios owned by publisher Rockstar Games. Unlike other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game also uses MotionScan to capture actor's facial expressions. BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development budget for the game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A. Noire {{one of the most}} expensive video games ever made.|$|E
50|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>works</b> began January 2014 with {{boreholes}} being {{drilled in}} preparation for the bridge over the Midland Main Line at Loughborough.|$|R

50|$|In 1971, <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> were {{established}} to make Pistol Auto 9mm 1A. The first specimen was manufactured in 1977, while large-scale manufacturing began in 1981.|$|R
5|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on Red Dead Redemption {{began in}} 2005; full {{development}} commenced in 2006, following {{the formation of}} a core development team. Rockstar San Diego co-opted a number of other studios owned by parent company Rockstar Games to facilitate development between a full team of over 800. Media analysts estimated the development budget for the game was between US$80 million and US$100 million, making Red Dead Redemption {{one of the most expensive}} video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{placed his}} {{department}} {{at the disposal of}} the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The Human Genome Project—the largest, {{most costly}} single {{biological}} study ever undertaken—began in 1988 {{under the leadership}} of James D. Watson, after <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> with genetically simpler model organisms such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Shotgun sequencing and gene discovery methods pioneered by Craig Venter—and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with Celera Genomics— led to a public–private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.|$|E
50|$|The Transport and Works Act Order for the {{extension}} was approved in August 2017 and <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> will start {{by the end}} of 2017, with completion expected in 2021.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{as part of}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> for the station, {{a series}} of archaeological {{excavations}} were carried out. During these digs, archaeologists unearthed the remains of Emperor Hadrian's Athenaeum.|$|R
50|$|The Preparatory Committee {{consisted}} of 150 memberes with 94 Hong Kong appointees and 56 Mainland appointees. All {{the members of}} the <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Working</b> Committee were appointed to the Preparatory Committee.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{extension}} of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path {{on the east side of}} the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by Lord Parry, the chairman of the Wales Tourist Board. By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing. After 1973, the peak year for passengers on the Talyllyn with 186,000passenger journeys made, numbers were to decline consistently until the 1990s. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on the conversion of Irish Pete for use on the Talyllyn, which had begun in the early 1970s, was put on hold in 1975 and the chassis and boiler were put into storage at Pendre.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, on 13April1961, HSA {{decided to}} conduct <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on a {{supersonic}} derivative of the P.1127 {{under the guidance}} of Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance enhancing feature be adopted {{in the form of the}} plenum chamber burning (PCB)– essentially an afterburner – in the engine. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in motor traffic in the early 20th century, the capacity of the original tunnel was soon perceived as inadequate. In 1930, John Mills, MP for Dartford, remarked that HGVs delivering from Essex to Kent could not practically use any crossing of the Thames downstream of the tunnel. The LCC obtained an act to construct a new tunnel in 1938, but work did not start due to the outbreak of World War II. Construction eventually started in 1958 with <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on the northern approach road. By this time, traffic had become progressively worse. In 1960, Richard Marsh, MP for Greenwich complained that vehicles could spend 30 to 45 minutes stuck in tunnel traffic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>works</b> for ADHGB can {{be traced}} back to 1848/49. Already Paulskirche Constitution of 28 March 1849 {{provided}} in § 64 inter alia establishing a General Commercial Code. On 2 December 1848 a commission had started preparations previously.|$|R
5|$|During {{the period}} 1918 to 1939, the {{isolation}} hospital remained the sole medical provision in Sheriff Hill. Faced {{with an increase}} in population, Gateshead Council decided that a new general hospital should be built. In March 1938, <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> started on the Queen Elizabeth Hospital {{on the site of the}} isolation hospital; the foundations were laid in 1939 but the outbreak of World War II delayed the building work. The new hospital was opened by Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, on 18 March 1948. It is the largest hospital in Gateshead and has since been expanded, most notably with the opening of the North East NHS Surgery Centre in 2008, which cost £13.3 million.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the MTA began {{advertising}} Requests for Proposals (RFP) {{for three}} new contracts {{for the second}} phase, which were planned to be awarded in summer 2016. In April 2016, the MTA and the State of New York reached a deal to restore funding to Phase 2, {{with a total of}} $1.035 billion allocated. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board increased funding for Phase 2 by $700 million. The new budget of $1.735 billion would allow for a near-term 30 percent match per Full Funding Grant Agreement process. By August 2017, <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on the line was underway, and the engineering firm AKRF was updating the environmental impact study for Phase 2. AKRF had previously prepared the Manhattan East Side Alternatives and the original EIS for the Second Avenue Subway. The design of the project is being done by Phase 2 Partnership, a joint venture of Parsons-Brinckerhoff and STV. The EIS and design will be finished in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Mining in Mine 1b was {{terminated}} in 1958, but operation in Mine 5 started the following year. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on Mine 4 started in 1954, and from 1960 {{it was used}} as a reserve mine. The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s. In 1959, a man fell seriously ill, so a landing strip was prepared in Adventdalen. From the same year, Braathens SAFE started serving the tundra airport with irregular winter flights. In 1957, a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958. From 1961, the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school. A branch of Tromsø Sparebank opened in 1959.|$|E
50|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>works</b> {{had been}} {{finished}} to link mainland Zhuhai with Qi'ao island. Nonetheless {{the proposal was}} dropped {{to give way to}} a later proposal of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which links Hong Kong at Lantau, and connects Macau as well.|$|R
25|$|The lowest tender for {{execution}} {{of the project was}} accepted in February 1995, and the out-turn was £1.024 million, representing 95% of the funding; <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> accounted for 1.5% and legal costs and administration for 3.5%. Barr Construction were the main contractor.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 June - Beijing names 27 {{mainland}} {{officials and}} 30 Hong Kong residents to the <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Working</b> Committee (PWC) as a predecessor to the HKSAR Preparatory Committee {{to be set}} up in 1996 to oversee final phase of sovereignty transfer and HKSAR establishment.|$|R
5|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>work</b> {{had begun}} well before that date, however, and Ericsson's {{consortium}} contracted with Thomas R. Rowland of the Continental Iron Works at Greenpoint, Brooklyn on 25 October {{for construction of}} Monitors hull, with her keel being laid on that same day. The turret was built and assembled at the Novelty Iron Works in Manhattan, disassembled and shipped to Greenpoint where it was reassembled. The ship's steam engines and machinery were constructed at the DeLamater Iron Works, also in Manhattan. Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, who once served aboard Merrimack, was appointed Superintendent of the ship while she was undergoing construction. Although never formally assigned to the crew, he remained aboard her as an inspector during her maiden voyage and battle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>work</b> on Vesperia {{began in}} 2005. Full {{development}} began in May {{of the following}} year and lasted approximately two years. Returning staff included producer Yoshito Higuchi, composers Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, and character designer Kōsuke Fujishima. The writers included Takashi Hasegawa and Hideo Baba. Developed by the same team that made Tales of Symphonia and Tales of the Abyss, it was designed for the Xbox 360 as the PS3 {{had yet to be}} shown to the company and the former console was achieving international popularity. The anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G, with an art style influenced by cel-shaded animation. The game's theme song, Ring a Bell by Bonnie Pink, was used for both the Japanese and English releases. Upon release, the game was an international commercial success, selling over 600,000 copies worldwide. Critical reception has been generally positive, and further media related to the world of Vesperia has been developed.|$|E
5|$|Well {{before the}} design was finalised, four ships were ordered in July 1943. Africa was {{originally}} ordered as an unnamed Audacious-class carrier, but {{the order was}} modified to a Malta-class ship on 12 July 1943. Malta, New Zealand and Gibraltar were all ordered three days later. New Zealand was originally ordered from Cammell Laird, but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944. The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any more material on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders, {{it is unlikely that}} any of them actually did more than <b>preliminary</b> <b>work.</b> None of the ships were ever laid down and all of them were cancelled before the end of 1945.|$|E
50|$|In May 1590, in {{the urgency}} of an {{outbreak}} of child fever, a hospital {{was established in the}} Fédons. The latter was used for only three to four months, and was forgotten until discovered by the <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> for the LGV Méditerranée during spring 1996.|$|R
