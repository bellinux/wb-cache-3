5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his accepted impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now.

The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition <b>picks</b> <b>a</b> fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of the premiers of the {{province}} of Quebec, Canada, since Confederation in 1867. Quebec uses a unicameral (originally bicameral) Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier {{is the leader of the}} party that controls the most seats in the National Assembly (previously called the Legislative Assembly). The premier, sometimes called the prime minister, is Quebec's head of government, while the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec.

5|$|Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to {{the prom}} with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are {{kicked out of the}} prom when Finn <b>picks</b> <b>a</b> fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor, which {{effectively}} ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, {{despite the fact that she}} and Jesse seem to be a couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. According to an advertisement for the film, the plot was written especially for Marie Eline, {{also known as the}} Thanhouser Kid, as a feature which would show her abilities. Eline's role and actions were described in a deus ex machina fashion by The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer because of her actions to guide and assist her blind sister. Though, Lonergan liked to use the dramatic technique in the conclusion of the plots, it was not like the usage in The Actor's Children. It is also not the most striking example of the technique, in The Restoration the runaway child <b>picks</b> <b>a</b> doorstep to rest upon in a city, at complete random, is taken in by a recently engaged wealthy woman and reunited with her amnesia-struck father. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast in the starring role is Marie Eline as the little girl. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying two more actors in the production. The other credits amongst the cast are unknown, but most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E

25|$|An {{intuitive}} {{explanation is}} that, if the contestant initially <b>picks</b> <b>a</b> goat (2 of 3 doors), the contestant {{will win the}} car by switching because the other goat {{can no longer be}} picked, whereas if the contestant initially picks the car (1 of 3 doors), the contestant will not win the car by switching (Carlton 2005, concluding remarks). The fact that the host subsequently reveals a goat in one of the unchosen doors changes nothing about the initial probability.|$|E
25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped.

These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E

25|$|Euclidean {{geometry}} has {{two fundamental}} types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would {{be referred to}} as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily <b>picks</b> <b>a</b> line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.|$|E
