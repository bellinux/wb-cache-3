40|$|International audienceDry air {{polluted}} by butyl-mercaptan {{was treated}} in a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) reactor at atmospheric pressure using air as <b>plasmagene</b> gas in discharge and postdischarge modes. The energy density was varied between 200 to 1300 J/L. To assess the treatment efficiency, the concentrations of buty-mercaptan, total Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and SO 2 were determined in the exhaust gas. Whatever the energy density was, the treatment efficiency was better in post-discharge mode. The butyl-mercaptan could be completely eliminated from 400 J/L and SO 2 selectivity was always low, below 10 %. Measurements of CO, CO 2 and total VOCs indicated that 50 to 70 % of the reaction products were condensed on the reactor wall {{in the form of}} micro-droplets, depending on the energy density. FTIR and XPS techniques were used to characterize the reaction products which were soluble in water. These analyses indicated that the reaction products contain oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur in an oxidized form. A reaction mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction from the -SH bond by the nitrate radical was proposed, pointing out the important role of nitrate radicals NO 3 in the reactivity of air flowing post-discharge...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present {{contribution}} {{will report}} {{on the development of}} a Microwave Plasma Torch (MPT) at the von Karman institute and on the characterization of subsonic plasma flow of various <b>plasmagene</b> gases (air, N 2, CO 2 and Ar) at atmospheric pressure. The aim of this work is to explore plasma flow regimes for a large envelope of operating conditions. Using a conventional arrangement for MPT, including cylindrical open-ended dielectric quartz tube, plasma generated with molecular gases {{have been found to be}} homogeneous while with argon filamentary structures have been observed. Electrical characterization of the source has been performed for some operating conditions using forwarded and reflected microwave power monitoring. Comprehensive characterization of the flow by means of high speed imaging has been performed to estimate the effect of the oscillation of the delivered power on plasma jet unsteadiness. Analysis in time and frequency domains of the light intensity recorded at 1 kHz rate is presented. Low resolution Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) diagnostic was performed in order to identify typical radiative signature of air, N 2 and CO 2 plasma jet. High resolution OES was performed on pure N 2 plasma suitable for thermodynamic characterization using N 2 + First Negative and N 2 2 nd Positive systems. Making the common assumption that the internal energy levels of molecular species are populated according to a Boltzmann distribution and making no assumption concerning the total species concentration similarly to [1], comparisons between measured and calculated radiative signature of molecular systems evidence for the achievement of thermal equilibrium and slight departure to Saha equilibrium...|$|E

40|$|The Aegilops kotschyi thermo-sensitive cytoplasmic male {{sterility}} (K-TCMS) system may facilitate hybrid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed multiplication and production. The K-TCMS line is completely male sterile during the normal wheat-growing season, whereas its fertility can be restored in a high-temperature environment. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for {{male sterility}}/fertility conversion and candidate genes involved with pollen development in K-TCMS, we employed RNA-seq to sequence the transcriptomes of anthers from K-TCMS line KTM 3315 A during development under sterile and fertile conditions. We identified 16840 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different stages including 15157 known genes (15135 nuclear genes and 22 <b>plasmagenes)</b> and 1683 novel genes. Bioinformatics analysis identified possible metabolic pathways involved with fertility based on KEGG pathway enrichment of the DEGs expressed in fertile and sterile plants. We found {{that most of the}} genes encoding key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and jasmonate biosynthesis pathways were significant upregulated in uninucleate, binuclate or trinucleate stage, which both interact with MYB transcription factors, and that link between all play essential roles in fertility conversion. The relevant DEGs were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. Thus, we suggested that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and jasmonate biosynthesis pathways were involved in fertility conversion of K-TCMS wheat. This will provide a new perspective and an effective foundation for the research of molecular mechanisms of fertility conversion of CMS wheat. Fertility conversion mechanism in thermo-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterile/fertile wheat involves the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, jasmonate biosynthesis pathway, and MYB transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|Diallel {{mating design}} {{experiment}} with reciprocal crosses {{was used to}} determine combining abilities of five maize inbred lines and their hybrid combinations for grain yield, ear length, ear diameter, number of kernel rows per ear, number of kernels per row in 2005. and 2006. year. GCA and SCA significant values were observed for all traits under study in both years. GCA/SCA relation showed that dominant gene effect had prevalent influence in the inheritance of grain yield, ear length and ear diameter. Additive gene effect had larger importance in the inheritance of number of kernel rows per ear. NS- 1445 inbred line showed best GCA effect for grain yield, ear length and number of kernels per row, but worst GCA effect for number of kernel rows per ear. Best GCA effect for ear diameter achieved inbred line F- 7 R. Line BL- 47 showed best GCA effect for number of kernel rows per ear in both years, but also the worst GCA effect for grain yield and number of kernels per row. Hybrid combination NS- 1445 x BL- 47 showed largest SCA effect for grain yield in both years and also showed, like hybrid combination F- 7 R x NS- 1445, significant SCA effects for all other traits, except ear diameter. This cross also proved that hybrid combinations that include one parent with good GCA effect and the other parent with bad GCA effect can have very successful performance. It will be useful during selection material testing, to keep also genotypes which show bad GCA effect, but have phenotypic favorable trait values. Reciprocity effect was significant for SCA effects of all traits but ear diameter. It is the conformation of involvement of <b>plasmagenes</b> in maize quantitative traits inheritance. The largest reciprocity effect for grain yield achieved F- 7 R x BL- 47 in both years. Significantly higher grain yield in this hybrid combination was achieved when line F- 7 R was used as a female parent and significantly higher number of kernel rows per ear was achieved when line BL- 47 was used as a female parent...|$|R
40|$|Although {{only about}} 3 {{years have passed}} since the {{preparation}} of the original manuscript of this book for the Russian edition, the number of successful experiments on somatic hybridization of higher plants has doubled. Although the main inferences of the first edition still remain in force, most of them have received conclusive experimental support and, moreover, some new con­ clusions have been drawn. It can be expected that these inferences and conclusions will constitute a more or less durable foundation for somatic cell genetics of higher plants. We thus hope this book will also remain useful over the next years, in spite of the rapid progress of experiments and {{the increase in the number}} of scientific reports in this field. Though it might appear strange to an uninvolved observer, the principal progress in hybridization of somatic cells of higher plants has been due to plant physiologists (who entered the field by elaborating methods and techniques for plant cell and, later, for isolated protoplast culture) rather than plant geneticists. However, further qualitative improvement in this field is inconceivable without the instillation of genetic ideology and the strict logic of genetic experiments. The main purpose ofthis book is the attempt to organize the available experimental data in terms and cate­ gories of genetic analysis. For this reason, this book lays no claim on being a comprehensive treatise on somatic hybridization. 1 Introduction. - 2 Techniques of Parasexual Hybridization. - 2. 1 Culture Techniques. - 2. 1. 1 Culture of Isolated Plant Protoplasts. - 2. 1. 2 Culture of Single Cells and Protoplasts. - 2. 2 Isolated Protoplast Stage and Plant Cell Engineering. - 2. 2. 1 Protoplast Fusion. - 2. 2. 2 Cell Reconstruction Involving Fusion of Subprotoplasts. - 2. 2. 3 Cell Modification Through Uptake of Isolated Cell Organelles by Plant Protoplasts. - 2. 3 Problems of Genetic Variability. - 2. 3. 1 Genetic Variability Associated with in Vitro Manipulation of Plant Cells. - 2. 3. 2 Genetic Changes in Cells Induced During the Stage of Isolated Protoplasts. - 3 Protoplast Fusion and Parasexual Hybridization of Higher Plants. - 3. 1 Perspectives. - 3. 1. 1 Terminology. - 3. 1. 2 History of Parasexual Hybridization of Higher Plants. - 3. 2 Methods of Screening for Parasexual Hybrids. - 3. 2. 1 Introduction. - 3. 2. 2 Genetic Complementation. - 3. 2. 3 Physiological Complementation. - 3. 2. 4 Restoration of Growth Capacity in Hybrids Upon Fusion of Inactivated Cells. - 3. 2. 5 Mechanical Isolation. - 3. 2. 6 Physical Enrichment. - 3. 3 Frequency of Formation of Parasexual Hybrids. - 3. 4 Protoplast Fusion and the Bypassing of Sexual Barriers. - 3. 5 Analysis of the Parasexual Hybridization Process and the Genetic Composition of Plant Forms Arising from Protoplast Fusion. - 3. 5. 1 General Guidelines. - 3. 5. 2 Genetic Methods of Analysis. - 3. 5. 2. 1 Hybrid Crosses. - 3. 5. 2. 2 Cloning. - 3. 5. 2. 3 Cytogenetic Studies. - 3. 5. 2. 4 Cytophotometric Measurement of Nuclear DNA Content. - 3. 5. 3 Biochemical Analysis. - 3. 5. 3. 1 Multiple Molecular Forms of Enzymes. - 3. 5. 3. 2 Analysis of Fraction I Protein. - 3. 5. 3. 3 Restriction Endonuclease Analysis of Chloroplast and Mitochondrial DNA. - 3. 5. 3. 4 Molecular Hybridization of Nucleic Acids. - 3. 5. 3. 5 Analysis of Low Molecular Weight Substances. - 4 Transmission Genetics of Parasexual Hybridization in Closely Related Crosses. - 4. 1 General Considerations. - 4. 1. 1 Perspectives and Philosophy of Analysis of Transmission Genetics. - 4. 1. 2 Initial Experiments on Transmission Genetics of Parasexual Hybrids. - 4. 1. 3 Hybridization of More Than Two Parental Cells. - 4. 2 Fate of Extranuclear Genetic Determinants. - 4. 2. 1 Perspectives. - 4. 2. 2 Protoplast Fusion and the Formation of Cytoplasmic Heterozygotes. - 4. 2. 3 Mitotic Segregation of <b>Plasmagenes</b> and the Sorting Out of Parental Genotypes. - 4. 2. 4 Recombination of <b>Plasmagenes.</b> - 4. 3 Fate of Nuclear Genes in the Process of Somatic Hybridization. - 4. 3. 1 Segregation of Nuclei. - 4. 3. 2 Chromosome Sets of Hybrid Cells. - 4. 4 Transmission Genetics in Hybridization Systems Utilizing Parental Cell Inactivation. - 4. 4. 1 Consideration of Animal and Bacterial Systems. - 4. 4. 2 Treatment with Iodoacetate. - 4. 4. 3 Irradiation. - 4. 5 Genetic Diversity of Hybrid Plants Obtained by Protoplast Fusion. - 5 Protoplast Fusion and Hybridization of Distantly Related Plant Species. - 5. 1 Introduction. - 5. 2 Initial Stages of Culture of Hybrid Cells of Distantly Related Plant Species. - 5. 3 Interfamily Cell Hybrids of Higher Plants. - 5. 4 Intertribal Hybrids of Higher Plants. - 5. 4. 1 Hybridization of Cruciferae Species. - 5. 4. 2 Hybridization of Distantly Related Members of the Solanaceae and Other Families. - 5. 4. 3 General Conclusions of Results Obtained with Intertribal Hybrids of Higher Plants. - 5. 5 Intergeneric Hybrids. - 5. 6 Influence of Physical and Chemical Factors on the Fate of Genetic Material in Distantly Related Species Combinations. - 5. 6. 1 Introduction. - 5. 6. 2 Irradiation and the Induction of Genetic Asymmetry. - 5. 6. 3 Induction of Mitotic Chromosome Segregation by Chemical Agents. - 6 Use of Somatic Hybridization. - 6. 1 Genetic Analysis Using Parasexual Hybridization. - 6. 1. 1 Introduction and Perspective. - 6. 1. 2 Analysis of the Nature of Inherited Traits. - 6. 1. 3 Analysis of Nuclear Genes. - 6. 1. 3. 1 Resistance to 5 -Methyltryptophan. - 6. 1. 3. 2 Resistance to S-(2 -Aminoethyl) -L-Cysteine. - 6. 1. 3. 3 Resistance to Cycloheximide. - 6. 1. 3. 4 Resistance to Azetidine- 2 -Carboxylate. - 6. 1. 3. 5 Additional Complementation Studies. - 6. 1. 4 Cosegregation of Extranuclear Genes. - 6. 1. 5 Analysis of Mitotic Cycle Mechanisms. - 6. 1. 6 Analysis of the Mechanisms of Differentiation and Morphogenesis. - 6. 2 Practical Use of Somatic Cell Hybridization. - 6. 2. 1 Introduction. - 6. 2. 2 Bypassing of Incompatibility in Interspecific Hybridization. - 6. 2. 3 Reconstruction of Cytoplasmic Genomes. - 6. 2. 4 Transfer of Cytoplasmic Genomes and Cytoplasmic Male Sterility. - 7 Conclusion. - References...|$|R
