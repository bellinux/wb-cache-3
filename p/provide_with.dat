5|$|Chopra is a {{supporter}} of environmental charities and is brand ambassador for NDTV Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and provide solar power to rural villages without electricity supplies. She appeared with children in an animated video to support the cause, and removed rubbish from {{the banks of the}} Yamuna river in Agra to increase awareness of environmental issues. During the third and fourth editions of Greenathon, She adopted up to seven villages to <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> a regular supply of electricity. She adopted a tigress in 2011 and a lioness in 2012 at the Birsa biological park, paying for both animals' upkeep for a year. To promote organ donation, Chopra pledged to donate her own organs after death and was co-keynote speaker at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Bollywood-themed 20th-anniversary celebration of its liver-transplant programme in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Tripura {{has high}} {{incidence}} of open defecation, especially in the interior hilly and forest areas. The state has extensively implemented Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and currently the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and convergence with MGNREGS to address this problem. Schools and Anganwadi Center are focussed to <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> urinals and latrines, separate {{for boys and girls}} aling with baby friendly toilets in Anganwadi Centers to inculcate the habit of using sanitary latrines in young age. However many toilets lie dysfuncational due to lack of maintenance and damage. Earlier schemes of providing plastic squatting plates, free of cost to people, has not produced results as most of them lie unused as many people cannot afford to construct a toilet. Open defecation has created problems of diarrhoea and vulnerability to malaria. The Chief Minister of Tripura has envisioned to make the state Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2017.|$|E

He has recorded a series of public service announcements championing good health, child immunisation and proper nutrition, and joined India's Health Ministry and UNICEF in a nationwide child immunisation campaign as part of National Rural Health Mission of India. In 2011, he joined Amitabh Bachchan and Judi Dench to promote Resul Pookutty's foundation that works to improve the living conditions of underprivileged people in India. The same year, he received UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children, becoming the first Indian to win the accolade. During his multiple appearances at the NDTV Greenathon, Khan has adopted up to twelve villages to <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> electricity {{as part of the}} solar energy harnessing project's initiative Light A Billion Lives.|$|E

25|$|After September 11, 2001, the Essex County Sheriff's Bomb Squad had a tenfold {{increase}} in requests for bomb detection. This caused {{a problem for}} New Jersey Transit, according to the agency’s then police chief, Mary F. Rabadeau. At Penn Station in Newark, the transit authority had been dependent on the Essex County Sheriff's bomb squad to respond to every bomb threat or suspicious parcel. That disrupted the station, sometimes for hours, having an immense impact on transportation in the area, because the station is host to hundreds of daily Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains, plus two rapid transit lines and intercity and local buses. The best resource the agency could <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> the most apparent and immediate impact was canine bomb-detection teams. After interviewing people at other agencies that had their own canine bomb-detection squads, New Jersey Transit chose the Essex County Sheriff's Office to train the transit police on New Jersey Transit property—on trains and buses and in stations and other facilities where the teams would be working.|$|E
500|$|Beadle {{agreed with}} Smith that a deal ending UDI without any prior {{agreement}} on the replacement constitution would meet with widespread opposition among white Rhodesians, but still felt that Salisbury should agree. He asked Smith to commend the terms to his colleagues in Salisbury, speculating {{that if he did}} the Cabinet would surely accept. Smith refused to make such a commitment, much to the disappointment of Beadle and Gibbs, and signed the final document only to acknowledge it as an accurate record. Wilson was furious with Beadle, feeling that he should have taken a far firmer line to persuade Smith to settle; after Beadle left the meeting, Wilson said that he [...] "could not understand how any man could have a slipped disc whom Providence had failed to <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> a backbone". Beadle and Gibbs urged Smith to reconsider during the journey home, but made little headway.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} used rats {{to examine}} the effect of a single bout of voluntary activity (wheel running) on the acquisition, extinction, and reconsolidation of context conditioned fear. In Experiment 1, rats <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to a wheel for 3 h immediately before or after a shocked exposure to a context froze more when tested in that context than rats <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to the wheels 6 h after the shocked exposure or rats not <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to the wheels. In Experiment 2, rats <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to the wheels immediately before or after a nonshocked exposure to the conditioned context froze less when tested in that context than rats <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to the wheels 6 h after the nonshocked exposure or rats not <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to the wheels. In Experiment 3, rats <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to wheels immediately after an extended nonshocked exposure to the conditioned context again froze less, whereas rats <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> access to the wheels after a brief nonshocked exposure froze more on the subsequent test than sedentary controls. These results show that a single bout of running can enhance acquisition, extinction, and reconsolidation of context conditioned fear. © 2014 Siette et al...|$|R

60|$|In {{the course}} of the present session of Congress a bill was {{introduced}} for apportioning representatives among the people of the several States, according to the first enumeration. The constitution had provided that the number of representatives should not exceed one for every thirty thousand persons, and the House of Representatives passed a bill allotting to each State one member for this amount of population. This ratio would leave a fraction, greater or less, in each State. Its operation was unequal, as in some States a large surplus would be unrepresented, and hence, in one branch of the legislature, the relative power of the State be affected. That, too, was the popular branch, which those who feared a strong executive, desired to <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> the counterpoise of as full a representation as possible.|$|E

60|$|The {{spirit of}} oppression, {{the spirit of}} servility, {{and the spirit of}} fraud, these are the {{immediate}} growth of the established administration of property. They are alike hostile to intellectual improvement. The other vices of envy, malice, and revenge are their inseparable companions. In a state of society where men lived in the midst of plenty and where all shared alike the bounties of nature, these sentiments would inevitably expire. The narrow principle of selfishness would vanish. No man being obliged to guard his little store or <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> anxiety and pain for his restless wants, each would lose his individual existence in the thought of the general good. No man would be an enemy to his neighbour, for they would have no subject of contention, and, of consequence, philanthropy would resume the empire which reason assigns her.

This beautiful fabric of imagination vanishes at the severe touch of truth. The spirit of benevolence, cherished and invigorated by plenty, is repressed by the chilling breath of want. The hateful passions that had vanished reappear. The mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul. The temptations to evil are too strong for human nature to resist. The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions, and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in for the support of the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food. The rosy flush of health gives place to the pallid cheek and hollow eye of misery. Benevolence, yet lingering in a few bosoms, makes some faint expiring struggles, till at length self-love resumes his wonted empire and lords it triumphant over the world.|$|E
