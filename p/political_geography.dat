During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern <b>political</b> <b>geography.</b> For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} topics covered by Banglapedia {{includes}} <b>political</b> <b>geography,</b> religion, literature, art and architecture, folk practices and institutions, indigenous and colonial administration, politics, society, economy, ethnicity, and the sciences. All 64 districts of Bangladesh, as well as 451 upazilas, have been described in details ranging from topographical accounts {{to the number of}} dairy farms and hatcheries. Over 2,000 single- and four-colour illustrations depict Bangladeshi art and architecture, everyday life, cities and villages and personages. It has about 2,100 cross-references, cartographic information, tables and statistics. It is laid out in alphabetical order and is prefaced by an essay by the Chief Editor. There is a section explaining how to use the Banglapedia, which clarifies issues such as date systems, contributors, cross references, and headings.|$|E

25|$|In rapidly {{expanding}} western states, the Federalists had few supporters. Every state had a distinct <b>political</b> <b>geography</b> that shaped party membership. In Pennsylvania, the Republicans were weakest around Philadelphia and strongest in Scots-Irish {{settlements in the}} west. Members came from all social classes, but came predominantly from the poor, subsistence farmers, mechanics and tradesmen. After the War of 1812, partisanship subsided across the young republic—people called it the Era of Good Feelings. James Monroe narrowly won the party's nomination for President in Congress over William Crawford in 1816 and defeated Federalist Rufus King in the general election.|$|E

When New York City was consolidated into its present form in 1898, all previous town and county governments within it were abolished {{in favor of the}} present five boroughs and a unified, centralized city government.

25|$|The book {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2025, after the world's climate has {{recovered}} from the devastation of the meteors. The <b>political</b> <b>geography</b> of the time is dramatically different from our own world, and innovations such as the airplane and combustion engine are only beginning to reach prominence. The Angrezi Raj (formerly the British Empire), centered in its former colonies in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, is the most powerful nation on Earth. It stands alongside other surviving world powers, including France-outre-mer (a European-settled North Africa), the Caliphate of Damascus (a united Middle East), the Empire of Dai-Nippon (a Japanese-ruled China and Far East), and the Russian Empire (a remnant of the original, now located in central Asia).|$|E
25|$|The <b>political</b> <b>geography</b> of the Chajoma is {{described}} in some detail in {{a small group of}} early colonial documents composed by the Chajoma leadership. At its greatest extent, the Chajoma kingdom covered an area of 900–1000km². It was bounded on the north by the Motagua River, on the east with the Las Vacas River, by San Pedro Ayampuc in the southeast, the River Chalcayá on the southwest and the River Quisayá to the west. Their neighbour to the south was the Poqomam kingdom, with its capital at Chinautla Viejo (Old Chinautla, identified as the Mixco Viejo of Colonial period records). To the west they were bordered by the Kaqchikel kingdom based at Iximche. This territory includes the northern third of the department of Guatemala and includes both the cooler highland area to the south and the hotter lowlands of the Motagua Valley to the north. The latter is a challenging area for agriculture, with the poor soil of the steep-sided lowland river valleys consisting of semi-weathered metamorphic schistose. The best land for agriculture lies in the southern highland portion of the Chajoma territory, with settlement concentrating there from the Classic Period onwards.|$|E

500|$|Rupert is {{considered}} {{to have been a}} quick-thinking and energetic cavalry general, but ultimately undermined by his youthful impatience in dealing with his peers during the Civil War.

As a colonial governor, Rupert shaped the <b>political</b> <b>geography</b> of modern Canada—Rupert's Land was named in his honour. [...] He also {{played a role in the}} early African slave trade.
