40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the manuscript “Soil-atmosphere exchange of ammonia in a non-fertilized grassland: measured emission potentials and inferred fluxes ” by G. R. Wentworth et al. It provides an observational large scale characterization of NH 3 (and other chemicals) during a 50 -day campaign over a non-fertilized grassland in Ontario, CA. The {{results show that the}} emission potential for non-fertilized grasslands is way below (up to 2 orders of magnitude) the values proposed in previous studies for fertilized lands. The NH 3 fluxes obtained during the campaign were also validated against previous literature showing a relative good agreement. An analysis using a Lagrangian model assesses the air <b>parcel</b> <b>history</b> and therefore identifies the possible impact of various emission sources on the chemical composition. The authors have found that NH 3 – contrarily to all the other chemicals investigated- does not show a bias due to the different air mass directions, suggesting that the NH 3 near surface is mainly controlled by emission/deposition rather than horizontal advection or entrainment. This is somewhat surprising since non-fertilized grasslands have a lower emission potential if compared to fertilized lands – as also mentioned in this manuscript. Maybe some extra clarification ca...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a {{nighttime}} profile of OClO in the Arctic vortex {{during the winter of}} 2000 is overestimated, by nearly a factor of 2, using an isentropic trajectory model constrained by observed profiles of ClOx (ClO + 2 X ClOOCl) and BrO. Calculated abundances of nighttime OClO are shown {{to be sensitive to the}} abundance of BrOx (BrO + BrCl), details of the air <b>parcel</b> <b>history</b> during the most recent sunrise/sunset transitions, and the BrCl yield from the reaction BrO + ClO. Many uncertainties are considered, and the discrepancy between measured and modeled nighttime OClO appears to be robust. This discrepancy suggests that production of OClO occurs more slowly than implied by standard photochemistry. If the yield of BrCl from the reaction of BrO + ClO is increased from 7 % (JPL 2002 value) to 11 % (near the upper limit of the uncertainty), good agreement is found between measured and modeled nighttime OClO. This study highlights the importance of accurate knowledge of BrO + ClO reaction kinetics as well as air parcel trajectories for proper interpretation of nighttime OClO. These factors have a considerably smaller impact on the interpretation of OClO observations obtained during twilight (90 (deg) <=SZA <= 92 (deg)), when photolytic processes are still active...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} N_ 2 O isotopic {{fractionation}} {{in the stratosphere}} may be understood {{within the limits of}} the standard photochemical models if mass-dependent photodissociation rates for the various N_ 2 O isotopomers are incorporated. Thus, we conclude that there is no demonstrable reason to invoke a significant chemical source of N_ 2 O in the middle atmosphere. This paper presents a general theory for isotopomer dependent photodissociation rates that accounts for the isotopic fractionation observed in stratospheric N_ 2 O and how photodissociations appear to be both a source and a sink of N_ 2 O in the middle atmosphere. Photo-induced isotopic fractionation effects (PHIFE), explain the distinct fractionation signatures found for ^(15) N/^(14) N and ^(18) O/^(16) O ratios in both laboratory and remote sensing measurements. Furthermore, PHIFE predicts substantially different isotopic fractionations in the stratosphere for the isotopomers ^(15) N^(14) N^(16) O and ^(14) N^(15) N^(16) O, which have identical molecular weights but different isotopic substitution sites. Modeling results based on this theory suggest that there is no demonstrable reason to invoke a significant chemical source of N_ 2 O in the middle atmosphere and that N_ 2 O multi-isotope correlations should prove a useful measure of stratospheric air <b>parcel</b> <b>history...</b>|$|E

The perturbations are added instantaneously {{and allowed to}} evolve freely afterward. The parcel model reproduces most {{of the changes in}} the LES-simulated cloudy updraft statistics in response to the perturbations. Analyses of <b>parcel</b> <b>histories</b> show that a positive temperature perturbation forms a buoyancy barrier, which preferentially eliminates parcels that start with lower equivalent potential temperature or have experienced heavy entrainment. Besides the amount of entrainment, the height at which parcels entrain is also important in determining their fate. Parcels entraining at higher altitudes are more likely to overcome the buoyancy barrier than those entraining at lower altitudes. Stochastic entrainment is key for the parcel model to reproduce the LES results. Responses to environmental moisture perturbations are quite small compared to those to temperature perturbations because changing environmental moisture is ineffective in modifying buoyancy in the BOMEX shallow cumulus case. The second part of the paper further explores the feasibility of a stochastic parcel–based cumulus parameterization.

40|$|Aerosol {{radiative}} forcing estimates suffer from large uncertainties {{as a result}} of insufficient understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions. The main source of these uncertainties is dynamical processes such as turbulence and entrainment but also key aerosol parameters such as aerosol number concentration and size distribution, and to a much lesser extent, the composition. From June to August 2011 a Cloud and Aerosol Characterization Experiment (CLACE 2011) was performed at the high-alpine research station Jungfraujoch (Switzerland, 3580 m a. s. l.) focusing on the activation of aerosol to form liquid-phase clouds (in the cloud base temperature range of − 8 to 5 °C). With a box model the sensitivity of the effective peak supersaturation (SS peak), an important parameter for cloud activation, to key aerosol and dynamical parameters was investigated. The updraft velocity, which defines the cooling rate of an air parcel, was found to have the greatest influence on SS peak. Small-scale variations in the cooling rate with large amplitudes can significantly alter CCN activation. Thus, an accurate knowledge of the air <b>parcel</b> <b>history</b> is required to estimate SS peak. The results show that the cloud base updraft velocities estimated from the horizontal wind measurements made at the Jungfraujoch can be divided by a factor of approximately 4 to get the updraft velocity required for the model to reproduce the observed SS peak. The aerosol number concentration and hygroscopic properties were found to be less important than the aerosol size in determining SS peak. Furthermore turbulence is found to have a maximum influence when SS peak is between approximately 0. 2 and 0. 4 %. Simulating the small-scale fluctuations with several amplitudes, frequencies and phases, revealed that independently of the amplitude, the effect of the frequency on SS peak shows a maximum at 0. 46 Hz (median over all phases) and at higher frequencies, the maximum SS peak decreases again...|$|E

Unlike in advanced democracies where parties are key agents of political socialization and leadership, parties in West Africa are built on ethno-religious foundations. A peculiar character of highly marginalized youth thus becomes inevitable, both in politics and decision-making processes of the state. To assert themselves, the youth have also become agents of destabilization of the democracy they partook to build. Apart from their involvement in political violence, youths are now available as unconscientious “foot soldiers” of ethnic militias and terrorist groups that are constituting increased social problems in West Africa.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{goals of}} this study are to 1) quantify the link between aerosols, low-level clouds, and meteorology, and 2) evaluate model representation of aerosol-cloud interactions. Recent in-situ and remote sensing studies indicate that meteorological effects which influence cloud liquid water path dominate the aerosol signal in stratocumulus clouds. To address this issue, Chapter II undertakes a synoptic-scale investigation of aerosol-cloud interactions. Using parcel back-trajectories, we develop a method to isolate meteorological from aerosol impacts on clouds, and evaluate results over the Northeast Atlantic stratocumulus regime. Using MODIS observations and ECMWF analyses, we show that controlling for variations in lower tropospheric stability reduces the dependence of cloud fraction on AOD by at least 24 %. We conclude that meteorological forcing must be accounted for in assessing aerosol impacts on cloud forcing, and that doing so requires a Lagrangian analysis of <b>parcel</b> <b>histories.</b> Chapter III extends the analysis in Chapter II by performing an in-depth analysis of the meteorological sensitivities of Northeast Atlantic stratocumulus clouds. Additional satellite observations are obtained from CERES, SSM/I and QuikScat. Compositing is used to quantify the sensitivity of cloud fraction to variations in meteorological state along 72 hour Lagrangian back trajectories. Clouds are found to respond to variations in stability, free tropospheric humidity, and sea surface temperature (SST) advection over long time scales while being influenced by changes in surface divergence over much shorter time scales. Cloud sensitivity to both divergence and stability is shown to be robust and not significantly affected through covariance with other forcings. An additional finding is that the sign of the relationship between cloud fraction and several quantities, including divergence, temperature advection, and surface fluxes, is reversed for long time lags. Along with the differences in stability, SST, and boundary layer humidity that are maintained throughout the trajectories, it is suggested that these point to decoupling of the cloud and sub-cloud layers as a possible cause for cloud dissipation. In contrast, the large cloud fraction composite appears to be more shallow and well-mixed at earlier times in the trajectory, thus maintaining a strong coupling with the surface. In Chapter IV, the observational sensitivities observed in Chapters II and III are compared with model representations of aerosol-cloud interactions. Since model parameterizations of aerosol-cloud interactions can be switched on or off, climate simulations can be used to separately quantify the impacts of aerosols and meteorology on cloud cover. Both the ECMWF and GFDL models are analyzed using the trajectory method developed in previous chapters. Both are consistent with Chapter II in showing that a significant fraction of the correlation between AOD and CF results from meteorological covariations. However, the two differ significantly in the magnitude of the correction and in their representation of low-level clouds. The ECMWF model, which shows a 43 % correction to the AOD-CF sensitivity, also shows a weak correlation (R^ 2 = 14. 4 %) when MODIS cloud cover is compared with ECMWF cloud cover predictions. Alternatively, if the dynamical sensitivities of MODIS clouds are compared to those of the ECMWF clouds, the two compare reasonably well. In contrast, the GFDL model shows a 100 % correction, indicating that within the confidence limits of our analysis, low-level cloud cover is not affected by changes in aerosol. However, the GFDL model's treatment of clouds does not compare well with the observational cloud sensitivities identified in Chapter III. Since the model results are only relevant to the observational analysis if the simulations accurately represent cloud cover, from these results {{it is not possible to}} quantitatively conclude on a corrected sensitivity of cloud cover to changes in aerosol optical depth. However, the results do qualitatively confirm the results of Chapter II. In addition, the Lagrangian technique developed in previous chapters proves useful in providing detailed diagnostic information on model performance, in particular as a means of testing cloud parameterizations...|$|R

The results show that the model with mixing parameterized from the large-scale flow deformations well reconstructs the observed asymmetric structure of the ExTL with a deeper transition layer on the cyclonic side of the jet stream. Information from the model and observations are integrated using tracer-tracer correlations between ozone (O- 3) and carbon monoxide (CO). Transport of chemical tracers from the stratospheric or tropospheric background to the ExTL through mixing is identified by the change of the CO-O- 3 correlation in the CO-O- 3 space. The ExTL formation process simulated by the model, therefore, provides a scenario to connect the mixed air <b>parcels</b> to the <b>history</b> of mixing. An estimate of timescales of ExTL formation is made using model experiments. The results show that the fastest formation of the ExTL occurs on the isentropic levels below the subtropical jet core, e. g. around 3 weeks for 310 K, whereas at 360 K level (jet core) the formation of the ExTL needs around 3 months.

While {{not the first}} to use the word ‘culture’ more or less in its modern sense, he can certainly be credited with defining the concept and ensuring its wide adoption. One of his major works is entitled Primitive Culture (Tylor 1871), and in its introductory pages one reads: ‘To many educated minds there seems to be something presumptuous and repulsive in the view that the history of mankind is part and <b>parcel</b> of the <b>history</b> of nature, that our thoughts, wills, and actions accord with laws as definite as those which govern the motions of the waves, the combinations of acids and bases, and the growth if plants and animals’ (Tylor [1871] 1958, p. 2). A few pages later he refers directly to Quetelet and details the regularity of phenomena such as crime rates, exactly as documented by Quetelet. The following year he published a review of two of Quetelet’s major works, namely Physique Sociale and Anthropométrie (Tylor 1872). In this piece he refers with approval to Thomas Buckle’s doctrine of history’s inexorable laws.
