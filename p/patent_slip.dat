5|$|Several old {{building}}s, which {{date from}} the 1880s, remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the hydraulic engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic engine house itself. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery, installed in 1907 by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, which powers the dock's hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks. The former pattern-maker's shop and stores {{date from the}} same period and are grade II listed, as are the <b>Patent</b> <b>slip</b> and quay walls.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, a <b>Patent</b> <b>Slip</b> Dock for ship repairs {{was built}} at Pointhouse. This was an {{innovative}} {{alternative to a}} dry dock, invented by Robert Napier. The vessel sat on a big trolley, which was on rails, and was hauled up onto dry land by a powerful winch. The yard had up to 2,000 employees on just 18 acres of ground plus approximately 300 workers at the former premises of the company in Whitehall Foundry.|$|E

5000|$|In 1938, Oppenheimer {{transferred}} {{title in}} his U.S. Patent No. 2,199,868 to Comfy, but retained a reversionary {{interest in it}} as well as rights to royalties on <b>patented</b> <b>slip</b> covers and 25% of any patent infringement damages. Comfy began to enforce the Oppenheimer patent by suing retailers only and demanding, as the condition for settlement, discontinuance of the sale of competitors' goods and adoption of the Comfy line. In 1938 Comfy sued and settled with Hecht's of New York, a Sure-Fit customer; Hecht agreed to Comfy's terms and Comfy dismissed the suit. When Sure-Fit found its customers receiving notices of infringement and being threatened with suit, it sought an opinion from its attorney, who informed it [...] "that there was no possibility of the Oppenheimer patent being sustained in an adequately contested suit." [...] In 1928 Sure-Fit filed a suit against Comfy, in the Southern District of New York, seeking to have the Oppenheimer patent declared invalid and charging Comfy with unfair competition and violation of the antitrust laws. In October 1938, Comfy and Sure-Fit, with Oppenheimer's approval, entered into an agreement, the basic document of the alleged conspiracy; Sure-Fit then dismissed its suit against Comfy, by stipulation of counsel.|$|R
5000|$|Patents {{have also}} been criticized for being granted on already-known inventions, with some {{complaining}} in the United States that the USPTO fails [...] "to do a serious job of examining patents, thus allowing bad <b>patents</b> to <b>slip</b> through the system." [...] On the other hand, some argue that because of low number of patents going into litigation, increasing quality of patents at patent prosecution stage increases overall legal costs associated with patents, and that current USPTO policy is a reasonable compromise between full trial on examination stage on one hand, and pure registration without examination, on the other hand.|$|R
50|$|The harbour {{is located}} {{at the mouth of the}} River Dart (the name 'Dart' is Brythonic Celtic meaning 'river where oak trees grow'), which rises high on Dartmoor, and enters the sea at Dartmouth. The river begins as two {{separate}} branches (the East Dart and West Dart), which join at Dartmeet. The rivers are crossed by a number of clapper bridges, notably at the hamlet of Postbridge. At Totnes a weir (of the 17th century vintage rebuilt in the 1960s) has been constructed across the river. The river reach between the Totnes weir and the port is tidal and hence navigable, and there are no bridges across the river in this reach. The banks of the lower Dart are covered in ancient woodland of native oak. The entrance to the river from the sea is rocky with cliffs on either side. The lower section of the River Dart forms the Dartmouth Harbour, a deep water natural harbour with a long history of maritime usage.The low coast line rises gradually. The harbour entrance is 5 mi to the south west of Berry Head. On the east side, Kingswear Castle is located very close to the water's edge, and on the west side, Dartmouth Castle is built on a rocky promontory. Visible landmarks from the entrance to the harbour are: the outline of Dartmoor Range which has granite peaks of Hayton (rugged peak); Rippon with single carn 1525 ft; Stoke Fleming Church built on a high ground, about 1.75 mi to the west of the entrance; and Mewstone, a rocky islet about 0.75 mi east of the entrance. Dartmouth is located on the right bank of the estuary.The tide rise is about 14 ft and the <b>patent</b> <b>slips</b> are of 250 ft and 450 ft length, capable of berthing large vessels. Navigation up to Totnes is possible for 10 mi along the River Dart. Blackstone rock, 8 ft above high water level, is a landmark for ships to bypass shoals at the entrance. Entrance to the bay is 220 yard m wide between the rocks but as it widens into the harbour it provides enough room for vessels of any draught and fairly large capacity to berth safely. However, during rough weather it is dangerous to navigate through the entrance due to the rough rocky faces, and for miles without any sand bars for protection.|$|R
2500|$|A marine railway {{is similar}} to a canal {{inclined}} plane in that it moves boats up or down a slope on rails.

[See Note 1.] It is also {{the seat of the}} Supreme Court and of the University of the Cape of Good Hope. It possesses a first-rate [...] "South African museum," [...] two cathedrals, many churches, a castle, fort, barracks, and other buildings too numerous to mention.

6000|$|Captain Whalley {{had lifted}} his head to look, and his mind, {{disturbed}} in its meditation, turned with wonder (as men's minds will do) to matters of no importance. It struck {{him that it was}} to this port, where he had just sold his last ship, that he had come with the very first he had ever owned, and with his head full of a plan for opening a new trade with a distant part of the Archipelago. The then governor had given him no end of encouragement. No Excellency he--this Mr. Denham--this governor with his jacket off; a man who tended night and day, so to speak, the growing prosperity of the settlement with the self-forgetful devotion of a nurse for a child she loves; a lone bachelor who lived as in a camp with the few servants and his three dogs in what was called then the Government Bungalow: a low-roofed structure on the half-cleared slope of a hill, with a new flagstaff in front and a police orderly on the veranda. He remembered toiling up that hill under a heavy sun for his audience; the unfurnished aspect of the cool shaded room; the long table covered at one end with piles of papers, and with two guns, a brass telescope, a small bottle of oil with a feather stuck in the neck at the other--and the flattering attention given to him by the man in power. It was an undertaking full of risk he had come to expound, but a twenty minutes' talk in the Government Bungalow on the hill had made it go smoothly from the start. And as he was retiring Mr. Denham, already seated before the papers, called out after him, [...] "Next month the Dido starts for a cruise that way, and I shall request her captain officially to give you a look in and see how you get on." [...] The Dido was one of the smart frigates on the China station--and five-and-thirty years make a big slice of time. Five-and-thirty years ago an enterprise like his had for the colony enough importance to be looked after by a Queen's ship. A big slice of time. Individuals were of some account then. Men like himself; men, too, like poor Evans, for instance, with his red face, his coal-black whiskers, and his restless eyes, who had set up the first <b>patent</b> <b>slip</b> for repairing small ships, {{on the edge of the}} forest, in a lonely bay three miles up the coast. Mr. Denham had encouraged that enterprise too, and yet somehow poor Evans had ended by dying at home deucedly hard up. His son, they said, was squeezing oil out of cocoa-nuts for a living on some God-forsaken islet of the Indian Ocean; but it was from that <b>patent</b> <b>slip</b> in a lonely wooded bay that had sprung the workshops of the Consolidated Docks Company, with its three graving basins carved out of solid rock, its wharves, its jetties, its electric-light plant, its steam-power houses--with its gigantic sheer-legs, fit to lift the heaviest weight ever carried afloat, and whose head could be seen like the top of a queer white monument peeping over bushy points of land and sandy promontories, as you approached the New Harbor from the west.|$|E
6000|$|In {{these letters}} to Selwyn, we are made acquainted {{with a whole}} society of these defunct fine gentlemen: and can watch with a curious {{interest}} a life, which the novel-writers of that time, I think, have scarce touched upon. To Smollett, to Fielding even, a lord was a lord: a gorgeous being with a blue ribbon, a coroneted chair, and an immense star on his bosom, to whom commoners paid reverence. Richardson, a man of humbler birth than either of the above two, owned that he was ignorant regarding the manners of the aristocracy, and besought Mrs. Donnellan, a lady {{who had lived in}} the great world, to examine a volume of Sir Charles Grandison, and point out any errors which she might see in this particular. Mrs. Donnellan found so many faults, that Richardson changed colour; shut up the book; and muttered that it were best to throw it in the fire. Here, in Selwyn, we have the real original men and women of fashion of the early time of George III. We can follow them to the new club at Almack’s: we can travel over Europe with them: we can accompany them not only to the public places, but to their country-houses and private society. Here is a whole company of them; wits and prodigals; some persevering in their bad ways; some repentant, but relapsing; beautiful ladies, parasites, humble chaplains, led captains. Those fair creatures whom we love in Reynolds’s portraits, and who still look out on us from his canvases with their sweet calm faces and gracious smiles—those fine gentlemen who did us the honour to govern us; who inherited their boroughs; took their ease in their <b>patent</b> places; and <b>slipped</b> Lord North’s bribes so elegantly under their ruffles—we make acquaintance with a hundred of these fine folks, hear their talk and laughter, read of their loves, quarrels, intrigues, debts, duels, divorces; can fancy them alive if we read the book long enough. We can attend at Duke Hamilton’s wedding, and behold him marry his bride with the curtain-ring: we can peep into her poor sister’s death-bed: we can see Charles Fox cursing over the cards, or March bawling out the odds at Newmarket: we can imagine Burgoyne tripping off from St. James’s Street to conquer the Americans, and slinking back into the club somewhat crestfallen after his beating: we can see the young king dressing himself for the Drawing-room and asking ten thousand questions regarding all the gentlemen: we can have high life or low, the struggle at the Opera to behold the Violetta or the Zamperini—the Macaronis and fine ladies in their chairs trooping to the masquerade or Madame Cornelys’s—the crowd at Drury Lane to look at the body of Miss Ray, whom Parson Hackman has just pistolled—or we can peep into Newgate, where poor Mr. Rice the forger is waiting his fate and his supper. “You need not be particular about the sauce for his fowl,” says one turnkey to another: “for you know he is to be hanged in the morning.” “Yes,” replies the second janitor, “but the chaplain sups with him, and he is a terrible fellow for melted butter.” ...|$|R

A small stationary steam engine mounted on the traverser platform drove an endless screw, which was then used to slide the boat back into its shed.|$|E
