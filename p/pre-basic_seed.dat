40|$|The {{development}} of more efficient and productive systems for <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> potato production would {{improve the quality of}} the propagative material used by the potato growers, directly affecting the crop yields. A two-year experiment was carried out to evaluate the potato <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> production by two types of hydroponic systems (fibrocement tiles and articulated PVC gutters), two cultivars (`Baronesa ` and `Eliza`) and two types of propagative material (plants coming from in vitro culture and minitubers). The PVC gutters system was highly efficient. When using minitubers, this system reached multiplication rates up to 74 tubers per plant. Minitubers were more productive than in vitro plants, independent of cultivar and hydroponic system utilized...|$|E
40|$|In potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) seed {{certification}} programs, {{the use of}} in vitro plants, microtubers and minitubers as <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> are of great importance, especially {{in countries such as}} Peru, where {{there is a need to}} eradicate the informal production of the seed to promote new plantations. The present work had as objective to obtain of microtubers and minitubers as <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> in three Peruvian potato cultivars. When comparing the effect of both factors (method and cultivar) in the number of seeds per plant it was possible to state that with the exception of the cultivar 'Capiro', no differences were found between both methods of seed production for the rest of the cultivars. This result is very important since it shows that it is possible to use both methods of <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> production for cultivars 'Canchan' and 'Papa 3 '. In the cultivar 'Capiro' a greater number of minitubers was achieved per plant, but its low fresh mass, which could prevent its use as a basic seed. Other studies are required to adjust the culture conditions to achieve better results in this cultivar.   Keywords: certified seed, genotype, in vitro technique...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> potato {{material}} {{is used for}} basic seed (elite) and certified seed potato production. At this moment all basic seed {{material is}} imported into Republic of Serbia and Republic of Srpska, {{despite the fact that}} the method of in vitro tissue culture production of virus-free seed potato has been developed in both countries and there is a continuous demand for pre-basic and basic seed potato. Current total production is significantly lower than actual requirements. In the 80 s and 90 s of the previous century two modern facilities for production of virus-free seed potato and certified seed were built in Sokolac (Republic of Srpska) and Guča (Republic of Serbia). Although facilities were well-equipped, seed potato production was permanently ceased in 2000. The presence of high infection pressure dominated by potato virus Y is shown in the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Srpska. This paper gives an overview of <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> potato material production in both countries over the last two decades...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the SASHA project is to strengthen technical, financial and institutional capacities for the sustainable production of <b>pre-basic</b> sweetpotato <b>seed</b> in 11 sub-Saharan African countries. This flyer outlines the schematic of sweetpotato seed system and the progress made from June 2014 to July 2015 towards achieving this objective. It specifically summarizes work in developing and testing different seed system technologies to increase the multiplication rate for sweetpotato and improve the supply of quality, early generation seed; and exploring innovative partnership business models between public research programmes and private entities that may contribute to developing commercially viable seed systems.

40|$|The {{effect of}} genotype, seed {{category}} and year on yield components (number of spikelets per spike, grain number per spike, grain weight per spike and thousand grain weight) for three wheat genotypes were studied during a two-year research. Genotype PKB Lepoklasa and seed category <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> {{had the highest}} values for {{the largest number of}} the studied traits, while the genotype BG Merkur and the certified seed of the first generation had the lowest values. Higher values for the studied traits were found in 2010, compared to 2009. AMMI analysis established a significant effect of the interaction of factors and main components (PCA 1 and PCA 2) for all investigated traits except thousand grain weight. The genotype PKB Talas was the most stable, while the genotype PKB Lepoklasa was the least stable. Seed categories certified seed of the first generation and basic seed had similar reactions to the interaction between factors...|$|E
40|$|Scarcity of {{good quality}} seed is major {{obstacle}} to expanded potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in sub-saharan Africa (SSA). Constraints in availability and supply of seed potato are partly attributable to challenges in production of pre-basic which is an intermediary step necessary in production of seed tubers in the seed potato value chain. Aeroponic minutuber production is a relatively recent technology {{that has the potential}} to break the seed potato bottleneck in many SSA countries due to several advantages that it holds especially those related to high multiplication rates; typically (1 : 50 - 100) that arise from sequential harvesting. There are, however, a number of potential challenges which, if not addressed, can contribute to non attainment of the projected increases in seed availability and not only mess up the 3 generation (3 G) revolution strategy of boosting seed tuber production in SSA but also jeopardize the adoption of the technology. Besides problems associated with failure of electricity supply and management of nutrition, the Achilles‘ heel of aeroponic minituber production is probably the large variation in physiological age of resulting tubers due to sequential harvesting that takes place over several months during the production cycle. In the absence of cold storage facilities which are few and beyond the reach of many <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> potato growers in many SSA countries, harvested minitubers can either be at dormant, apical dominance, multiple sprouting or senile stage when they are required for planting with significant impacts on subsequent yields. This paper discusses the problems associated with physiological age in seed tuber systems based on aeroponic minitubers and proposes some approaches that may overcome these challenges to ensure that the promise of aeroponic minituber production is realized. The proposed approaches include the strategic application of dormancy inhibiting and dormancy promoting substances at various stages of aeroponic minituber production combined with the use of low cost storage systems such as the diffused light storage technology depending on the dormancy period of the variety (ies) being grown.
