25|$|Some of {{the bird}} species found here are Malabar {{whistling}} thrush; species of Bulbuls; Woodpeckers, Hornbills, pigeons, Drongos, Asian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> The sanctuary has been recently adopted under a tiger-conservation project called Project Tiger which is an initiative from the Indian government.|$|E
25|$|The monarchs are {{generally}} monogamous, with the pair bonds ranging {{from just a}} single season (as in the African <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher)</b> to life (the Elepaio). Only three species are known to engage in cooperative breeding; but many species are as yet unstudied. They {{are generally}} territorial, defending territories that are around 2 ha in size, but a few species may cluster their nesting sites closely together. Nesting sites may also be chosen close to aggressive species, for example leaden flycatchers nests may be located near the nests of the aggressive noisy friarbird. The nests are in turn often aggressively defended by monarch species. In all species the nest is an open cup on a branch, fork or twig. In some species the nests can be highly conspicuous.|$|E

50|$|According to Linné’s first {{description}} Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> {{were only}} distributed in India. Later ornithologists observed this spectacular bird in other areas, {{and based on}} differences in plumage of males described several subspecies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> inhabit a {{range of}} habitat types, from {{rainforest}} to montane forest, woodlands, savanna, mangroves, riparian forest, deciduous forests and bamboo groves, some species will also move into gardens and cultivated habitat.|$|R
25|$|The paradise flycatchers of {{the genus}} Terpsiphone have the widest {{distribution}} {{of any of the}} monarchs, ranging across almost all of sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Mascarenes and Seychelles, southern and eastern Asia as far as Korea, Afghanistan, the Philippines and the Lesser Sundas. The other <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> genus, Trochocercus, is restricted to Africa. The other exclusively Asian genus is the Hypothymis monarchs. The remaining genera are predominantly found in the Austro-Papuan and Oceania regions. A few monotypic genera are restricted to Pacific islands; these include the Chuuk monarch (Metabolus) in the Micronesian island of Chuuk, the Hawaiian Elepaio (Chasiempis) and the buff-bellied monarch (Neolalage) which is restricted to the islands of Vanuatu. Other Pacific genera are the shrikebills (Clytorhynchus) and the Mayrornis monarchs, both of which are found in Melanesia and west Polynesia, and the Pomarea monarchs which are exclusively Polynesian in origin.|$|E
25|$|The monarchs are {{a diverse}} family of {{passerine}} birds that are generally arboreal (with {{the exception of}} the magpie-larks). They are mostly slim birds and possess broad bills. The bills of some species are quite large and the heavy-set bills of the shrikebills are used to probe dead wood and leaves. The plumage of the family ranges from sombre, such as the almost monochrome black monarch, to spectacular, as displayed by the golden monarch. The tails are generally long and spectacularly so in the paradise flycatchers in the genus Terpsiphone. Sexual dimorphism in plumage can be subtle, as in the paperbark flycatcher, where the female is identical to the male except for a slight buff on the throat; striking, as in the Chuuk monarch where the male almost entirely white and the female entirely black; or non-existent, as in the Tahiti monarch. In some species, for example the Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> the males have two or more colour morphs.|$|E
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species.

50|$|The <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Terpsiphone), are a genus of bird in {{the family}} Monarchidae. The genus ranges across Africa and Asia, {{as well as a}} number of islands. A few species are migratory, but the {{majority}} are resident. The most telling characteristic of the genus is the long tail streamers of the males of many species. In addition to the long tails the males and females are sexually dimorphic and have rufous, black and white plumage.|$|R
50|$|The <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> {{have the}} widest {{distribution}} {{of any of}} the monarch flycatchers, ranging across sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia.

50|$|The drongos, {{subfamily}} Dicrurinae, are a subfamily {{of small}} passerine birds of the Old World tropics {{in the family}} Dicruridae. Originally the family included the single genus Dicrurus (subfamily Dicrurinae), but now it has been expanded to include the subfamilies Rhipidurinae (Australasian fantails), Monarchinae (monarchs and <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers)</b> and Grallininae (magpie-larks). The subfamily Dicrurinae contains two genera, the monotypic Chaetorhynchus, and Dicrurus, which contains about 25 species. The placement of the pygmy drongo (Chaetorhynchus papuensis) in the subfamily is in dispute on morphological and genetic grounds.|$|R
