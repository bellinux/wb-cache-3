5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey <b>product</b> <b>manager</b> Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price—US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017—and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect {{in order to try}} to sell more television sets. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{differences in}} antecedents {{and consequences of}} organizational intelligence in USA (N= 184) and UAE (N= 157). Important differences were predicted and found. Although USA and UAE <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> tend to be similar on some factors (e. g., declarative and procedural knowledge), the results revealed that there are significant differences between two countries on cultural and communication related antecedents, and product related consequences. For the antecedents, the differences exist on informal communication, clan culture and hierarchy culture. While USA <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> attached great importance to informal communication, UAE <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> attached least importance. Clan culture was rated very highly by USA <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> and very low by UAE <b>product</b> <b>managers.</b> However, UAE <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> attached great importance to hierarchy culture, while USA <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> attached least importance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to report {{findings}} from an empirical research study of the Polish machinery industry carried out by a team from Warsaw Technical University. This study aims to show the role and importance of material and non-material motivations in encouraging, developing and directing innovative activity in the machinery industry. The study was carried out among top management and <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> of industrial organizations. Survey results have allowed the authors to establish, first of all, what kinds of motives induce top management and <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> to undertake innovative activity and, secondly, which of these motives are more important and popular among the sample participants. The main conclusion is that non-material motivation plays a greater role than material motivation in stimulating top management and <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> to innovate in Polish industrial organizations. Thus, in order to stimulate industrial innovation, further non-material motivational techniques should be introduced in industrial settings. ...|$|R

The aim of the paper is to present partial results of an independent research and connect them with the knowledge base of knowledgable management and human factors in product management. The paper focuses on a set of requirements for qualifications, experience, knowledge and skills that are imposed on candidates for the position of “Brand Manager”. For the purposes of defining the research objectives, an assumption was made that a set of requirements for candidates will prove that brand <b>managers</b> and <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> are knowledgable workers. In order to meet this goal, the method of content analysis of job advertisements was used. Secondly, the research was focused on identifying and analysing the differences between the sets of requirements for <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> and brand managers. The analysis of the texts of job advertisements resulted in the requirements for knowledge and competency. It provided the information about what level of education, type and length of practical experience was preferred for the position of “Brand Manager”. The unexpected result was that the groups of technical knowledge and work experience of brand <b>managers</b> and <b>product</b> <b>managers</b> had statistically significant differences.
