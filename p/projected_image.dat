5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front <b>projected</b> <b>image</b> appear to recede.

5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The <b>projected</b> <b>image</b> of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we will {{introduce}} a method {{how to draw}} the orthogonal <b>projected</b> <b>images</b> of spherical conics (great circle, small circle, and conic on the sphere) in the Euclidean plane. The orthogonal <b>projected</b> <b>images</b> of spherical circles are conics in the plane. On the other hand, the orthogonal <b>projected</b> <b>images</b> of spherical conics are not conic but quartic in general. To construct these figures with basic drawing tools, stereographic projection plays an important role. The stereographic projection maps circles on the sphere to circles in the plane. Using this property, we can construct the orthogonal <b>projected</b> <b>images</b> of spherical circles in the plane. As for spherical conics, the famous Pascal’s theorem (mystic hexagon) is essential. The Pascal’s theorem is also valid for spherical geometry. Applying this theorem, we can also construct the orthogonal <b>projected</b> <b>images</b> of spherical conic in the plane. We will realize these constructions along with the dynamic geometry software Cabri II Plus. These constructions are very instructive to {{understand the importance of}} stereographic projection and also the great fun of conic. 1...|$|R

The image resolution is limited to (2-2.5nm), due to quantum mechanical effects and lateral variations in the electron velocity.|$|E

25|$|In {{semiconductor}} photolithography applications, {{depth of}} field is extremely important as integrated circuit layout features must be printed with high accuracy at extremely small size. The difficulty is that the wafer surface is not perfectly flat, but may vary by several micrometres. Even this small variation causes some distortion in the <b>projected</b> <b>image,</b> and results in unwanted variations in the resulting pattern. Thus photolithography engineers take extreme measures to maximize the optical {{depth of field}} of the photolithography equipment. To minimize this distortion further, semiconductor manufacturers may use chemical mechanical polishing to make the wafer surface even flatter before lithographic patterning.|$|E
25|$|French Jewish philosopher, mathematician, {{physicist}} and astronomer/astrologer Levi ben Gershon (1288–1344) (also known as Gersonides or Leo de Balneolis) made several astronomical observations using a camera obscura with a Jacob's staff, describing methods {{to measure the}} angular diameters of the sun, {{the moon and the}} bright planets Venus and Jupiter.

500|$|The {{technique}} {{consisted of}} a separate scenery projector set at a right-angle to the camera, and a half-silvered mirror placed at an angle in front that reflected the <b>projected</b> <b>image</b> forward {{in line with the}} camera lens onto a backdrop made of retroreflective material. The reflective directional screen behind the actors could reflect light from the <b>projected</b> <b>image</b> a hundred times more efficiently than the foreground subject did. The lighting of the foreground subject had to be balanced with the image from the screen, making the image from the scenery projector on the subject too faint to record. The exception was the eyes of the leopard in the [...] "Dawn of Man" [...] sequence, which glowed orange from the projector illumination. Kubrick described this as [...] "a happy accident".|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} song, Sophie Muller filmed a music video for [...] "Take Me Home" [...] which was {{released}} on the song's CD single. The video was also included in her video album Watch My Lips (2002).' It opens with Ellis-Bextor, {{dressed in a black}} one-strap dress, in front of a yellow-toned painting of a woman with red lips. Throughout the music video, Ellis-Bextor is seen in a variety of dresses and outfits—she appears {{standing in front of a}} green mural with a flowery large tablecloth, while dressing a see-through shirt, which reveals her black bra; other scene shows her with a dark green gown; other shows her with a flower and leaves pattern and holding a in front of a <b>projected</b> <b>image</b> which shows the Eiffel Tower from far. She also appears dressed in a green trench coat in another scene. Usually, costume and location scenes are accompanied by a change of gradient color, which are projected onto Ellis-Bextor. By the middle of the video, she walks across a street, surrounded by formally-dressed men, who dance around her and lift her. After the song's middle 8 plays, the lights of the street turn on and various French event posters are shown. The video concludes as they all enter a disco club. She also performed the track at the Read My Lips Tour (2002–03), serving as its encore. Ellis-Bextor would shortly introduce the song, with green eye makeup and red lipstick, dressed in a cream-colored dress and pink heels. As the backing track started playing, she would start singing and clapping her hands as the public imitated her, and the audience was showered with confetti.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and <b>projected</b> <b>image,</b> it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E
