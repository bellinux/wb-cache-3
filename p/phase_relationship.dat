25|$|Sensory dissonance and its two perceptual manifestations (beating and roughness) {{are both}} {{closely related to}} a sound signal's {{amplitude}} fluctuations. Amplitude fluctuations describe variations in the maximum value (amplitude) of sound signals relative to a reference point and {{are the result of}} wave interference. The interference principle states that the combined amplitude of two or more vibrations (waves) at any given time may be larger (constructive interference) or smaller (destructive interference) than the amplitude of the individual vibrations (waves), depending on their <b>phase</b> <b>relationship.</b> In the case of two or more waves with different frequencies, their periodically changing <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> results in periodic alterations between constructive and destructive interference, giving rise to the phenomenon of amplitude fluctuations.|$|E

25|$|If the two {{frequencies}} {{were exactly}} the same, their <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> {{would not change}} and both {{would appear to be}} stationary on the oscilloscope display. Since the two frequencies are not exactly the same, the reference appears to be stationary and the test signal moves.

25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is oriented so that it will pass one linear polarization and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate. This brings the two components back into their initial <b>phase</b> <b>relationship,</b> reestablishing the selected circular polarization.|$|E
25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedance—a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|E

If the autospectral densities of the outputs are specified, the <b>phase</b> <b>relationships</b> between the outputs that will minimize or maximize the trace of the input auto spectral density matrix are derived. It is shown that other <b>phase</b> <b>relationships</b> and ordinary coherence less than one {{will result in a}} trace intermediate between these extremes.

25|$|The {{microwave}} bridge contains {{both the}} microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source {{there is an}} isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} figure, the two {{orthogonal}} components {{have the same}} amplitudes and are 90° out of phase. In this case, one component is zero when the other component is at maximum or minimum amplitude. There are two possible <b>phase</b> <b>relationships</b> that satisfy this requirement: the x component can be 90° ahead of the y component {{or it can be}} 90° behind the y component. In this special case, the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane, so this polarization is called circular polarization.

2500|$|This {{derivation}} of the grating {{equation is}} based on an idealised grating.

When such an electron decays without external influence, emitting a photon, that is called [...] "spontaneous emission". The phase and direction associated with the photon that is emitted is random. A material with many atoms in such an excited state may thus result in radiation which has a narrow spectrum (centered around one wavelength of light), but the individual photons would have no common <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> and would also emanate in random directions.

2500|$|Another way to {{classify}} amplifiers {{is by the}} <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> of the input signal to the output signal. [...] An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or {{mirror image of the}} input as seen on an oscilloscope). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An emitter follower is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. Voltage follower is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} {{circular}} polarization {{and its relationship}} to other polarizations is often understood by thinking of the electric field as being divided into two components which are at right angles to each other. Refer to the second illustration on the right. The vertical component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in blue while the horizontal component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in green. Notice that the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component leads the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength. It is this quadrature <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> which creates the helix and causes the points of maximum magnitude of the vertical component to correspond with the points of zero magnitude of the horizontal component, and vice versa. The result of this alignment is that there are select vectors, corresponding to the helix, which exactly match the maxima of the vertical and horizontal components. (To minimize visual clutter these are the only helix vectors displayed.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Note that {{in these}} experiments, the only {{quantity}} that affects {{the result is the}} difference in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here. If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the <b>phase</b> <b>relationship</b> between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a fixed amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a varying amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's [...] "clock" [...] would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out.
