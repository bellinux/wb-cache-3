5|$|One of the {{earliest}} descriptions of a virus-infected <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in a}} poem written by the Japanese Empress Kōken (718–770), in which she describes a plant in summer with yellowing leaves. The plant, later identified as Eupatorium lindleyanum, is often infected with tomato yellow leaf curl virus.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{diversity}} of a harvested <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> {{be the result}} of genetic differences: a crop may have genes conferring early maturity or disease resistance Such traits collectively determine a crop's overall characteristics and their future potential. Diversity within a crop includes genetically-influenced attributes such as seed size, branching pattern, height, flower color, fruiting time, and flavor. Crops can also vary in less obvious characteristics such as their response to heat, cold, a drought, or their ability to resist specific diseases and pests.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, the <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> vary in colour due to altitude, {{the lower}} altitude <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> have pure white standards.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plants</b> <b>can</b> {{be grown}} from corms (similar to bulbs and tubers) or from seed, or the <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> be bought at garden centers or nurseries.|$|R
40|$|Invasive, {{non-indigenous}} <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> degrade {{water quality}} and fish habitat when they invade lakes, ponds, and streams. Changes in plant community architecture in lakes due to invasion by canopy-forming invasive aquatic <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> result in loss of native plant biodiversity and reduction of the structural complexity of the underwater habitat. Differences in photosynthetic biochemistry between non-indigenous and native <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> result in large diurnal pH and dissolved oxygen concentrations...|$|R
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> readily sprout from old wood. This {{is not the case}} for var.cunninghamii which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E
5|$|The ectomycorrhizae formed {{between the}} fungus and host <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be {{influenced}} by soil microorganisms present in the mycorrhizosphere. For example, soil bacteria from the genera Paenibacillus and Burkholderia alter the branching structure of the root, whereas Bacillus species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus {{does not require a}} specific soil but seems to prefer acidic and nutrient-deficient soil. Suillus luteus produces hydroxamic acid-based siderophores, which are compounds that can chelate iron and extract it from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions. Ignacio Chapela and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of S.luteus in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by S.luteus deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these might not be a remedy for rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|Diesel and {{gas engine}} power <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> {{be used for}} base load to {{stand-by}} power production due to their high overall flexibility. Such power <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> be started rapidly to meet the grid demands. These engines can be operated efficiently {{on a wide variety}} of fuels, adding to their flexibility.|$|R
25|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} finally allow the {{generation}} of electricity from biomass. The <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be chopped and converted as a whole, {{or it can be}} left alive so that waste saps from the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be converted by bacteria.|$|E

25|$|Cannas {{are largely}} free of pests, {{but in the}} US, plants {{sometimes}} fall victim to the canna leaf roller moth, and the resultant leaf damage, while not fatal to the <b>plant,</b> <b>can</b> be most distressing to a keen gardener.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the salt}} carried inland by {{constant}} onshore winds, only the hardiest varieties of small <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> thrive close to shore. Coastal strawberry and Pacific silverweed are common along the coast due to their reproductive advantages and salt tolerance.|$|E
25|$|The space {{required}} for a sewage treatment <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be reduced by using a membrane bioreactor to remove some wastewater from the mixed liquor prior to treatment. This results in a more concentrated waste product that can then be treated using the activated sludge process.|$|E
25|$|The {{abundance}} of the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be significantly reduced by applying glyphosate, imazapyr, {{a combination of}} both, or by cutting all visible stalks and filling the stems with glyphosate. However, these methods have not been proven to provide reliable long-term results in completely eliminating the treated population.|$|E

50|$|As {{nutrients}} {{tend to be}} rarely {{available to}} lithophytes or chasmophytes, many species of carnivorous <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> be viewed as being pre-adapted to life on rocks. By consuming prey, these <b>plants</b> <b>can</b> gather more nutrients than non-carnivorous lithophtytes. Examples include the pitcher plants Nepenthes campanulata and Heliamphora exappendiculata, many Pinguicula and several Utricularia species.|$|R
25|$|The same <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> host {{three to}} five generations of beetles. Up to 100 beetles {{can be found in}} a single fruit. The insect is very {{sensitive}} to desiccation, and waits for the rains to leave the fruit. The most affected areas in the crops are the shady and moist ones.|$|E
25|$|Only {{occasionally}} cultivated as an ornamental, it can nevertheless {{be grown}} successfully in milder climates if kept warm and sheltered in a shady location, with well-watered soil. It also grows well when potted and indoors. The <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be grown from seeds, by first soaking them, or from cuttings of a mature plant.|$|E
25|$|Another of {{the ways}} in which the {{ecological}} role of a <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> make it a weed even if it is in itself inoffensive, is if it harbours a pest that is dependent on it for survival; for example, Berberis species are intermediate hosts for stem rust fungi, so that they promote serious damage to wheat crops when growing near the fields.|$|E

25|$|Ratoon cropping: In some environments, {{additional}} grain crops {{could be}} harvested each year if the plants ratooned quickly. Shoots growing from the mature <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> reach the reproductive stage {{more quickly than}} shoots growing from seed. Transplanting seedlings is faster than sowing seed, but still requires time and labor-intensive field preparation and, of course, a large supply of labor for transplanting.|$|E
25|$|Veratrum nigrum is {{native to}} Eurasia from France to Korea {{including}} Germany, Poland, Russia, China, and Mongolia. The <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> exist in hardiness zones 4 through 7. It grows best in shade or partial shade, with wet or moist grounds conditions. Any nutrient-rich soil supports its growth, although one source observes that it prefers calcium-rich soil. Another source observes that the bed must be fairly deep.|$|E
25|$|Covering the {{affected}} patch of {{ground with a}} non-translucent material {{can be an effective}} follow-up strategy. However, the trimmed stems of the <b>plant</b> <b>can</b> be razor sharp and are able to pierce through most materials. Covering with non-flexible materials such as concrete slabs has to be done meticulously and without leaving even the smallest splits. The slightest opening can be enough for the plant to grow back.|$|E
