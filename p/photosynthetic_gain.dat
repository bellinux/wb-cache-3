40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} behaviour of endolithic andepilithic lichens {{characteristic of}} sedimentary and volcanic rock {{was investigated in}} situ in the Mountain Zebra National Park, South Africa. The park forms part of an inland semi-desert known as the Karoo, in the Cape Province. Temperatures within Balfour sandstone were monitored, the results showing that during the early morning, temperatures within the sandstone were nearly 5 @C lower than ambient air temperatures. This may enhance the frequency of water condensing on the sandstone, which may be particularly important for the endoliths Leciclea aff. sarcogynoides and Sarcogyne cf. austroafricana. Maximum photosynthetic rates of the investigated species were found at temperatures between 20 @C and 30 @C, far higher than the recorded optimum temperatures for lichens from temperate and desert regions.

30|$|Accordingly, {{there is}} the notion that plants have a {{remarkable}} ability to adapt the growth of their organs to environmental conditions. In a low light environment plants should allocate biomass to light-capturing tissue and minimize carbon losses, but in the high light environment, plants invest more in root mass in order to compensate for higher transpiration losses by water uptake (King 1994; Valio 2001). In the second case, less biomass can be invested in leaf material, which strongly reduces <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain</b> and potential growth rate (Korner 1991). These results are completely in agreement with ours. Similar results have been obtained for leaves of Portugal Myrtus communis (Mendes et al. 2001), Corylus avellana (Catoni et al. 2015) and Vitis vinifera L.

40|$|Summary Recent {{hypotheses}} of timberline causation in-clude {{the possibility}} that limitations to growth processes may be more limiting than restrictions on <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain,</b> and that cold soil is a primary limiting factor at high alti-tude. However, {{almost all of the}} supporting data for timberline causation have come from studies on older trees, with little fo-cus on the mechanisms of seedling establishment and the growth of saplings away from the forest edge into the treeline ecotone. We describe a conceptual model of timberline migra-tion that invokes a strong dependence on ecological facilita-tion, beginning with seed germination and continuing through seedling establishment and sapling growth to the stage where trees with forest-like stature form new subalpine forest at a higher altitude. In addition to protection from severe mechani-cal damage, facilitation of <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> and car-bon processing is enhanced by plasticity in plant form and microsite preference, enabling seedling survival and sapling growth inside and through the often severe boundary layer just above the ground cover. Several forms of facilitation (inani-mate, interspecific, intraspecific and structural) result in sub-stantial increases in <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> throughout the summer growth period, leading to enhanced root growth, sub-sequent amelioration of drought stress, and increased seedling survival. Avoidance of low temperatures and low-temperature photoinhibition of photosynthesis may be major benefits of the facilitation, enhancing <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> and respira-tory-driven growth processes. We propose that the growth of vertical stems (flagged tree forms) from krummholz mats is analogous functionally to the facilitated growth of a seed-ling/sapling in and away from ground cover. Increasing abun-dance and growth of newly established trees in the treeline ecotone generates a structural and microsite facilitation char-acteristic of the subalpine forest below. This is followed by the formation of new subalpine forest with forest-like trees, and a new timberline at higher altitude...|$|R

Data were collected across 4 seasons (October and January—growing seasons; May and July—senescent seasons) to determine seasonal dynamics in physiological responses to air exposure. Both species showed clear light-dependent responses with a decline in photosynthetic efficiency and increased photoprotection during periods of combined maximum daily irradiance and air exposure for all seasons. In Z. muelleri ssp. capricorni there was a negative correlation between air-exposed effective quantum yield and light intensity, suggesting exposure was driving this decline. Conversely, sensitivity (decline in effective quantum yield of photosystem II) to increased irradiance dominated the response in H. ovalis, with {{no change in the}} magnitude of this response between air-exposed and submerged blades. The response to air exposure observed in Z. muelleri ssp. capricorni showed seasonal variation, with a greater decline in photosynthesis during the spring (October).

40|$|Abstract: Mistletoes {{are highly}} {{specialized}} perennial flowering plants adapted to parasitic life on aerial {{parts of their}} hosts. In our discussion on the physiological interactions between parasite and host, we focus on water relations, mineral nutrition, {{and the effect of}} host vigour. When host photosynthesis is greatest, the xylem water potential of the host is most negative. To maintain a flux gradient and avoid stomatal closure and wilting, the mistletoe must tolerate a more negative water potential than the host. Succulent leaves enhance water storage and allow mistletoes to rehydrate before their hosts rehydrate. Mistletoe infections may disrupt the host stomatal control system, causing early and oscillating closure of host stomata, thereby diminishing host <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain.</b> Mistletoes lack the active uptake of minerals of a typical plant root system and rely upon the haustorium to connect with the host for the essentially one-way flow of photosynthates and nu-trients from host to parasite. Modest growth rates, tolerance, succulence, and rapid leaf turnover are some means by which mistletoes avoid mineral deficiency or excess. We propose high concentrations of some mobile elements in the mistletoe by comparison with the host result not from active uptake, but from the inevitable accumulation by a parasite that utilizes host phloem sap. The relationship between host condition and mistletoe performance varies by situation and over time. In some cases, the host can outgrow the mistletoe, but favorable host status can also accelerate mistletoe growth. A better understanding of the mistletoe–host interaction can be utilized in improved management of infested forest plantations for resource production as well as for conservation of biodiversity and endangered species...|$|E

Photosynthetic optimum increased from - 3 to 2 degrees C between irradiance levels of 100 and 1500 micromoles photons m- 2 s- 1, while the upper compensation point rose from 1 to 17 degrees C. The mean yearly total time available for metabolic activity (temperature above - 10 degrees C and moisture present) was 771. 3 h for horizontal rock, 421. 5 h for northeast-oriented sloped rock, and 1042. 2 h for a small depression in horizontal rock (the characteristic site of occasional lichen apothecia). The calculated mean gross productivity value for a horizontal rock was 1215 mg C m- 2 y- 1, and net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain</b> was 606 mg C m- 2 y- 1.

40|$|Facing {{environmental}} {{issues in a}} global change context requires improving our knowledge about the land surface and its dynamics. Today, the accumulation of satellite time series at moderate resolution constitutes unique datasets to monitor Earth’s surface evolution on each squared km. The ambition of this thesis was to exploit the multispectral reflectance variability as observed by the SPOT-VEGETATION time series (1999 - 2011) to characterize land surface dynamics at multi-annual and seasonal scales. Because of their single year strategy, current global land cover maps are sensitive to temporary events and to year-to-year variation related to meteorological and phenology change. An innovative land cover mapping approach {{takes advantage of the}} long time series to derive a multi-year global land cover map. This was found efficient to reduce the sensitivity to the observation period found in all global annual maps. In addition, a change detection method capitalizes on the land cover trajectories over the whole time series to highlight forest, cropland, grassland, bare area, urban area and water losses and gains. It provides {{for the first time a}} complete portrait of the Earth’s land surface transformations systematically described by the year of change and the land cover transition. At seasonal scale, vegetation phenology of tropical rainforest is prone to a large debate about the ability of remote sensing to monitor any vegetation cycle due to atmospheric contamination and more recently viewing and illumination geometry variation. Capitalizing on the 13 -y reflectance values, this thesis proves that the seasonal dynamics of appropriate vegetation index are driven by leaf phenological events, themselves responding to light availability in order to enhance <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain,</b> in both Amazon and Congo basins.

The model regenerated the three-dimensional shoot structure and spatial and temporal display of leaves; we calculated the hourly light interception of each leaf with a detailed light model that allowed us to estimate hourly leaf <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain</b> taking leaf age into account. To evaluate the importance of simultaneous foliar phenology and slanting shoots in beech saplings, we calculated the photosynthetic budgets for saplings with contrasting foliar phenologies and shoot inclinations. In our simulations, we distinguished between simultaneous and successive foliar phenologies, upright and slanting shoot inclinations, and environments with and without a vertical gradient in light intensity. Other model parameters (including photosynthesis vs. light curve, leaf size, and leaf shape) were obtained directly from live beech saplings. With no vertical gradient in light intensity, modeled saplings with simultaneous foliar phenology and slanting shoots (as in live beech) had larger annual photosynthetic gains than saplings with other combinations of traits. Hence, simultaneous foliar phenology and slanting shoots are efficient ways to display leaves in the shaded forest understory light regime where beech saplings thrive. In the presence of vertical light gradients, which can occur in canopy gaps, saplings with upright shoots had larger annual photosynthetic gains than counterparts with slanting shoots. Although mean daily photosynthetic gains of saplings with successive foliar phenology were elevated by exposing leaves to strong light when young and productive, the annual photosynthetic budget of these saplings was reduced (compared to saplings with simultaneous foliar phenology) by their relatively short leaf lifespan. Overall, our results suggest that slanting shoots with simultaneous foliar phenology are particularly successful in shaded environments, where beech often dominates, because they appear to maximize the annual carbon budget by avoiding self-shading and extending leaf lifespans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} {{is generally}} advantageous for plants in nutrient-poor soils. Arcto-alpine areas are relatively nutrient-poor, but abundantly inhabited by non-mycorrhizal species. Possibly, mycorrhizal symbiosis is not favoured {{due to the}} harsh climatic conditions and the short growing season, which constrain the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain</b> and growth of the arcto-alpine plants. This hypothesis was theoretically evaluated by assuming that optimal mycorrhizal colonization maximizes the net carbon gain of the host plant. In addition, the prevalence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark-septate endophytic (DSE) fungi along an altitudinal gradient was studied in the field, and their effects on the plant performance were tested in the laboratory. In the model, the photosynthetic nutrient use efficiency (PNUE) had {{a key role in}} determining whether mycorrhizal strategy would be optimal for the plant net carbon gain. The model generated several colonization patterns depending on possible changes in PNUE and soil nutrient concentrations along altitudinal gradients. Field studies indicated that species-level colonizations do not yield a consistent pattern along the altitude except for fine endophyte, which increased along an altitudinal gradient. In a high-alpine field site root fungal colonizations were rare. Seasonal shifts in colonizations in low-alpine conditions were not found. DSE fungi were common root-associates in the field. In the laboratory, AM had a positive impact on the performance of Gnaphalium norvegicum at 15 °C, but not at 8 °C. DSE-inoculation did not colonize the roots, but it had a positive impact on seedling performance, which {{may be due to the}} saprophytic activity of the fungus in the substrate. Additionally, mycorrhizal inoculum was found to decrease the performance of a non-mycorrhizal plant in a competition experiment. Species-level mycorrhizal colonization patterns may differ from community-level pattern along altitudinal gradients and the relative abundance of different fungal symbionts may change along with the altitude. The performance of mycorrhizal plants in high-alpine conditions may be decreased due to several factors e. g. low temperature constraints on plant and fungal physiology and allocation, soil disturbances and low availability of inoculum. Climatic constraints for plant photosynthesis may thus affect the mycorrhizal colonization patterns in arcto-alpine conditions, but are not necessarily the primary cause for lower performance of mycorrhizal plants at higher altitudes...|$|E

Annual mean CO₂ was around 17 ppm higher than the global average reported for the time of measurement (361 ppm; 1995 / 96), and daily values ranged from 317 to 490 ppm. Diel courses of CO₂ could be classified into three different types. Type A, when CO₂ levels rose overnight and then fell strongly to below global levels during the day, which predominated in the summer (about 75 of days); Type B, irregular diel courses occurred during all seasons with often very rapid changes apparently due to advective CO₂ transport; Type C, CO₂ concentration was typically almost stable at generally between c. 330 and 430 ppm which predominated in the winter (63 of days). Under controlled conditions, CO₂ saturation of net photosynthesis (NP) of L. muralis at optimal hydration and light occurred at around 1000 ppm. NP was also affected by low CO₂ at limiting light and thallus water contents. Based upon these data, we estimated the improvement of NP of L. muralis due to transient increase of ambient CO₂ (as compared with the global average) for one selected combination of environmental factors (nocturnal dew or frost). This combination is an important source of water for the lichen, resulting in 40 of its annual production and, especially in these situations, photosynthesis was increased by high ambient CO₂ in the early morning under prevailing Type A conditions. After dew activation, light compensation point of NP occurred at an average concentration of 413 ppm and diel maxima of NP at 402 ppm. This allows a rough estimate that the transiently elevated CO₂ increased the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain</b> of the lichen after dew of 7, or an improvement to its annual carbon balance of about 3.

40|$|Studies of {{the impact}} of climate change on plants are {{generally}} based on vascular plants. Bryophytes basically differ from tracheophytes in having a smaller size and a poikilohydric strategy for water and nutrients. Their survival and growth are highly dependent on their external environment. Bryophytes are able to lose most of their cell water without dying, and resume normal metabolism after rehydration, gaining positive carbon balance over wet-dry cycles. This is sort of adaptation is called desiccation tolerance. Desiccation tolerance is a common but not unique phenomenon among bryophytes: cells of bryophytes in exposed sunny sites can switch from full turgor to air dryness quickly, while the species of moist habitats dry more slowly, and can suffer stress by even moderate drying. They can maintain efficient photosynthesis under low light conditions, have low chl a/b ratios, and within a limited temperature range their optimum growth is possible. When certain bryophytes’ CO 2 assimilation is suppressed, photorespiration activity increases and becomes the main electron sink. Bryophytes, as the sensitive components of various vegetation types, are capable of effective light absorption during their desiccation, rehydration, freezing and melting, with the help of coexisting alga and vascular plant energy dissipation mechanisms. They have relatively low optimal temperature for growth (with narrow T range for net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gain),</b> including only minor differences between the optimum temperatures for net photosynthesis in the same species from polar, temperate and tropical populations. Bryophytes have a low acclimatization potential for high temperatures, taking into account that they are generally drought avoiders. Temperature acclimatization potential is of high importance for the physiological basis of altitudinal distribution and the likely responses of bryophytes to climate change. Bryophytes with their small and resistant spores are able to disperse over long distances by wind, which might help their survival in the changing environment. Dominant vascular vegetation might change as temperature will increase; however, suitable microhabitats for bryophytes might still persist. The abundance and species composition of bryophytes in plant communities is predicted to be altered, as well as the function of the whole ecosystem. Based on recent literature and own data, the author makes an attempt to summarize the physiological mechanisms, morphological features and alternative strategies which make bryophytes successful in a constantly changing terrestrial environment. These plants represent a sophisticated solution to the challenges of life at their scale. Further exploration of bryophyte ecophysiology in the changing and stressful environment will provide new information that will assist bryophyte conservation.

We hypothesized that invasion by B. thunbergii could be facilitated by a lower leaf construction cost (CC) and reduced leaf nitrogen content (N) relative to photosynthetic rate (A) and maximum photosynthetic capacity (Amax), which would afford it greater energy-use efficiency (EUE) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), and maximums of these variables (EUEmax and NUEmax), compared with native shrubs. Although B. thunbergii and K. latifolia exhibited similar peak-season A and Amax, EUE, EUEmax, and NUEmax were greater in B. thunbergii, which exhibited lower leaf CC and density.

We analyze from this perspective how a lichen fungus may maximize <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gains</b> in bipartite and tripartite associations. We treat the frequency of nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts in cyanobacteria and the relative proportion of green algal cells vs. that of cyanobacteria per unit fungus as the variables to be manipulated for maximal carbon gain. The model predicts that even with a negligible cost of cephalodia (compartments containing cyanobacteria) {{it is in the}} interest of the tripartite lichen, first, to increase the heterocyst frequency, and second, keep the relative number of cyanobacteria considerably lower than that of green algae. Hence, the lichen fungus achieves higher fitness by making the cyanobacterial partner to specialize on N fixation. The available empirical data support these predictions as the reported heterocyst frequencies in bipartite lichens range from 2 to 8 %, and in tripartite lichens between 10 and 55 %. It is concluded that interaction asymmetry (i. e. commensalism or parasitism rather than mutualism) provides a sound basis to understand the high phenotypic plasticity expressed by fungi-forming bipartite and tripartite associations with cyanobacteria and green algae...|$|R
50|$|H. arenicola cannot divide without {{containing}} the endosymbiont. But, unlike a fully integrated organelle, the Nephroselmis alga does not divide {{along with the}} host cell. When the host cell divides, one of the daughter cells receives the Nephroselmis cell and the other daughter returns to a heterotrophic lifestyle. Hence, the mother protist gives rise to green-coloured and white-coloured daughter cells. The latter behaves like a predator until it ingests a Nephroselmis green alga. The alga then loses its flagella and cytoskeleton, while the Hatena, now a host, switches to <b>photosynthetic</b> nutrition, <b>gains</b> {{the ability to move}} towards light and loses its feeding apparatus. Thus, the protist exhibits an unusual life cycle of alternating autotrophy and heterotrophy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Dynamic {{responses}} of understory plants to sunflecks have been extensively studied, {{but how much}} differences in dynamic light responses affect daily photosynthesis (Aday) is still the subject of active research. Recent models of dynamic photosynthesis have provided a quantitative tool that allows the critical assessment {{of the importance of}} these sunfleck responses on Aday. Here we used a dynamic photosynthesis model to assess differences in four species that were growing in ambient and elevated CO 2. We hypothesized that Liriodendron tulipifera, a species with rapid <b>photosynthetic</b> induction <b>gain</b> and slow induction loss, would have the least limitations to sunfleck photosynthesis relative to the other three species (Acer rubrum, Cornus florida, Liquidambar styraciflua). As a consequence, L. tulipifera shoul...|$|R
40|$|Early {{observations}} led Sanio [Wissen. Bot., 8, (1872) 401] {{to state}} that xylem conduit diameters and lengths in a coniferous tree increase from the apex down to a height below which they begin to decrease towards the tree base. Sanios law of vertical tapering has been repeatedly tested with contradictory results and {{the debate over the}} scaling of conduit diameters with distance from the apex has not been settled. The debate has recently acquired new vigour, as an accurate knowledge of the vertical changes in wood anatomy {{has been shown to be}} crucial to scaling metabolic properties to plant and ecosystem levels. Contrary to Sanios hypothesis, a well known model (MST, metabolic scaling theory) assumes that xylem conduits monotonically increase in diameter with distance from the apex following a power law. This has been proposed to explain the three-fourth power scaling between size and metabolism seen across plants. Here, we (i) summarized available data on conduit tapering in trees and (ii) propose a new numerical model that could explain the observed patterns. Data from 101 datasets grouped into 48 independent profiles supported the notions that phylogenetic group (angiosperms versus gymnosperms) and tree size strongly affected the vertical tapering of conduit diameter. For both angiosperms and gymnosperms, within-tree tapering also varied with distance from the apex. The model (based on the concept that optimal conduit tapering occurs when the difference between <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>gains</b> and wall construction costs is maximal) successfully predicted all three major empirical patterns. Our results are consistent with Sanios law only for large trees and reject the MST assumptions that vertical tapering in conduit diameter is universal and independent of rank number...|$|R
30|$|The {{differences}} in photosynthetic capacity reflected the {{differences in}} leaf anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. Stomata can effectively regulate gas exchange where water vapor exits the plant and CO 2 enters. Leaf conductance, <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> and the potential transpiration rate are primarily determined by both stomatal aperture and density (Brodribb and Jordan 2011; Büssis et al. 2006). The stomata of R. delavayi and R. irroratum were more densely packed and smaller than R. yunnanense, and as a result, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were nearly twice that of R. yunnanense (Table  3). As the ability of leaves to quickly open stomata and increase conductance may allow greater rates of carbon fixation to occur, so densely and small stomata partly contributed to larger stomatal conductance, and consequently higher photosynthetic rate of R. delavayi and R. irroratum.|$|R
30|$|While the Psora decipiens {{dominated}} BSC {{might have}} an advantage in habitats with frequent high air humidity (e.g. along the coastline), the cyanolichen dominated BSC-types (Peltula patellata, P. richardsii) might have advantage in dryer sites that are subject to floodings. Placidium squamulosum dominated BSCs are somehow in-between, as they can reactivate NP at least to a small proportion, but, to a lesser degree, also can stand water suprasaturation. However, these theoretical conclusions have to remain speculative and are meant as working hypotheses for continuation of research. As a consequence of our studies, it becomes obvious that investigating <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> of BSCs cannot just be performed on small soil crust samples of few square centimeters, but need to cover {{the full spectrum of}} BSC patches dominated by different species and species composition.|$|R
30|$|The plants {{showed a}} high {{plasticity}} to water shortage, since drought stress at values {{close to the}} wilting point {{did not affect the}} plants’ functionality although it did affect their growth. Black locust has lower WUE than other species grown in short-rotation coppice species so is certainly not a low water-use tree species. Thus, growing black locust in a plantation setting may affect ground-water recharge and the local water budget. However, its ability to grow under adverse edaphic conditions plus other traits not studied here (such as high wood density and rot resistance) makes it a suitable species for marginal lands. Growth performance and morphological adaptations were more sensitive than the photosynthesis across the range of soil water availabilities tested, and hence growth is limited by factors other than <b>photosynthetic</b> C <b>gain.</b>|$|R
40|$|Effects of pH, photoperiod, and {{substrate}} {{nutrient concentration}} on {{the rate of}} germination of the gemmae and primary protonema growth of Calymperes erosum C. Muell. were studied. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} in germination of C. erosum gemmae and protonema growth among the different substrate pH levels, photoperiod treatments, and substrate nutrient conditions, respectively (P 0. 05) increase in germination and protonemal growth was observed when the nutrient concentration was increased from 25 % to 200 %. Results indicate the moss is adapted to low nutrients and that it may germinate well at substrate pH as low as 2 howbeit the probability of establishment will remain limited until pH levels improve to 4 or 5. Furthermore, the moss is able to achieve net <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> during morning hours. Recovery from photoinhibition is likely by evening...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of ozone (O 3) on the canopy carbon budget, we investigated photosynthesis and respiration of leaves of Siebold's beech saplings under free air O 3 exposure (60  nmol mol(- 1), during daytime) in relation to the within-canopy light gradient; we then calculated the canopy-level <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> (PCG) and respiratory carbon loss (RCL) using a canopy photosynthesis model. Susceptibilities of photosynthesis and respiration to O 3 were greater in leaves of upper canopy than in the lower canopy. The canopy net carbon gain (NCG) was reduced by O 3 by 12. 4 % during one growing season. The increased RCL was the main factor for the O 3 -induced reduction in NCG in late summer, while contributions of the reduced PCG and the increased RCL to the NCG were almost the same in autumn. These results indicate contributions of changes in PCG and RCL under O 3 to NCG were different between seasons...|$|R
40|$|This study {{quantified}} {{variation in}} net <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> {{in response to}} natural fluctuations in symbiont density for the Mediterranean coral Cladocora caespitosa, and evaluated which density maximized photosynthetic carbon acquisition. To do this, carbon acquisition was modeled as an explicit function of symbiont density. The model was parameterized using measurements of rates of photosynthesis and respiration for small colonies with {{a broad range of}} zooxanthella concentrations. Results demonstrate that rates of net photosynthesis increase asymptotically with symbiont density, whereas rates of respiration increase linearly. In combination, these functional responses meant that colony energy acquisition decreased at both low and at very high zooxanthella densities. However, there was a wide range of symbiont densities for which net daily photosynthesis was approximately equivalent. Therefore, significant changes in symbiont density do not necessarily cause a change in autotrophic energy acquisition by the colony. Model estimates of the optimal range of cell densities corresponded well with independent observations of symbiont concentrations obtained from field and laboratory studies of healthy colonies. Overall, this study demonstrates that the seasonal fluctuations, in symbiont numbers observed in healthy colonies of the Mediterranean coral investigated, do not have a strong effect on photosynthetic energy acquisition...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{above-ground}} {{woody biomass}} production, WP, in some western Amazon forests exceeds {{those in the}} east {{by a factor of}} 2 or more. Underlying causes may include climate, soil nutrient limitations and species composition. In this modelling paper, we explore the implications of allowing key nutrients such as N and P to constrain the photosynthesis of Amazon forests, and also we examine the relationship between modelled rates of photosynthesis and the observed gradients in WP. We use a model with current understanding of the underpinning biochemical processes as affected by nutrient availability to assess: (i) the degree to which observed spatial variations in foliar [N] and [P] across Amazonia affect stand-level photosynthesis; and (ii) how these variations in forest photosynthetic carbon acquisition relate to the observed geographical patterns of stem growth across the Amazon Basin. We find nutrient availability to exert a strong effect on <b>photosynthetic</b> carbon <b>gain</b> across the Basin and to be a likely important contributor to the observed gradient in WP. Phosphorus emerges as more important than nitrogen in accounting for the observed variations in productivity. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of future tropical forests under a changing climate...|$|R
