5|$|Considered the top {{high school}} player in the country, Bradley {{initially}} chose to attend Duke University {{in the fall of}} 1961. However, after breaking his foot in the summer of 1961 during a baseball game and thinking about his college decision outside of basketball, Bradley decided to enroll at Princeton due to its record in <b>preparing</b> <b>students</b> for government or United States Foreign Service work. He had been awarded a scholarship at Duke, but not at Princeton; the Ivy League does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships, and Bradley's family's wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid.|$|E

40|$|Presented at {{the annual}} Association of Institutional Research (AIR) forum, Toronto, Canada, May 25, 2011. This study {{compared}} the outcomes for less prepared and well prepared first year college students enrolled in learning communities at the University of Minnesota. Less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> were retained at the same rate, though their first year grades were significantly lower. In a second study the less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> were compared to an earlier cohort of matched pairs. The matched pairs had similar rates of retention and similar grades. A third study compared the responses of less prepared and well <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> to items on the SERU survey. Less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> reported more gains in items related to the learning outcome communicating effectively. Less prepared and more <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> reported similar gains on the outcome appreciating diversity. Less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> were as satisfied as well <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> with their {{sense of belonging to}} the institution and were as likely to say they would choose to attend the same institution again, but they were less satisfied with their grades, social experience and academic experience...|$|R

25|$|AAST {{was founded}} on a charter school {{framework}} in 1992 with the mission of <b>preparing</b> <b>students</b> for careers {{in math and science}} by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment.

The roots of the program can be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology, and physics, and its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. This academy celebrated ten years of excellence in 2006-07. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies.|$|E

25|$|Washington, Thorn and Dillingham {{developed}} the Calhoun Colored School {{according to the}} Hampton-Tuskegee model. First, students would receive a basic elementary education and then an industrial education {{at the high school}} level. This model envisioned <b>preparing</b> <b>students</b> for the work available in the rural areas in which most of them lived. Boys would become farmers and perhaps skilled tradesmen, and girls would become wives and homemakers, as well as laundresses, dressmakers, or domestic workers. The best students were encouraged to become teachers and work in the community or outlying areas to promote further education along the Hampton-Tuskegee model. There was a great push to continue to improve literacy among both children and adults, and teaching was a high calling.|$|E

Normal (Academic) course are geared towards <b>preparing</b> <b>students</b> for the O-level exam in the fifth year, subject to good performance in the N-level exam in the fourth year, and students take academic subjects such as Principles of Accounting. In Normal (Technical), students take subjects of a more technical nature, such as Design and Technology, and they generally proceed to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) after the N-level exam in the fourth year. In 2004, the Ministry of Education announced that selected students in the Normal course would have an opportunity to sit for the O-level exam directly without first taking the N-level exam.|$|E

25|$|The College of the University of Chicago is the university's sole {{undergraduate}} {{institution and}} one of its oldest components, emerging contemporaneously with the university's Hyde Park campus in 1892. Instruction is provided by faculty from across all graduate divisions and schools for its 6,300 students, but the College retains a select group of young, proprietary scholars who teach its core curriculum offerings. Unlike many major American research universities, the College is small in comparison to the University's graduate divisions, with graduate students outnumbering undergraduates at a 2:1 ratio. The College is most notable for its core curriculum pioneered by Robert Maynard Hutchins, which remains among the most expansive of highly ranked American colleges, as well as its emphasis on <b>preparing</b> <b>students</b> for continued graduate study since 85% of graduates go onto graduate study within 5 years of graduation, which is higher than any other school, and around 15-20% of graduates go on to receive PhDs.|$|E
25|$|Fears of a Japanese {{hit-and-run}} {{air raid}} {{mounted in the}} weeks after Pearl Harbor, although {{at the beginning of the}} war, St. Louis had no air raid sirens and little plans in case of an attack. In spite of its distance from the coasts, city leaders appropriated $50,000 for area defense, including $4,500 to light the MacArthur Bridge. Call-in radio shows were cancelled, and weather forecasts were censored. Civil defense preparations both in the city and county moved slowly, but on March 7, 1942, the city held its first blackout. A second blackout, held in February 1943, was considerably more successful than the first, with 4 of 12 civil defense districts fully blacked out. The local branch of the federal Office of Civilian Defense enrolled 5,300 air raid wardens, 2,400 volunteer firefighters, and 3,000 volunteer police officers by April 1942. City building inspectors selected 200 sites as air raid shelters, enough to house 40,000 people, and local schools began <b>preparing</b> <b>students</b> for attack. The city and region also were protected by anti-aircraft guns, but mistakenly fired on civilian aircraft multiple times during the war.|$|E
