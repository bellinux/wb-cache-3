40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) {{is known as}} one of the most effective irrigation methods capable of improving water use efficiency through providing small amounts of water at short irrigation intervals and causing little or no water loss in terms of deep percolation, runoff and soil evaporation. However, temporal waterlogging within the root zone during and after irrigation events adversely affects root respiration, water and nutrient uptake and consequently plant growth. Therefore, irrigation of plants with hyper-aerated, or oxygenated, water could alleviate the impacts of waterlogging in the rhizosphere. Recent studies reportedly showed that aeration of irrigation water by means of venturi air injector in SDI systems (known as oxygation) enhanced crop performance in hypoxic soils. However, there was evidence of non-uniform improvement in crop yield along lateral pipes which might be ascribed to non-uniform distribution of air flow along irrigation pipes. Moreover, under pipe inclinations ranging from 5 º to 15 º, preferential flow of air was reportedly observed in branching pipe systems (containing no emitters) for ratio of water to air flow in the range of 0. 1 – 0. 3. In the current study, preliminary investigation on preferential flow of air into branching horizontal <b>pipe</b> <b>layouts</b> suggested that delivery of air bubbles from the first emitter on the lateral pipe closest to the junction of main pipe and manifold might have formed a zone of relative low pressure.

Furrow and border irrigation alternatives were designed and ranked with the SADREG model, considering lasered and nonlasered land levelling, field lengths of 50 e 200 m and various inflow discharges. A multicriteria analysis approach was used to analyse and compare the alternatives based upon economic and water saving criteria. Results for surface irrigation indicate a slight advantage for long non-lasered graded furrows; non-lasered alternatives were selected due to economic considerations. For drip irrigation, the best ranking is for systems having lower costs, mainly with double rows per lateral and larger emitter spacing. Comparing surface and drip irrigation systems, despite low cost, drip alternatives may lead to 28 e 35 % water saving relative to improved graded furrows, and increase water productivity from 0. 43 kg m 3 to 0. 61 kg m 3, surface irrigation provides higher farm returns.

40|$|Due {{to quiet}} operation, no moving parts, long {{lifespan}} and compact structure, the thermoelectric application {{has become a}} potential green technology which {{has been used in}} different areas in the efforts of contributing to achieve simplified and compact system structures and environmental friendliness. Its applications cover a wide range from the earliest application on kerosene lamp to aerospace applications, transportation tools, industrial utilities, medical services, electronic devices and temperature detecting & measuring facilities. Its disadvantage lies in the low conversion efficiency which only converts small amount (for BizTe 3, up to 5 %) of harvested energy to electrical power. It makes the use of the TEG system far from being economically feasible due to long cost recovery period. Consequently, its use is limited to specialised area where it is unnecessary to consider the cost of the thermal energy input and system cost recovery. This research aims to explore a way of widening the application range of thermoelectric generation based on introducing a potential direction of improving energy utilisation efficiency to a higher level by adopting thermoelectric cogeneration concept in residential house. It focuses on investigating the practicality of using thermoelectric applications in domestic sectors where the large amount of heat is exhausted to environment without being used and developing thermoelectric cogeneration system to generate electricity and produce pre-heated water for domestic use by recovering the waste heat from the domestic boiler and utilising the on-site solar energy. With the conversion efficiency given by the current commercially available thermoelectric modules, the optimised heat exchanging regimes and systems for thermoelectric applications have been comprehensively studied from the aspects of system design, integration, experimental study, numerical simulation and modification. The importance and necessity of effective heat exchanging methods have been emphasised by the experimental and numerical proofs {{for the development of a}} domestic thermoelectric cogeneration system with higher thermal efficiency. The impacts of this domestic energy solution have been evaluated from the aspects of the improvement for outdoor environment and indoor energy profile, as well as economic benefit. For the flue gas heat exchanger, the model with sudden expansion and gradual constriction has been identified gives in terms of overall performance. The model with sudden expansion, gradual constriction and staggered <b>pipe</b> <b>layout</b> and the one with sudden expansion, gradual constriction and inline <b>pipe</b> <b>layout</b> show better overall performance than other models. Among these two models, the one with staggered <b>pipe</b> <b>layout</b> shows better performance than the one with inline <b>pipe</b> <b>layout</b> in the velocity range of 3. 6 m 1 s- 5 m 1 s, whilst the one with inline <b>pipe</b> <b>layout</b> shows better performance between 0 - 3. 6 m 1 s. For the cold side heat exchanger, the one with four (Zl 5 mm branch channel angled at 90 against the main channel delivers the best overall performance out of 9 cooling plates built according to three variables. Experimental studies show the one-stage TCS produces more power than the two-stage TCS does when the heat input is supplied at 47 W and 60 W. As the heat input increases, the power output of twostage TCS gets closer to that of one-stage TCS. In the system construction and assembly, uneven assembly can lead to a 20 % drop in conversion efficiency. The pressure load at 181 psi gives the highest power output out of five load values, which are 136 psi, 159 psi, 181 psi, 204 psi and 227 psi, respectively. In comparison with individual assembly, module thickness difference ~n whole assembly degrades the system conversion efficiency. The cost recovery period of deploying this system in a residential house installed with a 24 kW boiler and a 1 m 2 solar collector has been evaluated. Based on the conversion efficiency and thermal efficiency that is 4 % and 67 % at l 30 DC temperature difference, the house can produce 98 W electricity and 1640 W useable heat when l the boiler is running and the contribution from the solar energy is included. It takes less than 4. 2 years to recover the system cost.

This report studies four GCHP pumping systems and makes comparisons between the four using life-cycle cost analyses for six building models. The goal for this analysis was to discover commonalities between the models in order to provide designers insight into which pumping system is the most cost effective. The analysis was performed by first creating energy models to obtain system and zone load information, as well as system part-load data and geothermal heat exchanger performance. From the zone load information, heat pump selections were then performed to indicate the worst case piping path that is required for pump head calculations. <b>Piping</b> <b>layouts</b> were created to establish pipe lengths for the pump head calculations as well. Other piping components such as valves and fittings and the air separator pressure drops were also calculated. Once the pump head calculations were complete for each system, pump schedules were created. From there initial unit and installation costs were determined for each pump, as well as their replacement costs. The part-load data from the energy models were then used to obtain annual pump energy consumption and pump utility cost. Finally, assumptions were made to establish regular and preventative maintenance requirements for each pumping system. Initial and replacement unit costs, annual utility cost and regular and preventative maintenance costs were the components used in the life-cycle cost analysis. Each of these components was converted to 30 -year projected costs and added to create a total life-cycle cost for each pumping system. Comparisons were then made and the results showed that a primary pumping system with VFD control and 100 % redundancy was the most cost effective system. However, there are other considerations such as controllability, flexibility and availability that might persuade designers to choose one of the other alternate solutions...|$|R

The goals of this project is to study the cooling system in the floor of indoor ice rinks placed at Sweden and achieve a solution against the problem of permafrost in the soil, due to low temperatures, and against the problem of the large amount of energy lost through the ground, due to low efficiency. In order to success in this challenge, five different models performed with COMSOL Multiphysic 3. 5 have been simulated and studied to observe the energy saving that can be obtained by changing different design parameters, such as property of the concrete, insulation layer or heating <b>pipes</b> <b>layout.</b> According to the results the following conclusions have been obtained. On one hand, regarding the thermal conductivity, models design with high thermal conductivity concrete, conducts heat in an easier way than the normal concrete, and it will enable higher and quicker amounts of heat transferred through the slab. The improved thermodynamic properties of Concrete layer allow using the refrigerant 5, 4 ºC higher temperature to keep the ice at a desired temperature. So, it must be pointed out that in terms of heat transfer, the concrete layer that supports the cooling pipes {{is one of the most}} important parts of the structure. On the other hand, as far as the insulation layer is concerned, the best option is to place one below heating pipes, due to the energy losses are reduced from 9 W/m 2   to 0, 4 W/m 2. Finally, regarding to the cooling pipes depth, it must be pointed out that when the pipes are raised up 50 mm, the refrigerant temperature required to maintain the desired ice surface properties has been increased from - 16 ºC to - 9 ºC.

40|$|Techniques that {{optimise}} {{the design}} and operation of water distribution systems have taken {{a long time to}} make the transition from theory to practice. There are several reasons for this including the size and complexity of existing systems, the vast number of possible solutions and the wide range of system-specific design considerations, performance requirements and operational limitations encountered in practice. This paper describes the application of a class of powerful search and optimisation techniques called genetic algorithms to the optimisation of the design of piped irrigation delivery systems. The genetic algorithm (GA) search is a computer-simulated evolution process that imitates nature's ongoing search for better solutions. In the application to pipe network optimisation, the GA searches for near-optimal cost networks or network expansions which meet specified design criteria and performance requirements for a system subject to defined future demand patterns. The GA computes the actual cost of proposed designs based on commercially available component sizes and uses an efficient, reliable hydraulic simulation model to check the hydraulic feasibility of trial network solutions. The GA search method is robust and is well-suited to the design of complex engineering systems. The formulation of the GA model is very flexible and the GA can be used to optimise any system variable that is input to the hydraulic simulation model. This may include <b>pipe</b> network <b>layout,</b> <b>pipe</b> sizes, tank locations and pump sizes. It is possible to incorporate any type of cost or objective function and any performance constraint that may be imposed on the system (and evaluated by hydraulic simulation), no matter how specific. A case study is presented to demonstrate the versatility of the GA technique and the significant cost savings that may be achieved by the application of this technique to a practical irrigation network design problem. The case study involves the rehabilitation of an aged pressure pipe system (constructed in the 1920 s) in the Loveday Division of the Cobdogla Irrigation Area in the South Australian Riverland. The design achieved by the GA search saved 11. 0 % of the estimated cost for the supply and construction of pipelines, compared to the design determined by the conventional design approach based on experience and the trial-and-error application of a hydraulic simulation package.

40|$|Abstract: We {{proposed}} an economic, cost-constrained optimal {{design of a}} water distribution system (WDS) that maximizes seismic reliability while satisfying pressure constraints. The model quantifies the seismic reliability of a WDS {{through a series of}} procedures: stochastic earthquake generation, seismic intensity attenuation, determination of the pipe failure status (normal, leakage, and breakage), pipe failure modeling in hydraulic simulation, and negative pressure treatment. The network’s seismic reliability is defined as the ratio of the available quantity of water to the required water demand under stochastic earthquakes. The proposed model allows no pipe option in decisions, making it possible to identify seismic-reliability-based optimal layout for a WDS. The model takes into account the physical impact of earthquake events on the WDS, which ultimately affects the network’s boundary conditions (e. g., failure level of pipes). A well-known benchmark network, the Anytown network, is used to demonstrate the proposed model. The network’s optimal topology and pipe layouts are determined from a series of optimizations. The results show that installing large redundant pipes degrades the system’s seismic reliability because the pipes will cause a large rupture opening under failure. Our model is a useful tool to find the optimal <b>pipe</b> <b>layout</b> that maximizes system reliability under earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|Water {{is a very}} {{important}} component in the production process at underground coal mines. Current unfavourable economic conditions have forced the coal mining industry to identify and address every possible bottleneck preventing optimal production. An increase in water-related downtime was identified as one of the bottlenecks at Goedehoop Colliery’s Vlaklaagte Shaft. The purpose of this project was to identify the various causes that contributed to the high downtime (501 hours in 2013, which led to a potential profit loss of R 12. 9 million) and to suggest possible solutions. After a thorough investigation the main causes of water-related downtime were identified as low water pressure and low water flow caused by pipe leakages and bursts. The main root cause for the low water flow and pressure was identified as being the low pressure resistance (1600 kPa) of the thin-walled galvanized steel pipes used in the underground inbye water reticulation system. The pipes were selected according to the previous 1000 kPa pressure requirement for the continuous miner. However, the pressure requirement changed to 1500 kPa, which resulted in the pipes being exposed to much higher pressures than designed for. The water reticulation system was reviewed and current and future underground <b>pipe</b> <b>layout</b> and water requirements were determined for the shaft. The time frame in which the water consumption would be the highest was determined to be between 1 January 2014 and 7 September 2014. Machine and sprayer specifications were used to determine the water consumption at the shaft. Three different solutions were considered to solve the water-related downtime problem and to ensure the efficient supply of water to the newly open sections. Permanent underground concrete dams, semi-mobile dams, or new pipe columns with a higher pressure resistance of 3200 kPa were considered. A trade-off study (taking into consideration cost, time to completion and ease of implementation, maintenance requirements, safety, and flexibility) was completed to determine which of these solutions would be most viable.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{the problem}} of {{underground}} vertical U-tube heat exchangers in ground source heat pump systems in Shenchi station of Shuohuang railway, the transient heat transfer physical and mathematical model of the soil and borehole temperature field is established. Finite element numerical simulation is made by virtue of MATLAB software. Through the method of numerical simulation, the paper analyzes the soil temperature, obtains the distribution of isotherms around the pipes and the scope of the heat transfer, and understands the heat transfer performance around the pipe intuitively. Based on the model and numerical solution, the paper analyzes the changes of temperature field about the soil around ground heat exchangers in different ways which involve geological conditions operating mode, <b>layout,</b> <b>pipe</b> depth, and pipe coupling interval situation, and then the dates are obtained to help the engineering design of ground heat exchangers...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} documented cases of extraction of fluids {{from the ground}} causing surface subsidence. The cases include groundwater, oil and gas, as well as geothermal fluid withdrawal. A recent comprehensive review {{of all types of}} man-induced land subsidence was published by the Geological Survey of America. At the early stages of a geothermal power development project it is standard practice in most countries for an environmental impact report to be required. The possibility of geothermal subsidence has to be addressed, and usually it falls on the geophysicists and/or geologists to make some predictions. The advice given is vital for planning the power plant location and the borefield <b>pipe</b> and drain <b>layout.</b> It {{is not so much the}} vertical settlement that occurs with subsidence but the accompanying horizontal ground strains that can do the most damage to any man-made structure...|$|R
40|$|A multicriteria maximum-entropy {{approach}} to the joint <b>layout,</b> <b>pipe</b> size and reliability optimization of water distribution systems is presented. The capital cost {{of the system is}} taken as the principal criterion, and so the trade-offs between cost, entropy, reliability and redundancy are examined sequentially in a large population of optimal solutions. The novelty of the method stems from the use of the maximum-entropy value as a preliminary filter, which screens out {{a large proportion of the}} candidate layouts at an early stage of the process before the designs and their reliability values are actually obtained. This technique, which is based on the notion that the entropy is potentially a robust hydraulic reliability measure, contributes greatly to the efficiency of the proposed method. The use of head-dependent modelling for simulating pipe failure conditions in the reliability calculations also complements the method in locating the Pareto-optimal front. The computational efficiency, robustness, accuracy and other advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by application to a sample network...|$|R
