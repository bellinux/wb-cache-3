500|$|Fuller {{travelled}} {{five miles}} (eight kilometres) after the collision, then successfully made an emergency <b>pancake</b> <b>landing</b> {{in a large}} paddock [...] south-west of Brocklesby. The locked aircraft slid [...] across the grass before coming to rest. As far as Fuller was concerned, the touchdown was better than any he had made when practising circuits and bumps at Forest Hill airfield the previous day. His acting commanding officer, Squadron Leader Cooper, declared the choice of improvised runway [...] "perfect", and the landing itself as a [...] "wonderful effort". The RAAF's Inspector of Air Accidents, Group Captain Arthur [...] "Spud" [...] Murphy, flew straight to the scene from Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne, accompanied by his deputy Henry Winneke.

50|$|A belly landing, <b>pancake</b> <b>landing</b> or gear-up landing {{occurs when}} an {{aircraft}} lands without its landing gear fully extended and uses its underside, or belly, as its primary landing device. Normally the term gear-up landing refers to incidents {{in which the}} pilot forgets to extend the landing gear, while belly landing refers to incidents where a mechanical malfunction prevents the pilot from extending the landing gear.|$|E

She {{was able to}} save herself by holding the biplane level and effecting a <b>pancake</b> <b>landing.</b> Remarkably, the only damage was a broken girder near the engine and a cut to her hand.

50|$|Even {{today there}} is a certain {{symbolism}} associated with the preparation of the crÃªpes. A tradition dating back to the late fifth century and linked to a fertility rite is to flip the crepes in the air with the right hand while holding a gold coin (such as a Louis d'or) or some other coin in the left hand, in order to have prosperity throughout the year. One has to ensure that the <b>pancake</b> <b>lands</b> properly back in the pan. It is also said that the first crepe made should be kept in an armoire to ensure a plentiful harvest later in the year. It is sometimes specified that it be placed {{at the top of the}} armoire, and the pancake will supposedly not get moldy and will keep misery and deprivation far away.|$|R
50|$|His exploit in the V6 {{made him}} famous, and Balthasar {{found himself in}} command of the newly formed combat group with the V6 and three He 45C recon planes. Over the next few months the V6 was flown by a number of pilots, and on 6 July Unteroffizier Max Schulze knocked out an {{additional}} number of armored cars. On 19 July Schulze was once again flying the V6 when the engine seized during landing. Schultze walked away from the resulting <b>pancake</b> <b>landing,</b> but the plane broke her back and was a writeoff.|$|E
50|$|During {{the run of}} the idents, {{there were}} also quick, usually humorous short {{animations}} shown before the trailers known as 'Stings'. Examples included a 2-shaped <b>pancake</b> <b>landing</b> in a frying pan, a '2' performing stunts on a bicycle, or a set of spinning plates {{in the form of the}} '2'. These were sometimes themed to suit a particular event, such as sport coverage; for instance, a set of snooker balls racked in the '2' shape. Animations were also created to match the theme of a year's Christmas symbol. During the 1995 Christmas period, for example, a set of short animations featuring Wallace and Gromit were used, along with a similarly themed ident.|$|E
