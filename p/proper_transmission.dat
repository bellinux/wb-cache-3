50|$|A new {{transmitting}} {{facility was}} installed by the PMG's Department at Cox Peninsula near Darwin {{in the late}} 1960s, rebroadcasting programs emanating from Radio Australia studios in Melbourne. Equipment included three Collins Radio 250 kW HF transmitters and five log-periodic antennas directed at East Asia and South-east Asia. The antennas were largely demolished by Cyclone Tracy on 25 December 1974 and Radio Australia broadcasts from this locality were not reinstated (by then Telecom Australia) until about 1988.

50|$|During {{skeletal}} myogenesis, cycling progenitor cells {{known as}} myoblasts differentiate and fuse together into non-cycling muscle cells called myocytes that {{remain in a}} terminal G0 phase. As a result, the fibers that make up skeletal muscle (myofibers) are cells with multiple nuclei, referred to as myonuclei, since each myonuclei originated from a single myoblast. Skeletal muscle cells continue indefinitely to provide contractile force through simultaneous contractions of cellular structures called sarcomeres. Importantly, these cells are kept in a terminal G0 phase since disruption of muscle fiber structure after myofiber formation would prevent <b>proper</b> <b>transmission</b> of force through {{the length of the}} muscle. Muscle growth can be stimulated by growth or injury and involves the recruitment of muscle stem cells - also known as satellite cells - out of a reversible quiescent state. These stem cells differentiate and fuse to generate new muscle fibers both in parallel and in series to increase force generation capacity.|$|E

The QoS demand of a connection is represented as an expected packet error rate (PER). Based on this expected PER, the BS calculates the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of each mode.
