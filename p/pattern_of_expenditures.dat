50|$|The radical nationalization-expropriation {{measures}} in the mid-1970s were initially accompanied by a policy-induced redistribution of national income from property owners, entrepreneurs, and private managers and professionals to industrial and agricultural workers. This wage explosion favoring workers with a high propensity to consume had a dramatic impact on the nation's economic growth and <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Private and public consumption combined rose from 81 percent of domestic expenditure in 1973 to nearly 102 percent in 1975. The counterpart of overconsumption {{in the face of}} declining national output was a contraction in both savings and fixed capital formation, depletion of stocks, and a huge balance-of-payments deficit. The rapid increase in production costs associated with the surge in unit labor costs between 1973 and 1975 contributed significantly to the decline in Portugal's ability to compete in foreign markets. Real exports fell between 1973 and 1976, and their share in total expenditures declined from nearly 26 percent to 16.5 percent.|$|E

In this study, a median voter framework is used to analyse the demand for landscape management services based on the expenditures of sub-federal governments for two decentralized landscape management programmes in Switzerland. Furthermore, based on the expenditures for one cantonal and one national agri-environmental scheme, it is determined whether the cantonal scheme resulted in a more demand-oriented <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> than the national scheme.

40|$|Incidence {{studies of}} fiscal policy in {{developing}} countries typically examine either the distribution of tax burdens or the incidence of public expenditures. But the central issue for policymakers is the combined or net incidence of fiscal activities. One reason that combined incidence studies are so rare is that they require detailed data on both taxation and public spending. The authors show that the net incidence of fiscal policy {{in a country with}} average data - the Philippines - can be estimated using a variety of data sources and tools, using simplifying assumptions. For 20 years, the Philippine economy has experienced a series of balance of payments crises triggered by fiscal crises. It has had an unsatisfactory record of poverty alleviation. The authors examine net fiscal incidence to find out how poverty will be affected by the rise in taxes and the cut in spending. They found that: 1) the incidence pattern of taxes is basically neutral. Contrary to expectations, indirect taxes are only slightly regressive; and 2) it is the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> that drives the combined incidence, which is progressive.

40|$|Standard {{models of}} intertemporal {{allocation}} {{predict that the}} time path of expenditures should beindependent of the time path of income. Recently two papers, Parker (1999) and Souleles (1999) have suggested that U. S. households have a high marginal propensity to spend within yearanticipated income changes. We use an expenditure survey panel from Spain to re-examine thisissue. We exploit two important features of the Spanish data. First, we have quarterly panel datathat follows households {{for more than four}} quarters. Second, we use the fact that workers areexogenously sorted into one of two payment schemes: some receive the same amount eachmonth of the year and others receive an extra payment in June and December. The extra paymentis large and predictable. We examine the detailed <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> over the year to seewhether they differ between the two groups. We fail to find even weak differences. Wecomplement this with a conventional Euler equation analysis of excess sensitivity. Our predictingequation for (quarterly) earnings growth is much better than usual and is likely to give a powerfultest of the hypothesis that predictable changes in income do not lead to changes in expenditurepatterns. The results of this analysis confirm the graphical analysis: we find no evidence ofexcess sensitivity. We conclude that households in normal times do smooth consumption overthe year. We suggest a reconciliation of our results with those of Parker and Souleles. Consumption; Excess Sensitivity; Smoothing. ...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{new data}} file of {{insurance}} claims under employer- provided health plans {{to describe the}} <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> in a large corporation: who spends? on what? for how long? The description is illustrative of detail that can be distilled for other firms. There are three noticeable features of spending: (1) The differences in {{the provisions of the}} two FIRM plans seem to have substantial effects on health care expenditures. Inpatient expenditures are a much larger fraction of the total under a first-dollar coverage plan available to hourly employees. (2) Substance abuse and other mental health disorders account for a surprisingly large fraction of health care costs. (3) The components of health care cost differ substantially across individuals, demographic groups, and plans, suggesting that further analysis of the 'micro' details of medical expenditures may help to assess the probable implications of alternative insurance reforms. (4) There is substantial persistence in individual health care expenditures from year to year. Illustrative calculations suggest that this persistence may lead to considerable inequality in individual costs under demand-side insurance reforms such as those coupled with IHA saving plans, and thus may place important limitations on plans that might otherwise be attractive. The exploratory analysis contained in this paper suggests that firm data can provide important insights into the black box that erupts expenditures under private insurance plans. And, hence these data may provide greater understanding of how plan reforms may affect expenditures. ...|$|E

40|$|The views {{expressed}} {{are those of}} the author and do not necessarily represent an official position of BLS Consumer expenditures on specific items vary widely over time, consumers tend to maintain a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> for much longer time periods. The market basket of goods and services that make up the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is divided into seven major groups, such as food and beverages or housing. The pattern of consumer expenditures at this level changes more slowly than the components within a group. A Consumer Price Index {{is one of the most}} widely used economic indicators. It is a measure of the average change in the prices paid, in the United States, by urban consumers for a fixed market basket of goods and services. Knowing that consumers are constantly offered new items to include in their market basket, how do changing market baskets influence the CPI? The answer is not unambiguous and depends on the importance of the change in terms of total expenditures by consumers. When the price of a commodity goes up or down it is usual to expect consumption of that commodity to go down or up, respectively, as a result. In fact, most of us frequently make such choices every time we go the supermarket. Price indexes are produced to provide government, business, and individuals a measure to compare prices over time and make informed decisions on economic behavior. Many believe changes in the Consumer Price Index reflects changes in their standard of living. Because the CPI is a modified Laspeyres index and keeps quantities fixed between revisions, it is a measure of price change not a tru...|$|E
40|$|Many governments use price {{subsidisation}} (total {{costs less}} total revenues from user charges) to meet social protection objectives in lieu of, or in addition to, direct income transfers. Such subsidies {{may be perceived}} as influencing behaviour to further other socially desirable policies. For example, the price response induced by lowering the price of schooling will both lower the cost of living for the beneficiaries and also increase the investment in education more than a similar income transfer would achieve. The incidences of benefits from a general price subsidy are proportional to purchases and can be deduced from the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Some goods are inappropriate vehicles for redistribution since subsidies on them will not only accrue mainly to the rich they will actually increase inequality in welfare. It is therefore important to ensure that commodities chosen for price subsidisation are largely consumed by the lower income groups. Also, detailed data on such commodities should be made public to make the extent of subsidy easily tractable. In the case of Pakistan, the problem of lack of transparency of federal and provincial budgets is vividly demonstrated by the inability of such budgets to readily highlight the subsidy on the various economic and social services, which are essentially in the nature of ‘private’ goods, provided by such governments. This is not only a reflection of the problem of the nature of budgeting practices whereby, first, revenues and expenditures on different heads are shown separately and no account is made either of depreciation of assets or the costs of capital used to finance the acquisition of assets which yield a stream of services. Second, {{to the extent that the}} subsidies largely benefit the upper income groups, political compulsions dictate that such subsidies largely remain hidden. ...|$|E

Many studies reported good health-related outcomes of fasting including weight loss. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify the local <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on food consumption, dietary habits during Ramadan and correlate that to self-reported weight gain after Ramadan in a group of families in Jeddah, Western Saudi Arabia. Methods A Cross-section study using a pre-designed questionnaire to identify the local <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on food consumption, dietary habits during Ramadan and correlate that to self-reported weight gain after Ramadan in a representative cohort of Saudis living in Jeddah. It was piloted on 173 nutrition students and administered by them to their families. Results A total of 173 Saudi families were interviewed. One out of 5 indicated that their expenditure increases during Ramadan. Approximately two thirds of the respondents (59. 5 %) reported weight gain after Ramadan. When asked about their perspective explanations for that: 40 % attributed that to types of foods being rich in fat and carbohydrates particularly date in (Sunset meal) 97. 7 % and rice in (Dawn meal) 80. 9 %. One third (31. 2 %) indicated that it was due to relative lack of physical exercise in Ramadan and 14. 5 % referred that to increase in food consumption. Two thirds (65. 2 %) of those with increased expenditure reported weight gain. Conclusion Surprisingly weight gain and not weight loss was reported after Ramadan by Saudis which indicates timely needed life-style and dietary modification programs for a population which reports one of the highest prevalence rates of diabetes. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} {{condition of the}} state governments in India has been {{a cause for concern}} for sometime now. Over the years, the consolidated financial position of the state governments has shown a marked deterioration in some of their major deficit indicators. One of the fundamental weaknesses of state government finances in India {{can be attributed to the}} increases in non-developmental expenditure, particularly the revenue component <b>of</b> the non-developmental <b>expenditure,</b> and interest payments as a proportion of revenue receipts. Structural imbalances in the form of large revenue deficits, rising interest burden, increasing distortions in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and very slow growing non-tax revenues are major problem areas for state finances. These problems have been aggravated a great deal over the past few years because of a variety of reasons. The resource constraints in state finances have been accentuated by a near stagnant tax-GDP ratio, rising share of non-developmental outlay in the total <b>expenditure,</b> large volumes <b>of</b> hidden or implicit subsidies and increasing financial losses of state enterprises. A growing pressure on state finances has also stemmed from the rising demand for public services. Furthermore, the fiscal situation in the states is likely to come under much greater pressure with the acceptance of the Report of the Fifth Pay Commission by several state governments in India. Be that as it may, the critical problem in state finances is not only one of high levels <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> but also one of increasing distortions in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The three different methods of intergovernmental fiscal transfers have resulted in an inefficient transfer mechanism that has increased bureaucracy at the state level, accommodated numerous interest groups, and delinked plan requirements of states from actual transfers. Similarly, better fiscal performance is not acknowledged with higher transfers, instead the gap filling approach of the Finance Commission discourages fiscal discipline in the states. In the area <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> reduction, we have identified several potential areas for controlling <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> the state governments. In our view, by raising user charges on water in accordance with the costs incurred in providing water, and aligning tariff rates of the SEBs in line with their costs, the state governments could significantly cut their budgetary losses. In addition, a freeze on state government employment can help save scarce resources to be used for productive purposes elsewhere in the states...|$|R

Method: Nine trained males completed three 2000 m TTs on a Velotron cycling ergometer. To examine pacing strategy, the data were assigned to 250 m “bins,” with the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> aerobic and anaerobic energy expenditure calculated from total work accomplished and gas-exchange data. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between trials in performance times (191. 4 (SD 4. 3), 189. 4 (4. 6), 190. 1 (5. 6) s), total aerobic (58. 3 (2. 7), 58. 4 (3. 1), 58. 0 (3. 4) kJ) and total anaerobic energy expenditure (16. 4 (3. 3), 17. 3 (2. 8), 16. 5 (3. 1) kJ). Pacing strategy in the second and third TT differed from the first TT in that a lower power output was adopted during the first 500 m, enabling a higher power output during the final 750 m of the TT. This adjustment in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> was mediated by an alteration in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> anaerobic energy <b>expenditure,</b> which paralleled changes in total energy expenditure.
