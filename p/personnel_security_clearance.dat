40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 1974, GAO has examined <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> processes and acquired a historical view of key factors to consider in reform efforts. GAO placed the Department of Defense's (DOD) <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> program, which represents 80 percent of federal government clearances, on its high-risk list in 2005 due to long-standing problems. These problems include incomplete investigative reports from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the agency primarily responsible for providing clearance investigation services; the granting of some clearances by DOD adjudicators even when required data were missing from the investigative reports used to make such determinations; and delays in completing clearance processing. Delays {{can lead to a}} heightened risk of disclosure of classified information, additional costs and delays in completing related contracts, and problems retaining qualified personnel.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses our key findings and recommendations in our report that we are releasing today on some aspects of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> reforms. We conducted our review {{in response to a}} congressional request. This is the fourth in a series of hearings, in which Congress has asked GAO to testify; and this Subcommittee's continued oversight has helped focus attention on the need for personnel security reform. Personnel security clearances allow government and industry personnel to gain access to classified information that, through unauthorized disclosure, can in some cases cause exceptionally grave damage to U. S. national security. The July 2010 and subsequent October 2010 recent unauthorized leak of almost 500, 000 classified documents posted to the Internet related to the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq provides a cogent example of the inherent risks involved when granting an individual a security clearance. To ameliorate these risks, government agencies rely on a multiphased <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> process. However, with the increase in demand over the past decade for personnel with security clearances, we and others have identified problems with the security clearance process with respect to delays and incomplete documentation. As a result, we have designated the Department of Defense's (DOD) clearance program [...] which represents a vast majority of the initial security clearances adjudicated by the federal government [...] as a high-risk area since 2005. In light of longstanding concerns regarding delays in processing clearances and other issues, Congress set objectives and established requirements for improving the clearance process in section 3001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA). IRTPA established objectives for timeliness, requirements for reciprocity [...] an agency's acceptance of a background investigation or clearance determination completed by any authorized investigative or adjudicative agency [...] and an integrated, secure database to house clearance information. In 2007, DOD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) formed the Joint Security Clearance Process Reform Team, known as the Joint Reform Team, to transform the security clearance process governmentwide. In the following year, Executive Order 13467 was issued, establishing a Suitability and Security Clearance Performance Accountability Council (Performance Accountability Council) that is responsible for driving the implementation of reform and is accountable to the President for achieving the reform effort's goals. This governance structure was put in place, in part, to sustain the momentum of clearance reforms. We have previously noted that top leadership must be committed to organizational transformation. To this end, committed executive leadership has worked to reform the <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> process by improving timeliness and developing quality measures. Congressional oversight through hearings held by this subcommittee in February, July and September 2008, and in October 2009 has helped focus attention on the need for security clearance reform. In addition, the recently passed Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires reports by the President on the security clearance process, including information on timeliness and quality. This statement highlights the key findings and recommendations from the report we are issuing today. Specifically, it will focus {{on the extent to which}} select executive branch agencies (1) investigate and adjudicate initial <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> applications for civilian, military, and industry personnel in a timely manner; (2) honor previously granted personnel security clearances and the challenges, if any, that exist related to reciprocity; and (3) share personnel clearance information in a single, integrated database. ...|$|E

5000|$|CRI in {{particular}} offers especially broad protection to service members and {{employees of the}} Defense Intelligence Community through the Defense Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Program because CRI is the lead federal investigative entity reviewing <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> decision-making as a pretext for reprisal. This is done under the Inspector General’s authority, and not through an application of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Section 2302 of title 5 lists twelve distinct prohibited personnel practices that, when following a disclosure of wrongdoing, may constitute a whistleblower reprisal. Severe actions such as termination, reassignment, or demotion are included among these title 5-defined adverse actions; however, <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> decision-making and other adverse <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> decisions {{are not covered by}} the Whistleblower Protection Act. Since intelligence and counterintelligence employment is absolutely contingent upon gaining and maintaining a <b>security</b> <b>clearance,</b> review of <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> decision-making used as a pretext for reprisal is necessary in the protection of Defense Intelligence Community whistleblowers. For this reason, CRI investigates reprisal allegations regarding security determinations through the IG Act, which is not limited by [...] exemptions for intelligence and counterintelligence agencies. Accordingly, a revocation of a <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> is reviewable as a pretext for reprisal. In its reports of investigation reviewing <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> decisions, CRI classifies a negative action taken by a responsible management official as a “unfavorable <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> determination” (USPD) and then applies title 5 standards to its review. In addition to the actions included under the definition of a UPSD, CRI also investigates suspension of <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> as well as recommendations to an agency’s central adjudication facility to revoke, deny, or suspend <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> as possible unfavorable <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> determinations. While not actionable in and of themselves, suspensions and recommendations to a CAF are examined by CRI because they may constitute contributing pretexts to reprisal through security determination. By identifying these measures as actionable unfavorable <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> determinations, CRI is able to provide broad protection to whistleblowers within the DoD intelligence community.|$|R

S. screening system shows how security clearance practices, including everything from background checks and fingerprinting to urinalysis and the polygraph, shape and transform those individuals who are subject to them. By bringing participants’ testimonies to light, Deutscher looks at the efficacy of various practices while extracting revealing cultural insights into {{the way we think about}} privacy, national security, patriotism, and the state.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPublicized incidents involving espionage or violence by government employees with <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> have raised {{concern for the}} <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> community.

This thesis developed a comprehensive list of current Internet behaviors, and used the list to examine Internet behavior in cases of cleared government employees who {{have been charged with}} espionage or terrorism-related crimes since 2008. Cases showed a trend of increasing variety of behaviors in these cases with time. In contrast, data from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pertaining to proposed <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> denials related to the Use of Information Technology Systems guideline showed a slight decrease. Incorporation of cybervetting into the background investigation process is proposed as a measure to enhance mitigation of questionable Internet behaviors, and may result in an increase in <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> denials. Examination of the list of Internet behaviors against the current adjudicative guidelines resulted in recommended improvements for the Foreign Influence, Financial Considerations, Personal Conduct, Handling Protected Information, and Use of Information Technology Systems guidelines. Operations Security is proposed as a completely new adjudicative guideline. Supervisory <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> Specialist, U. S.
