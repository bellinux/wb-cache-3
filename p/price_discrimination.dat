25|$|The {{monopoly}} model, already {{considered by}} marginalist economists, describes a profit maximizing capitalist facing a market demand curve with no competitors, who may practice <b>price</b> <b>discrimination.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is not {{the same}} as <b>price</b> <b>discrimination,</b> the {{practice}} by which monopolists (and to a lesser extent oligopolists and monopolistic competitors) charge different buyers different prices based on their willingness to pay.|$|E
25|$|These {{problems}} with the club-good mechanism arise because the underlying marginal cost of giving the good to more people is low or zero, but, because {{of the limits of}} <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> those who are unwilling or unable to pay a profit-maximizing price do not gain access to the good.|$|E

To the extent that Becker&# 039;s (1971) theory is correct, we anticipate greater levels of discrimination in less competitive sectors of the economy. The data do not support that notion. We also investigate whether the <b>price</b> of <b>discrimination</b> varies by identity of discriminator. Overall the <b>price</b> of <b>discrimination</b> is about A$ 15, 000...|$|R
50|$|This act {{is one in}} a {{category}} of regulatory enactments which attempt to control <b>price</b> <b>discriminations</b> - or different prices for identical products. Similar prohibitions on discrimination {{have been found in}} specialized regulatory systems, such as those relating to transportation and communications.|$|R
50|$|Another {{explanation}} {{of the existence of}} a dual housing market is the availability of housing units, either for sale or for rent, for minority groups. Oftentimes, <b>price</b> <b>discriminations</b> results from <b>price</b> fluctuations of property based on the existing demographic of residence in a neighborhood. Racial preference affects the available geographic spaces open to certain minority groups. For example, African Americans are disproportionately found in a small distribution of suburban communities.|$|R

25|$|The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 102 {{contains}} the prohibition on monopolies abusing a dominant position. As {{well as a}} general ban, it prohibits specific practices including <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> and exclusive dealing. It enables legislation to be adopted on mergers between firms (the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC). The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition.|$|E
25|$|Patents {{have been}} criticized in the {{developing}} world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines. Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of <b>price</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Moreover, under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organization, countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read {{with the goals of}} public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.|$|E

30|$|Throughout this paper, and {{following}} directly from R&C’s brokerage model, {{it has been}} assumed that the broker has a monopoly position. Indeed, the WZH reservation model, which R&C’s brokerage model extends, is described by the authors as a mechanism that “extracts revenue {{similar to that of}} a monopoly provider practicing temporal <b>pricing</b> <b>discrimination</b> with a user population whose preference distribution is known in advance”[11]). Thus, the brokerage model relies on the broker being somehow able to position itself as a monopoly provider of options; perhaps through an exclusive licensing agreement with the provider.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mechanism}} for reservations of bursty resources that is both truthful and robust. It consists of option contracts whose pricing structure induces users to reveal the true likelihoods that they will purchase a given resource. Users are also allowed to adjust their options as their likelihood changes. This scheme helps users save cost and the providers to plan ahead so as {{to reduce the risk}} of under-utilization and overbooking. The mechanism extracts revenue similar to that of a monopoly provider practicing temporal <b>pricing</b> <b>discrimination</b> with a user population whose preference distribution is known in advance. 1...|$|R
25|$|Some {{consumers}} {{are concerned that}} yield management could penalize them for conditions which cannot be helped and are unethical to penalize. For example, the formulas, algorithms, and neural networks that determine airline ticket prices could feasibly consider frequent flyer information, which includes a wealth of socio-economic information such as age and home address. The airline then could charge higher prices to consumers who are between certain ages or who live in neighborhoods with higher average wealth, even if those neighborhoods also include poor households. Very few (if any) airlines using yield management are able to employ this level of <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> because prices are not set based on characteristics of the purchaser, which are in any case often not known {{at the time of}} purchase.|$|E
2500|$|Discrimination {{based on}} price is {{charging}} different prices for {{goods and services}} to different people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or sex.

40|$|The {{classical}} <b>price</b> (quantity) <b>discrimination</b> model {{relies on}} the assumption that the consumers can neither buy more than one bundle each, nor resell the goods to each other.

30|$|We {{therefore}} {{conclude that}} {{the introduction of a}} new secondary market venue for users to buy and sell RIs has closed the window of opportunity to commercially exploit the brokerage model of R&C. This is particularly compelling, since R&C’s brokerage model assumes that the broker has a monopoly position. Indeed, the WZH reservation model, which R&C’s brokerage model extends, is described by the authors as a mechanism that “extracts revenue similar to that of a monopoly provider practicing temporal <b>pricing</b> <b>discrimination</b> with a user population whose preference distribution is known in advance”[11]). Thus, the brokerage model relies on the broker being somehow able to position itself as a monopoly provider of options; perhaps through an exclusive licensing agreement with the provider. However, every user now has the ability to trade RIs on ARIM. Thus, the assumption that the broker has a monopoly position is no longer tenable. For this reason, the brokerage model must be able to compete with prices expected on the secondary market. As we have shown, this is not possible.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of the Internet and other digital technologies has had a considerable influence on all elements of the marketing mix, including pricing. This is especially important {{in the context of}} service industries, such as hotels and airline companies, where digital technologies dramatically altered pricing policies. This process is dominated by dynamic pricing – a <b>pricing</b> <b>discrimination</b> technique which leverages real-time pricing and individualizes prices. Customers are aware that companies are charging different prices for the same products or services, and the issue of price fairness has also emerged. Unfavorable customers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of dynamically determined prices could lead to different consequences for the company, such as negative word-of-mouth and social media communication, and a decrease in customer loyalty.

2500|$|Copyright is {{typically}} {{thought of as}} a limited, legally sanctioned monopoly. Because of this, copyright licensing may sometimes interfere too much in free and competitive markets. These concerns are governed by legal doctrines such as competition law in the European Union, anti-trust law in the United States, and anti-monopoly law in Russia and Japan. Competition issues may arise when the licensing party unfairly leverages market power, engages in <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> through its licensing terms, or otherwise uses a licensing agreement in a discriminatory or unfair manner. Attempts to extend the copyright term granted by law [...] for example, by collecting royalties for use of the work after its copyright term has expired and it has passed into the public domain [...] raise such competition concerns.|$|E
2500|$|Yield {{management}} is a variable pricing strategy, based on understanding, anticipating and influencing consumer behavior {{in order to}} maximize revenue or profits from a fixed, time-limited resource (such as airline seats or hotel room reservations or advertising inventory). As a specific, inventory-focused branch of revenue management, yield management involves strategic control of inventory to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price. This process can result in <b>price</b> <b>discrimination,</b> in which customers consuming identical goods or services are charged different prices. Yield {{management is}} a large revenue generator for several major industries; Robert Crandall, former Chairman and CEO of American Airlines, gave yield management its name and has called it [...] "the single most important technical development in transportation management since we entered deregulation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson began {{pushing for}} {{legislation}} which culminated with the Federal Trade Commission Act signed in September 1914. In doing so, Wilson broke with his predecessors' practice of litigating the antitrust {{issue in the}} courts, known as trust-busting; the new Federal Trade Commission provided a new regulatory approach, to encourage competition and reduce perceived unfair trade practices. In addition, he pushed through Congress the Clayton Antitrust Act making certain business practices illegal, such as <b>price</b> <b>discrimination,</b> agreements prohibiting retailers from handling other companies' products, and directorates and agreements to control other companies. The power of this legislation was {{greater than that of}} previous anti-trust laws since it dictated accountability of individual corporate officers and clarified guidelines. This law was considered the [...] "Magna Carta" [...] of labor by Samuel Gompers because it ended union liability antitrust laws. In 1916, under threat of a national railroad strike, Wilson approved legislation that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employees; there was no strike.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} forms of <b>price</b> <b>discrimination.</b> First degree <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> charges each {{consumer}} the maximum price {{the consumer is}} willing to pay. Second degree <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> involves quantity discounts.

Third degree <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> is the most prevalent type.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> on social {{efficiency}} are unclear. Output can be expanded when <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> is very efficient.

5000|$|Gender-based <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{is a form}} of {{economic}} discrimination that occurs when one gender is charged a different price than another gender for identical goods or services. Race and class-based <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> also exists. Acts of discrimination often have legal ramifications, but a study of gender-based <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> first looks at gendered price disparities. From there, the question of whether gendered price disparities prove an intent to discriminate or constitute illegal discrimination can become a legal inquiry that is developed by examining the law of the applicable jurisdiction. [...] Gender-based <b>price</b> <b>discrimination</b> is typically disapproved of, but not universally. In the United States, a few states have adopted statutes forbidding gender-based <b>price</b> <b>discrimination,</b> but these policies are largely unenforced.|$|E
30|$|Most {{theoretical}} and empirical studies of low-cost airlines focus {{on the relationship between}} pricing and route characteristics, market structure, and other variables ([19, 22 – 25]. The diversity of these and other results suggests that the effects of competition on low-cost carrier pricing are complex and not easily predictable. Pels and Rietveld analyse the London-Paris market, on which both low-cost and traditional carriers operate. Some of these carriers seem to lower fares when potential competitors raise theirs, probably because the price movements are interpreted as signal of market saturation. Pitfield analyses the price behaviours of low-cost carriers competing on UK-based markets, and finds evidence of correlation between the fares. He also suggests that the temporal <b>pricing</b> <b>discrimination</b> adopted by duopolistic low-cost markets is a threat to the recovery of all fixed costs. Piga and Bachis [24] find a positive correlation between a LCC’s market share at the origin airport and the fares it offers. Analysing Ryanair’s pricing strategy, Malighetti et al. [19, 25] find that competition induces a greater advance discount without significantly affecting the average fare offered. They also find that Ryanair, after stimulating new demand and increasing the frequency of its existing flights, has consolidated its dominant position by employing a less aggressive pricing strategy.|$|R

40|$|The pervasiveness {{and nature}} of dual pricing of {{periodicals}} (different subscription price structures for institutions and individuals) is ex-plored, employing a stratified sample of 180 American titles for a span of ten years (1966 - 75). Initiated at least {{as early as the}} mid- 1950 s, approximately 15 percent of all titles sampled now stipulate two subscription rates. The extent of such a phenomenon on period-ical budgets is magnified by the fac! that the disparity between the two subscription rates is increasing, and the mean annual institutional rate is rising at a significantly faster rate than the mean price assessed to individual subscribers. CASUAL CONVERSATION about dual pric-ing of periodicals has been in existence for several years. It cannot, however, be said that the talk has in any way been substantive in nature regarding the sub-ject. Still there has been at least an awareness that publishers of periodicals quite frequently charge a higher rate for institutional subscribers than for individual subscribers. There also has been the expressed uneasiness regarding the trend toward higher institutional rates which only seemed to fuel the ef-fect of inflation on the cost of library materials. But as with other facts of life there seemed to be the typical resig-nation to the increased costs via this double pricing scheme. At the time of this investigation (early 1976) · the lit-erature was void of material pertaining to dual pricing.

In practice, government is the core impetus of propelling V 2 G services, especially in the initial stage. For example, through “Los Angeles Air Force Base Vehicle to Grid Pilot Project” led by U.S. Air Force, the related technologies and the market mechanism have been verified; moreover, it also concluded that many policy hurdles (e.g. high regulatory barriers) must be removed. The other project is initiated by U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which aims to understand V 2 G services benefits, and to evaluate grid interoperability standards. In terms of Europe, the “SEEV 4 -City” project has been launched by 13 partners from 5 cities across Europe. The main aim of SEEV 4 -City is to develop the concept “Vehicle for Energy” services into sustainable (commercially and socially viable) business models to integrate EVs and renewable energy. In addition, other stakeholders also initiate their demonstration projects of V 2 G services. Take “Parker” for example. This is sponsored by Nissan, NUVVE, Frederiksberg Forsyning, Mitsubishi Motors and other companies. The objective of this project is to validate electric vehicles as part of an operational vehicle fleet that can support the power grid by becoming a vertically integrated resource, providing seamless support (i.e. V 2 G) to the power grid both locally and system-wide.|$|R
