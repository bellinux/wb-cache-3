40|$|Twenty {{microsatellites}} (simple sequence repeats, SSR) {{were used}} to discriminate wild boar from domestic <b>pig</b> <b>and</b> to identify mixtures of the two. Reference groups of wild boar <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> samples were collected from the UK and Europe for genetic assignment tests. Bayesian Analysis of Populations software (BAPs) gave 100 % correct assignment for blind wild boar <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> samples <b>and</b> correctly identified mixed samples. DNA was extracted from 12 commercial food samples (11 labeled as containing wild boar) including patés, salamis, and sausage, and good SSR profiles were obtained. Eleven samples were correctly assigned as <b>pig,</b> <b>and</b> two as mixed meats. One sample sold as wild boar meat was clearly assigned as pig. A further 10 blind samples of meat cuts were analyzed, eight wild boar <b>and</b> two <b>pig,</b> <b>and</b> all were correctly assigned...|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, {{most of whom were}} occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> domestic fowl. Workers supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning and weaving of wool at home. The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the Black Death in 1646.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced <b>pigs,</b> <b>and</b> spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} {{acceptance of the}} 3R's, many countries—including Canada, Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Germany—have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines {{in the use of}} cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea <b>pigs,</b> <b>and</b> hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals, resulting in an increase in overall animal use.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Marquesan Dog. They were {{introduced}} to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, <b>pigs,</b> <b>and</b> the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point.|$|E
5|$|More than 50 {{species of}} exotic mammals have been {{recorded}} in South Florida, at least 19 of which are self-sustaining. Colonies of feral mammals are established in or around the Everglades, including dogs, <b>pigs,</b> <b>and</b> cats. Wild animals native {{to other parts of}} the U.S. have also been established including nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi).|$|E

5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E
5|$|The dodo, and its extinction, {{was more}} typical of the extinctions of pigeons in the past. Like many species that {{colonise}} remote islands with few predators, it {{lost much of its}} predator avoidance behaviour, along with its ability to fly. The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, <b>pigs,</b> <b>and</b> cats, quickly spelled the end for this species and all the other island forms that have become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} algae {{are regularly}} monitored and removed {{to protect the}} benthic habitat. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E

5|$|The islanders' {{livelihood}} {{was based}} on fishing (for white fish, herring and lobster), crofting (with up to 55 ha (0.21 sq mi) of arable and pasture land fertilised by wrack on which sheep, cattle, ponies, <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> poultry were kept) and very dependent on the bounty provided by seabirds. For example, rent was payable to The MacNeil in fachaich or ‘fatlings’ - shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E

Ingestion of N. pseudonarcissus or N. jonquilla is followed by salivation, acute abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, then neurological and cardiac events, including trembling, convulsions, and paralysis. Death may result if large quantities are consumed.|$|E
