The condition often affects only one foot. Severity varies, with some animals usable for work or riding, and others unsound for life. Careful farrier work on the hooves can lessen the severity of many cases, and in certain circumstances surgery may be beneficial. The visible outward appearance of a club foot has different possible origins that include a genetic predisposition to the condition, a congenital defect formed while the animal is in the womb, or problems with diet and bone development during the early <b>post-natal</b> <b>period.</b> Certain horse breeds appear to be more predisposed to the condition than others, but research has yet to identify the genes involved.|$|E

The Child Welfare Law of December 1947 extended special protection to abused, abandoned, and neglected children, guaranteed the privacy rights of children born out of wedlock, established health-care programmes for mothers and children, provided for prenatal care, outlawed the employment of minors in dangerous occupations, and abolished the practice of indentured labour.

40|$|A {{direct link}} between antenatal {{maternal}} mood and fetal behaviour, as observed by ultrasound from 27 to 28 weeks of gestation onwards, is well established. Moreover, 14 independent prospective studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal anxiety/stress and cognitive, behavioural, and emotional problems in the child. This link generally persisted after controlling for post-natal maternal mood and other relevant confounders in the pre- and <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods.</b> Although some inconsistencies remain, the results in general support a fetal programming hypothesis. Several gestational ages {{have been reported to}} be vulnerable to the long-term effects of antenatal anxiety/stress and different mechanisms are likely to operate at different stages. Possible underlying mechanisms are just starting to be explored. Cortisol appears to cross the placenta and thus may affect the fetus and disturb ongoing developmental processes. The development of the HPA-axis, limbic system, and the prefrontal cortex are likely to be affected by antenatal maternal stress and anxiety. The magnitude of the long-term effects of antenatal maternal anxiety/stress on the child is substantial. Programs to reduce maternal stress in pregnancy are therefore warranted. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOlfaction {{is crucial}} for short {{distance}} host location and pheromone detection by insects. Complexes of olfactory receptors (ORs) are composed of odor-specific ORs and OR co-receptors (Orco). Orcos are widely co-expressed with odor-specific ORs and are conserved across insect taxa. A number of Orco orthologs have been studied to date, although none has been identified in cereal aphids. In this study, an Orco gene ortholog was cloned from the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, and named “SaveOrco”; RNA interference (RNAi) reduced the expression of SaveOrco to 34. 11 % in aphids, resulting in weaker EAG (electroantennogram) responses to plant volatiles (Z- 3 -hexene- 1 -ol; methyl salicylate, MeSA) and aphid alarm pheromone (E-β-farnesene, EBF). Aphid wing differentiation induced by EBF was investigated in both RNAi treated and untreated aphids. EBF induced production of winged aphids in both pre-natal and <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods</b> in untreated aphids, but no such induction was observed in the RNAi-treated aphids. We conclude that SaveOrco {{is crucial for}} the aphid's response to pheromones and other volatiles, and is involved in wing differentiation triggered by EBF...|$|R

50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{there was}} concern {{regarding}} the high and rising maternal mortality rates, and Douglas made {{a significant contribution to}} their reduction. As a Medical Officer, she monitored maternity services and child welfare in Scotland, making reports to the Chief Medical Officer, which contributed to an improvement in maternity services and provision. In 1935, she and her colleague Dr Peter L. McKinlay published the Report on Maternal Mortality and Morbidity in Scotland, a comprehensive investigation into maternal death in Scotland. The report found that 60% of all deaths attributed to childbirth were regarded as avoidable caused by inadequate or intrusive medical care and a lack of medical support. The recommendations from the Douglas and McKinlay's report ultimately lead to the Maternity Services Scotland (1937) Act after they were endorsed in the Scottish Health Services Committee Report (Cathcart Report of 1936, a report on Scotland's health services which informed the development of the Scottish National Health Service. The Act required that any women could make application for the joint services of a physician and midwife throughout her pregnancy, labour, and the <b>post-natal</b> <b>period,</b> with the advice or help of an expert obstetrician. As a result, there was a 1,000% {{increase in the number of}} hospital beds available to pregnant women, increasing from 300 in 1926 to 3,000 in 1948.

40|$|Renal-specific {{oxido-reductase}} (RSOR), {{an enzyme}} relevant to diabetic nephropathy, is exclusively expressed in renal tubules. Studies were initiated to determine whether, like other tubular specific proteins, it selectively modulates tubulogenesis. Northern blot analyses revealed a ∼ 1. 5 kb transcript, and RSOR expression was detectable in mice embryonic kidneys at day- 13, gradually increased by day- 17 and extended into neo- and <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods.</b> RSOR mRNA and protein expression {{was confined to}} proximal tubules, commencing at day- 17 and increasing subsequently, but remained absent in glomeruli and medulla. Treatment with RSOR antisense oligodeoxynucleotide resulted in a dose-dependant dysmorphogenesis of metanephric explants harvested at day- 13. The explants were smaller, had expanded mesenchyme, and the population of tubules was markedly decreased. The glomeruli were unaffected, as assessed by mRNA expression of glomerular epithelial protein 1 and reactivity with wheat germ agglutinin. Antisense treatment led to a selective reduction of RSOR mRNA. Immunoprecipitation also indicated a selective translational blockade of RSOR. These findings suggest that RSOR is developmentally regulated, exhibits a distinct spatio-temporal distribution and probably {{plays a role in}} tubulogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Strategies to {{meet the}} {{healthcare}} needs of pregnant women are made available throughout antenatal, intra-partum and <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods.</b> These strategies are aimed at reducing perinatal and maternal mortality amongst women who access and utilise healthcare at an early stage. Late visits with irregular antenatal attendance result in failure to adequately use antenatal interventions. Objectives: This study intended to compare and describe the level of patient satisfaction with antenatal care between two groups of women who received free antenatal care from community private physicians and public midwives. Methods: A quantitative comparative descriptive design with a Likert-scale measure was used. Sixty women, half from each group, participated in the study. Structured questionnaires with closed-ended response options were used to obtain data. Results: The midwives’ group was less satisfied with antenatal care than the physicians’ group, with the former citing long waiting times as contributing to their dissatisfaction with antenatal care. Conclusion: Addressing long waiting times improves satisfaction with antenatal care. Daily antenatal visits, rather than visits on a specific day, may reduce long waiting times as women’s visits are spread over all clinic days. Satisfaction with antenatal care has implications for access to healthcare, resulting in positive pregnancy outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{factors are}} {{important}} determinants {{of the development}} and function of anti-pathogen defences. Inflammation is {{a central part of}} innate immunity, but the developmental factors that shape the regulation of inflammation are not known. We test the hypothesis that microbial exposures in infancy are associated with high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) in adulthood using prospective data from a birth cohort in the Philippines (n = 1461). Lower birth weight was associated with increased CRP, consistent with a role for inflammation in the widely documented inverse relationship between birth weight and adult cardiovascular diseases. In addition, higher levels of microbial exposure in infancy were associated with lower CRP. These associations were independent of socioeconomic status, measures of current body fat and other health behaviours. We conclude that measures of microbial exposure and nutrition during the pre-natal and early <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods</b> are important predictors of CRP concentration in young adulthood. We speculate that the development of anti-inflammatory regulatory networks in response to early microbial exposure represents plasticity in the development of anti-pathogen defences, and that this process may help explain the low CRP concentrations in this population...|$|R

Current developmental theories of violence {{and aggression}} emphasize biological and psychosocial factors, particularly during adolescence. However, there has been less focus on understanding the interactive, multiplicative effects of these processes. Furthermore, {{little attention has been}} given to the pre-, peri-, and postnatal periods, where prevention and intervention may yield effective results. Early health risk factors that influence negative behavioral outcomes include prenatal and postnatal nutrition, tobacco use during pregnancy, maternal depression, birth complications, traumatic brain injury, lead exposure, and child abuse. There is an ample literature to suggest that these early health risk factors may increase the likelihood of childhood externalizing behaviors, aggression, juvenile delinquency, adult criminal behavior, and/or violence. This paper proposes an early health risk factors framework for violence prediction, built on existing developmental theories of criminal behavior and supported by empirical findings. This framework addresses gaps in the adolescent psychopathology literature and presents a novel conceptualization of behavioral disturbance that emphasizes the pre-, peri-, and <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods,</b> when a child’s development is critical and the opportunity for behavioral and environmental modification is high.

Early childhood caries (ECC) is a serious public health problem in disadvantaged communities in both developing and industrialized countries in which under-nutrition is common.

Throughout life physiological systems strive to maintain homeostasis and these systems are susceptible to exposure to maternal or environmental perturbations, particularly during embryonic development. In some cases, these perturbations may influence genetic and physiological processes that permanently alter the functioning of these physiological systems; a process known as developmental programming. In recent years, the neuroimmune system has garnered attention for its fundamental interactions with key hormonal systems, such as the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. The ultimate product of this axis, the glucocorticoid hormones, {{play a key role in}} modulating immune responses within the periphery and the CNS as part of the physiological stress response. It is well-established that elevated glucocorticoids induced by developmental stress exert profound short and long-term physiological effects, yet there is relatively little information of how these effects are manifested within the neuroimmune system. Pre and <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods</b> are prime candidates for manipulation in order to uncover the physiological mechanisms that underlie glucocorticoid programming of neuroimmune responses. Understanding the potential programming role of glucocorticoids may be key in uncovering vulnerable windows of CNS susceptibility to stressful experiences during embryonic development and improve our use of glucocorticoids as therapeutics in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, we investigated {{the effects of}} pre- and post-natal melatonin treatment on behavioral and cognitive abnormalities and on several neuromorphological alterations (hypocellularity, neurogenesis impairment and increased oxidative stress) that appear during the early developmental stages in TS mice. Pregnant TS females were orally treated with melatonin or vehicle {{from the time of}} conception until the weaning of the offspring, and the pups continued to receive the treatment from weaning until the age of 5 months. Melatonin administered during the pre- and <b>post-natal</b> <b>periods</b> did not improve the cognitive impairment of TS mice as measured by the Morris Water maze or fear conditioning tests. Histological alterations, such as decreased proliferation (Ki 67 + cells) and hippocampal hypocellularity (DAPI+ cells), which are typical in TS mice, were not prevented by melatonin. However, melatonin partially regulated brain oxidative stress by modulating the activity of the primary antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase in the cortex and catalase in the cortex and hippocampus) and slightly decreasing the levels of lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus of TS mice. These results show the inability of melatonin to prevent cognitive impairment in TS mice when it is administered at pre- and post-natal stages. Additionally, our findings suggest that to induce pro-cognitive effects in TS mice during the early stages of development, in addition to attenuating oxidative stress, therapies should aim to improve other altered processes, such as hippocampal neurogenesis and/or hypocellularity...|$|R

The objective of our study was to find out whether there was any significant statistical association between maternal height and the birth weight of the neonate. We identified a group of low birth weight neonates (n= 54) and a control group (n= 51) of normal weight neonates at term in Mediciti Hospital over a period of 1 year and retrospectively looked the maternal heights for both groups.
