40|$|The {{effect of}} 6, 9 -deepoxy- 6, 9 -(phenylimino) -delta 6, 8 -prostaglandin I 1 (<b>Piriprost)</b> on the {{oxidative}} response was studied in human neutrophils stimulated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), phorbol 12 -myristate, 13 -acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan. <b>Piriprost</b> inhibited the stimulatory effect of fMLP on superoxide anion (O 2 -) generation, at concentrations {{higher than those}} which depress leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) formation. This inhibition was overcome by increasing the concentration of fMLP. Neither exogenous LTB 4 nor indomethacin were able to reverse the inhibitory effect of <b>piriprost</b> on fMLP action. In contrast, <b>piriprost</b> did not inhibit the stimulation of O 2 - production induced by PMA or zymosan. <b>Piriprost</b> behaves thus as a specific and apparently competitive antagonist of fMLP: this action {{does not seem to}} involve lipoxygenase inhibition and might be exerted {{at the level of the}} fMLP receptor or its associated mechanisms of transduction.

40|$|The leukotrienes, a {{group of}} {{oxidative}} metabolites of arachidonic acid, have potent pharmacological actions on human airways. We have investigated {{the effects of a}} leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, <b>piriprost</b> (U- 60, 257) administered by inhalation on allergen and exercise induced bronchoconstriction in 12 subjects with allergic asthma. Subjects underwent diagnostic challenges with allergen and treadmill exercise to define the strengths of the stimuli required to reduce the FEV 1 to about 25 % of baseline (PS 25). On separate study days subjects inhaled either <b>piriprost</b> 1 mg or vehicle placebo, followed 15 minutes later by the PS 25 allergen or exercise. The FEV 1 was measured at regular intervals before and after challenge up to 60 minutes. After allergen challenge in six subjects peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured for the following 20 hours. When compared with placebo, inhalation of <b>piriprost</b> had no significant protective effect on the fall in FEV 1 at any time point within 60 minutes of allergen or exercise challenge. In the four subjects with a documented late asthmatic reaction 2 - 12 hours after allergen challenge <b>piriprost</b> had no protective effect when compared with placebo. In the subjects who recorded PEF over 20 hours after allergen challenge {{there was no significant difference}} between <b>piriprost</b> and placebo. <b>Piriprost</b> was appreciably more irritant to the respiratory tract than was placebo. On the assumption that inhaled <b>piriprost</b> was bioavailable in the airways, this study casts doubt on any theory of a pivotal role for leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of acute exercise and allergen induced airway bronchoconstriction in asthma...|$|E

Both as single agents and in combination with chlorambucil, there was inhibition of glutathione 5 -transferase activity as measured with l-chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene as a substrate. A depletion in intracellular glutathione was also evident following ethacrynic acid alone or in combination with chloram bucil.

40|$|Ovalbumin (OA) {{and calcium}} {{ionophore}} A 23187 {{were used to}} induce contractions of sensitized guinea-pig tracheal and lung parenchymal preparations in the presence and absence of indomethacin. This model {{was used to examine}} the properties of a series of compounds reported to inhibit 5 -lipoxygenase or to antagonize lipoxygenase products at the receptor level. FPL 55712 and <b>piriprost</b> appeared to act as pharmacological antagonists because they rapidly reduced tracheal tone established by OA. The prolonged phase (i. e. greater than 10 min post-challenge) of airways contractions induced by OA is assumed to be lipoxygenase-dependent and was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), FPL 55712, nafazatrom and benoxaprofen, in order of potency. <b>Piriprost</b> had similar inhibitory effects on the trachea, but not on lung parenchyma. The inhibitory effects of NDGA and FPL 55712 were reduced, and those of nafazatrom increased by indomethacin. Indomethacin decreased the inhibitory effect of <b>piriprost</b> on the trachea, but facilitated inhibition by this agent on the parenchyma. A roughly similar pattern was seen on A 23187 -induced contractions, but FPL 55712 did not modify these contractions and benoxaprofen enhanced the response of the trachea. BW 755 C enhanced the overall contractile response of OA- and A 23187 -induced tracheal contractions (but not parenchymal contractions) in a bell-shaped manner, an effect not seen in the presence of indomethacin. This indicated that BW 755 C could be acting as a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor. The results suggested that, although inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway were partially effective in inhibiting the contractions of the airways induced by OA or A 23187, other mediators in addition to those of the lipoxygenase pathway contribute to these contractions.

40|$|THE cytokines interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) {{enhanced}} the extracellular release of arachidonate metabolites from ionophore-stimulated neutrophils by 145 + 10 % (mean + S. E. M., n 13) and 182 + 11 % (n 16), respectively. To determine whether enhanced leukotriene production mediates {{the effects of}} these cytokines on neutrophil activity, two different specific arachidonate 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) inhibitors, <b>piriprost</b> and MK- 886, were used to inhibit leukotriene synthesis. Neither inhibitor affected the upregulation of CD 11 b-integrin expression or priming of superoxide generation stimulated by IL- 8 and GM-CSF. It is concluded that leukotrienes do not mediate either the direct or priming effects of these cytokines and that these classes of anti-inflammatory drugs are therefore unlikely to inhibit the effects of IL- 8 and GM-CSF on neutrophil activation.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of arachidonic acid (AA) to stimulate granule exocytosis from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) was investigated. AA induced the selected extracellular release of azurophil (myeloperoxidase, lysozyme) and specific (lysozyme, vitamin B 12 binding protein) granule constituents from human PMNs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Cytochalasin B (CB) enhanced {{but was not}} required for PMN activation with AA. Although extracellular calcium {{had no effect on}} granule exocytosis, AA did stimulate the mobilization of intracellular sequestered Ca 2 + which resulted in an increase in cytosolic-free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) as reflected by increased fluorescence of Fura- 2 -treated cells. AA stimulated Ca 2 +/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PK-C) activity in PMNs. 4, 4 '-Diisothiocyano- 2, 2 '-disulphonic acid stilbene (DIDS), an anion channel blocker, caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of granule enzyme release. Activation of PMNs with AA was unaffected by the lipoxygenase/cycle-oxygenase inhibitors, 5, 8, 11, 14 -eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) and benoxaprofen, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, 6, 9, deepoxy- 6, 9 -(phenylimino) delta 6, 8 -prostaglandin 1 (1) (<b>piriprost</b> potassium) or a pure cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of toxic}} shock syndrome (TSS) remains unknown. On {{the basis of}} experimental data, it has been hypothesized that staphylococcal TSS Toxin 1 (TSST- 1) may interact synergistically {{with low levels of}} endotoxin and give rise to many of the clinical findings. We have demonstrated previously that lipid A, the biologically active component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, induces dose-dependent necrosis of isolated rat renal tubular cells (RTCs). In the present studies, the authors investigated whether this injury could be augmented by TSST- 1. The viability of RTCs was assessed by vital dye exclusion. Incubation of freshly isolated rat RTCs with either 1 ng/ml of TSST- 1 or 0. 1 ng/ml LPS or lipid A had minimal cytotoxicity (less than 6 %). Exposure of RTCs to 1 ng/ml TSST- 1 for 20 minutes, followed by washing, resulted in a significant enhancement of cytotoxicity when RTCs were exposed to 0. 1 ng/ml LPS or lipid A. The sensitization of RTCs by TSST- 1 to LPS- or lipid-A-induced injury was prevented by methylamine and chloroquine, two inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). Chelation of extracellular calcium by 2 mM EGTA also blocked the TSST- 1 -induced sensitization of RTCs to LPS or lipid A. Inhibition of RTC arachidonic acid metabolism by methylprednisolone, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and <b>piriprost</b> significantly inhibited RTC necrosis induced by TSST- 1 and LPS or lipid A by 33 - 62 %. Thiourea and deferoxamine, agents which ameliorate oxidant injury, also inhibited this synergistic injury by 34 - 67 %. Thus, TSST- 1 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of LPS/lipid A, and the sensitization of RTCs appeared to involve RME or TSST- 1. Oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid and generation of reactive oxygen species appeared to participate in LPS/lipid-A-mediated RTC death...|$|E
