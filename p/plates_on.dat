40|$|Autocrine and paracrine {{mechanisms}} modulate {{the synthesis}} and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM); moreover, each {{component of the}} ECM is capable of modulating the synthesis and release of other ECM molecules. Therefore, the synthesis of ECM glycoprotein fibronectin and laminin was studied in the human breast cancer cell lines MCF 7 and MDA MB 23, <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> different ECM. Our {{results showed that the}} cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> a fibronectin substrate increased laminin synthesis: this event correlated with an increase in alpha 2 and alpha 3 integrin subunits. Staurosporine-induced apoptosis was then analyzed in the cell lines <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> different ECM. Staurosporine treatment determined the apoptosis of 35 and 33 % respectively of MDA MB 231 and MCF 7; these values increased to 60 and 64 % in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> laminin, to 48 and 63 % in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> fibronectin and to 64 and 69 % in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> matrigel. Moreover, staurosporine treatment decreased bcl- 2 expression in the cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> fibronectin and laminin. Yet, staurosporine treatment determined PARP cleavage and PARP partial disappearance when the cells were <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> matrigel. Finally, a partial loss of function mutant Ras protein that activated only Raf pathway, was expressed in MCF 7, in order to identify whether the increase of apoptosis induced by extracellular matrix involved the Raf/MAP kinase pathway. The increase of apoptosis of the cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> matrigel suggested that the activation of the Raf pathway is probably involved in the decrease of survival on matrigel. These data demonstrate that the modification of ECM modulates the apoptotic process of breast cancer cells and suggest that it is worthwhile to dissect the role of ECM in the control of apoptotic process...|$|R

5|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or lamellar <b>plates)</b> <b>on</b> their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to reduce the weight of the head. The short, tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths are the culmination of this process.|$|E

5|$|When the Radstock branch was constructed, it was {{intended}} to link it to the main line of the Paulton branch at Midford, which was at a lower level at this point. The Lock Fund created in 1802 was to have paid for the construction of the locks, but because there was little regular traffic on the branch, the company built one lock, an aqueduct over the Midford Brook, and a short tramway to bridge the gap. This contributed to the economic failure of the branch, and its replacement by a tramway in 1815. The tramway was laid along the former canal's towpath. It was single-line with passing places every , and was originally laid using cast iron <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> stone block sleepers, but was relaid using wrought iron plates.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} the Canucks' loss, Daniel was in {{attendance}} for the NHL Awards show in Las Vegas, having been nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player, the Ted Lindsay Award as the NHL's most outstanding player and the NHL Foundation Player Award for his and Henrik's work in the Vancouver community. Daniel won the Lindsay Award over forwards Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks. In Hart Trophy voting, he finished as the first runner-up to Perry with 51 first-place ballots and 960 voting points total (16 and 83 fewer than Perry, respectively). Daniel and Henrik also lost the NHL Foundation Award to Los Angeles Kings captain Dustin Brown. After being named to the NHL's Second All-Star Team the previous year, Daniel received First Team honours with Henrik for the 2010–11 season. Returning to Sweden in the off-season, Daniel and Henrik were co-recipients of the Victoria Scholarship, as the country's athletes of the year.

5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E

5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> its hips.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> the neck), {{but these}} are only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} temnospondyls have large bony <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> their backs. One temnospondyl, Peltobatrachus, has armour-like plating that covers both its back and underside. The temnospondyl Laidleria also has {{extensive}} plating on its back. Most {{members of the}} family Dissorophidae also have armor, although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates. Other temnospondyls, such as Eryops, have been found with small, disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin. All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus. The scutes may have provided stability for the spine, as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments. Temnospondyls, such as Sclerothorax and Eryops, that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine. Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs, but unlike Peltobatrachus, Laidleria, Eryops, and dissorophids, these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic. Plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor, as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group.|$|E
