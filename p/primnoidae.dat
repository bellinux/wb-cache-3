40|$|Sequence {{data were}} {{obtained}} for five different loci, both mitochondrial (cox 1, mtMutS, 16 S) and nuclear (18 S, 28 S rDNA), from 64 species representing 25 genera of the common deep-sea octocoral family <b>Primnoidae.</b> We tested the hypothesis that <b>Primnoidae</b> have an Antarctic origin, as {{this is where they}} currently have high species richness, using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods of phylogenetic analysis. Using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny we also investigated the time of species radiation in sub-Antarctic <b>Primnoidae.</b> Our relatively wide taxon sampling and phylogenetic analysis supported <b>Primnoidae</b> as a monophyletic family. The base of the well-supported phylogeny was Pacific in origin, indicating <b>Primnoidae</b> sub-Antarctic diversity is a secondary species radiation. There is also evidence for a subsequent range extension of sub-Antarctic lineages into deep-water areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Conservative and speculative fossil-calibration analyses resulted in two differing estimations of sub-Antarctic species divergence times. Conservative analysis suggested a sub-Antarctic species radiation occurred ∼ 52 MYA (95 % HPD: 36 – 73 MYA), potentially before the opening of the Drake Passage and Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) formation (41 – 37 MYA). Speculative analysis pushed this radiation back into the late Jurassic, 157 MYA (95 % HPD: 118 – 204 MYA). Genus-level groupings were broadly supported in this analysis with some notable polyphyletic exceptions: Callogorgia, Fanellia, Primnoella, Plumarella, Thouarella. Molecular and morphological evidence supports the placement of Tauroprim...|$|E

We define habitat-forming deep-sea corals {{as those}} {{families}} of octocorals, hexacorals, and stylasterids with species that live deeper than 200 m, {{with a majority}} of species exhibiting complex branching morphology and a sufficient size to provide substrata or refugia to associated species. We present 2, 649 records (name, geoposition, depth, and data quality) from eleven institutions on eight habitat-forming deep-sea coral families, including octocorals in the families Coralliidae, Isididae, Paragorgiidae and <b>Primnoidae,</b> hexacorals in the families Antipathidae, Oculinidae and Caryophylliidae, and stylasterids in the family Stylasteridae. The data are ranked according to record quality.

40|$|Octocorals {{are being}} {{included}} in {{a great variety of}} worldwide studies with the aim of analyzing taxonomy, ecology, biogeography, genetics and geochemistry, among other aspects. The study described here includes samples collected during the ‘Macrofauna’ explorations carried out by the Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras (Invemar) between 1998 and 2002 from shallow (20 m) to deep (500 m) waters. A total of 280 museum containers were examined. Samples were collected at 32 stations distributed along the continental shelf and upper slope of Colombian Caribbean. A total of 44 species have been recognized, 21 of them identified to species level and 23 to genus level; the species are included in 22 genera and nine families (Plexauridae, Gorgoniidae, Ellisellidae, <b>Primnoidae,</b> Anthothelidae,Clavulariidae, Keroeididae, Acanthogorgiidae, Chrysogorgiidae).

40|$|Abstract. The {{conservation}} of deep-sea corals is of {{growing interest in}} the United States. A range of issues including biodiversity protection, {{conservation of}} seafloor habitats, {{and the role of}} deep-sea corals as essential fish habitat places greater significance on understanding the distributions of these corals and fishing activities. At the same time overfishing of some groundfish populations highlights the need for ecosystem-based management. Here we present records of habitat-forming deep-sea corals from the United States Pacific Fishery Management Council region that we analyze in relation to differential ecological impacts of demersal fishing gears. We use an ecological footprint approach combining groundfish catch by gear type with a previously published ecological severity ranking of fishing gears. Deep-sea corals in the Isididae, Paragorgiidae, <b>Primnoidae,</b> Antipathidae and Stylasteriidae families are widespread throughout their depth ranges in the Northeast Pacific, although the scleractinian families Oculinidae and Caryophylliidae are relatively rare. In this qualitative analysis, we highlight areas of relatively high coral concentration such as the West Coast continental shelf break and Montere...|$|E
40|$|Two cold-water coral taxa, Octocorallia in {{the class}} Anthozoa and Stylasteridae {{in the class}} Hydrozoa, were identified. Deep-water samples were {{collected}} in fishing nets at depths ranging between 20 and 200 m along the coasts of the East Sea in Korea from 1976 to 1993. The two species {{found in this study}} represent new records for Korea: Paragorgia arborea (Linnaeus, 1758) in the class Anthozoa, and Stylaster profundiporus Broch, 1936 in the class Hydrozoa. Two families, Paragorgiidae and Stylasteridae, are also newly recorded in Korea. Furthermore, the species name of another cold-water gorgonian species, Primnoa pacifica (Kinoshita, 1907) in the family <b>Primnoidae,</b> is amended in this report. The two newly recorded cold-water coral species from Korea are described in detail based on their morphological characteristics. Paragorgia arborea is characterized by its growth form, medulla and cortex, zooid dimorphism, canal system, and spicule composition. Stylaster profundiporus is distinguished by its external skeletal characteristics, such as the coordination of dactylopores and gastropores, presence or absence of gastrostyles and dactylostyles, cyclosystem orientation, ampullar position, gastropore tube shape, and coenosteal texture...|$|E
40|$|The diversity, ubiquity and {{prevalence}} in deep {{waters of}} the octocoral family Chrysogorgiidae Verrill, 1883 make it noteworthy as a model system to study radiation and diversification in the deep sea. Here we provide the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the Chrysogorgiidae, and compare phylogeny and depth distribution. Phylogenetic relationships among 10 of 14 currently-described Chrysogorgiidae genera were inferred based on mitochondrial (mtMutS, cox 1) and nuclear (18 S) markers. Bathymetric distribution was estimated from multiple sources, including museum records, a literature review, and our own sampling records (985 stations, 2345 specimens). Genetic analyses suggest that the Chrysogorgiidae as currently described is a polyphyletic family. Shallow-water genera, and two of eight deep-water genera, appear {{more closely related to}} other octocoral families than to the remainder of the monophyletic, deep-water chrysogorgiid genera. Monophyletic chrysogorgiids are composed of strictly (Iridogorgia Verrill, 1883, Metallogorgia Versluys, 1902, Radicipes Stearns, 1883, Pseudochrysogorgia Pante & France, 2010) and predominantly (Chrysogorgia Duchassaing & Michelotti, 1864) deep-sea genera that diversified in situ. This group is sister to gold corals (<b>Primnoidae</b> Milne Edwards, 1857) and deep-sea bamboo corals (Keratoisidinae Gray, 1870), whose diversity also peaks in the deep sea. Nine species of Chrysogorgia that were described from depths shallower than 200 m, and mtMutS haplotypes sequenced from specimens sampled as shallow as 101 m, suggest a shallow-water emergence of some Chrysogorgia species...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} countered the {{paradigm}} of seamount isolation, confounding conservation efforts at a critical time. Efforts to study deep-sea corals, one of the dominant taxa on seamounts, to understand seamount connectivity, are hampered {{by a lack of}} taxonomic keys. A prerequisite for connectivity is species overlap. Attempts to better understand species overlap using DNA barcoding methods suggest coral species are widely distributed on seamounts and nearby features. However, no baseline has been established for variation in these genetic markers relative to morphological species designations for deep-sea octocoral families. Here we assess levels of genetic variation in potential octocoral mitochondrial barcode markers relative to thoroughly examined morphological species in the genus Narella. The combination of six markers used here, approximately 3350 bp of the mitochondrial genome, resolved 83 % of the morphological species. Our results show that two of the markers, ND 2 and NCR 1, are not sufficient to resolve genera within <b>Primnoidae,</b> let alone species. Re-evaluation of previous studies of seamount octocorals based on these results suggest that those studies were looking at distributions at a level higher than species, possibly even genus or subfamily. Results for Narella show that using more markers provides haplotypes with relatively narrow depth ranges on the seamounts studied. Given the lack of 100 % resolution of species with such {{a large portion of the}} mitochondrial genome, we argue that previous genetic studies have not resolved the degree of species overlap on seamounts and that we may not have the power to even test the hypothesi...|$|E
40|$|Deep-sea gorgonian octocorals of the {{families}} <b>Primnoidae</b> and Isididae exhibit centennial-scale lifespans and in some species annually-secreted growth rings, which potentially provide high-resolution long term paleoceanographic records. We examined trace element and stable carbon (d 13 C) and oxygen (d 18 O) isotope variability in a live-collected 140 year old specimen of Keratoisis ornata (Isididae) from the southern Grand Banks of Newfoundland (700 m water depth) and in a late Holocene K. ornata form the Hudson Strait dated at ~ 1. 1 ka BP (~ 200 yr life-span). Skeletal chronology was previously established {{through a combination of}} AMS- 14 C, 210 Pb and bomb- 14 C dating and revealed a growth rate of 76 µm/yr. Hydrographic records from the Southern Grand Bank extend back to the early 20 th century, overlapping with the coral record almost continuously over a period of 96 years. Focusing on the skeletal calcite fraction, trace elements were measured along parallel radii of axial sections using laser ablation ICP-MS, while d 13 C and d 18 O were measured on micromilled samples acquired at a spatial resolution of 100 µm. Trace elements and stable isotopes turned out to be strongly linked to microstructure, with strong differences between the juvenile and the adult skeletal portions. Isotopic values were relatively depleted in juvenile calcite bands, while trace elements were strongly enriched in Li, Mg and B. Only the heaviest d 18 O-values from the adult phase are in equilibrium with seawater d 18 O-composition and temperature, inhibiting the extraction of temperature time-series from ontogenetic transects. Bulk adult Mg/Ca-values at 4 °C fit the temperature calibration for P. resedaeformis by Sherwood et al. (2005), {{as well as with the}} calibration for Lepidisis sp. by Thresher et al. (2010). Long-term temperature series are at present difficult to extract, because Mg/Ca show a similar systematic ontogenetic decrease in the Recent and the late Holocene K. ornata specimens. This leads to a reconstruction of an apparent 1 °C drop across the last 96 years, which is opposite to the measured 1 °C rise. Overall, our results demonstrate that further development is required to interpret geochemical patterns in gorgonian calcites as reliable environmental proxies...|$|E
40|$|Zoantharians are a {{group of}} cnidarians that are often found in {{association}} with marine invertebrates, including corals, in shallow and deep-sea environments. However, {{little is known about}} deep-sea zoantharian taxonomy, specificity and nature of their associations with their coral hosts. In this study, analyses of molecular data (mtDNA COI, 16 S, and 12 S rDNA) coupled with ecological and morphological characteristics were used to examine zoantharian specimens associated with cold-water corals (CWC) at depths between 110 and 800 m from seamounts and island slopes in the Azores region. The zoantharians examined were found living in association with stylasterids, antipatharians and octocorals. From the collected specimens, four new species were identified: (1) Epizoanthus martinsae sp. n. associated with the antipatharian Leiopathes sp.; (2) Parazoanthus aliceae sp. n. associated with the stylasterid Errina dabneyi (Pourtalès, 1871); (3) Zibrowius alberti sp. n. associated with octocorals of the family <b>Primnoidae</b> [Paracalyptrophora josephinae (Lindström, 1877) ] and the family Plexauridae (Dentomuricea aff. meteor Grasshoff, 1977); (4) Hurlizoanthus hirondelleae sp. n. associated with the primnoid octocoral Candidella imbricata (Johnson, 1862). In addition, based on newly collected material, morphological and molecular data and phylogenic reconstruction, the zoantharian Isozoanthus primnoidus Carreiro-Silva, Braga-Henriques, Sampaio, de Matos, Porteiro & Ocaña, 2011, associated with the primnoid octocoral Callogorgia verticillata (Pallas, 1766), was reclassified as Zibrowius primnoidus comb. nov. The zoantharians, Z. primnoidus comb. nov., Z. alberti sp. n., and H. hirondelleae sp. n. associated with octocorals showed evidence of a parasitic relationship, where the zoantharian progressively eliminates gorgonian tissue and uses the gorgonian axis for structure and support, and coral sclerites for protection. In contrast, the zoantharian P. aliceae sp. n. associated with the stylasterid E. dabneyi and the zoantharian E. martinsae sp. n. associated with the antipatharian Leiopathes sp., appear to use the coral host only as support with no visible damage to the host. The monophyly of octocoral-associated zoantharians suggests that substrate specificity is tightly linked to the evolution of zoantharians.
