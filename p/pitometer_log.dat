5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's <b>Pitometer</b> <b>log</b> (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

50|$|Pitometer logs (also {{known as}} pit logs) are devices {{used to measure}} a ship's speed {{relative}} to the water. They are used on both surface ships and submarines. Data from the <b>pitometer</b> <b>log</b> is usually fed directly into the ship's navigation system.|$|E
50|$|The pit sword (also {{known as}} a rodmeter) is a blade of metal or plastic that extends into the water beneath the hull of a {{nautical}} vessel. It {{is part of the}} <b>pitometer</b> <b>log,</b> a device for measuring the ship's speed through the water.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{technology}} of the <b>pitometer</b> <b>log</b> {{is similar to that}} of the pitot tube on an aircraft. Typically, the pitometer has a long tube that penetrates the ship's hull near the keel. The part of the pitometer protruding from the ship is sometimes called a pit sword or rodmeter. This tube usually has two openings: one facing the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the dynamic pressure of the seawater and one at 90Â° to the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the static seawater pressure. The dynamic pressure of the seawater is a function of the depth of the water and the speed of the vessel.|$|E
50|$|Essentially an {{electromechanical}} analog computer, the Mark 1 was electrically {{linked to}} the gun mounts and the Mark 37 gun director, the latter mounted as high on the superstructure as possible to afford maximum visual and radar range. The gun director was equipped with both optical and radar range finding, {{and was able to}} rotate on a small barbette-like structure. Using the range finders, the director was able to produce a continuously varying set of outputs, referred to as line-of-sight (LOS) data, that were electrically relayed to the Mark 1 via synchro motors. The LOS data provided the target's present range, bearing, {{and in the case of}} aerial targets, altitude. Additional inputs to the Mark 1 were continuously generated from the stable element, a gyroscopic device that reacted to the roll and pitch of the ship, the <b>pitometer</b> <b>log,</b> which measured the ship's speed through the water, and an anemometer, which provided wind speed and direction.|$|E
