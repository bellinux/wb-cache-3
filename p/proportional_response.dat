As described by Shackleton (2000), the deep-sea sediment record of [...] "is {{dominated by a}} 100,000-year cyclicity that is universally interpreted as the main ice-age rhythm". Shackleton (2000) adjusted the time scale of the Vostok ice core [...] record to fit the assumed orbital forcing and used spectral analysis to identify and subtract the component of the record that in this interpretation {{could be attributed to}} a linear (directly <b>proportional)</b> <b>response</b> to the orbital forcing. The residual signal (the remainder), when compared with the residual from a similarly retuned marine core isotope record, was used to estimate the proportion of the signal that was attributable to ice volume, with the rest (having attempted to allow for the Dole effect) being attributed to temperature changes in the deep water.|$|E

This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.|$|R

2500|$|To this end, {{companies}} {{make use of}} platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram [...] to reach audiences much wider than {{through the use of}} traditional print/TV/radio advertisements alone {{at a fraction of the}} cost, as most social networking sites can be used at little or no cost (however, some websites charge companies for premium services). This has changed the ways that companies approach to interact with customers, as a substantial percentage of consumer interactions are now being carried out over online platforms with much higher visibility. Customers can now post reviews of products and services, rate customer service, and ask questions or voice concerns directly to companies through social media platforms. Thus social media marketing is also used by businesses in order to build relationships of trust with consumers. To this aim, companies may also hire personnel to specifically handle these social media interactions, who usually report under the title of Online community managers. Handling these interactions in a satisfactory manner can result in an increase of consumer trust. To both this aim and to fix the public's perception of a company, 3 steps are taken in order to address consumer concerns, identifying the extent of the social chatter, engaging the influencers to help, and developing a <b>proportional</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E

40|$|A box {{model is}} {{presented}} to simulate changes in Mediterranean long-term average salinity and d 18 O over the past 20, 000 years. Simulations are validated by comparison with observations. Sensitivity tests illustrate robustness {{with respect to the}} main assumptions and uncertainties. The results show that relative humidity over the Mediterranean remained relatively constant around 70 %, apparently narrowly constrained to {{the lower end of the}} range observed globally over sea surfaces by the basin's land-locked character. Isotopic depletion in run off, relative to the present, is identified as the main potential cause of depletions in the Mediterranean d 18 O record. Also, slight increases in relative humidity (of the order of 5 %) might have caused very pronounced isotopic depletions, such as that in sapropel S 5 of the penultimate interglacial maximum. The model shows distinctly non <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> of d 18 O and salinity to environmental change, which argues against the use of isotope residuals in Mediterranean paleosalinity reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} circadian {{clock is}} a cell-autonomous system that drives oscillations in behavior and physiology {{in anticipation of}} daily environmental change. To assess the robustness of a human molecular clock, we systematically depleted known clock components and observed that circadian oscillations are maintained {{over a wide range}} of disruptions. We developed a novel strategy termed Gene Dosage Network Analysis (GDNA) in which small interfering RNA (siRNA) -induced dose-dependent changes in gene expression were used to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints. The use of multiple doses powered the analysis to uncover several novel network features of the circadian clock, including <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> and signal propagation through interacting genetic modules. We also observed several examples where a gene is up-regulated following knockdown of its paralog, suggesting the clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function.

40|$|Nongenotoxic {{carcinogens}} are {{chemicals that}} induce neoplasia without it or its metabolites reacting directly with DNA. Chemicals classified as nongenotoxic carcinogens have been assumed {{to act as}} tumor promoters and exhibit threshold tumor dose-responses. This {{is in contrast to}} genotoxic carcinogens that are DNA reactive, act as tumor initiators, and are assumed to exhibit <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> at low doses. In this perspective, we examine the basic tenets and utility of this classification for evaluating human cancer risk. Two classes of so-called nongenotoxic chemical carcinogens selected for review include cytotoxic agents that induce regenerative hyperplasia (trihalomethanes and inducers of a 2 -microglobulin nephropathy) and agents that act via receptor-mediated mechanisms (peroxisome proliferators and dioxin). Major conclusions of this review include: a) many chemicals considered to be nongenotoxic carcinogens actually possess certain genotoxic activities, and limiting evaluations of carcinogenicity to their nongenotoxic effects can be misleading; b) some nongenotoxic activities may cause oxidative DNA damage and thereby initiate carcinogenesis; c) although cell replication is involved in tumor development, cytotoxicity and mitogenesis do not reliably predict carcinogenesis; d) a threshold tumor response is not an inevitable result of a receptor-mediated mechanism.

40|$|Our {{research}} {{reveals that}} introductory college statistics students experience considerable difficulty applying their classroom knowledge when assessing empirical sampling distributions. In a task-based survey, {{students were asked}} to judge the likelihood of four empirical sampling distributions (presented to them in graphical form), from a known skewed population. Two graphs were obtained through simulation and two were created to be unreasonable representations of the sampling situation. Students struggled to identify the reasonable graphs in this sampling situation, and seventy-five percent made two or fewer correct identifications, performing no better than one would by guessing. Student responses are described with reference to a five-tiered framework for statistical reasoning: idiosyncratic (0), additive (1), transitional (2), proportional (3), and distributional (4). This model, which describes types of student reasoning, emerged from the work of Shaughnessy, Ciancetta, and Canada (2004), and Shaughnessy, Ciancetta, Best, and Noll (2005). Briefly, additive responses rely on frequencies and individual data points, transitional responses tend to focus on one particular aspect of the distribution such as shape, <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> are primarily focused on the population proportion, and distributional responses use multiple aspects of the distribution, such as center and spread.

5000|$|Finally, {{the idea}} of enforcing, or {{carrying}} out a duty of gratitude, as well as calibrating the extent one’s gratitude, seems inconsistent with the warm and benevolent feelings of “being grateful.” There is a similar inconsistency in {{the idea of}} enforcing a duty to love. Reciprocity, by contrast, because it does not necessarily involve having special feelings of love or benevolence, fits more comfortably into discussions of duties and obligations. Further, its requirement of an in-kind response invites us to calibrate both the quality and the quantity of the response. [...] The norm of reciprocity thus requires that we make fitting and <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> to both the benefits and harms we receive - whether they come from people who have been benevolent or malicious. Working out the conceptual details of this idea presents interesting questions of its own.

40|$|Eph {{receptor}} signaling plays {{key roles}} in vertebrate tissue boundary formation, axonal pathfinding, and stem cell regeneration by steering cells to positions defined by its ligand ephrin. Some {{of the key}} events in Eph-ephrin signaling are understood: ephrin binding triggers the clustering of the Eph receptor, fostering transphosphorylation and signal transduction into the cell. However, a quantitative and mechanistic {{understanding of how the}} signal is processed by the recipient cell into precise and <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> is largely lacking. Studying Eph activation kinetics requires spatiotemporal data on the number and distribution of receptor oligomers, which is beyond the quantitative power offered by prevalent imaging methods. Here we describe an enhanced fluorescence fluctuation imaging analysis, which employs statistical resampling to measure the Eph receptor aggregation distribution within each pixel of an image. By performing this analysis over time courses extending tens of minutes, the information-rich 4 D space (x, y, oligomerization, time) results were coupled to straightforward biophysical models of protein aggregation. This analysis reveals that Eph clustering {{can be explained by the}} combined contribution of polymerization of receptors into clusters, followed by their condensation into far larger aggregates. The modeling reveals that these two competing oligomerization mechanisms play distinct roles: polymerization mediates the activation of the receptor by assembling monomers into 6 - to 8 -mer oligomers; condensation of the preassembled oligomers into large clusters containing hundreds of monomers dampens the signaling. We propose that the polymerization–condensation dynamics creates mechanistic explanation for how cells properly respond to variable ligand concentrations and gradients...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 101 - 103) A certain phenomena exists {{which enables}} some {{men and women}} to bring into their retirement years a continuing zest for life. Norman Garmezy would call these people invulnerable, Abraham Maslow would find them to be self-actualized, Goethe would say they have a strong entelechy. But neither spokesman would be able to explain the underlying source of the basic strength exhibited in such joie de vivre. The intent of this exploratory study was to provide insight into the source of such strength through two means: first, by a content analysis of journal and newspaper articles written about extraordinarily resilient elderly people; secondly, through an analysis of the findings of a questionnaire developed {{for the purpose of this}} study and completed by 39 elderly men and women who exhibited a continuum of activity from highly active through moderately active to relatively least active. The findings of the study, though not vertified by statistical tests, appear to provide some support for one of the expectations of the study: that there are specific and unique personality traits found in the most active of the subjects. The active subjects appeared to be more involved in a greater variety of activities, remained more oriented toward the future and were able to tell more about themselves than the less active subjects. In contrast, the least active of the subjects seemed more characterized by negative traits such as stubbornness, anxiety, and the tendency to "give up easily". Further, there is evidence that the most active showed continuing movement toward self-actualization. There also is evidence suggesting that the characteristics of invulnerability are present within the most active. These findings are suggested on the basis of the <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> of the three groups.

40|$|The cold {{deserts of}} the Colorado Plateau contain {{numerous}} geologically and geochemically distinct sedimentary bedrock types. In the area near Canyonlands National Park in Southeastern Utah, geochemical variation in geologic substrates {{is related to}} the depositional environment with higher concentrations of Fe, Al, P, K, and Mg in sediments deposited in alluvial or marine environments and lower concentrations in bedrock derived from eolian sand dunes. Availability of soil nutrients to vegetation is also controlled by the formation of secondary minerals, particularly for P and Ca availability, which, in some geologic settings, appears closely related to variation of CaCO 3 and Ca-phosphates in soils. However, {{the results of this study}} also indicate that P content is related to bedrock and soil Fe and Al content suggesting that the deposition history of the bedrock and the presence of P-bearing Fe and Al minerals, is important to contemporary P cycling in this region. The relation between bedrock type and exchangeable Mg and K is less clear-cut, despite large variation in bedrock concentrations of these elements. We examined soil nutrient concentrations and foliar nutrient concentration of grasses, shrubs, conifers, and forbs in four geochemically distinct field sites. All four of the functional plant groups had similar <b>proportional</b> <b>responses</b> to variation in soil nutrient availability despite large absolute differences in foliar nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry across species. Foliar P concentration (normalized to N) in particular showed relatively small variation across different geochemical settings despite large variation in soil P availability in these study sites.
