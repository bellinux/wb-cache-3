Neglecting hydrodynamic interactions, we study the formation of compact polymer structures called globules.

5000|$|This {{transition}} {{is associated with}} the transition of a polymer chain from good solvent behavior through ideal or Theta solvent behavior to <b>poor</b> <b>solvent</b> behavior. The canonical coil-globule {{transition is}} associated with the Upper critical solution temperature and the associated Flory theta point. In this case, collapse occurs with cooling and results from favorable attractive energy of the polymer to itself. A second type of coil-globule transition is instead associated with the lower critical solution temperature and its corresponding theta point. This collapse occurs with increasing temperature and is driven by an unfavorable entropy of mixing. [...] An example of this type is embodied by the polymer PNIPAAM, mentioned above. Coil globule transitions may also be driven by charge effects, in the case of polyelectrolytes. In this case pH and ionic strength changes within the solution may trigger collapse, with increasing counterion concentration generally leading to collapse in a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte.

Below the adsorption transition, the reverse effect is observed. The radius of gyration components as well as conformational (free) energies and entropies {{as a function of}} the chain centre of mass (CM) position along the pore axis reveal strong anomalies in the vicinity of the pore entrance. Below the adsorption transition, the dense globule in a <b>poor</b> <b>solvent</b> swells and deforms when penetrating the pore and recollapses once it is fully confined.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>poor</b> <b>solvent</b> quality on fluid demixing {{of a model}} mixture of colloids and nonadsorbing polymers is investigated using density functional theory. The colloidal particles are modelled as hard spheres and the polymer coils as effective interpenetrating spheres that have hard interactions with the colloids. The solvent is modelled as a two-component mixture of a primary solvent, regarded as a background theta-solvent for the polymer, and a cosolvent of point particles that are excluded from both colloids and polymers. Cosolvent exclusion favors overlap of polymers, mimicking {{the effect of a}} <b>poor</b> <b>solvent</b> by inducing an effective attraction between polymers. For this model, a geometry-based density functional theory is derived and applied to bulk fluid phase behavior. With increasing cosolvent concentration (worsening solvent quality), the predicted colloid-polymer binodal shifts to lower colloid concentrations, promoting demixing. For sufficiently <b>poor</b> <b>solvent,</b> a reentrant demixing transition is predicted at low colloid concentrations. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|We discuss polymer {{adsorption}} in a <b>poor</b> <b>solvent.</b> For {{a single}} chain {{we find a}} wetting transition on an attractive wall when the thermal correlation lenght ξ is {{of the order of}} the adsorption lenght D.

The adsorption of a polymer solution in a <b>poor</b> <b>solvent</b> is considered only when the chains wet the surface.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the kinetics of loop formation in flexible ideal polymer chains (Rouse model), and polymers in good and <b>poor</b> <b>solvents.</b> We {{show for the}} Rouse model, using a modification {{of the theory of}} Szabo, Schulten, and Schulten, that the time scale for cyclization is τ_c∼τ_ 0 N^ 2 (where τ_ 0 is a microscopic time scale and N is the number of monomers), provided the coupling between the relaxation dynamics of the end-to-end vector and the looping dynamics is taken into account. The resulting analytic expression fits the simulation results accurately when a, the capture radius for contact formation, exceeds b, the average distance between two connected beads. Simulations also show that, when a < b, τ_c∼ N^α_τ, where 1. 5 <α_τ< 2 in the range 7 <N< 200 used in the simulations. By using a diffusion coefficient that is dependent on the length scales a and b (with a<b), which captures the two-stage mechanism by which looping occurs when a < b, we obtain an analytic expression for τ_c that fits the simulation results well. The kinetics of contact formation between the ends of the chain are profoundly affected when interactions between monomers are taken into account. Remarkably, for N < 100 the values of τ_c decrease by more than two orders of magnitude when the solvent quality changes from good to poor. Fits of the simulation data for τ_c to a power law in N (τ_c∼ N^α_τ) show that α_τ varies from about 2. 4 in a good solvent to about 1. 0 in <b>poor</b> <b>solvents.</b> Loop formation in <b>poor</b> <b>solvents,</b> in which the polymer adopts dense, compact globular conformations, occurs by a reptation-like mechanism of the ends of the chain.
