Following the second breakup, <b>Principe</b> and Wleklinski decided to form a new band called Transistor Revolt, and recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath. <b>Principe</b> met McIlrath in Indianapolis while attending a Sick of It All concert, and recalled seeing him perform with his previous band Baxter. Impressed with McIlrath's gritty vocals, <b>Principe</b> gave him a seven track demo he had recorded, and invited him to join the nascent band.

5|$|<b>Principe</b> di Carignano {{took part}} in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866, where she led the Italian line of battle, but was not heavily engaged.

5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships to heave to. Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a yard of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer <b>Principe</b> de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. <b>Principe</b> was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard <b>Principe,</b> as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E
