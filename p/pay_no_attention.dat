25|$|A running gag {{throughout}} {{the series is}} that Namiko is extremely clumsy, and will very often fall in holes, fall out of buildings (usually out of her classroom window), or off of cliffs. While the students in her class are initially concerned about her many falls, they become jaded by how often it occurs and <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to her potentially getting injured {{later on in the}} series. Namiko remains a tough individual though and always recovers after her falls no matter how severe they may be.|$|E

25|$|In childhood, Vātsyāyana says, {{a person}} should {{learn how to}} make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass one should {{concentrate}} on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth. The Kama Sutra acknowledges that the senses can be dangerous: 'Just as a horse in full gallop, blinded by the energy of his own speed, pays no attention to any post or hole or ditch on the path, so two lovers, blinded by passion, in the friction of sexual battle, are caught up in their fierce energy and <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to danger' (2.7.33).|$|E
500|$|Each episode took {{approximately}} {{two months to}} edit, and editing usually began as the episodes were still being shot. The editors would work on two episodes simultaneously. Following {{the completion of the}} episodes, Muskett added the score for them. The episodes include split screen sequences. Although the sequences were presented in a similar vein to the American action series 24, the split screen idea did not come from the show itself; Nalluri thought of it independently after visiting a pub one night after filming wrapped up. The series also introduced the premise of not including any production credits. The producers agreed that adding credits would be a waste of time, and that the viewers would <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to them. However, they also saw this as an opportunity; as Spooks is a spy show, Wolstencroft had the idea that it would be [...] "cool" [...] to have a show that was anonymous, and it would fit the spirit of the series.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first major}} gunfight between the Rangers and Mexican bandits {{occurred}} in June 1875. McNelly's Rangers surprised {{a group of}} sixteen Mexican cattle thieves and one American man, driving about 300 head of cattle toward the Rio Grande, and also toward Juan Cortina, and a steamer headed for Cuba. They were Cortina's hand-picked men, who had boasted they could cope with any Rangers or vigilantes. Captain McNelly issued his orders. [...] "Don't shoot {{to the left or}} the right. Shoot straight ahead. And don't shoot till you've got your target good in your sights. Don't walk up on a wounded man. <b>Pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to a white flag. That's a mean trick bandits use on green-hands. Don't touch a dead man, except to identify him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Postmodern {{designers}} were in {{the beginning}} stages of what we now refer to as [...] "graphic design". They created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. They also seemed to entirely <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to traditional conventions such as legibility. Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that [...] "retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates". Yet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched {{for more and more}} ways to go against the system. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Tibor Kalman, and Jamie Reid.|$|E
2500|$|... "Although {{the power}} {{is given to the}} scholar to excommunicate a man who has slighted him, it is not praiseworthy for him to employ this means too frequently. He should rather shut his ears to the words of the ignorant and <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said, 'Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken' (Eccl. vii. 21). This was the custom of the early pious men, who would not answer when they heard {{themselves}} insulted, but would forgive the insolent[...] [...] [...] But this humility should be practised only when the insult occurs in private; when the scholar is publicly insulted, he dares not forgive; and if he forgive he should be punished, for then it is an insult to the Torah that he must revenge until the offender humbly apologizes" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, by now, Pakistan {{was moving}} in a {{different}} direction. Using the opening created by the Korean War, Pakistan was aggressively pursuing American military aid. Two days after Liaquat Ali Khan's assassination, Pakistani military delegation was in Washington {{to get as much}} military equipment as it could. The delegation expressed Pakistan's readiness to participate in defending the Middle East even if the US were to <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to Pakistan's security against India. Pakistan regarded India's behaviour during the military stand-off as [...] "aggressive", as one that needed a military response. As the US-Pakistan Mutual Defence Pact was taking shape in September 1953, Nehru warned Pakistan that it has to choose between winning Kashmir through a plebiscite or pursuing a military alliance with the US. If such a pact were to be concluded, Nehru said, the situation would change dramatically and [...] "all problems would be seen in a new light". Consequently, when the pact was concluded in May 1954, Nehru withdrew the plebiscite offer and declared that the status quo was the only remaining option.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} one day, Rabbi Eliezer {{employed}} every imaginable {{argument for the}} proposition that {{a particular type of}} oven was not susceptible to ritual impurity, but the Sages did not accept his arguments. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, then let this carob tree prove it," [...] and the carob tree moved 100 cubits (and others say 400 cubits) out of its place. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a carob tree. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let this stream of water prove it," [...] and the stream of water flowed backwards. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a stream of water. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let the walls of this house of study prove it," [...] and the walls leaned over as if to fall. But Rabbi Joshua rebuked the walls, telling them not to interfere with scholars engaged in a halachic dispute. In honor of Rabbi Joshua, the walls did not fall, but in honor of Rabbi Eliezer, the walls did not stand upright, either. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let Heaven prove it," [...] and a Heavenly Voice cried out: [...] "Why do you dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, for in all matters the halachah agrees with him!" [...] But Rabbi Joshua rose and exclaimed in the words of [...] "It is not in heaven." [...] Rabbi Jeremiah explained that God had given the Torah at Mount Sinai; Jews <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to Heavenly Voices, for God wrote in [...] "After the majority must one incline." [...] Later, Rabbi Nathan met Elijah and asked him what God did when Rabbi Joshua rose in opposition to the Heavenly Voice. Elijah replied that God laughed with joy, saying, [...] "My children have defeated Me, My children have defeated Me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Haridasa {{first became}} {{associated}} with Advaita Acarya. Haricarana Dasa, the biographer of Advaita Acharya {{says that all}} the demigods in heaven heard prayers of Advaita and reveal themselves to him, therefore when Advaita saw Haridasa, he could immediately recognizes that he was Brahma incarnate and named him Hari-dasa (literary meaning servant of God). He instructs Haridasa to recite Krishna's names and assures him that Krishna will always show mercy to Haridasa. The close {{relationship between the two}} and the fact that Advaita was feeding a Muslim, became a subject of malicious gossip. This apparent anomaly create a stir in a brahmana community, where others could not understand how a powerful ascetic was disregarding a convention of keeping a distance from Muslims. [...] The fact that community was disturbed is reflected in both Chaitanya Charitamrita and in Chaitanya Bhagavata. Haricarana Dasa in his historical records, confirms that while Advaita was from the higher ranks of [...] Bengali brahmana community, he completely ignored the facts about Haridasa's background, being impressed with the young man's heartfelt devotion. [...] While others became upset with Advaitas attention to Haridasa, and threatened to excommunicate Advaita, Advaita tells Haridasa to <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> to 'those petty people' and Advaita schedules a fire ceremony, agnihotra for the morning, and when preparations for this ritual to begin, there is no fire {{to be found in the}} whole town, and because of this whole life of the village is at a standstill. Advaita points out to all local brahmana priests that if priests are true to their religious teachings, there must be fire, and tells them to approach Haridasa with dried grass in their hands. When Haridasa relights all the fires with his potency, he also according to this record, manifests his four-faced Brahma-like form. While Agni, deity of Vedas responsible for fire is under control of the brahmanas, its Muslim born Haridasa, who lights the fires lost by all brahmanas in the village by the power of his devotion, 'the purity those born brahmana have lost.|$|E
