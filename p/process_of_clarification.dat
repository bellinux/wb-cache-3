50|$|The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarification</b> is {{concerned}} with the removal of particles; those larger than 5 - 10 mm for coarse polishing, particles larger than 1-4 micrometers for clarifying or polishing. Microbial stabilization requires a filtration of at least 0.65 micrometers for yeast retention and 0.45 µm for bacteria retention. However, filtration at this level may lighten a wine's color and body. Microbial stabilization does not imply sterility, i.e. eliminating (removing) or killing (deactivating) of all forms of life and other biological agents. It simply means that a significant amount of yeast and bacteria has been removed to a harmless level for the wine stability.|$|E

What happens to the competition when the contestants are allowed to {{interact with each other}} and with the competition jury? We consider dialogues to be a supplementary social technology that is becoming embedded in well-known forms of architectural competitions. By enabling feedback on preliminary design ideas and solutions, the dialogues are meant to accelerate <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarification</b> and learning, and to enable the contestants to implement changes and improvements during the development of their final design entries. However, in an empirical study the actual effects proved less straight-forward. The feedback allowed the architects to react and adapt, but in some cases they reacted and adapted in ways which they later regretted. By showing that feedback may also mislead the architectural teams to draw wrong implications we are sensitized to the inherent problems in knowing certain things ahead of time. We elaborate on this dilemma and suggest some implications for the theory and management of architectural competitions.

Cultural translation is the act of presenting cultural objects in another culture while deliberating explaining the elements of the object which are culturally specific to their original culture. In the words of translation critic James Steintrager, Chow challenges [...] "the claims cultural translation theory made on behalf of cultural expertise obscure the ideological and institutional stakes in the rhetoric of faithfulness: the claim to have better access to a culture and to know what it is really about in all its complexity." [...] Chow challenges these faithfulness arguments by exploring how they interfere with the potentially useful <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarification</b> that can arise when converting a text from one cultural situation to another. Chow sees the clarification as providing the opportunity for obscured cultural practices to become more [...] "visible as a cultural construct." [...] When reviewing her ideas, Steintrager argues that Chow's discussion of assumptions about faithfulness in cultural translation contentiously highlights how postcolonial studies remains bound to close reading and faithful interpretation, without considering the power of simplification.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> wine making, {{operation}} of cross-flow microfiltration allows a one-step <b>clarification</b> and sterilization <b>of</b> wine, with lower waste {{compared to the}} conventional <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarification</b> and sterilization. Indeed, these <b>processes</b> are sources <b>of</b> voluminous waste (earth, Kieselguhr, additives), when discharges {{are becoming more and}} more restricted by environmental and health rules. Nevertheless, cross-flow microfiltration of wine presents a major drawback: membrane fouling causes a significant decrease in the flow rates, due to excessive retention of some wine components which could lead ultimately to the alteration of the quality of wine. The aim of this work was to study the impact of some specific wine components (phenolic compounds and yeast extract), as well as some physico-chemical parameters (pH) in regard to membrane fouling. Studies were performed using one red wine and synthetic wines, using cellulose acetate membranes (0. 2 μm) operated in the dead-end mode under 2 bar pressure. The simultaneous presence of the both species of phenolic compounds (anthocyanins and tannins) in the synthetic wine was shown to be the main cause of fouling, whereas the presence of one specie leads only to standard blocking type behavior. An important decrease in the flow rates was also observed when yeast extract was added to the liquid. This yeast extract was shown t...|$|R
