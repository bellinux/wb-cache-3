25|$|Along {{with much}} of the central and {{northern}} California coast, Big Sur frequently has dense fog in summer. The summer fog and summer drought have the same underlying cause: a massive, stable seasonal high pressure system that forms over the north Pacific Ocean. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>cell</b> inhibits rainfall and generates northwesterly air flow. These prevailing summer winds from the northwest drive the ocean surface water slightly offshore (through the Ekman effect) which generates an upwelling of colder sub surface water. The water vapor in the air contacting this cold water condenses into fog. The fog usually moves out to sea during the day and closes in at night, but sometimes heavy fog blankets the coast all day. Fog is an essential summer water source for many Big Sur coastal plants. While few plants can take water directly out of the air, water condensation on leaf surfaces slowly precipitates into the ground like rain.|$|E

500|$|By early August 18, {{the storm}} {{maintained}} convection {{near the center}} with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to [...] Shortly thereafter, the storm began weakening because of increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper-level low. On August 19, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well-defined center and on the following day, a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated {{to the extent that}} only a diffuse low-level circulation center remained; observations indicated the barometric pressure rose to an unusually high [...] The flight indicated that Andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft. After the upper-level low weakened and split into a trough, the wind shear decreased over the storm. A strong high <b>pressure</b> <b>cell</b> then developed over the southeastern United States, which built eastward and caused Andrew to turn to the west. Convection became more organized as upper-level outflow became better established. An eye formed, and Andrew attained hurricane status early on August 22, about [...] east-southeast of Nassau, Bahamas. In the forecast issued six hours after becoming a hurricane, the cyclone was predicted to make landfall near Jupiter, Florida, with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on August 25. This underestimated both the strength and the speed of the storm, which would eventually make landfall in South Florida.|$|E

40|$|Closed-form {{expressions}} for {{the stiffness}} and the damping coefficients of a squeeze film are derived for MEMS devices with perforated back plates. Two kinds of perforation configurations are considered—staggered and matrix or non-staggered configuration. The analytical solutions are motivated from {{the observation of}} repetitive pressure patterns obtained fromnumerical (FEM) solutions of the compressible Reynolds equation for the two configurations using ANSYS. A single pressure pattern is isolated and further subdivided into circular <b>pressure</b> <b>cells.</b> Circular geometry is used based on observed symmetry. Using suitable boundary conditions, the Reynolds equation is analytically solved over the <b>pressure</b> <b>cells.</b> The complex <b>pressure</b> obtained is used to identify the stiffness and damping offered by the <b>pressure</b> <b>cells.</b> The stiffness and damping forces due to <b>pressure</b> <b>cells</b> within a pattern are added up separately. In turn, the stiffness and damping due to all the patterns are summed up resulting in the stiffness and damping forces due to the entire squeeze film. The damping and spring forces thus obtained analytically are compared with those obtained from the FEM simulations in ANSYS. The match {{is found to be}} very good. The regime of validity and limitations of the analytical solutions are assessed in terms of design parameters such as pitch to air gap, hole length to diameter and pitch to hole radius ratios. The analysis neglects inertial effects. Hence, the results are presented for low values of Reynolds number...|$|R
