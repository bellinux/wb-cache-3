40|$|Abstract—Energy {{consumption}} {{is among the}} major problems faced by cellular operators. In metropolitan areas, cellular network is divided into smaller cells due to high traffic. During low traffic period e. g., at midnight, Base Stations are underutilized but remain active and consume energy. In this paper, we propose two signaling frameworks for pooling the Base Stations of different cellular operators in a single cell during low traffic. The first Framework can be deployed rapidly with existing infrastructure. While the second framework {{can be used with}} Base Stations with enhanced capabilities. We consider cellular network with real Base Stations location in Paris region. We have taken blocking probability as Quality of Service parameter. Proposed signaling frameworks take into account call processing, subscribers soft handover between different operator’s Base Station. In this way, up to 66 % energy saving can be achieved for three different service providers in a single cell at low traffic period which also helps in the reduction of cellular radiation.

Leela uses her hunting skills to kill the squad snake, saving their lives, but Rinandor remains suspicious of her and demands to know why she's on an interdicted world. Leela easily slips away from them and soon finds the Doctor, who is still trapped by the bird-louse predator. Leela also kills this predator and takes the Doctor back to Rinandor and Pertandor, who are forced to concede that they can't survive on this world without Leela's help. They assume that the Doctor is also a toody—probably a duelling agent who's brought Leela to this world to train illegally. Trying to find {{the rest of their}} group, they instead find a <b>pool</b> <b>blocking</b> their path—and, impossibly, the equipment packs they discarded during their flight from the snake are on the island in the centre of the pool.

We investigated the role of lymphocyte subsets and adhesion molecules in this Bi-mAb-mediated cytolysis. CD 4 + lymphocytes were the most rapidly expanding subpopulation, but Bi-mAb-directed cytotoxicity was mediated preferentially by CD 8 + lymphocytes and effector cells belonging to the CD 45 RO+ "memory" <b>pool.</b> <b>Blocking</b> of the LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 or CD 2 /LFA- 3 adhesion pathways by mAb decreased Bi-mAb-mediated cytotoxicity.

Cross-linking of LFA- 1 or CD 2 molecules on lymphocytes prestimulated with Bi-mAb bound to CD 3 and CD 28 antigen lead to a more pronounced and prolonged rise in the intracellular concentration of free Ca 2 +. Additional CD 2 cross-linking resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of distinct proteins.

40|$|Liquid chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS) -based proteomics {{is becoming}} an increasingly important tool in characterizing the abundance of proteins in biological samples of various types and across conditions. Effects of disease or drug treatments on protein abundance are of particular interest for the characterization of biological processes and the identification of biomarkers. Although state-of-the-art instrumentation is available to make high-quality measurements and commercially available software is available to process the data, {{the complexity of the}} technology and data presents challenges for bioinformaticians and statisticians. Here, we describe a pipeline for the analysis of quantitative LC-MS data. Key components of this pipeline include experimental design (sample <b>pooling,</b> <b>blocking,</b> and randomization) as well as deconvolution and alignment of mass chromatograms to generate a matrix of molecular abundance profiles. An important challenge in LC-MS-based quantitation {{is to be able to}} accurately identify and assign abundance measurements to members of protein families. To address this issue, we implement a novel statistical method for inferring the relative abundance of related members of protein families from tryptic peptide intensities. This pipeline has been used to analyze quantitative LC-MS data from multiple biomarker discovery projects. We illustrate our pipeline here with examples from two of these studies, and show that the pipeline constitutes a complete workable framework for LC-MS-based differential quantitation.

40|$|High-density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) -[3 H]triolein (i. e. [3 H]triolein {{incorporated into}} reconstituted HDL) {{was taken up}} by cultured fibroblasts through an apparently saturable process, competitively inhibited by non-labelled HDL and independent of the LDL receptor. Using 125 I-HDL and HDL-[3 H]triolein, binding experiments (at 0 degrees C) followed by a short-time 'chase' at 37 degrees C showed that 125 I radioactivity was rapidly released in the culture medium (as trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material), whereas 3 H radioactivity remained associated with the cell. The cell-associated HDL-[3 H]triolein was rapidly degraded in normal fibroblasts, and the liberated [3 H]oleic acid was incorporated into newly biosynthesized phospholipids. In Wolman-disease fibroblasts HDL-[3 H]triolein was degraded at a normal rate, and thus independently of the lysosomal compartment. In contrast, the degradation of HDL-[3 H]triolein was blocked in fibroblasts from Neutral Lipid Storage Disease (NLSD), similarly to that of endogenously biosynthesized triacylglycerols [Radom, Salvayre, Nègre, Maret and Douste-Blazy (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 164, 703 - 708]. Trypsin-treated HDL-[3 H]triolein was also taken up by cells and degraded quite similarly to HDL-[3 H]triolein. In conclusion, all these data taken together suggest that HDL-[3 H]triolein is: (i) associated with the cell through a process independent of intact apolipoprotein (apo) As, thus probably independent of an apoA-receptor-mediated uptake; (ii) internalized by cells, whereas 125 I-apoAs are released in the culture medium; (iii) directed to the same non-lysosomal catabolic <b>pool</b> (<b>blocked</b> in NLSD) as for endogenously biosynthesized triacylglycerols...|$|R

25|$|The {{method used}} to read NANDflash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time (become programmed). This is known as read disturb. The {{threshold}} number of reads is generally {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of reads between intervening erase operations. If reading continually from one cell, that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read. To avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase. When the count exceeds a target limit, the affected block is copied over to a new block, erased, then released to the <b>block</b> <b>pool.</b> The original <b>block</b> is as good as new after the erase. If the flash controller does not intervene in time, however, a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error-correcting code.|$|R
40|$|In the {{encoding}} {{phase of}} fractal image compression, {{most of the}} time is taken in finding the closest match between each range block and a large <b>pool</b> of domain <b>blocks.</b> We use the intrablock variance distributions of domain blocks to reduce the search space. For finding a close match, we need search only the domain blocks whose maximal intrablock variance quadrants are at the same corner as the range block. Thus, we reduce the number of transforms applied on each domain block from eight to two. We also adopt the longest-distance-first vector quantization scheme to divide the large <b>pool</b> of domain <b>blocks</b> into clusters. Thus, the number of domain blocks to be searched is also reduced.
