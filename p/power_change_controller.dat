However, no previous study has described the degree or direction of <b>power</b> <b>change,</b> or even confirmed that such a relationship exists. Using a validated, standardized instrument for measuring personal power we collected data from 276 healthcare workers in two different hospitals before and after implementation of CPOE. We identified a significant correlation between power perceptions and attitudes toward CPOE. Examining the direction of change by healthcare position, we found that the power perception values decreased for all positions and that attitudes toward CPOE varied based on use of the system.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} {{technique}} for discriminating double talk and echo path change using the stochastic charac-teristics of <b>power</b> <b>change</b> for an adaptive noise canceller. The causes of rapid error increasing are double talk and echo path change. When the echo path is changed, the system corrects the impulse response {{in order to}} reduce the error. However, in the case of double talk, the system has to suspend the updating impulse response in order to maintain the quality of the voice signal. In the conventional system, it was difficult to discriminate between the two situations. In this research, the stochastic characteristics of the voice <b>power</b> <b>change</b> in the double talk period were experimentally verified to be different from the <b>power</b> <b>change</b> during echo path changing.

A voluntary disclosure checklist has been used for hand-collecting data from annual reports.

40|$|PURPOSE. Because {{presbyopia}} {{is thought}} to be accompanied by increased lens sclerosis this study was conducted to investigate whether refilling the capsule of the presbyopic human lens with a soft polymer would restore the ability of the lens to undergo accommodative changes. METHODS. Accommodative forces were applied to natural and refilled lenses by circumferential stretching through the ciliary body and zonular complex. Nine natural lenses and 10 refilled lenses from donors ranging in age from 17 to 60 years were studied. Two refill polymers with a different Young's modulus were used. The lens power was measured by a scanning laser ray-tracing technique, and lens diameter and lens thickness were measured simultaneously while the tension on the zonules was increased stepwise by outward pull on the ciliary body. RESULTS. In the natural lenses the older lenses were not able to undergo <b>power</b> <b>changes</b> with stretching of the ciliary body, whereas in the refilled lenses, all lenses showed <b>power</b> <b>changes</b> comparable to young, natural lenses. The refilled human lenses had a higher lens power than the age-matched natural lenses. The Young's modulus of the polymers influenced the lens <b>power</b> <b>change</b> when measured with the ciliary body diameter increased by 4 Him. CONCLUSIONS. Refilling presbyopic lenses with a soft polymer enabled restoration of lens <b>power</b> <b>changes</b> with mechanical stretching. Because sclerosis of the lens {{is an important factor in}} human presbyopia, refilling the lens during lens surgery for cataract could enable restoration of clear vision and accommodation in human presbyopia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{supervisory}} technique {{to monitor the}} material removal state and tool wear condition {{as well as the}} estimation method for overall power consumed in the machining from the effective spindle <b>power</b> <b>change.</b> The effective <b>power</b> (VAcosφ) was the optimal motor related parameter to represent the motor load. The cutting condition can be related with the effective <b>power</b> <b>change</b> by using the averaged effective power for 0. 2 seconds. The mean effective power is in proportion to the material removal rate. In addition, the averaged effective power can monitor continuously the tool wear condition and tool breakage. There was a series of cutting conditions where the specific effective power becomes minimum in the grooving operation. Under the cutting conditions with the minimum specific effective power, the cutting would have been conducting at the least cutting resistance and less overall power consumed. These facts indicates that we can determine the cutting conditions, where the cutting resistance and overall power consumed are getting minimum at the same time, by measuring the effective spindle <b>power</b> <b>change</b> during the operation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{accommodation}} {{process of}} the human eye is still a controversial subject. Coleman assumes that the lens, together with the zonula fibers, forms a diaphragm which is held in a catenary shape due to the pressure difference between the aqueous and vitreous body of the lens. The aim of the paper is to compare the results of two simulations (according to the Helmholtz and to the Coleman theories) with ultrasonographic data. MethodsAn axisymmetric static finite element model of the lens was generated using the literature data for geometry, material properties and loads. The refractive power of the lens was calculated for two different ages (29 and 45 years). ResultsThe application of a pressure to the posterior lens surface did not yield an increase in refractive <b>power</b> <b>change</b> during accommodation. Rather a decrease in accommodation related refractive power was found. ConclusionsPhysiologically relevant refractive <b>power</b> <b>changes</b> are obtained by a simulation {{in accordance with the}} Helmholtz theory. A simulation in accordance with the Coleman theory does not yield physiological values of refractive <b>power</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R
