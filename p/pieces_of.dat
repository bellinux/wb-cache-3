5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
