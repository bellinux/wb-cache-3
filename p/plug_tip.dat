50|$|This stratified-charge {{approach}} to lean-burn combustion {{means that the}} air-fuel ratio isn't equal throughout the cylinder.

5000|$|Since the {{cigarette}} lighter socket was originally designed only to heat a cigarette lighter, repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors {{can lead to}} many problems. In addition to the issues with partially-compatible physical dimensions, the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, {{there have been reports}} of melted <b>plug</b> <b>tips</b> due to poor contact and heat generation from ohmic resistance.

5000|$|A {{spark plug}} {{is said to}} be [...] "hot" [...] if it is a better heat insulator, keeping more heat in the tip of the spark plug. A spark plug {{is said to be}} [...] "cold" [...] if it can conduct more heat out of the spark <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> and lower the tip's temperature. Whether a spark plug is [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] is known as the heat range of the spark plug. The heat range of a spark plug is {{typically}} specified as a number, with some manufacturers using ascending numbers for hotter plugs, and others doing the opposite - using ascending numbers for colder plugs.|$|E
50|$|In some three-conductor TRS phone inserts, {{the concept}} is {{extended}} by using specially designed phone jacks that will accept a mono phone plug partly inserted to the first click and will then connect the tip to the signal path without breaking it. Most standard phone connectors {{can also be used}} in this way with varying success, but neither the switch contact nor the tip contact can be relied upon unless the internal contacts have been designed with extra strength for holding the <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> in place. Even with stronger contacts, an accidental mechanical movement of the inserted plug can interrupt signal within the circuit. For maximum reliability, any usage involving first click or half-click positions will instead rewire the plug to short tip and ring together and then insert this modified plug all the way into the jack.|$|E
5000|$|The spark plug's firing end will be {{affected}} by the internal environment of the combustion chamber.

50|$|The {{glow plugs}} used in model engines are {{significantly}} different from those used in full-size diesel engines. In full-size engines, the glow plug is used only for starting. In model engines, the glow plug {{is an integral part}} of the ignition system because of the catalytic effect of the platinum wire. The glow plug is a durable, mostly platinum, helical wire filament recessed into the <b>plug's</b> <b>tip.</b> When an electric current runs through the plug, or when exposed to the heat of the combustion chamber, the filament glows, enabling it to help ignite the special fuel used by these engines. Power can be applied using a special connector attaching to the outside of the engine, and may use a rechargeable battery or DC power source.|$|R
5000|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, that a special {{condition}} exists: if a male three-conductor plug is partially inserted into a female two-conductor socket {{such that the}} female ring contact bridges the gap of the male <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> and first ring, then an identical signal will be connected to both these conductors, thus simulating a [...] "Y" [...] connection. Note this is definitely NOT a reliable connection and is only useful in a test or emergency situation. Further note that analog low and line level audio circuits usually tolerate this well if the volume (current) is not excessive, though other cases may not {{be due to the}} typical surge current that occurs at the moment all three conductors engage. Common example of condition: a typical 3.5 mm earphone socket of a mono radio or micro amp has a stereo headphone plug partly inserted. Mono audio should be delivered to both speakers if the plug depth is carefully adjusted in the socket.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} the {{threaded}} portion of the plug should be closely matched to {{the thickness of the}} head. If a plug extends too far into the combustion chamber, it may be struck by the piston, damaging the engine internally. Less dramatically, if the threads of the plug extend into the combustion chamber, the sharp edges of the threads act as point sources of heat which may cause pre-ignition; in addition, deposits which form between the exposed threads may make it difficult to remove the plugs, even damaging the threads on aluminium heads in the process of removal. The protrusion of the tip into the chamber also affects plug performance, however; the more centrally located the spark gap is, generally the better the ignition of the air-fuel mixture will be, although experts believe the process is more complex and dependent on combustion chamber shape. On the other hand, if an engine is [...] "burning oil", the excess oil leaking into the combustion chamber tends to foul the <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> and inhibit the spark; in such cases, a plug with less protrusion than the engine would normally call for often collects less fouling and performs better, for a longer period. In fact, special [...] "anti-fouling" [...] adapters are sold which fit between the plug and the head to reduce the protrusion of the plug for just this reason, on older engines with severe oil burning problems; this will cause the ignition of the fuel-air mixture to be less effective, but in such cases, this is of lesser significance.|$|E
5000|$|A {{matter of}} some debate is the [...] "indexing" [...] of plugs upon installation, usually only for {{high-performance}} or racing applications; this involves installing {{them so that}} the open area of the spark gap, not shrouded by the ground electrode, faces {{the center of the}} combustion chamber, towards the intake valve, rather than the wall. Some engine tuners believe that this will maximize the exposure of the fuel-air mixture to the spark, also ensuring that every combustion chamber is even in layout and therefore resulting in better ignition; however, others believe this is useful only to keep the ground electrode {{out of the way of}} the piston in ultra-high-compression engines if clearance is insufficient. In any event, this is accomplished by marking the location of the gap on the outside of the plug, installing it, and noting the direction in which the mark faces; then the plug is removed, and additional washers are added to change the orientation of the tightened plug. This must be done individually for each plug, as the orientation of the gap with respect to the threads of the shell is random. Some plugs are made with a non-random orientation of the gap and are usually marked as such by a suffix to the model number; typically these are specified by manufacturers of very small engines where the spark <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> and electrodes form a significantly large part of the shape of the combustion chamber. The Honda Insight has indexed spark plugs from factory, with four different part numbers available corresponding to the different degrees of indexing to achieve most efficient combustion and maximal fuel efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Threaded {{plug valves}} are used {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded plug valve involves a plug with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the plug valve all the way in engages the <b>plug's</b> <b>tip</b> with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|R

50|$|Throttle-body fuel {{injection}} first appeared for the 302 on the Lincoln Continental in 1980, and was made standard on all applications in 1983 except manual-transmission equipped Mustangs, Mercury Capris (equipped first with two-barrel (1982), then later four-barrel carburetor (1983-85)), and F-series trucks. The block was fitted with revised, taller lifter bosses to accept roller lifters, and a steel camshaft in 1985, and electronic sequential {{fuel injection}} {{was introduced in}} 1986. While sequential injection was used on the Mustang beginning in 1986, many other vehicles, including trucks, continued to use a batch-fire fuel injection system. The speed-density based EFI systems used a large, two-piece, cast-aluminum manifold. It was fitted on all engines through 1988, after which year it was phased out for a mass-air type measuring system in most applications (non-California compliant Panther platform cars retained the speed-density system until the Lincoln Town Car received the Modular V8 for model year 1991, and the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis for 1992). The same manifold was used in MAF applications, {{with the addition of}} the MAF sensor in the air intake tube. The MAF system continued, with minor revisions, until the retirement of the engine in 2001. Ford offered a performance head that was a stock part on 1993-1995 Mustang Cobra models and pre- 1997-1/2 Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers equipped with the 5.0 L engine called the GT-40 head (casting ID F3ZE-AA). In mid-1997, the Explorer and Mountaineer 5.0 L heads were revised and renamed GT40P. The GT40P heads, unlike the GT40 heads, had a very well-developed port shape/design which yielded about 200 cfm on the intake side and 140 cfm on the exhaust side without increasing the size of the ports at all from standard E7TE castings, and without increasing the exhaust valve size. They also had smaller 59-61 cc combustion chambers for added compression, and the combustion chamber shape was revised to put the spark <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> {{near the center of the}} chamber for a more even burn. These GT40P heads are considered by many enthusiasts to be extremely efficient.|$|E

Ultrasonic fuel vaporization did not demonstrate sufficient improvement in distribution to offset the performance loss caused by the additional manifold restriction.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate how the velocity and turbulence within different locations close to the spark plug influence the combustion at individual cycles in a SI-engine. 2 -D cycle-resolved laser doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements have been done both inside the spark gap and around the spark tip to extract velocity information. The pressure in the cylinder was measured with a piezo-electric transducer connected to an A/D-card in a standard PC. The velocity information was filtered to get "mean velocity" and "turbulence". The pressure signal was used in a one-zone heatrelease model to get different levels of mass fraction burned etc. The results show a significant influence of both the "mean velocity" and the "turbulence" on the early part of the combustion when the velocity was measured close to the spark <b>plug</b> <b>tip.</b> The influence was less significant when the velocity was measured at some distance from the electrodes for both a pancake and a high squish combustion chamber.

40|$|Shock-cell {{noise is}} {{identified}} to be a potentially significant problem for advanced supersonic aircraft at takeoff. Therefore NASA conducted fundamental {{studies of the}} phenomena involved and model-scale experiments aimed at developing means of noise reduction. The results {{of a series of}} studies conducted to determine means by which supersonic jet shock noise can be reduced to acceptable levels for advanced supersonic cruise aircraft are reviewed. Theoretical studies were conducted on the shock associated noise of supersonic jets from convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzles. Laboratory studies were conducted on the influence of narrowband shock screech on broadband noise and on means of screech reduction. The usefulness of C-D nozzle passages was investigated at model scale for single-stream and dual-stream nozzles.

The flow-field measurements complimented previous acoustic measurements. The exhaust system consisted of externally-plugged, externally-mixed, convergent nozzles. The study used bypass-to-core area ratios equal to 1. 0 and 2. 5 and tertiary-to-core area ratios equal to 0. 6 and 1. 0. Axisymmetric and offset tertiary nozzles were investigated for heated and unheated high-subsonic conditions. Centerline velocity decay rates for the single-, dual- and three-stream axisymmetric jets compared well when axial distance was normalized by an equivalent diameter based on the nozzle system total exit area. The tertiary stream had {{a greater impact on}} the mean axial velocity for the small bypass-to-core area ratio nozzles than for large bypass-to-core area ratio nozzles. Normalized turbulence intensities were similar for the single-, dual-, and three-stream unheated jets due to the small difference (10 percent) in the core and bypass velocities for the dual-stream jets and the low tertiary velocity (50 percent of the core stream) for the three-stream jets. For heated jet conditions where the bypass velocity was 65 percent of the core velocity, additional regions of high turbulence intensity occurred near the <b>plug</b> <b>tip</b> which were not present for the unheated jets.

40|$|The {{potential}} of jet noise shielding from the Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) airplane is investigated in subscale experiments. The jet nozzle had a bypass ratio 10 and was operated at realistic takeoff exhaust conditions using helium-air mixtures. The shield, fabricated from a thin flat plate, had the generic {{shape of the}} HWB planform. Redistribution of the jet noise source is essential for achieving substantial noise reduction. Devices used to alter the jet noise source comprised chevrons (in mild and aggressive configurations) {{and a number of}} porous wedge fan flow deflectors. Using the estimated cumulative (downward plus sideline) EPNL reduction as a figure of merit, shielding of the plain nozzle yields a 2. 4 dB reduction. Application of the aggressive chevrons increases the reduction to 6. 5 dB, while the best wedge configuration improves this figure to 6. 9 dB. Combination of wedge and aggressive chevrons yields a benefit of 7. 6 dB. Examination of high-definition noise source maps shows a direct link between the insertion loss and the axial location of peak noise source. The aggressive chevrons cause an abrupt contraction of the noise source length at Strouhal number Sr= 1. 2, while the wedge induces a gradual contraction with increasing frequency. As a result, the insertion loss with the aggressive chevrons is stronger than with the wedge. However, because the wedge is inherently quieter than the chevrons, it gives a slightly better overall benefit. Surveys of the mean flow field show that the wedge, and its combination with chevrons, produces a significant reduction in the potential core length. On the other hand, the chevrons alone induce modest changes in the length of the high-speed region of the jet. Therefore, the mean velocity field by itself cannot provide useful information for inferring the noise source length for these complicated flows.

40|$|Glow plugs {{are widely}} used to promote the desired cold start and post-cold start {{combustion}} characteristics of light duty diesel engines. The importance of the glow plug becomes more apparent when the compression ratio is low. An experimental investigation of combustion initiation and development aided by the glow plug {{has been carried out}} on a single cylinder HPCR DI diesel engine with a low compression ratio of 15. 5 : 1. High speed imaging of combustion initiated by the glow plug in a combustion bomb has been used to add understanding of initiation process. Complementary CFD studies have been carried out using ANSYS Fluent 14. 0 to explore the interactions between the glow plug and the spray behavior. Observation of successful combustion initiation show that two conditions must be met, compression heating and heat transfer from the glow plug must raise temperature of gas nearby to at least 413 ÂºC and the vapour/air equivalence ratio no lower than 0. 15 - 0. 35. The initiation site was at spray edge close to the glow plug, the flame grew locally before expanding downstream in direction of spray penetration {{after the end of the}} main injection. Experimental studies carried out on the engine indicated that the engine IMEP, heat release and combustion stability were continuously improved by using the glow plug at ambient temperatures higher than the temperature requiring the glow plug for initiation of combustion. A rapid development of premixed combustion was achieved associated with improved engine work output, heat release rate and cycle-by-cycle stability. The premixed combustion was enhanced by strengthening spray vaporization through the glow plug. In this study, the combustion behavior was enhanced by the glow plug up to ambient temperature of 20 ÂºC. Initiation delay was shortened by a rapid development of combustion aided by the glow plug.

40|$|This study tested {{mechanisms}} {{proposed for}} maternal uniparental mitochondrial inheritance in Neurospora: (1) exclusion of conidial mitochondria by the specialized female reproductive structure, trichogyne, due to mating locus heterokaryon incompatibility and (2) mitochondrial input bias favoring the larger trichogyne over the smaller conidium.

This suggests that maternal mitochondrial inheritance following hyphal fusions is due to some mechanism other than those that implicate the trichogyne.
