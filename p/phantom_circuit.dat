5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit.</b> An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

50|$|An {{electrical}} contactor is an electrically controlled switch which closes a power or high voltage electrical circuit. A plasma contactor changes the electrically insulating vacuum into a conductor by providing movable electrons and positive gas ions. This conductive path closes a <b>phantom</b> loop <b>circuit</b> to discharge or neutralize the static electricity that can build up on a spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{telephone}} line for {{plain old telephone service}} and some early microphones use a bias tee circuit—often with a gyrator replacing the inductor—this enables a thin cable with only 2 conductors to send {{power from the}} system to the device, and send audio from the device back to the system.Modern microphones often use 3 conductors in a <b>phantom</b> power <b>circuit</b> very similar to a bias tee circuit.|$|R

5000|$|A {{phantom group}} is {{composed}} of three circuits that are derived from two single-channel circuits to form a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit.</b> Here the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> is a third circuit derived from two suitably arranged pairs of wires, called side circuits, with each pair of wires being a circuit in itself {{and at the same}} time acting as one conductor of the third circuit. The [...] "side circuits" [...] within phantom circuits can be coupled to their respective voltage drops by center-tapped transformers, usually called [...] "repeating coils". The center taps are on the line side of the side circuits. Current from the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> is split evenly by the center taps. This cancels crosstalk from the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> to the side circuits. Phantom working increased the number of circuits on long distance routes in the early 20th century without putting up more wires. Phantoming declined with the adoption of carrier systems.|$|E

50|$|Phantom {{powering}} is {{not always}} implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1 mA per microphone), so the <b>phantom</b> supply <b>circuits</b> typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed {{on the assumption that}} this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2 mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt <b>phantom</b> power supply <b>circuits,</b> especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2 mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.|$|R

Includes bibliographical references. For {{phased array}} medical {{ultrasound}} imaging, digital beamforming techniques and VLSI circuits are studied {{to form a}} fully digital receive front-end hardware. To increase the timing accuracy in beamforming, a computationally efficient upsampling schme is examined. A digital beamforming method based on receive focusing at the raster focal points is proposed. The sector images of the resolution phantom, reconstructed from the phased array experimental data by beamforming at the radial and raster focal points, are presented for comparison of the image resolution performance of the two beamforming schemes. For adaptive beamforming, a phase aberration correction technique with very low computational complexity is described. Image quality performance of the technique is examined by digitally processing the non-aberrated and aberrated phased array experimental data sets of an ultrasound resolution <b>phantom.</b> VLSI <b>circuits</b> and their implementations for the proposed techniques are presented.

40|$|Characterization {{of blood}} {{impedance}} properties {{is important to}} estimate clinical diagnostic indices such as haematocrit, glucose level and hydration. Current in vivo bioimpedance spectroscopy methods are performed on a body appendage and thus represent a combined measurement of all tissues in the measurement field, rather than the blood individually. This paper describes a novel in vivo measurement technique to calculate bioelectrical properties of blood while excluding the disturbances from surrounding tissues, based on analysis of the impedance changes caused by blood accumulation. The forearm was modelled as a cylinder containing anatomical structures such as skin-fat layer, muscles, bones. Blood volume was modeled as the inner cylinder. A tetrapolar electrode system was applied to a human forearm and the impedance curves measured with and without blood pooling were processed to calculate the impedance parameters of arterial blood. The bioelectrical parameters of blood were estimated by fitting the blood curve to a Cole-Cole model using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) nonlinear curve fitting method. The approach proposed was verified using an experimental <b>phantom,</b> an equivalent <b>circuit</b> model and a preliminary human experiment. Results show that electrical properties of blood and surrounding tissues can be separated successfully. Of Cole-Cole parameters, the characteristic frequency fc is the most reliable parameter to characterize blood bioelectrical properties. This method may allow simplified measurement of blood characteristic parameters for many biomedical and clinical monitoring applications. Index Term...|$|R
50|$|It is {{theoretically}} {{possible to}} create a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> from two other phantom circuits and so on up in a pyramid with a maximum 2n-1 circuits being derived from n original circuits. However, more than one level of phantoming is usually impractical. Isolation between the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> and the side circuits relies on accurate balance {{of the line and}} transformers. Imperfect balance results in crosstalk between the phantom and side circuits and this effect accumulates as each level of phantoms is added. Even small levels of crosstalk are unacceptable on analogue telecommunications circuits since speech crosstalk is still intelligible down to quite low levels.|$|E
5000|$|This {{configuration}} {{can also}} be called [...] "bunched pairs". However, [...] "bunched pairs" [...] can also refer to the straightforward connection of two lines in parallel {{which is not a}} <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> and will not reduce the loading.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{directional}} {{patterns are}} produced by enclosing {{one side of the}} ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from [...] "figure-eight" [...] to [...] "unidirectional". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns, and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require <b>phantom</b> power, and <b>circuits</b> of modern passive ribbon microphones, i.e., those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} is to validate the relationship between hemoglobin saturation (SaO 2) and partial pressure of dissolved oxygen (pO 2) in breast tumors in mice using photoacoustic computed tomographic (PCT) imaging and OxyLite probe, respectively. In its simplest form, the relationship is described by the dissociation curve, or Hill’s equation, for hemoglobin, and is modeled as a sigmoidal curve that {{is a function of}} two parameters – the Hill coefficient, n, and the net association constant of HbO 2, K (or pO 2 at 50 % SaO 2). First, a calibration study to validate Hill’s equation in blood was performed by creating a closed <b>circuit</b> <b>phantom</b> to test the SaO 2 (co-oximeter) and pO 2 (Oxylite probe) relationship (K= 23. 2 mmHg and n= 2. 26). Next, non-invasive localized measurements of SaO 2 in MDA-MD- 231 and MCF 7 breast tumors using PCT spectroscopic methods were compared to pO 2 levels, where pO 2 levels were measured in 1 mm increments across the central axis of the tumor. The fitted results for MCF 7 and MDA-MD- 231 were K= 17. 2 mmHg and 20. 7 mmHg, and n= 1. 76 and 1. 63, respectively. The results are consistent with sigmoidal form of Hill’s equation. The lower value of K is indicative of the acidic microenvironment associated with tumors. Ongoing work to correct for photon transport and image artifacts are anticipated to enhance the quality of the results. In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrate photoacoustic can be used to measure tumor oxygenation, and its potential use in investigating th...|$|R
50|$|The {{kinds of}} {{stranding}} have different transmission characteristics. The {{capacity of a}} stranding affects itself, for example the two conductors of a quadruple run parallel over the entire cable length in star quad twisting. Capacitance between the conductors is thus substantially higher than with Dieselhorst Martin (DHM) - stranding in which {{the situation of the}} conductors {{to each other in the}} cable changes repeatedly. Because of the smaller work capacity of the DHM stranding it is possible to form additional electric circuits with the help of a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit.</b> Since the phantom transducers are turned on to in the middle of the master transducers, the currents of the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> on the two coming Rome circles compensate themselves.|$|E
50|$|Simplex {{signaling}} (SX) is signaling {{in which}} two conductors are used for a single channel, and a center-tapped coil, or its equivalent, is used to split the signaling current equally between the two conductors. The return path for the current is through ground. It is distinct from a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> in which the return current path for power or signaling is provided through different signal conductors.SX signaling may be one-way, for intra-central-office use, or the simplex legs may be connected to form full duplex signaling circuits that function like composite (CX) signaling circuits with E&M lead control.|$|E

50|$|Phantom {{powering}} {{consists of}} a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> where direct current is applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector (in modern equipment, usually an XLR connector). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for dynamic microphones could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with vacuum-tube circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.|$|E

40|$|Around {{the turn}} of the twentieth century a method that allowed for a third voice {{communications}} channel over two copper pairs was developed.

Today researchers in the area of DSL technology view the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> as the method for squeezing the last bit of bandwidth out of copper twisted pair communications. It is the objective of this contribution to first clarify whether communication at DSL frequencies is at all possible over a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit,</b> and secondly whether it can be used to increase the possible transfer rate and/or the distances over which these transfer rates can be achieved.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demand for a}} variety of new Internet services with different and possibly stringent QoS requirements (i. e. Internet Telephony, videoconferencing etc.) requires the design of mechanisms to support QoS guarantees. The current solutions proposed in IETF, RSVP (Resource reSerVation Protocol) and Differentiated Services, though suitable for many applications, may result inefficient to support real-time services on a call basis. RSVP is not really scalable and requires substantial changes in the Internet architecture, while Differentiated Services provide guarantees mostly on a static and permanent basis. In this paper we assume an Internet architecture supporting multiple priorities as needed in Differentiated Services, and introduce PCP (<b>Phantom</b> <b>Circuit</b> Protocol), a mechanism that provides a guaranteed bandwidth transport service for circuit oriented connections.

40|$|PCP (<b>Phantom</b> <b>Circuit</b> Protocol) is a {{mechanism}} {{that provides a}} guaranteed-bandwidth transport mechanism in IP networks. It includes an effective Call Admission Control (CAC) protocol and operates ona per call basis, as in circuit switched networks. In this respect PCP presents the same capabilities as RSVP, but, unlike RSVP, PCP is fully scalable since the CAC procedure is completely distributed, involves only network access points and does not require network routers to exchange any call set-up signaling. Up to now, {{the validity of the}} mechanism has been demonstrated with respect to Constant Bit Rate traffic. In this paper we show how PCP operation can be extended to Variable Bit Rate traffic. Our approach is fully compatible with other Differentiated Services since a proper interaction among the new traffic aggregate and the other traffic can be defined according to the PHBs description rules. 1.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the characterization measurements of an implantable bioimpedance monitor with ZigBee. Such measurements are done over RC networks,performing {{short and long-term}} measurements, with and without mismatch in electrodes and varying the temperature and the RF range. The bioimpedance monitor {{will be used in}} organ monitoring through electrical impedance spectroscopy in the 100 Hz - 200 kHz range. The specific application is the study of the viability and evolution of engineered tissue in cardiac regeneration in an experimental protocol with pig models. The bioimpedance monitor includes a ZigBee transceiver to transmit the measured data outside the animal chest. The bioimpedance monitor is based in the 12 Bit Impedance Converter and Network Analyzer AD 5933, improved with an analog front-end that implements a 4 -electrode measurement structure and allows to measure small impedances. In the debugging prototype, the system autonomy exceeds 1 month when a 14 frequencies impedance spectrum is acquired every 5 minutes. The receiver side consists of a ZigBee transceiver connected to a PC to process the received data. In the current implementation, the effective range of the RF link was of a few centimeters, then needing a range extender placed close to the animal.
