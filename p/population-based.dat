5|$|A {{study in}} {{geometric}} mean urine mercury concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure (skin care products) to inorganic mercury among New York City residents. <b>Population-based</b> biomonitoring {{also showed that}} mercury concentration levels are higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals.|$|E
5|$|A <b>population-based</b> study {{completed}} by the National Alcohol Research Center {{found that women who}} identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between <b>population-based</b> studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the <b>population-based</b> House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that SCSFLS runs in {{families}} and it is suspected that genetic similarity in families includes weakness in the dura mater, which leads to SCSFLS. Large scale <b>population-based</b> studies {{have not yet been}} conducted. While a majority of SCSFLS cases continue to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, an actual increase in occurrence is unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths mandated by the previous Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the <b>population-based</b> House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In <b>population-based</b> studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{about one}} billion people are {{estimated}} to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large <b>population-based</b> studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have overt hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have subclinical hypothyroidism. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH level below the 10mIU/l mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter).|$|E
5|$|Cuba was {{of special}} {{importance}} to Southern Democrats, who believed their {{economic and political}} interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the <b>population-based</b> House of Representatives, Southern politicians sought to maintain the fragile {{balance of power in}} the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island would have sent two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the <b>population-based</b> House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote. Republicans began {{looking for a way to}} offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.|$|E
25|$|In The Federalist Papers, James Madison {{explained}} {{his views on}} {{the selection of the}} president and the Constitution. In Federalist No. 39, Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state-based and <b>population-based</b> government.

25|$|Long-term {{benefits}} {{have also been}} associated with those patients who receive surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. However, much remains unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age of under 50 is linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme, as is 98%+ resection and use of temozolomide chemotherapy and better Karnofsky performance scores. A recent study confirms that younger age {{is associated with a}} much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a <b>population-based</b> cure. The <b>population-based</b> cure is thought to occur when a population's risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Population-based</b> rule evaluation, {{rules are}} applied to populations. All {{molecules}} {{of the same species}} in the same state are pooled together. Application of a specific rule reduces or increases the size of one of the pools, possibly at the expense of another.|$|E
25|$|StochSim is a particle-based {{stochastic}} simulator used {{mainly to}} model chemical reactions and other molecular transitions. The algorithm used in StochSim {{is different from}} the more widely known Gillespie stochastic algorithm in that it operates on individual entities, not entity pools, making it particle-based rather than <b>population-based.</b>|$|E
25|$|Individual {{consumption}} studies provide data at {{the individual}} consumer level. These surveys can be retrospective, prospective, {{or a combination of}} both. The most commonly used surveys are retrospective food recall studies or prospective food record studies. Individual consumption surveys obtain diaries from a <b>population-based</b> probability sample of respondents who report detailed information of their food consumption by type.|$|E
25|$|When running {{simulations}} on {{a biological}} model, any simulation software evaluates {{a set of}} rules, starting from a specified set of initial conditions, and usually iterating {{through a series of}} time steps until a specified end time. One way to classify simulation algorithms is by looking at the level of analysis at which the rules are applied: they can be <b>population-based,</b> single-particle-based or hybrid.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, The DHS Program {{has worked}} in over 15 {{countries}} in Africa, Asia and Latin America and Caribbean conducting <b>population-based</b> HIV testing. By collecting blood for HIV testing from representative samples {{of the population of}} men and women in a country, the DHS Program provides nationally representative estimates of HIV rates. The testing protocol provides for anonymous, informed, and voluntary testing of women and men.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{public schools}} were {{funded by a}} {{combination}} of <b>population-based</b> state reimbursement, taxes, and tuition paid by parents. In 1867, tuition was abolished, making public education free to all. At that time, attending school was voluntary, but by 1874, it became mandatory for students aged 8 to 14. Enforcement was sometimes difficult though, especially considering the agricultural economy that the area depended upon at the time.|$|E
25|$|Other countries, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, have {{targeted}} {{recommendations for}} the vaccine, e.g., for susceptible health care workers at risk of varicella exposure. In the UK, varicella antibodies are measured {{as part of the}} routine of prenatal care, and by 2005 all National Health Service personnel had determined their immunity and been immunized if they were non-immune and have direct patient contact. <b>Population-based</b> immunization against varicella is not otherwise practised in the UK.|$|E
25|$|A <b>population-based</b> {{study in}} Olmsted County, Minnesota county {{found that the}} {{cumulative}} incidence of autism grew eightfold from the 1980–83 period to the 1995–97 period. The increase occurred after the introduction of broader, more-precise diagnostic criteria, increased service availability, and increased awareness of autism. During the same period, the reported number of autism cases grew 22-fold in the same location, suggesting that counts reported by clinics or schools provide misleading estimates of the true incidence of autism.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2000 {{study of}} the World Health Organization (WHO), {{publicly}} funded systems of industrial nations spend less on healthcare, both {{as a percentage of}} their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior <b>population-based</b> health care outcomes. However, conservative commentator David Gratzer and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected healthcare performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine {{can cause}} birth defects. A 2003 <b>population-based</b> study in Denmark {{showed that the}} use of {{azathioprine}} and related mercaptopurine resulted in a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. Birth defects in a child whose father was taking azathioprine have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed. Transplant patients already on this drug should not discontinue on becoming pregnant. This contrasts with the later-developed drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which are contraindicated during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>population-based</b> health {{management}} is complex, requiring a multiple {{set of skills}} (medical, political, technological, mathematical etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues, but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.|$|E
25|$|SAD shows a {{high degree}} of co-occurrence with other {{psychiatric}} disorders. In fact, a <b>population-based</b> study found that 66% of those with SAD had one or more additional mental health disorders. SAD often occurs alongside low self-esteem and most commonly clinical depression, perhaps {{due to a lack of}} personal relationships and long periods of isolation related to social avoidance. Clinical depression is 1.49 to 3.5 times more likely to occur in those with SAD. Anxiety disorders are also very common in patients with SAD, in particular generalized anxiety disorder. Avoidant personality disorder is also highly correlated with SAD, with comorbidity rates ranging from 25% to 89%.|$|E
25|$|The Beyond 2011 Programme {{is being}} coordinated {{on behalf of}} UK Statistics by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS advised it would {{collaborate}} with the statistical authorities of the devolved administrations of Scotland and Northern Ireland, {{in order to ensure}} the consistency of statistics across the whole of the United Kingdom. The UK Statistics Authority has indicated that the Beyond 2011 recommendations will take into account user requirements, 'public burden', costs and public acceptability and above all the statistical viability of the potential solutions. The recommendations are anticipated to have implications for all <b>population-based</b> statistics and potentially, in the longer term, for the statistics gathering, analysis and publishing systems as a whole.|$|E
25|$|It is easy {{to imagine}} a {{biological}} system where some components are complex multi-state molecules, whereas others have few possible states (or even just one) and exist in large numbers. A hybrid approach has been proposed to model such systems: Within the Hybrid Particle/Population (HPP) framework, the user can specify a rule-based model, but can designate some species to be treated as populations (rather than particles) in the subsequent simulation. This method combines the computational advantages of particle-based modeling for multi-state systems with relatively low molecule numbers and of <b>population-based</b> modeling for systems with high molecule numbers and a small number of possible states. Specification of HPP models is supported by BioNetGen, and simulations can be performed with NFSim.|$|E
25|$|In {{subclinical}} hyperthyroidism, serum TSH is abnormally low, but T4- and T3-levels {{fall within}} laboratory reference ranges. It primarily affects the skeleton and the cardiovascular system (abnormalities in other systems {{have also been}} reported), in a similar but less severe and less frequent way than overt hyperthyroidism does. It can alter cardiac function, with increased heart rate, increased left ventricular mass index, increased cardiac contractility, diastolic dysfunction, and induction of ectopic atrial beats. Long-term mild excess of thyroid hormone can thus cause impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity. In a large <b>population-based</b> study of 2008, the odds of having poorer cognitive function were greater for subclinical hyperthyroidism than for stroke, diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's disease. Subclinical hyperthyroidism might modestly {{increase the risk of}} cognitive impairment and dementia.|$|E
25|$|The {{framework}} is formed by large collections of anatomical, physiological, and pathological data stored in digital format, typically by predictive simulations developed from these collections and by services intended to support {{researchers in the}} creation and maintenance of these models, {{as well as in}} the creation of end-user technologies to be used in the clinical practice. VPH models aim to integrate physiological processes across different length and time scales (multi-scale modelling). These models make possible the combination of patient-specific data with <b>population-based</b> representations. The objective is to develop a systemic approach which avoids a reductionist approach and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering) or anatomical sub-system (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, etc.).|$|E
25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as {{mebendazole}} and albendazole are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These anthelminthics are administered {{in a single}} dose are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole can be given with a single dose twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a single dose. WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, pyrantel pamoate is also equally effective on ascaris. However, {{it has been reported}} that albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate are not entirely effective against T. trichiura with single oral doses in <b>population-based</b> control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Population-based</b> {{studies of}} KLS {{have not been}} performed. Its {{prevalence}} is about 1 case per million people. In France, KLS has a prevalence of 1.5 per million people. It occurs most frequently among Jews in the US and Israel. First-degree relatives {{of people who have}} suffered from the syndrome are much more likely than the general population to suffer from it, although only in about one percent of cases do family members contract it. About 70 to 90 percent of patients are male. Patients with the syndrome are more likely than the general population to have genetic disorders, and about a third of people with the syndrome encountered some form of birth difficulty. In a study of 186 older patients, about ten percent had preexisting psychiatric issues. One study found that about ten percent of patients had a neurological condition before KLS developed. The condition does not appear to occur most frequently in one season.|$|E
