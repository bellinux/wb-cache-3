2500|$|While Newton and Leibniz {{provided}} a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked {{a degree of}} rigour. Bishop Berkeley memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them [...] "ghosts of departed quantities". Calculus acquired a firmer footing {{with the development of}} limits. Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by Riemann. Although all bounded <b>piecewise</b> <b>continuous</b> functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of Fourier analysis—to which Riemann's definition does not apply, and Lebesgue formulated a different definition of integral, founded in measure theory (a subfield of real analysis). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the standard part of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the hyperreal number system.|$|E

40|$|It {{was already}} known that a p-adic, locally Lipschitz {{continuous}} semi-algebraic function is <b>piecewise</b> Lipschitz <b>continuous,</b> where the pieces {{can be taken}} semi-algebraic. We prove that if the function has locally Lipschitz constant 1, then it is also <b>piecewise</b> Lipschitz <b>continuous</b> with the same Lipschitz constant 1. We do this by proving the following fine preparation results for p-adic semi-algebraic functions in one variable. Any such function can be well approximated by a monomial with fractional exponent such that moreover the derivative of the monomial is an approximation of the derivative of the function. We also prove these results in parametrized versions and in the subanalytic setting. Comment: 12 page...|$|R
