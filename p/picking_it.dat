When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing {{to go out to}} dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E

Guru Nanak's sons would not <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up because it was dirty or menial a task.

25|$|The ball can {{be kicked}} in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of kicks used; the punt, drop kick and place kick. To punt the ball the player must kick the ball before it touches the ground. A drop kick occurs if the ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place kick the ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player kicks the ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player kicks the ball along the ground instead of diving on it or <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> up.|$|E
25|$|Child labour {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013), more than 250 million {{children}} are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013). Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton <b>picking,</b> <b>it</b> becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.|$|E

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|... "Hold Tight" [...] is a midtempo pop song, with it {{incorporating}} military drums, atmospheric keyboards, and flourishes {{of electronics}} as its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song talks about love triumphing through tough times, having {{a message of}} holding onto one another and being strong. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising its chorus and <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> as a standout track. Others named it dull and generic. The song charted in a few European territories, reaching the top 40 in Finland, Hungary, and Spain.|$|E

It was one of three series UPN ordered as mid-season replacements during the 2000-2001 television season; the others were Chains of Love and Special Unit 2. The network had requested six episodes of All Souls when <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> up for air, and all of them had been shot before its cancellation.

[...] It started appearing on best seller lists in September 2004 and became a number one New York Times best seller in March 2005, maintaining its place on the list for two years.

500|$|... "Gypsy" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. While reviewing the album, Ayala Ben-Yehuda from Billboard singled out the song as an album highlight {{and called it}} [...] "the closest thing to an acoustic song on the album". Fraser McAlpine from the BBC Chart Blog also reviewed the song positively and praised its versatility, claiming it manages to be both [...] "conservative acoustic music" [...] and [...] "radical exotic world music" [...] at the same time. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy appreciated the acoustic-instrumentation of [...] "Gypsy", noting it to be [...] "by far the most organic-sounding offering from her She Wolf LP", but he also felt that the song is not [...] "as instantly infectious as some of her classic singles". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt the song was representative of the entire album, <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> as an album highlight. [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters, however, disliked {{the concept of the}} [...] "Gypsy", saying the [...] "metaphors don't work very well" [...] on the song.|$|E

500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E
