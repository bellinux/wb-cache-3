5000|$|The Au Sable Light Station {{was built}} in 1874 on Au Sable Point, a well known hazard on Lake Superior's [...] "shipwreck coast". The Au Sable <b>Point</b> <b>reef</b> is a shallow ridge of {{sandstone}} that in places is only 6 ft below the surface and extends nearly 1 mi into Lake Superior. The Au Sable <b>Point</b> <b>reef</b> {{was one of the}} greatest dangers facing ships coasting along the south shore of Lake Superior during the early shipping days when keeping land in sight was the main navigational method. The Au Sable <b>Point</b> <b>reef</b> was known as a [...] "ship trap" [...] that ensnared many ships, including the passenger ship Lady Elgin which was stranded there in 1859.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the changes in}} abundance {{and size of the}} oysters on the major reefs in San Antonio and Espiritu Santo Bays. To study the organisms associated with oysters with special emphasis on oyster pests and predators. Procedure; Monthly oyster samples were collected from stations by dredge or tongs. All oysters were measured to the nearest centimeter. Observations and collections of associated organisms were. made at the time the oyster samples were taken. Size: Throughout the duration of this study monthly oyster samples were taken on the four major reefs in this area: Mosquito <b>Point</b> <b>Reef,</b> Josephine <b>Reef,</b> Panther <b>Point</b> <b>Reef,</b> and Chickenfoot Reef. A standard bushel sample was taken from each reef for analysis. Specimens were measured to the nearest centimeter; and from these samples the average length of the oysters in a reef population was determined (Figure: 1) [...] It will be noted in examining the graphs of Figure I that there was...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{lightship}} to {{mark the}} <b>reef</b> off <b>Point</b> Gellibrand was the former barque New Constitution which the Government purchased in October 1856 for £1050. It took up station on 25 July 1859. In May 1860, tenders were called for {{construction of a new}} lightship off Point Gellibrand. The new lightship consisted of two white lights of equal height, [...] apart, and was shown from a temporary anchor in 4.5 fathoms of water. This lightship guarded Gellibrand's <b>Point</b> <b>reef</b> from 1861 until 1895.|$|R
50|$|Race Rock Lighthouse, in Long Island Sound, 8 mi from New London, Connecticut, {{was built}} under great difficulties. The builder was Captain Scott. His {{engineer}} was F.

50|$|Perhaps in {{part because}} of the {{remoteness}} of location, scholarly use of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens did not achieve the level Farrand desired. A devastating fire on Mount Desert Island in 1947 wiped out much of Bar Harbor's tax base, and the town badly needed its few taxpayers to assist with the cost of recovery. In 1955, concerned with the survival of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens, following Bar Harbor's refusal to grant it tax-exempt status, Farrand decided that <b>Reef</b> <b>Point’s</b> future was not secure and reluctantly abandoned the project. Once the decision was made to end <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens, she swiftly took the steps to sell <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> for development. Farrand donated the contents of her library, a large collection of fine art prints, horticulture books, and design drawings to the department of Landscape Architecture at University of California, Berkeley to continue her initial goal of spreading knowledge and education concerning landscape design. Her herbarium of approximately 2000 sheets that documents exactly what plants were used and where they were planted is housed at the University & Jepson Herbaria, University of California, Berkeley.|$|R

This research presents the first subsurface data from percussion cores through the reef. Results reveal that Cleveland <b>Point</b> <b>reef</b> initiated quickly after rising seas flooded their foundations 7300 years ago. The reef remained in a "catch-up" growth mode from 7300 to 5700 years ago before reef accretion ceased. Age data suggests that the termination of the reef occurred 5700 years ago and coincided with a hypothesized lowering of sea-level and a possible change in terrigenous sediment distribution in Moreton Bay...|$|R

50|$|Following the dismantlement of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Beatrix Farrand {{joined the}} Garlands, Lewis and Amy at Garland Farm Estate in their 1800s farm house near Salisbury Cove. Lewis Garland was the former {{administrative}} gardener of <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens and Amy his wife, also a horticulturalist, {{was one of}} Farrand’s close friends. The main house at <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> was dismantled; however some fixtures, materials, and architectural elements were salvaged for reuse {{in the construction of}} Farrand's extension and addition to the Garland farmhouse. She also planted a small but interestingly laid out garden behind her addition that was maintained by the subsequent owners of the Garland property before it was acquired by the Beatrix Farrand Society. The <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> property itself was sold to Robert W. Patterson, her long-trusted architect and <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> board member. The vegetation of the estate however held a different future. Charles Kenneth Savage, local innkeeper, garden designer and board member, conceived of bold plan to rescue Farrand’s plants from the estate. With financial support, from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and other summer residents, the plants were moved and eventually supplied the material for two future gardens. Savage designed these two new gardens in Northeast Harbor (the Asticou Azalea Garden and Thuya Garden), raised funds for their creation, and supervised their construction.|$|R
50|$|The {{residence}} was shingle-style with turrets, {{and high}} gables overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Wide verandas {{from which to}} view the sea were embroidered by vines of clematis and honeysuckle while the structure itself was shielded from the strong ocean winds by red and white spruce trees. Vegetation of this property proved crucial. The continually evolving gardens interwoven by grass paths that surrounded the <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> structure were essential to creating the estate. In 1917, <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> was deeded to Beatrix by her mother. In 1935 following her mother’s death Farrand and her husband Max Farrand (1869-1945), set about turning <b>Reef</b> <b>point</b> into a horticultural study center, {{one of the most}} ambitious projects in her career. The Farrands spent their summers at <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> and together, began creating their visionary educational enterprise: <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Gardens. This property played an instrumental role in Beatrix Farrand’s life and her dedication to the estate with particular attention to the grounds was a lifelong and heartfelt endeavor. One of many projects which was undertaken at the estate was the creation of a bog garden, to illustrate how indigenous plants could be used creatively. Conversely, groupings of numerous types of azaleas demonstrated how seemingly exotic plants could survive the severe Maine climate.|$|R

25|$|In September 1860, a Milwaukee-bound steamship, the Lady Elgin, sank off {{the coast}} of the campus in stormy weather after colliding with a schooner. Despite being the second-deadliest {{accident}} on the Great Lakes, Edward Spencer '62 and other students from the Garrett Bible Institute were credited with rescuing dozens of passengers. Following a public outcry over life-saving facilities and transportation safety, in 1871, the federal government granted the University a lifeboat and later, in 1876, constructed a life-saving station, both of which were manned and operated by students, near the Grosse <b>Point</b> <b>reef</b> and lighthouse.

50|$|The Garland Farm {{property}} {{consists of}} about 5 acre of woods and fields, with a main house, greenhouse, barn, {{and a small}} shop. The main house, a Cape built c. 1800 and rebuilt in the mid-19th century, was acquired by the Garland family in the 1870s, and was the home of Lewis and Amy Garland, the superintendent and chief horticulturalist of Beatrix Farrand's <b>Reef</b> <b>Point</b> Estate. When Farrand decided in 1955 to abandon <b>Reef</b> <b>Point,</b> the Garlands took her in, building an addition onto {{the rear of the}} house, which was designed by Bar Harbor architect Robert W.
