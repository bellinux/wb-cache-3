Hydrogen solubility in Zircaloy- 4 is low and hydrides precipitate after the Zircaloy- 4 matrix becomes supersaturated with hydrogen. These hydrides embrittle the Zircaloy- 4. To study hydrogen pickup and concentration, a postirradiation nondestructive radiographic technique for measuring hydrogen concentration was developed and qualified. Experiments on hydrogen pickup were conducted in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). Ex-reactor tests were conducted to determine the conditions for which hydrogen would dissolve, migrate, and precipitate.

Centrifugally cast stainless steel (CCSS) has been one material of interest since many <b>pressurized-water</b> <b>reactors</b> (<b>PWRs)</b> use this material in the primary pressure boundary. The two-dimensional mapping of amplitude has been performed in different CCSS microstructures, and it was also of interest to extend this capability to include phase.

The evaluations focus on station blackout events that include a series of unlikely events and conditions that result in a “high-drylow” plant condition. The high-dry-low condition refers to high primary side pressure along with a dried-out steam generator that is at low pressure. Failures of hot leg piping, pressurizer surge-line piping, and the reactor vessel lead to discharge of fission products into the containment. Failure of steam generator tubes prior to the failure of one of these other components leads to discharge of some fission products into the steam generator secondary system from where they may be discharged to the environment through the pressure-relief valves. This latter sequence is potentially more risk-significant since it involves a containment bypass scenario. The relative timing of these structural failures therefore affects the event sequence and whether the containment is bypassed.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{awarded a}} {{contract}} to the consortium Duke Cogema Stone and Webster (DCS) to dispose of up to 33 tonnes of excess weap-ons-grade plutonium (WG-Pu) by irradiating it {{in the form of}} mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel in four U. S. commercial <b>pressurized-water</b> <b>reactors</b> (<b>PWRs).</b> This paper estimates the increase in risk to the public from using WG-MOX at these reactors and finds that it exceeds recently established Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidelines. Therefore, the NRC will have a technical basis for prohibiting the use of MOX at these reactors unless the risk that they will experience a severe accident can be significantly reduced. MOX fuel will displace a fraction of the low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel that these reactors currently use. Because MOX cores have greater quantities of plutonium and other actinides than LEU cores throughout the operating cycle, the source term for radiological releases caused by severe reactor accidents will be greater for MOX-fueled PWRs. In this paper, the radiological consequences to the public from containment failure or bypass accidents at MOX-fueled PWRs are calculated, and compared to those resulting from the same accidents at LEU-fueled PWRs. This paper finds that compared to LEU cores, the number of latent cancer fatali-ties (LCFs) resulting from an accident with core melt and early containment failure would be higher by 39 %, 81 % or 131 % for full WG-MOX cores, depending on the frac-tion of actinides released (0. 3 %, 1. 5 % or 6 %). Under the DCS plan, in which WG-Pu will be purified using an aqueous process and only 40 % of the core will be loaded with WG-MOX, the number of LCFs would be 11 %, 25 % or 30 % higher, respectively. The average LCF risk to individuals within ten miles of a severe accident approximately doubles for a full WG-MOX core, and increases by 26 % for a DCS core.

40|$|The {{requirements}} of ANSI/ANS 8. 1 specify that calculational methods for away-from-reactor (AFR) criticality safety analyses be validated against experimental measurements. If {{credit for the}} negative reactivity of the depleted (or spent) fuel isotopics is desired, {{it is necessary to}} benchmark computational methods against spent fuel critical configurations. This report summarizes a portion of the ongoing effort to benchmark AFR criticality analysis methods using selected critical configurations from commercial <b>pressurized-water</b> <b>reactors</b> (<b>PWR).</b> The analysis methodology selected for all calculations reported herein was the codes and data provided in the SCALE- 4 code system. The isotopic densities for the spent fuel assemblies in the critical configurations were calculated using the SAS 2 H analytical sequence of the SCALE- 4 system. The sources of data and the procedures for deriving SAS 2 H input parameters are described in detail. The SNIKR code module was used to extract the necessary isotopic densities from the SAS 2 H results and to provide the data in the format required by the SCALE criticality analysis modules. The CSASN analytical sequence in SCALE- 4 was used to perform resonance processing of the cross sections. The KENO V. a module of SCALE- 4 was used to calculate the effective multiplication factor (k{sub eff}) of each case. The SCALE- 4 27 -group burnup library containing ENDF/B-IV (actinides) and ENDF/B-V (fission products) data was used for all the calculations. This volume of the report documents the SCALE system analysis of one reactor critical configuration for North Anna Unit 1 Cycle 5. This unit and cycle were chosen for a previous analysis using a different methodology because detailed isotopics from multidimensional reactor calculations were available from the Virginia Power Company. These data permitted comparison of criticality calculations directly using the utility-calculated isotopics to those using the isotopics generated by the SCALE- 4 SAS 2 H sequence. This reactor critical benchmark has been reanalyzed using the methodology described above. The benchmark critical calculation was the beginning-of-cycle (BOC) startup at hot, zero power (HZP).

The electrically heated rod bundle was used and the ballooning shape of the rods was simulated by superimposing hollow sleeves, which have a 90 % blockage ratio. Forced reflood tests were performed to examine the transient two-phase heat transfer behavior for different reflood rates and rod powers.

The effect of the axial-burnup distribution on reactivity and proposed approaches for addressing the axial-burnup distribution are briefly reviewed.

A statistical evaluation of the k{sub eff} values associated with the profiles in the axial-burnup-profile database was performed, and the most reactive (bounding) profiles were identified as statistical outliers. The impact of these bounding profiles on k{sub eff} is quantified for a high-density burnup credit cask.

The major fissile isotopes present in LWR fuels that impact criticality safety are the nuclides, {sup 235 }U, {sup 239 }Pu, and {sup 24 l}Pu.

As the final enrichment increases, the mass, geometry, or administrative controls that must be in place to prevent nuclear criticality become more stringent. Below an enrichment of about 0. 7 %, however, criticality is no longer a concern because the infinite multiplication factor for any heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture of fuel and water, even under conditions of optimum moderation, is less than unity.
