40|$|DNA {{damage in}} the form of cyclobutane {{pyrimidine}} dimers(CPDs) and (6 - 4) photoproducts(6 - 4 PPs) induced by UV-B radiation in Arabidopsis thaliana at different temperatures was investigated using ELISA with specific monoclonal antibodies. CPDs and 64 PPs increased during 3 h UV-B exposure, but further exposure led to decreases. Contrary to the commonly accepted view that DNA damage induced by UV-B radiation is temperature-independent because of its photochemical nature, we found UV-B-induction of CPDs and 64 PPs in Arabidopsis to be slower at a low than at a high temperature. <b>Photorepair</b> of CPDs at 24 degreesC was much faster than that at 0 degreesC and 12 degreesC with 50 % CPDs removal during 1 h exposure to white light. <b>Photorepair</b> of 6 - 4 PPs at 12 degreesC was very slow as compared with that at 24 degreesC and almost no removal of 6 - 4 PPs was detected after 4 h exposure to white light at 0 degreesC. There was evidence to suggest that temperature-dependent DNA damage and <b>photorepair</b> could have important ecological implications...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in the penetration of ultraviolet radiation that has been reported lately for freshwater ecosystems in southern South America would allegedly generate alterations in ecological processes. In this respect the mortality of Parabroteas sarsi, a calanoid copepod distributed in South American lakes and ponds, was studied. Specimens were reared at two different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and subjected to 72 h exposure to artificial ultraviolet radiation. At high dissolved organic carbon concentration the mortality of P. sarsi increased at 24 h and stabilized at 48 and 72 h, whereas at low dissolved organic carbon concentration mortality increased linearly during the studied period. The results support both the description of a screen effect of dissolved organic carbon against ultraviolet radiation, and the potential <b>photorepairing</b> role of visible radiation that explains the increase of mortality in conditions of low dissolved organic carbon concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280 - 400 nm) of ten species of freshwater and marine phagotrophic protists was assessed in short-term (4 h) laboratory experiments. Changes in the motility and morphology of the cells, {{as well as}} direct quantification of DNA damage, were evaluated. The net amount of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formed after exposure of the organisms to a weighted dose (Setlow DNA normalized at 300 nm) of 1. 7 kJ m(- 2) was quantified by an immunoassay using a monoclonal specific antibody directed against thymine dimers (T >$($) over bar Ts). This is the first application of this method to aquatic protists. The results indicated that marine and freshwater heterotrophic nanoflagellates, representatives from the order Kinetoplastida (Bodo caudatus and Bodo saltans, respectively) accumulate significantly higher DNA damage than protists representatives of the orders Chrysomonadida, Cryptomonadida or Scuticociliatida. The high proportion of A:T bases in the unique kinetoplast DNA, may explain the higher accumulation of T >$($) over bar Ts found in bodonids. Experiments made with B. saltans to study the dynamics of DNA damage accumulation {{in the presence of}} UVR and <b>photorepairing</b> light, indicated that the mechanisms of DNA repair in this species are very inefficient. Furthermore, the dramatic changes observed in the cell morphology of B. saltans probably compromise its recovery. Our results show that {{sensitivity to}} UVR among aquatic phagotrophic protists is species-specific and that different cell targets are affected differently among species. While DNA damage in B. saltans was accompanied by motility reduction, altered morphology, and finally mortality, this was not observed in other bodonids {{as well as in the}} other species tested...|$|R
40|$|<b>Photorepair</b> (photoreactivation) of {{micro-organisms}} is {{an important}} issue when UV light is used for disinfection purposes. Photoreactivation is a DNA repair process that takes place when cells that have been exposed to, and damaged by, UV light are subsequently exposed to light of a longer wavelength. Although this process has been examined in a number of micro-organisms after their exposure to continuous UV light there is no information available in the literature concerning the effect neither of pulsed UV light nor on the ability of L. monocytogenes to exhibit <b>photorepair</b> after UV light damage. In order to address these issues four factors were compared in this study on L. monocytogenes these being; (i) the effect of the initial dose of pulsed UV light (4 and 6 pulses); (ii) the effect of post exposure conditions on repair/recovery (light or/and dark repair); (iii) the effect of light intensity during <b>photorepair</b> (high intensity versus low intensity light); and (iv) the influence of growth phase (exponential and stationary phase) prior to treatment. The results demonstrate that L. monocytogenes exhibits light repair if the organism is exposed to longer wavelength light following the initial damaging exposure to pulsed high intensity UV-rich light...|$|E
40|$|Two photoproducts of DNA damage, i. e. cyclobutane {{pyrimidine}} dimers (CPDs) and 6 - 4 photoproducts (6 - 4 PPs), {{induced by}} UV-B radiation in suspension-cultured tobacco cells were quantified by {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies. CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs were induced in tobacco cells by UV-B radiation. <b>Photorepair</b> of CPDs was faster than that of 6 - 4 PPs. UV-B radiation induces formation of CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs even at 0 °C, but low temperature significantly decreases the UV-B-induced (in contrast to UV-C-induced) formation of CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs. Low temperature also retarded the removal of CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs under white light, and almost no <b>photorepair</b> of CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs was detected at 0 °C. When purified DNA from tobacco cells grown in darkness was irradiated with UV-B, formation of CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs {{took place at the}} same speed at different temperatures. It indicated that formation of CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs induced by UV-B was temperature-independent in a non-cellular system.

40|$|Ultraviolet light damages genomic {{material}} by inducing {{the formation}} of covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidines. Cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) constitute the most abundant primary lesion in DNA. Photolyase, a light-activated enzyme, catalytically repairs these lesions. Although many steps in the photolyase-mediated repair process have been mapped, details of the mechanism remain cryptic. Difference FT-IR spectroscopy was employed to obtain new mechanistic information about <b>photorepair.</b> Purified oligonucleotides, containing a central diuracil, dithymidine, or cyclobutane thymidine dimer, were monitored using vibrational methods. Construction of difference infrared data between undamaged and damaged DNA permitted examination of nucleic acid changes upon formation of the CPD lesion; these experiments indicated that C=O and C-H frequencies {{can be used as}} markers for DNA damage. Furthermore, in purified photolyase containing isotopically-labeled aromatic amino acids, we observed that tryptophan residues in photolyase underwent structural changes during <b>photorepair.</b> These data indicate that electron transfer during DNA repair occurs through-bond, and that redox-active, aromatic residues form the pathway for electron transfer...|$|E
40|$|Pyrimidine dimers are {{the major}} photoproducts {{produced}} in cellular DNA upon UV irradiation. In Escherichia coli there are dark and <b>photorepair</b> mechanisms that eliminate the dimers from DNA and prevent their lethal and mutagenic effects. To determine whether these repair mechanisms act cooperatively or competitively in repairing DNA, we investigated the effects upon one another of DNA photolyase, which mediates <b>photorepair,</b> and uvrABC excision nuclease, an enzyme complex of the uvrABC gene products, which catalyzes nucleotide excision repair. We found that photolyase stimulates the removal of pyrimidine dimers but not other DNA adducts by uvrABC excision nuclease. The two subunits of uvrABC excision nuclease, the uvrA and uvrB proteins which together bind to the dimer region of DNA, {{had no effect on}} the activity of photolyase. T 4 endonuclease V, which like photolyase is specific for pyrimidine dimers, was inhibited by photolyase, suggesting that these two proteins recognize the same or similar chemical structures in UV-irradiated DNA that are different from those recognized by uvrABC excision nuclease...|$|E
40|$|Norin 1, a {{progenitor}} of many economically important Japanese rice strains, {{is highly}} {{sensitive to the}} damaging effects of UVB radiation (wavelengths 290 to 320 nm). Norin 1 seedlings are deficient in <b>photorepair</b> of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. However, the molecular origin of this deficiency was not known and, because rice photolyase genes have not been cloned and sequenced, could not be determined by examining photolyase structural genes or upstream regulatory elements for mutations. We therefore used a photoflash approach, which showed that the deficiency in <b>photorepair</b> in vivo resulted from a functionally altered photolyase. These results were confirmed by studies with extracts, which showed that the Norin 1 photolyase–dimer complex was highly thermolabile relative to the wild-type Sasanishiki photolyase. This deficiency results from a structure/function alteration of photolyase rather than of nonspecific repair, photolytic, or regulatory elements. Thus, the molecular origin of this plant DNA repair deficiency, resulting from a spontaneously occurring mutation to UV radiation sensitivity, is defective photolyase...|$|E

40|$|All {{living organisms}} have DNA and since DNA is {{essential}} to life it must be repaired when damaged. UV radiation {{is one of the}} major DNA damaging agents, which photosynthetic organisms cannot avoid. The major UV-induced DNA lesions are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6 - 4) photoproducts (6 - 4 PPs) and the main repair pathways of theses lesions involve photolyases and various excision repair systems. Photolyases require longer wavelength UV-A or blue light to induce repair. This thesis summarises a series of investigations on the effect of temperature (0 - 30 °C) on induction of UV-B induced DNA damage, the <b>photorepair</b> of those UV-lesions and on the activity of purified photolyase in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY- 2 cells and leaves, lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) leaves, and Cladonia arbuscula ssp. mitis thalli. Several studies described here show that the induction of CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs is temperature dependent, with more lesions at higher temperatures. There is variation between species with the most remarkable being that almost no induction of CPDs was detectable in lingonberry at 0 °C after 60 minutes of UV-B radiation. Greenhouse grown tobacco showed larger induction of CPDs than naturally growing lingonberry under the same temperature and light conditions. The temperature dependence of the subsequent <b>photorepair</b> in vivo was measured using two different approaches. In the first approach samples were irradiated with UV-B at a given temperature resulting in a constant amount of lesions at the start of the subsequent <b>photorepair</b> experiment under varying temperatures. In the second approach the temperature utilised for induction of damage was the same as that of the following repair, resulting in varying amount of lesions at the start of <b>photorepair.</b> More lesions were generally repaired at higher temperatures than at lower. However, the repair was more efficient at lower temperatures in lingonberry, compared to tobacco leaves. Measurements of CPD-photolyase activity in vitro from tobacco and lingonberry showed little response to temperature increases, indicating that the photochemical reaction is rate-limiting under the conditions used here. The temperature effects on induction and repair in vivo are suggested to be mainly due to effects on the interaction between DNA and other cellular components such as the nucleosomes and the transcriptional apparatus...|$|E
40|$|Cnidarians {{containing}} symbiotic microalgae often inhabit {{highly variable}} light environments where successful growth requires that, during transient (potentially stressful) periods of high light (HL), the microalgal cells invest energy in photoprotection to minimise photodamage, or allow for photodamage to occur {{and invest in}} photorepair; however, the relative contribution of photoprotection and <b>photorepair</b> remains uncharacterised. Here we determined the light dependence of Photosystem II (PSII) photoinhibition and <b>photorepair</b> in 2 phylotypes of Symbiodinium displaying different susceptibilities to thermal stress. Upon exposure to photon flux densities (PFDs) > 500 μmol photons m - 2 s - 1 the thermally 'sensitive' Strain A 1. 1 displayed higher net photoinhibition, measured as a decrease in maximum PSII efficiency (F v /F m), than the thermally 'tolerant' Strain A 1. In contrast, gross photoinhibition, assessed as the decline of F v /F m {{in the presence of}} an inhibitor of D 1 protein synthesis, was similar in the 2 strains. Therefore, <b>photorepair</b> was considered to be the key mechanism minimising net photoinhibition in Strain A 1. Consistent with this conclusion, the 2 strains displayed similar capacities for other mechanisms of avoiding photodamage, specifically, photochemical (q P) and non-photochemical (NPQ) excitation energy quenching. Measurements on Strain A 1 grown under 2 PFDs (100 and 650 μmol photons m - 2 s - 1) revealed that photoacclimation to HL involved the upregulation of q P, which minimised gross photoinhibition by maintaining PSII in a more oxidised state. We conclude that both interspecific (e. g. phylotype diversity) and intraspecific (e. g. photoacclimation state) factors affect the susceptibility of Symbiodinium to light stress. © Inter-Research 2010...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, the {{sensitivity}} of four coexisting cladoceran species to ultraviolet (UV) -B radiation was evaluated. First, the LD 50 under conditions inhibiting the action of photoenzymatic repair was calculated by exposing cladocerans to different doses of UV-B light only. Animals in another treatment group were exposed to both UV-B and visible light, which allows for photoenzymatic repair. Photoenzymatic repair contributed significantly towards the degree of total tolerance to UV-B light in all groups of cladocerans, although {{the magnitude of the}} contribution varied among species. When no photoenzymatic repair was allowed, the most tolerant species was Moina micrura, followed by Daphnia ambigua and Ceriodaphnia dubia, with Diaphanosoma chilense being the most sensitive species. Under conditions permitting the action of <b>photorepair,</b> M. micrura was again the most tolerant species to UV-B light. Ceriodaphnia dubia showed an intermediate tolerance value, whereas D. chilense and D. ambigua were the least tolerant species, with no significant differences between them.

40|$|The {{formation}} of DNA photoproducts in organisms exposed to ambient levels of UV-B radiation {{can lead to}} death and/or reduced population growth in aquatic systems. Dependence on photoenzymatic repair to reverse DNA damage caused by UV-B radiation is demonstrated for Paraphysomonas sp., {{a member of a}} widely distributed genus of heterotrophic nanoflagellates. At 20 °C, Paraphysomonas sp. was exposed to a range of UV-B intensities encountered in natural systems. Populations of the flagellate survived and grew in a dose-dependent manner, but only when simultaneously exposed to <b>photorepair</b> radiation (PRR). In contrast, flagellates exposed to UV-B at 15 °C suffered 100 % mortality except at the lowest UV-B level (with PRR) tested, which suggested a <b>photorepair</b> temperature optimum above 15 °C. After acute UV-B exposures, DNA damage (measured as the {{formation of}} pyrimidine dimers) was reduced only in organisms that underwent subsequent exposure to PRR. Populations kept in the dark after UV-B exposure maintained the initial levels of pyrimidine dimers. These results are the first to demonstrate the reliance of a heterotrophic flagellate on photoenzymatic DNA repair for survival from UV-B exposure...|$|E

40|$|The low {{survival}} of microbial pest control agents exposed to UV {{is the major}} environmental factor limiting their effectiveness. Using gene disruption we demonstrated that the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii uses photolyases to remove UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and pyrimidine (6 - 4) photoproducts [(6 - 4) PPs] from its DNA. However, this <b>photorepair</b> is insufficient to fix CPD lesions and prevent the loss of viability caused by seven hours of solar radiation. Expression of a highly efficient archaeal (Halobacterium salinarum) CPD photolyase increased <b>photorepair</b> > 30 -fold in both M. robertsii and Beauveria bassiana. Consequently, transgenic strains were much more resistant to sunlight and retained virulence against the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. In the field this will translate into much more efficient pest control over a longer time period. Conversely, our data shows that deleting native photolyase genes will strictly contain M. robertsii to areas protected from sunlight, alleviating safety concerns that transgenic hypervirulent Metarhizium spp will spread from mosquito traps or houses. The precision and malleability of the native and transgenic photolyases allows design of multiple pathogens with different strategies based on the environments in which they will be used...|$|E
40|$|DNA photolyases {{catalyze}} {{the blue}} light-dependent repair of UV light-induced damage in DNA. DNA photolyases are specific for either cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers or (6 – 4) photoproducts. PHR 2 is {{a gene that}} in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii encodes a class II DNA photolyase which catalyzes the <b>photorepair</b> of cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers. Based on amino acid sequence analysis of PHR 2, which indicates {{the presence of a}} chloroplast targeting sequence, PHR 2 was predicted to encode the chloroplast photolyase of Chlamydomonas. Using a sensitive gene-specific in vivo repair assay, we found that overexpression of PHR 2 in Chlamydomonas results in targeting of the protein to not only the chloroplast, but also to the nucleus. Overexpression of PHR 2 photolyase in a photoreactivation-deficient mutant, phr 1, results in a largely inactive product. The phr 1 mutant was found to be deficient in both <b>photorepair</b> of a chloroplast gene, rbcL, and a nuclear gene, rDNA. These results suggest that PHR 2 is the structural gene for the photolyase targeted to both the chloroplast and the nucleus, and that the PHR 1 gene product is necessary for full activity of PHR 2 protein. To our knowledge, the requirement for a second gene for full activity of a DNA photolyase is novel...|$|E

It was detected in backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare (UV resistant) and the indica variety Kasalath (UV sensitive). Plants homozygous for the Nipponbare allele at the qUVR- 10 locus were more resistant to UVB compared with the Kasalath allele. High-resolution mapping using 1850 F 2 plants enabled us to delimit qUVR- 10 to a < 27 -kb genomic region. We identified a gene encoding the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase in this region. Activity of CPD <b>photorepair</b> in Nipponbare was {{higher than that of}} Kasalath and nearly isogenic with qUVR- 10 [NIL(qUVR- 10) ], suggesting that the CPD photolyase of Kasalath was defective. We introduced a genomic fragment containing the CPD photolyase gene of Nipponbare to NIL(qUVR- 10). Transgenic plants showed the same level of resistance as Nipponbare did, indicating that the qUVR- 10 encoded the CPD photolyase. Comparison of the qUVR- 10 sequence in the Nipponbare and Kasalath alleles revealed one probable candidate for the functional nucleotide polymorphism. It was indicated that single-base substitution in the CPD photolyase gene caused the alteration of activity of CPD <b>photorepair</b> and UVB resistance.

Four redox states of FAD are relevant for the various functions of PLs and CRYs: fully reduced FADH(-) (required for DNA <b>photorepair),</b> fully oxidized FADox (blue-light-absorbing dark state of CRYs), and the two semireduced radical states FAD(. -) and FADH(.) formed in ET reactions. The PL of Escherichia coli (EcPL) has been studied {{for a long time}} and is often used as a reference system; however, EcPL containing FADox has so far not been investigated on all relevant timescales.

40|$|Publicación ISIThis work {{reports on}} the {{significance}} of UV-B absorbing compounds and DNA <b>photorepair</b> in protecting bean plants from UV-B radiation under nitrogen restriction. Bean plants grown in sterile vermiculite and irrigated periodically with a nutrient solution containing 12 or 1 mM of nitrate were irradiated with 22 mu W cm(- 2) of UV-B, 4 h daily during 10 days after the first trifoliate leaf was developed. This intensity was equivalent to 3. 2 kJ m(- 2) per day, approximately. PAR fluence rate was 350 +/- 50 mu mol quanta m(- 2) s(- 1). Control plants did not receive UV-B irradiation. Leaf expansion was negatively affected by both nitrate restriction and UV-B irradiation. This decrease was paralleled by {{a significant increase in}} starch, which was exacerbated by the combined action of both factors. Combined action of low nitrogen and UV-B also negatively affected the CO 2 assimilation rate and the stomatal conductance. Formation of UV-B absorbing compounds was significantly increased by both UV-B irradiation and nitrogen restriction and this increase was exacerbated by the combination of both factors. No significant increase in dimer formation was detected in irradiated plants at the UV-B dose used. Significant dimer formation was only obtained by using very high UV-B intensities. This suggests that under an irradiation level of 22 mu W cm(- 2) of UV-B, which is close to natural conditions, protective mechanisms such as pigment screening and DNA <b>photorepair</b> were probably sufficient to prevent any dimer formation in leaves.

An endonuclease {{sensitive site}} (ESS) assay {{was used to}} determine the number of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in the genomic DNA of E. coli, while a conventional cultivation assay was used to investigate the colony-forming ability (CFA) of E. coli. In photoreactivation experiments, more than 80 % of the pyrimidine dimers induced by LP or MPF UV irradiation were repaired, while almost no repair of dimers was observed after MP UV exposure. The CFA ratios of E. coli recovered so that they were equivalent to 0. 9 -, 2. 3 -, and 1. 7 -log inactivation after 3 -log inactivation by LP, MP, and MPF UV irradiation, respectively. <b>Photorepair</b> treatment of DNA in vitro suggested that among the MP UV emissions, wavelengths of 220 to 300 nm reduced the subsequent <b>photorepair</b> of ESS, possibly by causing a disorder in endogenous photolyase, an enzyme specific for photoreactivation. On the other hand, the MP UV irradiation at wavelengths between 300 and 580 nm was observed {{to play an important role}} in reducing the subsequent recovery of CFA by inducing damage other than damage to pyrimidine dimers.

Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, a unicellular cyanobacterium which utilizes a plant-like photosynthetic apparatus, was the model organism in a search for regulators of photosynthesis genes. Cyanobacteria share with plants and algea the need to regulate expression of photosynthesis genes. This regulatory control has similarity to known cyanobacterial molecular mechanisms. These relationships were exploited in this study in an attempt to identify sequences encoding regulators of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria have well characterized genetic tools which would allow for further dissection of the regulation if a gene were isolated. It was this desire that motivated the identification and inactivation of a response regulator gene. As determined by the genetic interruption, the cloned response regulator srrB, is not involved in the transcriptional induction of the psbAII gene encoding the photosystem 11 reaction center protein DI under high-light conditions. No phenotype is known for srrB. A publication describing an Arabidopsis thaliana, blue-light photoreceptor which is encoded by a gene that has high-similarity to a class of cyanobacterial genes encoding blue-light activated DNA repair enzymes, motivated a search for a sequence related to the blue-light <b>photorepair</b> gene in Synechococcus PCC 7942 that might encode a photoreceptor.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies on}} {{biological}} systems like nucleic acid and protein {{have been widely}} developed in the past 50 years {{and will continue to}} be a topic of interest in forefronts of natural science. In addition to experimental science, computational modeling can give useful information and help us to understand biochemical issues at molecular, atomic and even electronic levels. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the hereditary basis of life’s genetic identity, has always been major topic of discussions since its structure was built in 1953. However, harmful UV radiation from sunlight can make damage to DNA molecules and eventually give rise to DNA damaging biological consequences, like mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and cell death. Photostability, photodamage, and <b>photorepair</b> are of vital importance in the photophysics and photochemistry of DNA. In this thesis, we have applied high level computer-aided theoretical methods to explore the underlying mechanisms for these three critical issues of DNA. Special attentions are paid to the following aspects: the properties of the excited states, the design of relevant computational models and the effects of biological environments. We have systematically studied the excited state properties of DNA from single base to base pair and oligonucleotides, where the concerted base pairing and base stacking effects was found to play important roles in DNA photostability. The UV-light induced isomerization mechanism between two photoproducts of DNA photodamage has been revealed in different biological environments. In association with DNA photodamage, the related <b>photorepair</b> processes have been proposed for different lesions in photolyase which is a catalytic enzyme for DNA, and the calculated results well explained the experimental observations. In particular, the internal and external properties of flavin cofactors have been extensively studied by combining the electronic structure and spectroscopic calculations. We have examined the effects of the intramolecular hydrogen bond on spectroscopic properties of flavins. The good agreements with the experimental spectra indicated that the biological self-regulation acted critical role in these biological systems. QC 2011053...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This review {{summarizes}} the early effects and responses of low doses of UV-B {{at the molecular}} level. {{in the case of}} four bean cultivars from Romania. The DNA molecules of the plant cells are damaged by UV due to the formation of different photoproducts. such as cyclobutane- pyrimidine dimers. (CPDs). which in turn can be combated by specialized photoreactivating enzyme systems. The investigation were done by using ELISA with specific monoclonal antibodies. CPDs formation increased during UV-B exposure. and <b>photorepair</b> led to descrease. The choice of Phaseolus vulgaris as biological material for investigations. {{can be explained by the}} importance of seeds and legumes in humans nutrition. being considered since centuries the poor peoples “meat” because of the increased level of high quality proteins. and the high energetically level. and due to the importance in soil amelioration. being used as very good previous culture plant for many other species...|$|E
40|$|An action {{spectrum}} was measured for ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced damage to (inhibition of) phytochrome-induced anthocyanin formation in cotyledons of 40 -hour-old Sinapis alba L. seedlings. The {{action spectrum}} showed maximum effectiveness in the 260 to 280 nanometer waveband with little effect above 295 nanometers. The damaging effect of UV could be photorepaired by subsequent exposure to sunlight or to long wavelength (360 nanometers) UV radiation. Because {{this form of}} damage is subject to <b>photorepair</b> (photoreactivation), it is {{probably due to the}} formation of pyrimidine dimers, and the results suggest {{that it would not be}} ecologically relevant even if there was an increase in solar UV due to a decrease in stratospheric ozone levels of about 30 %. If a dark period of more than 1 hour is interspersed between the phytochrome induction and the UV irradiation, the inhibition of the phytochrome induction gradually decreases with increasing dark period...|$|E
40|$|Photobacterium profundum is a {{cosmopolitan}} marine bacterium capable of growth at low temperature and high hydrostatic pressure. Multiple strains of P. profundum have been isolated from different {{depths of the}} ocean and display remarkable differences in their physiological responses to pressure. The genome sequence of the deep-sea piezopsychrophilic strain Photobacterium profundum SS 9 has provided some clues regarding the genetic features required for growth in the deep sea. The sequenced genome of Photobacterium profundum strain 3 TCK, a non-piezophilic strain isolated from a shallow-water environment, is now available and its analysis expands the identification of unique genomic features that correlate to environmental differences and define the Hutchinsonian niche of each strain. These differences range from variations in gene content to specific gene sequences under positive selection. Genome plasticity between Photobacterium bathytypes was investigated when strain 3 TCK-specific genes involved in <b>photorepair</b> were introduced to SS 9, demonstrating that horizontal gene transfer can provide a mechanism for rapid colonisation of new environments...|$|E
40|$|Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow) embryos {{were used}} to show a {{correlation}} between induction of pyrimidine dimers in DNA and embryo death. Embryo killing was measured {{by a lack of}} heart-beat and blood circulation at 48 h post-ultraviolet radiation (UVR). When the embryos were exposed to various doses of UVR from a FS- 40 sunlamp followed by exposure to photoreactivating light (PRL) (320 - 400 nm), the number of pyrimidine dimers decreased significantly. The <b>photorepair</b> of dimers was accompanied by a substantial increase in embryo survival. When embryo killing was examined {{as a function of the}} number of dimers present, dimers were identified as a major lesion involved in UVR-induced killing in these fish embryos. This in vivo study on photoreactivation treatment of fish embryos shows a direct association between UVR-induced pyrimidine dimers and embryo killing. In addition, when embryos were held in the dark for 9 h after UVR, 50 % of the dimers were removed by excision repair...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} of Vibrio cholerae genome revealed three genes {{belonging to the}} photolyase/cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptor family. The proteins encoded by the three genes were purified and characterized. All three proteins contain folate and flavin cofactors and have absorption peaks {{in the range of}} 350 - 500 nm. Only one of the three, VcPhr, is a photolyase specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. The other two are cryptochromes and were designated VcCry 1 and VcCry 2, respectively. Mutation of phr abolishes photoreactivation of UV-induced killing, whereas mutations in cry 1 and cry 2 do not affect <b>photorepair</b> activity. VcCry 1 exhibits some unique features. Of all cryptochromes characterized to date, it {{is the only one that}} contains stoichiometric amounts of both chromophores and retains its flavin cofactor in the two-electron reduced FADH 2 form. In addition, VcCry 1 exhibits RNA binding activity and copurifies with an RNA of 60 - 70 nucleotides in length...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{in sunlight}} damages DNA in plants, but little is understood about the types, lesion capacity, and coordination of repair pathways. We challenged intact alfalfa seedlings with UV doses that induced different initial levels of cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers and measured repair by excision and photoreactivation. By using alkaline gel electrophoresis of nonradioactive DNAs {{treated with a}} cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimer-specific UV endonuclease, we quantitated ethidium-stained DNA by electronic imaging and calculated lesion frequencies from the number average molecular lengths. At low initial dimer frequencies (less than ~ 30 dimers per million bases), the seedlings used only photoreactivation to repair dimers; excision repair was not significant. At higher damage levels, both excision and <b>photorepair</b> contributed significantly. This strategy would allow plants with low damage levels to use error-free repair requiring only an external light energy source, whereas seedlings subjected to higher damage frequencies could call on additional repair processes requiring cellular energy. Characterization of repair in plants thus requires an investigation {{of a range of}} conditions, including the level of initial damage...|$|E
40|$|Photolyases are DNA repair {{enzymes that}} use energy from blue light to repair {{pyrimidine}} dimers. We report {{the isolation of}} an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (uvr 2 - 1) that is defective in <b>photorepair</b> of cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers (CPDs). Whereas uvr 2 - 1 is indistinguishable from wild type {{in the absence of}} UV light, low UV-B levels inhibit growth and cause leaf necrosis. uvr 2 - 1 is more sensitive to UV-B than wild type when placed under white light after UV-B treatment. In contrast, recovery in darkness or in light lacking photoreactivating blue light results in equal injury in uvr 2 - 1 and wild type. The uvr 2 - 1 mutant is unable to remove CPDs in vivo, and plant extracts lack detectable photolyase activity. This recessive mutation segregates as a single gene located near the top of chromosome 1, and is a structural gene mutation in the type II CPD photolyase PHR 1. This mutant provides evidence that CPD photolyase is required for plant survival in the presence of UV-B light...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} step in predicting the effects of future increases in UV radiation (UVR) is to evaluate the mechanisms that organisms use to prevent and repair DNA damage and de-termine how those mechanisms influence UVR sensitivity. Damage is prevented to varying degrees through photo-protection and repaired via two main pathways: nucleotide excision repair and photoenzymatic repair. At present, {{little is known about}} the generality or similarity of these defenses among temperate freshwater fishes. We used laboratory ex-periments to compare UVR defense mechanisms among five freshwater fish species representing four families and three orders. Purified DNA, freeze-killed larvae and live larvae were exposed to UVB radiation for 12 h in the presence or absence of <b>photorepair</b> radiation. After exposure, we quantified fre-quencies of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in each exposure treatment. All five species used photoprotection and pro-portional decreases in dimer frequency were similar for all species. Evidence of excision repair was also found for all species but proportional decreases in photoproduct frequen-cies varied among species. Finally, evidence of photoenzymatic repair was found for only two of the five species...|$|E
