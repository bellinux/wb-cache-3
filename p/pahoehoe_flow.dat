Called pāhoehoe flows, these areas of surface-moving lava cool, forming either a smooth or rough, ropy surface. The lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source. At this point, the subsurface lava is still hot enough to break out at a point, and from this point the lava begins as a new [...] "source".

50|$|The lava emitted in eruptions at the Tseax Cone is fluid. Its lavas {{are made}} of basalt, a common grey to black or dark brown {{extrusive}} volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic) that is usually fine-grained due to rapid cooling of lava on the Earth's surface. Pāhoehoe is found at the volcano, which has a smooth, billowy, undulating, or ropy surface. A <b>pāhoehoe</b> <b>flow</b> typically advances {{as a series of}} small lodes and toes that continually break out from a cooled crust. It also forms lava tubes where the minimal heat loss maintains low viscosity. However, there is also basaltic lava at the volcano characterized by a rough or rubbly surface composed of clinker called ʻaʻā. The clinkery surface covers a massive dense core, which is the most active part of the flow. As pasty lava in the core travels downslope, the clinkers are carried along at the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Flows from Hawaiian eruptions can {{be divided}} into two types by their {{structural}} characteristics: pāhoehoe lava which is relatively smooth and flows with a ropey texture, and aa flows which are denser, more viscous (and thus slower moving) and blockier (see [...] and [...] ). These lava flows can be anywhere between 2 and 20 m thick. Aa lava flows move through pressure - the partially solidified front of the flow steepens due to the mass of flowing lava behind it until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. Though the top of the flow quickly cools down, the molten underbelly of the flow is buffered by the solidifying rock above it, and by this mechanism aa flows can sustain movement for long periods of time. Pāhoehoe flows, in contrast, move in more conventional sheets, or by the advancement of lava [...] "toes" [...] in snaking lava columns. Increasing viscosity {{on the part of the}} lava or shear stress on the part of local topography can morph a <b>pāhoehoe</b> <b>flow</b> into an a'a one, but the reverse never occurs.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} pāhoehoe emplacement {{is necessary for}} developing accurate models of flow field development, assessing hazards, and interpreting the significance of lava morphology on Earth and other planetary surfaces. Active pāhoehoe lobes on Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai'i, were examined on 21 – 26 February 2006 using oblique time series stereo-photogrammetry and {{differential global positioning system}} measurements. During this time, the local discharge rate for peripheral lava lobes was generally constant at 0. 0061 ± 0. 0019 m 3 /s, but the areal coverage rate of the lobes exhibited a periodic increase every 4. 13 ± 0. 64 min. This periodicity is attributed to the time required for the pressure within the liquid lava core to exceed the cooling-induced strength of its margins. The <b>pāhoehoe</b> <b>flow</b> advanced through a series of down-slope and cross-slope breakouts, which began as ∼ 0. 2 -m-thick units (i. e., toes) that coalesced and inflated to become approximately meter-thick lobes. The lobes were thickest above the lowest points of the initial topography and above shallow to reverse-facing slopes, defined relative to the local flow direction. The flow path was typically controlled by high-standing topography, with the zone directly adjacent to the final lobe margin having an average relief that was a few centimeters higher than the lava-inundated region. This suggests that toe-scale topography can, at least temporarily, exert strong controls on <b>pāhoehoe</b> <b>flow</b> paths by impeding the lateral spreading of the lobe. Observed cycles of enhanced areal spreading and inflated lobe morphology are also explored using a model that considers the statistical likelihood of sequential breakouts from active flow margins and the effects of topographic barriers...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} topographic and textural units were discerned on SIR-B radar {{images of the}} Kilauea/Kau Desert area. The SIR-B enhanced large-scale topographic features, such as the Kahuku Pali and the Koae Faults (both oriented towards the radar antenna), while it was unable to detect features facing away from the radar antenna such as the Hilina and Kaoiki Pali. Textural units which were identified on the SIR-B images include aa flows of various ages, and several pyroclastic units. The extreme surface roughness of aa flows produced high radar returns on both the 28 deg and 48 deg SIR-B data sets. In contrast, <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>flows</b> produced smooth, low return units which were difficult to distinguish from surrounding radar-dark materials. It is suggested that multilook direction data, acquired at steeper incidence angles during a reflight of SIR-B, may aid in the further identification of <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>flows</b> and subtle topographic features...|$|R
40|$|Two {{bodies in}} the Solar System exhibit {{high-temperature}} active volcanism: Earth and Io. While there are important differences in the eruptions on Earth and Io, in low-spatial-resolution data (corresponding to the bulk of available and foreseeable data of Io), similar styles of effusive and explosive volcanism yield similar thermal flux densities. For example, a square metre of an active <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>flow</b> on Io looks very similar to a square metre of an active <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>flow</b> on Earth. If, from observed thermal emission {{as a function of}} wavelength and change in thermal emission with time, the eruption style of an ionian volcano can be constrained, estimates of volumetric fluxes can be made and compared with terrestrial volcanoes using techniques derived for analysing terrestrial remotely-sensed data. In this way we find that ionian volcanoes fundamentally differ from their terrestrial counterparts only in areal extent, with Io volcanoes covering larger areas, with higher volumetric flux. Io outbursts eruptions have enormous implied volumetric fluxes, and may scale with terrestrial flood basalt eruptions. Even with the low-spatial resolution data available it is possible to sometimes constrain and classify eruption style both on Io and Earth from the integrated thermal emission spectrum. Plotting 2 and 5 m fluxes reveals the evolution of individual eruptions of different styles, as well as the relative intensity of eruptions, allowing comparison to be made from individual eruptions on both planets. Analyses like this can be used for interpretation of low-resolution data until the next mission to the jovian system. For a number of Io volcanoes (including Pele, Prometheus, Amirani, Zamama, Culann, Tohil and Tvashtar) we do have high/moderate resolution imagery to aid determination of eruption mode from analyses based only on low spatial-resolution data...|$|E

Using portable infrared Minolta/Land Cyclops radiometers, we measured surface temperatures of flows at various distances from their sources and investigated cooling rates {{and the development of}} crust.

Thirteen spectra of a single area on a <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>flow</b> field were collected over a 59 minute period (21 : 27 - 22 : 26 HST) from which the cooling of the lava surface has been investigated.

Over a 52 -minute period (within the time interval between flow resurfacings) the lava flow crust cooled by 358 to 410 C at a rate that was as high as 15 C/min.
