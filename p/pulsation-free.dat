Pulsation can be avoided if at least four pumping chambers are arranged in a line and when actuated by a specially developed flow schedule. Our findings show that it is possible to build a <b>pulsation-free</b> linear peristaltic pump. A prototype shows a remaining pulsation of only 11 % of the mean flow rate. But this pulsation can be further reduced when paying attention a trade-off between manufacturing expenses and attainable flow-consistency...|$|E
40|$|System {{reliability}} {{of a central}} supply system installed {{in the frame of}} the JESSI project 'MEGACLEAN' to provide 12 wafer photodeveloping stands with developing solution (tetramethylammonium hydroxide and surface active agent) has been studied over an operation period of 21 months. Particle concentration measurements by laser interferometer demonstrated that a particle (#>=# 0. 3 #mu#m) concentration of < 10 /ml can be maintained. In order to reduce the particle concentration to < 5 /ml, the applied membrane pumps have to be substituted by <b>pulsation-free</b> pumps. A meantime-between-failure value as good as 980 h was achieved. While operation costs are relatively low, the capital expenditure still has to be reduced.

40|$|A {{packed-bed}} electroosmotic pump (EOP) {{was constructed}} and evaluated. The EOP {{consisted of three}} capillary columns packed in parallel, a gas-releasing device, Pt electrodes and a high-voltage power supply. The EOP could generate output pressure above 5. 0 MPa and constant flow rate {{in the range of}} nl/min to a few mul/min for pure water, pure methanol, 2 mM potassium dihydrogenphosphate buffer, the buffer-methanol mixture and the pure water-methanol mixture at applied potentials less than 20 W The composition of solvent before/after pumping was quantitatively determined by using a gas chromatograph equipped with both flame ionization detector and thermal conductivity detector. It was found that there were no apparent changes in composition and relative concentrations after pumping process for a methanol-ethanol-acetonitrile mixture and a methanol-water mixture. Theoretical aspect of the EOP was discussed in detail. An capillary HPLC system consisting of the EOP, an injection valve, a 15 cm x 320 mum i. d., 5 mum Spherigel C(18) stainless steel analytical column, and an on-column UV detector was connected to evaluate the performance of the EOP. A comparative study was also carried out with a mechanical capillary HPLC pump on the same system. The results demonstrated that the reproducibility of flow rate and the <b>pulsation-free</b> flow property of the EOP are superior to that of mechanical pump in capillary HPLC application.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 This paper {{describes}} a unique pumping concept {{based on a}} noncontact mechanism operating solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag. The first section focuses on the pumping technology itself, describing how the pump mechanism operates, while the second section examines how the pump functions in problem applications, such as handling abrasive, viscous, high solids, air-entrained, and shear sensitive fluids. The next section describes the pump operating and design characteristics, including information on the pump?s NPSH requirement and other standard pump performance data. The final section {{describes a}}nd end-user?s experience with the disc pump in an oil refinery application. The disc pump system operates solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag, two phenomena well-known in fluid engineering. Although superficially the disc pump looks like a centrifugal unit, it has no impeller in the traditional sense, and uses instead a series of parallel, rotating discs, referred to in this paper as the ?disc assembly,? to generate the energy necessary to move product. The key difference between the disc assembly and a standard centrifugal pump impeller is that, with the disc assembly, the pumpage does not impinge on the rotating pump mechanism, so that it generates a <b>pulsation-free,</b> laminar flow pattern through the pump. The disc pump can operate effectively in hard-to-pump applications because it lacks an ?impingement? device, which results in minimal contact between the pump and pumpage...|$|E
