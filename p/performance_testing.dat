5|$|On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars {{intended}} for Harrisburg service completed their <b>performance</b> <b>testing.</b> Penn Central {{refused to accept}} the cars, citing numerous technical issues with the cars and their general unsuitability for the service. They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York - Washington service. They were moved back to the Budd plant for modifications in April. In July, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF re-formed No.2 Operational Training Unit (No.2 OTU) in March 1952 {{to convert}} RAAF pilots to jet {{aircraft}} and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at Williamtown, No.2 OTU was initially equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deHavilland Vampire jets. Cresswell assumed command on 21May 1953. He established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight in November, {{to prepare for}} the introduction into service of Australian-built CAC Sabres. As well as <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> the flight was responsible for teaching air-to-air combat techniques, to fill a capability void caused by the departure of many veteran fighter pilots of World WarII, and the RAAF's operational focus on ground attack rather than air combat in Korea. To facilitate the training, Cresswell and another pilot developed the RAAF's fighter combat instructor course, which has continued to be administered at Williamtown by No.2 OTU's successor formation, No.2 Operational Conversion Unit.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday sessions were held in dry and cloudy conditions, becoming damp during the day, resulting in the track surface becoming slippery. Michael Schumacher set the first session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 43.532 seconds, almost six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello was just off Häkkinen's pace with Coulthard setting the fourth fastest time. Frentzen and BAR driver Ricardo Zonta followed in fifth and sixth positions respectively. Fisichella, Mika Salo, Ralf Schumacher and Herbert completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Williams driver Jenson Button crashed into the pit lane {{at the end of}} the barriers and lost his front wing. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher did not manage to improve his lap time but was still quickest. Frentzen was running quicker and was second fastest. The two McLaren drivers were running slower—Häkkinen in third and Coulthard fifth–although both drivers were undertaking race set-up and brake <b>performance</b> <b>testing.</b> They were separated by Barrichello. Trulli was sixth fastest, ahead of Zonta. Villeneuve, Fisichella and Salo followed in the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{moved to}} rectify the {{situation}} by re-forming No.2OTU on 1March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deHavilland Vampire jets. Cresswell took command of No.2 OTU on 21May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No.2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight. The flight was responsible for <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> and developing combat flying techniques, {{in concert with the}} Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. Training courses on the Sabre began on 1January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No.3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.|$|E

The 20mm cannon was essentially a three barrel version of the M61 Vulcan 6-barrel 20mm cannon. The aircraft could carry a variety of ordnance including forward firing gun pods, 500- and 250-pound bombs, napalm units, cluster bomb units, flares, rockets, smoke grenades and propaganda leaflet dispensers.
