One {{of the location}} in this condition {{is the site of}} bridge Tambakboyo construction, where the 11 meters connection way (oprit) of the bridge collapsed even though has used geotextile and cerucuk bamboo. And abutment structure of Tambakboyo bridge with pile foundation became tilt and was found cavities in the girder beam and head of abutment about 20 centimeters and soil degradation of bridges oprit about ± 3, 25 meters. This Final Project contains about manual calculation of bearing capacity and soil degradation of Bridges oprit that happened in the location and also contains about the calculation using Plaxis program. The alternative solution using Plaxis program is to change the abutment structure from using pile foundation to bore pile foundation.

The <b>piles</b> with 12 <b>meters</b> (m) length and 0. 17 x 0. 17 square meter (m 2) cross section were instrumented with strain gauges, in order to know the load transfer in depth. Three tests performed in a slow maintained load way were conducted in a natural condition of moisture content soil. A fourth test was carried out after the previous soaking of the soil around the pile head. The tests were performed in the experimental research site at the Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho (Unesp).

40|$|Submarine felsic volcanoes are {{dominated}} by hyaloclastic <b>piles</b> hundreds of <b>meters</b> thick, the origin of which, {{in terms of how}} and when they form, is far from being completely understood. Here we present a study of the thermal remanent magnetization of the Miocene high- K dacitic El Barronal hyaloclastites (Cabo de Gata, Spain), showing that their formation is dominated by in situ fragmentation with small or negligible transportation and/or rotation of different clasts after their formation. Data indicate that fragmentation progressed down to 210 – 390 °C, well below the glass-transition temperature estimated at 560 – 750 ºC depending on the water content of the high-K dacite. Hence, hyaloclastite fragmentation in thick lavas may occur over most of the cooling history, {{as a result of the}} progressive access of sea water toward the lava interior by development of a complex network of contraction fractures...|$|R
40|$|Pretensioned {{high-strength}} concrete (PHC) pipe piles {{have been}} widely used for geotechnical engineering such as foundation engineering, slope engineering, highway engineering. To study the performance of a PHC pipe pile under hydraulic jacking, the monitoring of the strain profile along the PHC pipe pile under hydraulic jacking was carried out using FBG sensing technology. In this study, a PHC pipe pile was instrumented with two series of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors along pile axial direction and was then installed in the field using a hydraulic jacking method. To monitor the variation of strains along a PHC pile, two series of eight FBG strain sensors with different peak wavelengths were mounted {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>pile</b> with one <b>meter</b> spacing. In addition, based on the pile theory, both the axial force of the pile and average shear stress on the pile surface are calculated using the measured axial strains. It is found that there were significant residual strains in the piles after installation when hydraulic force was removed. This study confirms that the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are suitable for monitoring strain distribution along a pile under hydraulic jacking.

It {{has been used to}} connect the western part of Lorestan (Tarhan) to the east, and then on to Khoozestan province and Taysafun, the capital city of the Sassanian. The bridge is 312 meters long and 10.75 meters high. It has 28 arches and 27 piles. The area of each pile is 61 square meters, and the distance between the two <b>piles</b> is 7.5 <b>meters.</b> Five of its arches are intact; the others have been destroyed by natural factors. The arches of the bridge are made {{in the form of a}} wishbone. The piles and breakwaters of the bridge are in the form of six lateral lozenges made of stone. Probably the bridge also was used to distribute water. Materials of the bridge are river stones and stone chips in the arches and truncated stones in the piles. The bridge floor is paved in red block stones that have lost their square shape due to erosion. This attractive, huge bridge belongs to Sassanian era, and it is registered as number 1058 in the list of Iranian national monuments.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, the {{mechanical}} modeling and the numerical simulation of {{a pile of}} thin sheets under compressive and in-plane forces is presented. These sheets are not glued or laminated, but interact through frictional contact only. In applications, as for example {{the core of a}} large power transformer, such piles may consist of thousands of sheets, which are of thickness below one millimeter, while the dimensions of the <b>pile</b> reaches several <b>meters.</b> Also, several <b>piles</b> may interact by a frictional connection. Such connections are realized by regions where sheets from both stacks overlap mutually. Simulations using a properly meshed original geometry and standard finite element models lead to billions of unknowns for industrial applications. Additionally, the system is highly nonlin- ear due to the heavily coupled contact conditions posed on thousands of inter-faces. Simulations become extremely expensive in terms of both memory and computation time, if not even unsolvable due to numerical convergence prob- lems. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a macroscopic material model, which can be applied to an equivalent homogenized computational domain represent-ing the interconnected sheet piles. An extension of the material law in regions of mutual overlapping due to frictional connections is provided. When using the present approach, the homogenized computational domain can be discretized by a far smaller number of unknowns, while a good overall accuracy is retained. The numerical solution of standardized test problems is presented and verified against analytical considerations...|$|R
