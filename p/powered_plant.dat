50|$|By the 1920s most of {{the nine}} mines on the Line of Lode had their own steam powered {{electrical}} generators to power the surface and underground workings.

50|$|The sawmill {{came under}} threat when steam power was {{introduced}} at Tunadal, further south along Sweden's Baltic coast, in 1849, {{followed by an}} additional twenty steam powered sawmills in Sweden within a decade. The new steam powered sawmills were usually placed near the seaports from where the lumber was shipped, forcing the old water powered sawmills, which by necessity had been positioned at rapids a bit up the rivers, to close. The water powered sawmill at Baggböle closed in 1884, {{as one of the}} last in Sweden, when a new steam powered sawmill was opened in Holmsund, the seaport {{at the mouth of the}} Ume River. After the sawmill at Baggböle closed the facility changed hands a number of times, and there was a plan to build a pulp mill there at the end of the nineteenth century, plans that were ultimately abandoned. Instead a hydro-electric powerplant was constructed at the Baggböle Rapids in 1899, in order to provide electricity for the city of Umeå, replacing a local steam <b>powered</b> <b>plant.</b> In 1916-17 a new power plant was built at Baggböle, which supplied electricity at 40,000 volts, mainly to a pulp mill at Obbola, across the mouth of the Ume River from Holmsund, approximately 26 km from Baggböle. This power plant was eventually sold to the city of Umeå in 1947. The hydro-electric power plant at Baggböle was demolished in 1958 when a new substantially larger power plant was opened at Stornorrfors, only about 7 km up the Ume River from Baggböle.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSun is an {{unlimited}} energy source {{and it may}} be used to replace internal combustion engines in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV's). Through concentrated solar thermal energy stored in thermal batteries with phase changing materials it's possible to drive thermal engines for generating electricity on board, thus reducing the amount of electrical batteries required. Therefore, optimization through advanced control techniques is needed, provided that transformation from thermal to electrical energy has low efficiency. Optimization is achieved by means of system identification and custom parameters design and is applicable to any sun <b>powered</b> <b>plant</b> using the technology of concentrated thermal energy. The current development includes a prototype of a small campus vehicle with 60 Km range, and combines concepts of user-centred design to generate acceptance of Sun-powered systems. Moreover, excess energy generated in the vehicle is used to provide electric energy for houses. Finally, the concept of transformation from any Electric Vehicle to Sun powered Thermal-HEV is introduced...|$|E

40|$|District {{heating systems}} {{represents}} one of the ways by which the European Union is trying to reach set goals in energy efficiency and security field. These systems allow the use of different energy sources including local energy sources such as waste and biomass. This paper provides economic viability assessment of using these fuels in the district heating system. Economic evaluation is based on regression analysis from data of existing plants and on the locally dependent data. Some of parameters that are dependent of local parameters are price and available fuel quantity, therefore these values are separately modelled; biomass as a function of location of the plant while municipal waste as a function of location and the time changes in waste quantity and composition which depend of socio-economic trends and legislation. This methodology is applied on the case of district heating plants in the City of Zagreb where internal rates of return are calculated for four considered scenarios. Results indicate that waste <b>powered</b> <b>plant</b> can improve its profitability by co-combusting other local wastes while economic viability is achieved by introduction of region wide waste management system. Reducing plant capacity, based on prognosis of waste generation, showed that these plants can be competitive with biomass plants...|$|E
40|$|Steam line blowing is an {{operational}} cleaning method used to clean steam piping and reheaters prior to turbine powering for steam power plants. This paper focusses {{on the application}} and challenges associated with the steam blowing of large solar thermal collection power plants. The boiler configuration, located atop an over 400 foot tall tower, in a large solar thermal collection plant poses some challenges not associated with other steam supply methods. As {{a result of the}} flow path configurations and steam mass required for blowing the cold reheat, reheater, and hot reheat portions of the plant, attemperation is required to control temperatures in the reheater. The use of multiple flow paths and stages through the reheater also requires some additional consideration. Where in a fossil <b>powered</b> <b>plant</b> the losses through the reheater are based on the inlet vs. outlet conditions, additional vendor data is required to model the internal sections of the reheater in greater detail. Methodologies developed for fossil powered plants can be applied to large solar thermal collectors with special consideration for the unique configurations and constantly changing solar conditions associated with the plants. The smaller margins associated with these plants requires more rigorous modeling of the system components...|$|E
