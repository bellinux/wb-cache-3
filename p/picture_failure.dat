In one notable scene he appeared nude, a move which Jay Leno spent an entire segment mocking during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He mentioned on May 23, 2008, on The Tonight Show {{that he has been}} a guest 37 times, and that 34 of them were on a Friday, which happens to be the lowest watched night of television. He pleasantly joked with Jay about being a 'filler' guest. He made a similar reference in an appearance on March 15, 2010, stating he was asked to guest because of a cancellation. Jay stated that at least he was not appearing on Friday, which hosts the more well-known celebrity guests. As of December 28, 2012, Bradshaw has made 50 appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He is also a devout Christian and wrote the book Terry Bradshaw: Man of Steel with broadcaster Dave Diles. Since 2010, Bradshaw has been hosting television shows produced by United States Media Television.|$|E
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to direct {{attention}} to several curious and infrequently encountered con-ditions which may present in infancy or early childhood with a similar clinical <b>picture.</b> <b>Failure</b> to react normally to painful or noxious stimuli is the outstanding feature, and this abnormality is usually first recognized when the patient is undisturbed by an injury which obviously should be painful. As most of these conditions bear a superficial resem-blance to one another we suggest employing the general term "sensory syndrome " to describe them, and have been fortunate in being able to examine five examples. By reporting illustrative cases we propose to bring forward evidence indicating that several pathological conditions are included in this clinical picture. Congenital Indifference to Pain In the first condition, congenital indifference to pain, there is no objective neurological abnormality except that the patient, although recognizing the nature of all types of stimuli at normal thresholds, fails to evince the usual clinical manifestations associated with accepted pain-producing stimulation. Case 1. (A. C., NH 32034). -This patient is a 14 -year-old girl. Family History. -The parents are first cousins, the patient's grandmothers being sisters. There is no known neurological disease in either family. The parents and only sibling have been examined and no abnormality detected. There is no left handedness in the family. Medical and Developmental History. -The patient was born at full term after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. She developed normally during her first year, walked, and said a few words by her fourteenth month. When she was aged 10 months her parents noticed that she was inclined to chew her tongue, causing large ulcers which appeared to be painless and which eventually led to the destruction of the tip of the tongue. She was unsteady on her feet until the age of 3 years and neve...|$|E

Other people offer amazing suggestions, and no one who thinks the <b>pictures</b> <b>failures</b> quite manages to conceal his opinion. Poets are said to be fond of reading their own poems aloud, which seems amazing; but then as they read they cannot see their audience, nor guess how they are boring those sufferers. The poet, like the domestic fowl which did not scream when plucked, is [...] "too much absorbed." [...] But while his friends look at his pictures, the painter looks at their faces, and must make many sad discoveries. Like other artists, he does not care nearly so much for the praise as he is dashed and discomfited by the slightest hint of blame. It is a wonder that irascible painters do not run amuck among their own canvases and their visitors on Show Sunday. That, at least, in Mr. Browning's phrase, is [...] "how it strikes a contemporary." [...] Were the artists to yield to the promptings of their lower nature, were they to hearken to the Old Man within them, fearful massacres would occur in St. John's Wood, and Campden Hill, and round Holland House. An alarmed public and a powerless police would behold vast ladies of wealth, and maidens fair, and wild critics with eye-glasses speeding, at a furious pace, along certain roads, pursued by painters armed to the teeth with palette knives and mahlsticks.|$|R

The demonstration enables the user to view block diagrams for the various space station systems using an overview screen, and interactively choose a component and see what single or dual failure combinations can cause it to fail. It also allows the user to directly view the fault model, which {{is a collection of}} drawing and text listings accessible from a guide screen.

40|$|The Master’s thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of a narrative analysis method, {{which is trying to}} find a common structure of the story by analysing the narratives through roles and guiding forces of the story. One of the goals of my thesis was to test a method that is rarely used in social sciences in Estonia and try to give {{an overview of}} the possible usage, key points and threats of this method. The other goal of my thesis was to study how success and failure is being portrayed through stereotypes, ideologies and moral of the stories. To find the answers to the research questions and hypothesis, I took a closer look at ten narratives <b>picturing</b> success or <b>failure</b> in the scenarios of TV series “Õnne 13 ”. The method used in my research does not follow the ideas of Propp and Greimas to the detail, but is adapted to fit the research goals of the current thesis. Because of the uniqueness of the research material, which is more complex then myths or fairytales that were used in the studies by Propp and Greimas, the used method will have a bigger focus on the context and society. The changed focus is also necessary because of the goal of this research, which needs that context to detect the values, networks, motives and morals of the stories. The chosen method could be criticised for the ambiguousity in detecting the roles, but this in not an obstacle which can’t be overcome in further studies. The key results of the analysis is, that the chosen stories do not always follow the so- called fairytale narrative and this difference is especially visible in the stories <b>picturing</b> the <b>failure.</b> Also, the characters of the success stories are not always noble in their actions and motives, while the failure stories are not always completely negative. The moral messages from the stories often carry a social message, trying to give an advice or a warning about some actions, describe some ideology or show members of the social groups whose life is usually hidden from us. The discussion part of the thesis looks at the parallels between the TV series and popular narratives or characters in Estonian folk tales. This leads to a conclusion, that the stories and narratives told in every culture, bare the face of the given society. We may not like what the stories tell us, but people seldom like the truth anyway...|$|R
