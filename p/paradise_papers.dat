Based on the close study of psychoanalytic approach and Freud’s works, the main concern of the study focuses on the changes of Amory’s sexual desires in different phases of his life. Due {{to the loss of}} an idealized father figure, Amory strives to become a substitute father himself and falls into sexual illusion with different women.

2500|$|The Masters Apprentices (or The Masters to fans) were an Australian pop/rock band fronted by Jim Keays on lead vocals, which {{formed in}} 1965 in Adelaide, South Australia, {{relocated}} to Melbourne in February 1967 {{and attempted to}} break into the United Kingdom market from 1970, before disbanding in 1972.

40|$|The {{story of}} Joseph (in the Bible), Yusuf (in the Quran), has {{inspired}} literatures in many languages. This paper explores how some Swahili writers and translators {{have dealt with}} this inspiration, the implications for their language use {{and the way they}} have interpreted Yusuf as a theme for their writings. After a brief introduction on the importance of the story itself and putting the focus on a major theme of the plot, the following works are discussed: the new Quran translation by Sh Ali Muhsin (1995), a short novel by Mzee Salim A. Kibao (1975), two short stories by Amur bin Nasur il-Omeiri (1894), the utenzi Qissat-il Yusuf (l 913) and Abdulrazak Gurnahś English written novel <b>Paradise</b> (1995). The <b>paper</b> concludes with the observation that in analyzing how these Swahili writers have integrated the story of Yusuf in their writings, prose as well as poetry, it becomes clear that attempts in defining what is ‘foreign’ (or ‘Oriental’) and what is ‘indigenous’ (or ‘African’) are bound to fail...|$|R

He has a BA in Vietnamese Literature from The Teachers College of Saigon, a BA in American Literature from UCLA, and a Master in Library Science, also from UCLA. He is the author of two {{collections}} of poems, <b>Paradise</b> of <b>Paper</b> Bells (Thiên Đường Chuông Giấy, 1998) and Manufacturing Poetry 99-04 (Chế Tạo Thơ Ca 99-04 2004).

Vince Gotera reviews this book in the North American Review: : [...] "An overwhelming sense of liminality pervades these poems: [...] "I walk on bridges connecting two alien shores," [...] says the poet; [...] "my country; which country, I asked." [...] Surrealism also suffuses Phan's work, as does jazz: [...] "all I love is jazz jazz jazz and lots of gasoline in my bloody abyss." [...] Phan draws from Vietnamese, French, and American literatures, mixing traditional and modern Vietnamese cultures with French literature, [...] "imbued with philosophy, with lots of experimentations": and American literature [...] "suitable to a consumer society and a pragmatic culture, with that American emphasis on results" [...] (as he told translator Linh Dinh in an interview included {{at the end of the}} book). Phan adds, [...] "an investigation into American literature would greatly benefit Vietnamese writers. It would [...] [...] improve their sense of humor." [...] All of these qualities are combined in Phan's work, as glimpsed in the book's title Night, Fish, and Charlie Parker—especially humor. Phan's poetry is a distinctly American immigrant text, melancholy and celebratory at the same time. Read this book." ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 61 - 62) John Milton was {{a morally}} austere and conscientious Calvinist who loaned his literary abilities to the Puritan cause during the English Civil War. He was an exceptionally learned controversialist, and so effective were his tracts and pamphlets {{on behalf of}} the Puritans that he won the position of Latin secretary to Oliver Cromwell. Yet some of Milton's religious beliefs conflicted with Calvinist doctrine to the point of heresy. It is the intent of this paper to demonstrate that one of Milton's unconventional beliefs [...] Arminianism [...] is the underlying theology of his masterpiece, <b>Paradise</b> Lost. The <b>paper</b> presents a history of Christian thought beginning with the early Church and the teachings of Saint Augustine and ending with the Reformed theology of John Calvin. Arminianism, the theological thinking of James Arminius, was a reaction to strict Calvinism, and {{the differences between the two}} doctrines are delineated. Milton's own theological beliefs, as expressed in his De Doctrina Christiana, are examined and their similarity to Arminianism is established. Paradise Lost is then studied in the light of Milton's religious convictions to show their importance to the poem's theme of justifying the ways of God to men, and to establish the significance of Arminianism in our understanding and appreciation of the epic...|$|R

She said that the class would change the way I viewed literature and the way I responded to it. So of course, I went to the Professor and begged her to let me into English 335, a seminar on John Milton’s <b>Paradise</b> Lost. The <b>paper</b> I have submitted is the culmination of an entire semester’s worth of research. The assignment was to write a paper surrounding an original paradox driven thesis, which is a monumental task, seeing as scholars have been analyzing the paradoxes in Milton’s epic poem for centuries. I had never written a paradox driven thesis before so I formed a vague idea in my mind (Satan as a misunderstood, romantic hero, the Byron of Heaven and Hell) and started out flying by the seat of my pants to the library and checking out all the books I could find on the subject of Satan in Paradise Lost.

2500|$|Since {{receiving}} their {{prize in}} the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds in mid-1969, The Masters Apprentices were set on {{breaking into the}} UK market. They worked to save money for the effort with a national farewell tour in April–May. On 25 May, they boarded the Fairsky for UK, their agency business {{was left in the}} hands of Adrian Barker. They were given a send-off by a crowd of fans and friends including Rofe, Sambell, Meldrum, Ross D. Wylie, Johnny Young and Ronnie Burns. The six-week ocean voyage provided a break after years of constant gigging. Without the pressure and distraction of touring, they wrote and rehearsed new material. They had a stopover in Panama, where they were 'ripped off' while they bought some local marijuana. Arriving at the height of an English summer in July, the band entered a productive period. They moved into a hotel in Bayswater, but it was too expensive, so they moved to a house in North Harrow, London, where they continued to write and rehearse, and made contact with other Aussie expatriates. Freed from constant performing, they immersed themselves in the cultural life of London, going on shopping sprees for clothes in Kings Road, Chelsea, ploughing through scores of new records and doing the rounds of clubs and concerts, seeing the best music on offer. Wheatley continued work on a manuscript he had begun on the ocean voyage, [...] "Who the Hell is Judy in Sydney?", which recounted his experiences with the group. His memoirs were too hot for publishers at the time and were not printed until decades later when they became the basis for his autobiography <b>Paper</b> <b>Paradise.</b>|$|R
