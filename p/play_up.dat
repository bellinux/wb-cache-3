5|$|Relative {{to their}} high standards, UConn {{struggled}} {{during the first}} two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that has become almost routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E

5|$|Following halftime, Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who returned it to the Tech 41-yard line. On the first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running <b>play</b> <b>up</b> the middle. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas was called for a five-yard running into the kicker penalty and Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.|$|E
5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It is probable that Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably <b>play</b> <b>up</b> the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more probable that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bevin faced state Attorney General Jack Conway, marking the first gubernatorial race {{in state history}} {{featuring}} two candidates from Louisville, the state's largest city. The Kentucky Democratic Party attempted to <b>play</b> <b>up</b> the fractures in the Republican Party over Bevin's candidacy, launching a web site featuring fellow Republicans' criticisms of Bevin, drawn mostly from his primary race against McConnell. Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} mostly {{composed}} and entirely produced by Madonna and Ahmadzaï. Both had previously collaborated on Madonna's studio album Music (2000). The recording sessions for American Life started in late 2001, then {{was put on}} hold as Madonna filmed Swept Away in Malta and starred in the West End <b>play</b> <b>Up</b> for Grabs. She returned to the Olympic Recording Studios and Sarm West Studios in late 2002 and finished off the sessions in London and Los Angeles in early 2003. For the instrumentation featured {{in some of the}} song, Ahmadzaï played the guitars, and Stuart Price played the piano. Tom Hannen and Simon Changer, both of them worked as assistant engineer during the recording.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11 attacks, Madonna {{was in an}} introspective {{mood and}} started writing songs for her next studio album, American Life, with {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta, and also starred in the West End <b>play,</b> <b>Up</b> For Grabs. In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The World Is Not Enough (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went {{to look for a}} high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for Die Another Day.|$|E

5|$|Georgia coach Herman Stegeman, in {{the section}} on Southern {{football}} in Spalding's football guide, wrote that Vanderbilt had a good year {{but was unable to}} <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to its full capabilities and the Commodores should prepare for a fine season the next year. For Stegeman, the contest for the theoretical title of greatest Southern team in 1921 was between Centre, Georgia Tech, and Georgia. Clyde Berryman retroactively listed Vanderbilt as national champion. Lynn Bomar at fullback, Pos Elam at tackle, and Thomas Ryan at end were listed on Walter Camp's list of notable players. Bomar, Elam, Ryan, Tot McCullough, Alf Sharpe, and Pink Wade all made an All-Southern team although, according to the yearbook, Tom Ryan was the only player in the group to appear on an All-Southern team.|$|E
5|$|Solanas {{moved to}} New York City in the mid-1960s, {{working as a}} writer. She met pop artist Andy Warhol {{and asked him to}} produce her <b>play,</b> <b>Up</b> Your Ass. She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing and/or stealing, {{followed}} by Warhol expressing additional indifference to her play. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, a Man, paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the SCUM Manifesto. Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in the spring of 1968.|$|E
5|$|After the Euro qualification, Buffon {{stated that}} Euro 2016 {{would be the}} final European Championship of his career, but {{expressed}} his intentions to retire only after the 2018 World Cup, which would see him <b>play</b> <b>up</b> {{to the age of}} 40. On 31 May 2016, Buffon was named the captain of Conte's 23-man Italy squad for Euro 2016. In Italy's first game of the tournament on 13 June, Buffon kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over Belgium. This was Buffon's 14th appearance at the European Championships, making him Italy's out-right most capped player of all-time in the tournament, after overtaking Maldini, Del Piero and Cassano; with his fourth tournament appearance, he also equalled Del Piero for the most UEFA European Championships played in by an Italian player. He kept another clean sheet in a 1–0 win over Sweden in Italy's second group fixture on 17 June, which allowed his nation to top the group and advance to the second round, although he was later booked in injury time for time-wasting. Due to a bout of fever, Buffon was rested in Italy's final group match on 22 June, a 1–0 defeat against the Republic of Ireland, and was replaced by deputy Salvatore Sirigu. He returned to the starting line-up for his nation's round of 16 fixture against Spain on 27 June, making a crucial injury time save on Gerard Piqué to earn his third consecutive clean sheet of the tournament, as Italy avenged their Euro 2012 final defeat with a 2–0 victory over the defending champions. After a 1–1 draw following extra time in Italy's quarter-final fixture against Germany on 2 July, Buffon saved one penalty in the resulting shoot-out, although the reigning World Cup champions would ultimately emerge victorious following a 6–5 shoot-out loss. His one on one save to deny Mario Gómez in regulation time was later nominated for the UEFA Save of the Season Award. By the end of the following month, his nominated save on Gómez finished third with 14% of the votes.|$|E
