5|$|The soil is {{moistened}} {{so it will}} compact into {{a stable}} structure when packed into woven <b>polypropylene</b> or burlap sacks or tubes. Plastic mesh is sometimes used. <b>Polypropylene</b> (pp) sacks are most common, since they are durable when covered, cheap, and widely available.|$|E
5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, <b>polypropylene,</b> polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{had become}} one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, {{on the back of the}} highly {{successful}} Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a <b>polypropylene</b> body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but in the event the planned development of the follow-up C10 and C15 electric cars never got further than the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and <b>polypropylene</b> grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E
5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of <b>polypropylene.</b>|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or <b>polypropylene.</b> Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of <b>polypropylene</b> felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene</b> {{is used in}} <b>polypropylene</b> drums.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene</b> is {{normally}} tough and flexible, especially when copolymerized with ethylene. This allows <b>polypropylene</b> {{to be used}} as an engineering plastic, competing with materials such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). <b>Polypropylene</b> is reasonably economical.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene</b> {{is widely}} used in ropes, {{distinctive}} because they are light enough to float in water. For equal mass and construction, <b>polypropylene</b> rope is similar in strength to polyester rope. <b>Polypropylene</b> costs less than most other synthetic fibers.|$|E
25|$|The {{large number}} of end-use {{applications}} for <b>polypropylene</b> are often possible because {{of the ability to}} tailor grades with specific molecular properties and additives during its manufacture. For example, antistatic additives can be added to help <b>polypropylene</b> surfaces resist dust and dirt. Many physical finishing techniques can also be used on <b>polypropylene,</b> such as machining. Surface treatments can be applied to <b>polypropylene</b> parts in order to promote adhesion of printing ink and paints.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{the global}} market for <b>polypropylene</b> was about 55 million tonnes. <b>Polypropylene</b> is the world's second-most widely {{produced}} synthetic plastic, after polyethylene.|$|E
25|$|A common {{application}} for <b>polypropylene</b> is as biaxially oriented <b>polypropylene</b> (BOPP). These BOPP sheets {{are used to}} make a wide variety of materials including clear bags. When <b>polypropylene</b> is biaxially oriented, it becomes crystal clear and serves as an excellent packaging material for artistic and retail products.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene,</b> or 'polypro', {{has been}} used for the {{fabrication}} of cold-weather base layers, such as long-sleeve shirts or long underwear. <b>Polypropylene</b> is also used in warm-weather clothing, in which it transports sweat away from the skin. More recently, polyester has replaced <b>polypropylene</b> in these applications in the U.S. military, such as in the ECWCS. Although <b>polypropylene</b> clothes are not easily flammable, they can melt, which may result in severe burns if the wearer is involved in an explosion or fire of any kind. <b>Polypropylene</b> undergarments are known for retaining body odors which are then difficult to remove. The current generation of polyester does not have this disadvantage.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increase}} in the level of performance required for <b>polypropylene</b> quality in recent years, a variety of ideas and contrivances have been integrated into the production process for <b>polypropylene.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene</b> is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of <b>polypropylene</b> depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic <b>polypropylene,</b> for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic <b>polypropylene</b> and polyethylene.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} and frequency dependencies of electrical parameters for <b>polypropylene</b> film capacitors are very low. <b>Polypropylene</b> film capacitors have a linear, {{negative temperature coefficient}} of capacitance of ±2,5 % within their temperature range. Therefore, <b>polypropylene</b> film capacitors are suitable for applications in Class 1 frequency-determining circuits, filters, oscillator circuits, audio circuits, and timers. They are also useful for compensation of inductive coils in precision filter applications, and for high-frequency applications.|$|E
25|$|When the methyl {{groups in}} a <b>polypropylene</b> chain exhibit no {{preferred}} orientation, the polymers are called atactic. Atactic <b>polypropylene</b> is an amorphous rubbery material. It can be produced commercially either with a special type of supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst or with some metallocene catalysts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene</b> {{has good}} {{resistance}} to fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commercial}} <b>polypropylene</b> is isotactic and has {{an intermediate}} level of crystallinity between that of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Isotactic & atactic <b>polypropylene</b> is soluble in P-xylene at 140°C. Isotactic precipitates when the solution is cooled to 25°C and atactic portion remains soluble in P-xylene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene</b> and {{polyolefin}} pellets are extruded {{and combined}} {{to create a}} molten polymer, which consists of a 37.5µm thick <b>polypropylene</b> sheet sandwiched between two 0.1µm polyolefin sheets, creating a thin film 37.7µm thick. This is gravity fed through a snap cooling brass mandrel, reheater, blown into a large bubble using air pressure and temperature, and collapsed {{at the base of}} the four-storey chamber into a flat sheet by convergence rollers, and the sheet is then slit. This creates the base biaxially-oriented <b>polypropylene</b> substrate of 75.4µm thickness, called ClarityC by Innovia Films.|$|E
25|$|The resin {{identification}} code used in recycling to identify <b>polypropylene.</b>|$|E
25|$|Syndiotactic <b>polypropylene</b> {{was also}} first {{synthesized}} by Natta and his coworkers.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, three {{manufacturing}} processes {{are the most}} representative ways to produce <b>polypropylene.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, a {{study showed}} that a mixture of <b>polypropylene</b> and durable superoleophobic {{surfaces}} created by two engineers from Ohio State University can repel liquids such as shampoo and oil. This technology could {{make it easier to}} remove all the liquid contents from a <b>polypropylene</b> bottles, particularly those that have high surface tension such as shampoo or oil.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random copolymer, and block copolymer. The {{comonomer}} is typically used with ethylene. Ethylene-propylene rubber or EPDM added to <b>polypropylene</b> homopolymer increases its low temperature impact strength. Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to <b>polypropylene</b> homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point {{and makes the}} polymer more transparent.|$|E
25|$|Some fashion {{designers}} have adapted <b>polypropylene</b> to construct jewelry and other wearable items.|$|E
25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from <b>polypropylene</b> because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are <b>polypropylene</b> sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to <b>polypropylene</b> of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of <b>polypropylene,</b> although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. <b>Polypropylene</b> can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of <b>polypropylene</b> or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|Finally, molded or milled <b>polypropylene</b> is used {{to create}} low-volume tooling for molded gasket applications. Instead of many {{expensive}} metal molds, low-cost plastic tooling can be formed from a single metal master, which also allows greater design flexibility. The heat transfer characteristic of <b>polypropylene</b> tooling is poor, which {{must be taken into}} consideration during the formulation process.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} in Canada asserted that quaternary ammonium biocides and oleamide were leaking out of certain <b>polypropylene</b> labware, affecting experimental results. As <b>polypropylene</b> {{is used in}} a wide number of food containers such as those for yogurt, Health Canada media spokesman Paul Duchesne said the department will be reviewing the findings to determine if steps are needed to protect consumers.|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{expansion}} of <b>polypropylene</b> is very large, but somewhat {{less than that}} of polyethylene.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, <b>polypropylene</b> was {{discovered}} by Giulio Natta and began to be manufactured in 1957.|$|E
25|$|The {{melt flow}} rate (MFR) or melt flow index (MFI) {{is a measure of}} {{molecular}} weight of <b>polypropylene.</b> The measure helps to determine how easily the molten raw material will flow during processing. <b>Polypropylene</b> with higher MFR will fill the plastic mold more easily during the injection or blow-molding production process. As the melt flow increases, however, some physical properties, like impact strength, will decrease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polypropylene,</b> highly colorfast, {{is widely}} used in {{manufacturing}} carpets, rugs and mats to be used at home.|$|E
25|$|Expanded <b>polypropylene</b> (EPP) is a foam form of <b>polypropylene.</b> EPP {{has very}} good impact {{characteristics}} {{due to its}} low stiffness; this allows EPP to resume its shape after impacts. EPP is extensively used in model aircraft and other radio controlled vehicles by hobbyists. This is mainly due to its ability to absorb impacts, making this an ideal material for RC aircraft for beginners and amateurs.|$|E
25|$|Very thin sheets (~2–20µm) of <b>polypropylene</b> {{are used}} as a {{dielectric}} within certain high-performance pulse and low-loss RF capacitors.|$|E
