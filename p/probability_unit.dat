40|$|The data {{broadcast}} {{problem is}} to find a schedule for broad-casting a given set of messages over multiple channels. The goal is to minimize the cost of the broadcast plus the expected response time to clients who periodically and probabilistically tune in to wait for particular messages. The problem models disseminating data to clients in asymmetric communication environments, where there is a much larger capacity from the information source to the clients than in the reverse direction. Examples include satellites, cable TV, internet broadcast, and mobile phones. Such en-vironments favor the "push-based" model where the server broadcasts (pushes) its information on the communication medium and multiple clients simultaneously retrieve the spe-cific information of individual interest. This sort of environment motivates the study of "broadcast disks" in Information Systems [1; 7]. In this paper we present the first polynomial-time approximation scheme for the data broadcast problem for the case when W = O(1) and each message has arbitrary <b>probability,</b> <b>unit</b> length and bounded cost.

Such models intend to contribute to a deep comprehension of the perception or recognition mechanism which permits listeners to decide whether a source of a sound is located on the right or {{on the left side of}} their medial plane. Methods Numerous lateralization judgments are accomplished through a computer controlled experiment set-up in order to investigate the transduction mechanism beneath them. The statistical treatment of the psychoacoustic data obtained has been performed by Two and Three Factors – Probit (<b>Probability</b> <b>Unit)</b> Analysis. Results The Probit Analysis makes it possible to obtain the model coefficients and to fit ‘Probit Planes and Surfaces’ to the experimental data in order to study and predict the simultaneous effects produced by ITD and IAD in the listeners’ psychoacoustic perceptions at several Sensation Levels (SL). Conclusion The approach used here is appropriate for the analysis of this kind of binary response and it also offers a simple way to obtain psychophysical responses that can be related to neurophysiological phenomena. It is argued that this fact may lead to another way to access neural information through psychoacoustic experiments, without needing invasive methods...|$|E

In this study I examined the role of collaboration, curriculum, and the classroom context in the development of pedagogical content knowledge of a mathematics teaching intern. Additionally, I investigated the nature of the collaborative process between the teaching intern and his mentor teacher as they collaborated on action (during structured planning time) and in action (while students were present). The teaching internship resided in a seventh-grade mathematics classroom during the teaching of a <b>probability</b> <b>unit</b> from a standards-based curriculum, Connected Mathematics Project. Using existing research, a conceptual framework was developed and multiple data sources (audio taped collaborations, observations of the intern's teaching practices, semi-structured interviews, and a mathematics pedagogy assessment) were analyzed {{in order to understand the}} teaching intern's development of knowledge of instructional strategies, knowledge of student understandings, curricular knowledge, and conceptions of purpose for teaching probability. Results identified numerous dilemmas related to planning and implementing instruction. Although the teaching intern developed pedagogical content knowledge, he often experienced difficulty accessing it while teaching. Through collaboration, curriculum, and the classroom context, the teaching intern learned to incorporate his pedagogical content knowledge in instruction. Analysis revealed that as he gained new knowledge he was able to shift his focus from content to the use of instructional strategies for teaching and learning. The curriculum was the primary focus of collaboration and initiated the intern's examination of the learning-to-teach process. Collaboration on action and collaboration in action proved to be essential elements in the development of pedagogical content knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Dear TOJDE Readers, Welcome to {{the volume}} 15 number: 1 of TOJDE, In this issue, 18 {{articles}} of 34 authors from 9 different {{countries around the}} world have been published. These published articles are arrived to the tojde from, bBangladesh, Brunei, Greece, India, Indonasia, Malaysia, Republic Of Korea, Turkey and USA. The 1 st article is arrived from Grecee written by Evangelos Bebetsos and Dimitrios Goulimaris from Department of Physical Education & Sports Science, Democritus University Of Thrace Komotini, Hellas, on “Personal Outcome And Leadership As Defining Factors Of Satisfaction In The Context Of The Course “Arts II: Overview Of Greek Music And Dance” of The Hellenic Open University”. The {{purpose of this study was}} twofold: to assess the construct validity of the modified greek version of the “scale of athlete satisfaction” presented by Theodorakis and Bebetsos (2003) in the broader academic research sector and specifically in the field of open and distance learning, and to examine if variables such as sex, age, marital status and prior experience, influence the levels of students’ satisfaction. Participants were 144 students (55 men and 89 women) of the Hellenic Open University who participated in the course “arts ii: review of the Greek music and dance”, between the ages of 25 up to 67 years of age (μage= 42, sd= 7. 62). The scale consists of two factors: a) personal outcome and b) leadership. Results from factor analysis provided evidence for the construct validity of the scale developed by Theodorakis and Bebetsos (2003). Additionally, results indicated differences between the age groups on the factor of “personal outcome” were the youngest age group had the lowest scores among all three and also, results indicated differences on the factor of “leadership”, were men had higher scores than women. Overall, the study underlines the necessity of adaptation and usage of such an instrument in order to inform and educate educators, teachers and students about the factors that influence the learning process in combination with personal satisfaction and leadership behavior. The 2 nd article titled as “System Expertise Training Courses In Private Sector: Can They Be Given Online?”, written by Birim Balcı Demirci, from Okan Univesity, Istanbul, Turkey. She metion in her article that widely known that there are many schools in the private sector offering courses in computer technology, computer engineering, information systems and similar disciplines in addition to universities presenting such courses. The private sector programs are extremely popular with students already studying at university as well as being of great interest to previously graduated university students. The first purpose of this study is to determine the percentage of university students who attend theses education programs. Both previously graduated and presently studying students have been included. Secondly it aims to understand the reasons behind the attendance of such courses by students who are already studying a similar curriculum or have previously studied and graduated in similar and related fields. In the light of this information, some suggestions have been made about giving these courses as online. The 3 rd article is join study which is conducted by Du Gyu Kim, from University of North Texas, Usa and Jaemu Lee, from Busan National University of Education, Republic of Korea and titled as “A Study On Improving Information Processing Abilities Based on PBL”. This article is examined an instruction method for the improvement of information processing abilities in elementary school students. Current elementary students are required to develop information processing abilities to create new knowledge for this digital age. There is, however, a shortage of instruction strategies for these information processing abilities. This research proposes a method for teaching information processing abilities based on a problem-based learning model, and was tested with elementary students. The students developed an improved ability to create new knowledge and to present relationships with information through the process of problem solving. This study performed experimental research by comparing pre- and post-tests with twenty-three fifth grade elementary students over the course of eight months. This study produced a remarkable improvement in information selection, information reliability, information classification, information analysis, information comparison, and information internalization. This study presents an improved methodology for the teaching of information processing abilities. The fourth article written on “Satisfaction Clustering Analysis of Distance Education Computer Programming Students: A Sample of Karadeniz Technical University”, written by Hacer Ozyurt, from Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey. In line with recently developing technology, distant education systems based on information technologies are started to be commonly used within higher education. Students’ satisfaction is one of the vital aspects in order to maintain distant education efficiently and achieving its goal. As a matter of the fact, previous studies proved that student satisfaction is one of the most important factors in deciding the success of a system in terms of application. Therefore, this paper analyzes satisfaction variables of distant education computer programming students regarding this program as well as their clustering tendencies. 96 students who were having their majors in distant education computer programming at karadeniz technical university during 2012 - 2013 academic term constitute the sample of the study. The study employed satisfaction scale for students of distant education based on information technologies as data collection tool which comprised of 42 items. Data obtained from the scale was analyzed via ward method, one of the hierarchical clustering methods, in order to reveal their clustering tendencies. The 5 th article is arrived from Turkey which is written on “Gifted Students’ Views About First Stage Of The Education Program For The Gifted Students’ Bridge With University (EduPGBU) ”, written by Hasan Said Tortop, Bulent Ecevit University, Zonguldak, Turkey. All over the world, studies related to design of appropriate educational programs for gifted students are continuing. It is also important that these programs should be adapted to developing educational technologies.

This study investigated the relationship between problematic internet use and levels of loneliness among 311 distance education students. “The Problematic Internet Use Scale” and “Ucla-Loneliness Scale Iii” were used to collect the data. Independent-samples t-test and one-way ANOVA were conducted to examine the differences; and correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between variables. Findings revealed that male students’ use of the internet was more problematic compared to female students’. As the time spent on the internet increased, so did the problematic internet use levels. In addition, the problematic internet use levels of students varied with regard to marital status and not varied regard to their ages. A significant relationship was found between the level of problematic internet use and loneliness, and loneliness was found to be among the predictors of problematic internet use. Implications and suggestions for further research are provided. 7 th article is from Grecee on “Study Habits And Academic Achievement Of Kashmiri & Ladakhi Adolescent Girls: A Comparative Study” written by N. A. Nadeem, Javeed Ahamd Puja and Shabir Ahmad Bhat from University Of Kashmir, j & k. India. This presented study was conducted to study the study habits and academic achievement of adolescents’ girls in Jammu and Kashmir. 400 sample subjects were selected randomly from two ethnic groups’ viz. Kashmiri and ladakhi. The investigators used Palsane & Sharma’s study habits inventory (PSSHI) to collect data from the field. Certain statistical techniques like percentage, s. D., mean and t-value were used to analyze the data. The result confirms significant mean differences were found between Kashmiri and Ladakhi adolescents on their study habits and academic achievement. The 8 th article is titled as “Academic Counselling In Odl: Information System For Capacity Building Of Academic Counselors’ in IGNOU”, written by S. Kishore, from Indira Gandhi National Open University, Tamilnadu, India. Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) is an apex body for open and distance learning (ODL) system in India. The university has nation-wide operation and pioneer in distance education. IGNOU has an hqrs, 67 regional centres and about 3400 study centres throughout India. The study centres are the academic contact point for distance learners and the university engages around 54, 000 academic counsellors for giving learner support to the heterogeneous distance learners. In IGNOU, the academic counsellors are mostly drawn from the formal higher educational system and the exposure towards ODL system therefore, is minimal. However, the academic counsellors are the pivotal link between the odl institution and isolated distance learners in IGNOU. Their role in handling face-to-face academic counseling sessions at the study centre is very important. The academic counsellors in IGNOU are drawn from the conventional system of higher education. Though, periodical training is given to them by IGNOU, it is a difficult task to train such a massive number of counsellors across the country. In fact the role of an academic counselor is multifarious and requires both tutoring and counseling. For maintaining quality in academic counseling, the accumulation of multi-dimensional skills, attributes and information is essential on the part of the counselor in ODL. Among these, possessing information at various levels about ODL system is an enabling factor to effectively support isolated distance learner. Therefore, a comprehensive information system is felt the need of the hour for the capacity building of the academic counsellors in supporting distance learners and for the quality assurance process. This work explores and builds a comprehensive information system for the academic counsellors in an ODL system, keeping IGNOU as the context. The 9 th article is conducted as a join study by from Saudi Arabia and titled as “Mobile Fatwa (M-Fatwa) : The Integration Of Islamic Fatwa Through Mobile Technology” and written by Mohd Aliff Mohd Nawi, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei and Mohd Isa Hamzah, from Faculty Of Education, Universiti Kebangsaan, Malaysia, Malaysia. This article impressed that fatwa institutions play an important role to disseminate information about the fatwa decision that has been discussed. Fatwa is decided will be a guide and reference to the Muslims for dismantling all the problems related to religious law in everyday life. The purpose of this paper to discuss the integration method fatwa information using a mobile device technology. The challenges of fatwa integration using mobile technology is also reviewed in detail to create a new prospect in explaining the current issues or problems in religion. Some recommendation to achieve this combination of two elements was also made to implement using m-fatwa through mobile technology in malaysia. The 10 th article from Turkey which is written by Omer Faruk Sozcu, from Faculty of Education Fatih University, Istanbul, on “The Relationships Between Cognitive Style of Field Dependence And Learner Variables In E-Learning Instruction”. This study examines the relationships between cognitive styles of field dependent learners with their attitudes towards e-learning (distance education) and instructional behavior in E-learning instruction. The group embedded figures test (GEFT) and the attitude survey (for students’ preferences) towards e-learning instruction as distance education was administered to 157 students enrolled in various distance education programs at Fatih University, In Turkey. The study findings indicated that students’ cognitive style of field dependence was correlated with their attitudes and preferences for students’ roles in e-learning for distance education. Other factors such as a previous background in e-learning, including gender, educational level, use of social networks, and e-learning tools, and preferences for instructional variables and assessment in distance learning processes were also used. Finally, technological, motivational, and instructional-learning variables in learner interface design (LID) for e-learning instruction were correlated with students’ learning outcomes, attitudes, perceptions and preferences in learner interface design (LID) and attitudes toward e-learning instruction. At the end of the study, research questions were tested and instructional variables for distance education were indicated in tables. The findings were then assessed to see if they supported previous research or not and considered to future expectations for distance education and learner interface design (LID) procedures with field dependence learners. 11 th article from Turkey and written on “The Classification Of The <b>Probability</b> <b>Unit</b> Ability Levels Of The Eleventh Grade Turkish Students By Cluster Analysis”, written by Ozcan Ozyurt, Ffrom Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey. In this study she metion that, the <b>probability</b> <b>unit</b> ability levels of the eleventh grade Turkish students were classified through cluster analysis. The study was carried out in a high school located in Trabzon, Turkey during the fall semester of the 2011 - 2012 academic years. A total of 84 eleventh grade students participated. Students were taught about permutation, combination, binomial expansion, and probability, which were the sub-topics of <b>probability</b> <b>unit,</b> in an individualized mathematics learning environment called Uzwebmat. After students completed the learning of each sub-topic, they were subjected to an exam about the relevant topic through Uzwebmat-Cat. Students participated in 5 separate exams (i. e. one for each sub-topic and one end-of-unit test). Data were collected via system records made up of the ability levels of students concerning each subject. The ability levels obtained from each exam were analyzed through hierarchical clustering. According to the study results, the ability levels of students gathered in two main clusters in every test: medium ability level and advanced ability level. The 12 th article is from USA written by Sabiha Yeni from Yıldız Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey and Nesrin Ozdener from Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey, on “An Analysis on Usage Preferences of Learning Objects and Learning Object Repositories Among Pre-Service Teachers”. The purpose of the study is to investigate how pre-service teachers benefit from learning objects repositories while preparing course content. Qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used in a mixed methods approach. This study was carried out with 74 teachers from the faculty of education. In the first phase of the study, pre-service teachers’ prior knowledge about learning objects was defined. During the second phase of the study, a two-hour seminar was given to pre-service teachers to introduce the learning objects and the object repositories. Then, they were requested to prepare a course content and instructional plan using the object repositories. During the last phase of the study, their opinions about the object approach were determined. According to findings; before the seminar, it was observed that pre-services teachers didn’t know learning objects and object repositories. Also, they didn’t use learning object repositories as a reference for their courses. Pre-service teachers’ preferences about learning object repositories were change according to some different factors: especially language, interaction level and resource type. Furthermore, it was seen that most of them exhibited positive attitude toward learning objects. As a conclusion, it would be worthwhile to increase the number of object repositories allowing preparation of course contents by combining objects to form a whole, in order to promote and spread use of learning object approach among teachers and pre-service teachers through in-service training and pre-service training programs. The 13 th article on “Meeting The Needs Of Distance LearnerS of M ED Program: Bangladesh Open University Perspective” and written Amirul ISLAM and Sakiba Ferdowsi from School of Education, Bangladesh Open University, Bangaldesh. This study draws on The Experience of A Cohort of 22 Students From 09 Tutorial Centers Enrolled In A Master of Education (M Ed) Distance Learning Program administered by the Bangladesh open university (bou). It's purpose is to locate the aims and philosophies of distance learning within the experiences of actual distance learners in order to see if learners' needs were being met by the program and to obtain a fuller understanding of core aspects of distance education. It has found that students were, on the whole, satisfied with the course materials, the choice of modules, assignment feedback, and length of time given to complete the assignments, but significant problems surfaced regarding issues of student support, and access to and provision of resource materials. to meet the needs of learners. The 14 th article is from India on “Effectiveness of ARCS Model Of Motivational Design To Overcome Non Completion Rate of Students In Distance Education”, which is written by Sangeeta MALIK from symbiosis centre for distance learning, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The purpose of their study was to define students’ course completion rate in distance education is getting attention of the researchers throughout the globe. Many factors responsible for high non completion rate of students in distance education are job responsibilities, domestic pressure and complexity of course content. Some researchers reported psychological reasons for dropout like, feeling of inadequacy, distress (Rickinson and Rutherford, 1996); lack of confidence (Cullen, 1994) examination anxiety (Fan and Chan, 1997). In literature lack of motivation is considered as the major responsible factor for this problem as students generally feel lonely due to lack of communication & competition in distance education. In this article effectiveness of ARCS model of motivational design to overcome the motivational problem of distance learning students is discussed. The study indicate that the systems which are developed on the basis of ARCS model raise the attention of the students during instruction, develop a relevance to the students’ requirements, create a positive expectation for success and help having a satisfaction by reinforcing success. The 15 th and last article is on “Students Perceived Value Towards Quality Of Distance Education In Tamil Nadu” and written by D. SUGUMAR, K. THANDAVAMOORTHY and S. Joseph Xavier from Trichy, Tamil Nadu, INDIA. In Their article indicated that the quality of education of any distance learning programme is maintained by various ways, such as: quality of study material, internal and external evaluation, and student support methods and so on. The above aspects should be available in aspects to the post graduate degree students. In this research ex post facto research with field survey is used. It was carried out all over Tamil Nadu. The students who have enrolled for distance post graduate programme through study centres of Tamil Nadu Open University (TNOU), Annamalai University and Alagappa University were taken into consideration for collecting data. The total sample size was 600 respondents who were selected equally from all locations. The primary data were collected through questionnaire cum interview schedule method. The questionnaire is well structured and tested for reliability, testability and analytical ability. This study concludes that distance education programmes. With such a huge network spanning across the country, and the growth being exponential in a comparatively short period of time, there is a growing concern for the quality in education being imparted through such institutions. This study has confirmed that most of the students are highly satisfied towards the management education by the distance education mode expect few facts, there are students not satisfied with the PCP time schedule, syllabus covered by the course material and stipulated time for the payments of course fees.

Following the guide example of a dual frame set-up (DF) in telephone surveys, this contribution presents an extensive simulation study where different types of screenings to deal with the overlap issue are compared with the proper DF approach. We empirically show that the efforts of screening do not guarantee estimators more efficient than the DF estimators that do not need screening. Moreover simulation results show that screening at sample level does not correct for the increased inclusion <b>probability</b> of <b>units</b> in both frames produced by the DF set-up nor improve efficiency.
