5|$|The M3 Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) was a United States Army tank {{destroyer}} {{equipped with}} one 75mm gun and {{was produced by}} Autocar. After the fall of France, the U.S. Army {{decided to make a}} self-propelled artillery piece from the M1897A4 gun on the M3 chassis, which was designated the T12. After some improvement, it came into production as the M3 Gun Motor Carriage. However, the supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient for <b>production</b> <b>needs,</b> so a new gun shield was used. This was designated the M3A1 GMC.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{went into}} WWII with an economy still not fully {{recovered}} from the Great Depression. Because wartime <b>production</b> <b>needs</b> mandated large budget deficits and an accommodating monetary policy, inflation and a runaway wage-price spiral was seen as likely. As {{a part of a}} team charged with keeping inflation from crippling the war effort, Galbraith served as a deputy head of the Office of Price Administration (O.P.A.) during World War II in 1941–1943. The O.P.A. directed the process of stabilization of prices and rents.|$|E
25|$|These {{changes were}} unusual {{not only because}} the extent and timing of the changes meant that {{construction}} took place during the school year, but also because Drillbit Taylor production did not pay for the re-tiling. The district had provided money to re-tile floors throughout the LAUSD, so the re-tiling of the floors itself was not unusual or controversial. However, as the film's <b>production</b> <b>needs</b> guided the color choices for the re-tiling and the schedule for construction, many students were upset by the behavior of the movie company and the school.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in the 1930s, Imperial Japan {{attempted}} {{to expand its}} territory into China. [...] Opposed to these aggressive actions, the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands froze Japanese assets and imposed economic restrictions which prohibited the exportation of aircraft fuel as well as steel and iron to Japan, affecting 90% of Japan's war <b>production</b> <b>needs.</b> [...] Japan was forced to either give up its expansion plans or find alternative raw materials to continue producing equipment for the war. [...] Japan chose to continue with its plans, but decided it needed to neutralize any threat from the United States first.|$|E
500|$|Designer Harvey Smith {{suggested}} a streamlined plot that removed the Mexican invasion to make development easier and the narrative more personal. While finished assets were repurposed, entire {{parts of the}} game were abandoned, including Texas and the Denver airport. Environments such as a flooded city became a Majestic 12 research site and the endgame Helios space station became Area 51. He also made the call to remove a playable mid-game White House level due to its complexity and <b>production</b> <b>needs</b> in other areas. Pete Davison of USgamer referred to the White House and presidential bunker as [...] "the truly deleted scenes of Deus Ex lost levels". Spector referred to his [...] "dream" [...] level—the White House—as their [...] "toughest map challenge". The team has speculated that the assets may exist on a [...] "DVDs in someone's attic", though Pacotti, Smith, Spector, and the final release have no trace of them. Pacotti felt {{that the experience of}} rescuing Paul was worth cutting the White House from the game.|$|E
500|$|The game's story changed greatly during production, but {{the idea}} of an {{augmented}} counterterrorist protagonist named JC Denton remained throughout. Though Spector originally pictured Deus Ex as akin to The X-Files, lead writer Sheldon Pacotti felt that it ended up more like James Bond. Spector wrote that the team overextended itself by planning highly elaborate scenes, including a replica of downtown Austin, a reconstruction of Area 51 from satellite data, a sunken post-earthquake Los Angeles, a raid to free thousands of prisoners of war from a Federal Emergency Management Agency-controlled United Nations concentration camp, and over 25 missions throughout Siberia, western Europe, and the United States. Designer Harvey Smith pushed for the removal of a subplot in which Mexico invaded Texas, in order to make development easier and the narrative more personal. He also removed a largely complete White House level due to its complexity and <b>production</b> <b>needs.</b> Finished digital assets were repurposed or, in the cases of Texas and the Denver airport, abandoned by the team. Pete Davison of USgamer referred to the White House and presidential bunker as [...] "the truly deleted scenes of Deus Ex lost levels".|$|E

500|$|CBC's The Current held {{a debate}} {{on the merits of}} the ethical oil {{argument}} in Dec 2011. [...] Nobel laureate and chair of the Nobel Women's Initiative Jody Williams, argued that the ethical oil position was disingenuous and suspect of commercial interests rather than genuine concern for women’s rights. [...] She argued that the oil industry with no history of advocating the case of women’s rights, is ill placed to begin the discussion. [...] Ethical Oil spokesperson Kathryn Marshall responded that the ethical nature of oil <b>production</b> <b>needs</b> to be discussed, and she expected human rights activists to be more inclined to promote dialogue. [...] Dr. Andrew Crane a business ethics professor at York University agreed the ethical argument for oil production should be discussed, but also added the narrow focus of the books argument was prioritizing human rights over other ethical evaluating factors. [...] Dr. Crane further stated that Canada was not taking a leadership position by trying to improve ethical extraction practices overseas and not just in Canada. [...] He argued a primary ethical indicator is leadership, and companies operating in Canada, and Canadian companies operating abroad were not being held accountable within the ethical oil argument for their overseas practices. [...] Kathryn Marshall responded the focus should be on the pushing these [...] "unethical" [...] countries for regulatory action, rather than the pushing the companies to improve {{in the absence of a}} regulatory impetus.|$|E

It was admitted into the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1921. [...] By 1918, the breed {{was presented to the}} public. To this day, the Chantecler is one of only two breeds of poultry from Canada, and the only one known to have been created primarily by a member of a monastic order.|$|E
50|$|The Shaffer Ice Palace was {{converted}} to a manufacturing plant for assist in the <b>production</b> <b>needed</b> for World War II, leaving the Blue Birds without a home.

The paper will argue that heterodox <b>production</b> models <b>need</b> not be perfectly circular to make important contributions for heterodox production theory. Furthermore, it will be argued that models which consist of elements of hierarchial structures of production put emphasis on out of equilibrium traverse processes and historical time. ...|$|R
