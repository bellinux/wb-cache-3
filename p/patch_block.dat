40|$|Abstract—Exemplar-based methods, {{in which}} actual image blocks {{are used to}} fill in missing content, have {{achieved}} {{state of the art}} performance in image inpainting. The majority of these adopt a progressive approach, filling in the missing region inwards from the boundary. The final result is highly dependent on fill order, and while significant progress has been made on the choice of this order, the greedy nature of such a process leads to artifacts in some cases. The alternative exemplar-based approach proposed here is defined via joint optimization of a single functional, simultaneously assigning an estimated value to the entire inpainting region. The results are found to be highly competitive with other recent inpainting methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{activation}} of the nonselective cation channels in mouse pancreatic acinar cells has been assessed at low agonist concentrations using patch-clamp whole cell, cell-attached patch, and isolated inside-out patch recordings. Application of acetylcholine (ACh) (25 - 1, 000 nM) and cholecystokinin (CCK) (2 - 10 pM) evoked oscillatory responses in both cation and chloride currents measured in whole cell experiments. In cell-attached patch experiments we demonstrate CCK and ACh evoked opening of single 25 -pS cation channels in the basolateral membrane. Therefore, at least {{a component of the}} whole cell cation current is due to {{activation of}} cation channels in the basolateral acinar cell membrane. To further investigate the reported sensitivity of the cation channel to intracellular ATP and calcium we used excised inside-out patches. Micromolar Ca 2 + concentrations were required for significant channel activation. Application of ATP and ADP to the intracellular surface of the <b>patch</b> <b>blocked</b> channel opening at concentrations between 0. 2 and 4 mM.

40|$|The JSC {{registration}} processor performs scene-to-scene (or band-to-band) correlation {{based on}} edge images. The edge images {{are derived from}} {{a percentage of the}} edge pixels calculated from the raw scene data, excluding clouds and other extraneous data in the scene. Correlations are performed on <b>patches</b> (<b>blocks)</b> of the edge images, and the correlation peak location in each patch is estimated iteratively to fractional pixel location accuracy. Peak offset locations from all patches over the scene are then considered together, and a variety of tests are made to weed out outliers and other inconsistencies before a distortion model is assumed. Thus, the correlation peak offset locations in each patch indicate quantitatively how well the two TM bands register to each other over that patch of scene data. The average of these offsets indicate the overall accuracies of the band-to-band registration. The registration processor was also used to register one acquisition to another acquisition of multitemporal TM data acquired over the same ground track.

40|$|The {{lanthanide}} ions La 3 + and Gd 3 + block Ca 2 +-permeable cation {{channels and}} {{have been used as}} important tools to characterize channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family. However, widely different concentrations of La 3 + and Gd 3 + have reportedly been required for block of TRP 3 channels in various expression systems. The present study provides a possible explanation for this discrepancy. After overexpression of TRP 3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, whole-cell currents through TRP 3 were reversibly inhibited by La 3 + with an EC 50 of 4 µM. For comparison, the organic blocker SKF 96365 required an EC 50 of 8 µM. Gd 3 + blocked with an EC 50 of 0. 1 µM, but this block was slow in onset and was not reversible after wash-out. When the two lanthanides were added to the cytosolic side of inside-out <b>patches,</b> <b>block</b> was achieved with considerably lower concentrations (EC 50 for La 3 +, 0. 02 µM; EC 50 for Gd 3 +, 0. 02 µM).

40|$|Intestinal {{epithelial}} cells (IECs) overlying the villi play {{a prominent role}} in absorption of digested nutrients and establish a barrier that separates the internal milieu from potentially harmful microbial antigens. Several mechanisms by which antigens of dietary and microbial origin enter the body have been identified; however whether IECs play a role in antigen uptake is not known. Using in vivo imaging of the mouse small intestine, we investigated whether {{epithelial cells}} (enterocytes) play {{an active role in the}} uptake (sampling) of lumen antigens. We found that small molecular weight antigens such as chicken ovalbumin, dextran, and bacterial LPS enter the lamina propria, the loose connective tissue which lies beneath the epithelium via goblet cell associated passageways. However, epithelial cells overlying the villi can internalize particulate antigens such as bacterial cell debris and inert nanoparticles (NPs), which are then found co-localizing with the CD 11 c+ dendritic cells in the lamina propria. The extent of NP uptake by IECs depends on their size: 20 - 40 nm NPs are taken up readily, while NPs larger than 100 nm are taken up mainly by the epithelial cells overlying Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>patches.</b> <b>Blocking</b> NPs with small proteins or conjugating them with ovalbumin does not inhibit their uptake. However, the uptake of 40 nm NPs can be inhibited when they are administered with an endocytosis inhibitor (chlorpromazine).

40|$|Ocular {{dominance}} {{has been}} extensively studied, often with the goal to understand neuroplasticity, which is a key characteristic within the critical period. Recent work on monocular deprivation, however, demonstrates residual neuroplasticity in the adult visual cortex. After deprivation of patterned inputs by monocular patching, the patched eye becomes more dominant. Since <b>patching</b> <b>blocks</b> both the Fourier amplitude and phase information of the input image, it remains unclear whether deprivation of the Fourier phase information alone is able to reshape eye dominance. Here, for the first time, we show that removing of the phase regularity without changing the amplitude spectra of the input image induced a shift of eye dominance toward the deprived eye, {{but only if the}} eye dominance was measured with a binocular rivalry task rather than an interocular phase combination task. These different results indicate that the two measurements are supported by different mechanisms. Phase Integration requires the fusion of monocular images. The fused percept highly relies on the weights of the phase sensitive monocular neurons that respond to the two monocular images. However, binocular rivalry reflects the result of direct interocular competition that strongly weights the contour information transmitted along each monocular pathway. Monocular phase deprivation may not change the weights in the integration (fusion) mechanism much, but alters the balance in the rivalry (competition) mechanism. Our work suggests that ocular dominance plasticity may occur at different stages of visual processing, and that homeostatic compensation also occurs for the lack of phase regularity In natural scenes.

40|$|ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) {{channels}} {{are involved in}} ischemic cardioprotection induced by preconditioning (IPC), though the relative role of sarcolemmal (sK(ATP)) and mitochondrial (mitoK(ATP)) channels remains controversial. The sK(ATP) -selective sulphonylthiourea HMR 1098 has often {{been reported to be}} without effect on ischemic cardioprotection, suggesting minimal involvement of sK(ATP). Since some sulphonylureas show reduced potency under conditions of metabolic stress, we used patch clamp to assess the ability of HMR 1098 to block sK(ATP) currents of adult rat ventricular myocytes activated by metabolic inhibition (MI, NaCN+iodoacetate). In contrast to the prototype sulphonylurea glibenclamide, HMR 1098 (10 muM) was without effect on sK(ATP) currents, and also did not inhibit MI-induced action potential shortening. However, HMR 1098 blocked sK(ATP) current induced by the K(ATP) opener pinacidil (IC(50) = 0. 36 +/- 0. 02 muM), and reversed pinacidil-induced action potential shortening. In inside-out <b>patches,</b> <b>block</b> by HMR 1098 was relieved by increasing MgADP concentrations (1 - 100 muM). HMR 1098 inhibited pinacidil-activated recombinant Kir 6. 2 /SUR 2 A channels with a similar IC(50) (0. 30 +/- 0. 04 muM), but was less effective when channels were activated by low intracellular ATP. HMR 1098 displaced binding of the pinacidil analogue [(3) H]P 1075 to native cardiac membranes with a biphasic inhibition curve. Our results show that HMR 1098 becomes a much less effective inhibitor of sK(ATP) during metabolic stress, and suggest that the lack of effect of HMR 1098 on ischemic cardioprotection reported in some studies may represent loss of block by the drug under these conditions rather than a lack of involvement of sK(ATP) channels. 1672...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{generation}} and Euler flow about fighter aircraft are described. A fighter aircraft geometry is specified by an area ruled fuselage with an internal duct, cranked delta wing or strake/wing combinations, canard and/or horizontal tail surfaces, and vertical tail surfaces. The initial step before grid {{generation and}} flow computation is {{the determination of}} a suitable grid topology. The external grid topology that has been applied is called a dual-block topology which is a patched C (exp 1) continuous multiple-block system where inner blocks cover the highly-swept part of a cranked wing or strake, rearward inner-part of the wing, and tail components. Outer-blocks cover {{the remainder of the}} fuselage, outer-part of the wing, canards and extend to the far field boundaries. The grid generation is based on transfinite interpolation with Lagrangian blending functions. This procedure has been applied to the Langley experimental fighter configuration and a modified F- 18 configuration. Supersonic flow between Mach 1. 3 and 2. 5 and angles of attack between 0 degrees and 10 degrees have been computed with associated Euler solvers based on the finite-volume approach. When coupling geometric details such as boundary layer diverter regions, duct regions with inlets and outlets, or slots with the general external grid, imposing C (exp 1) continuity can be extremely tedious. The approach taken here is to <b>patch</b> <b>blocks</b> together at common interfaces where there is no grid continuity, but enforce conservation in the finite-volume solution. The key to this technique is how to obtain the information required for a conservative interface.

A mutation in the pore region that alters anion selectivity, F 337 A, but not another mutation at the same site that has no effect on selectivity (F 337 Y), had a complex effect on channel block by intracellular Pt(NO 2) 42 − ions. Relative to wild-type, block of F 337 A-CFTR was weakened at depolarized voltages but strengthened at hyperpolarized voltages. Current in the presence of Pt(NO 2) 42 − increased at very negative voltages in F 337 A but not wild-type or F 337 Y, apparently due to relief of block by permeation of Pt(NO 2) 42 − ions to the extracellular solution. This “punchthrough” was prevented by extracellular Cl− ions, reminiscent of a “lock-in” effect. Relief of block in F 337 A by Pt(NO 2) 42 − permeation was only observed for blocker concentrations above 300 μM; as a result, block at very negative voltages showed an anomalous concentration dependence, with an increase in blocker concentration causing a significant weakening of block and an increase in Cl− current. We interpret this effect as reflecting concentration-dependent permeability of Pt(NO 2) 42 − in F 337 A, an apparent manifestation of an anomalous mole fraction effect. We suggest that the F 337 A mutation allows intracellular Pt(NO 2) 42 − to enter deeply into the CFTR pore where it interacts with multiple binding sites, and that simultaneous binding of multiple Pt(NO 2) 42 − ions within the pore promotes their permeation to the extracellular solution...|$|R

Patches isolated into solutions containing 2 mM ATP showed channel activation at micromolar Ca 2 + concentrations. Our results show that ATP has two separate effects. The continuous presence of the nucleotide is required for operation of the cation channels and this action seems to depend on ATP hydrolysis. ATP can also close the channel and this effect can be demonstrated in excised inside-out patches when ATP is added to the bath after a period of exposure to an ATP-free solution.

40|$|Geodetic data at a plate {{boundary}} can reveal {{the pattern of}} subsurface displacements that accompany plate motion. These displacements are modelled as the sum of rigid block motion and the elastic effects of frictional interaction between blocks. The frictional interactions are represented by uniform dislocation on each of several rectangular fault <b>patches.</b> The <b>block</b> velocities and fault parameters are then estimated from geodetic data. Bayesian inversion procedure employs prior estimates based on geological and seismological data. The method {{is applied to the}} Transverse Ranges, using prior geological and seismological data and geodetic data from the USGS trilateration networks. Geodetic data imply a displacement rate of about 20 mm/yr across the San Andreas Fault, while the geologic estimates exceed 30 mm/yr. The prior model and the final estimates both imply about 10 mm/yr crustal shortening normal to the trend of the San Andreas Fault. Aseismic fault motion is a major contributor to plate motion. The geodetic data can help to identify faults that are suffering rapid stress accumulation; in the Transverse Ranges those faults are the San Andreas and the Santa Susana...|$|R
