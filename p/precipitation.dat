5|$|Convective rain, or showery <b>precipitation,</b> occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective <b>precipitation</b> falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most <b>precipitation</b> in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform <b>precipitation</b> also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective <b>precipitation</b> is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according {{to the amount of}} <b>precipitation</b> they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without <b>precipitation,</b> arid lands have less than 250mm (10in) of annual <b>precipitation,</b> and semiarid lands have a mean annual <b>precipitation</b> of between 250 and 500mm (10–20in). Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} evaporation {{which can lead}} to more <b>precipitation.</b> <b>Precipitation</b> generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in <b>precipitation</b> over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of heavy <b>precipitation</b> events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in <b>precipitation</b> and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more <b>precipitation),</b> along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less <b>precipitation</b> and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual <b>precipitation</b> increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25percent).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} and mechanical properties of pipeline steel X 80 through HTP rolled into 16 mm thick slab were tested.

Low content of P, S, high content of Mn and fine microstructure have good effect on reducing the ductile-brittle transitiop temperature. Two different <b>precipitations</b> are observed in pipeline steel X 80, a class of TiN <b>precipitations</b> is mainly and a small number of (Nb, V) (C, N) complex <b>precipitations</b> in the TiN around, and the other for large number of NbC <b>precipitations</b> and a small amount of TiC, VC and simultaneous deposition of the complex formed <b>precipitations.</b> Remarkable strengthening and grain refinement can ne caused by these <b>precipitations...</b>|$|R

5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a {{major factor}} in the {{variation}} of annual <b>precipitation</b> within Buenos Aires and the Pampas, particularly during spring and summer.

5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation {{leads to}} changes in the {{atmospheric}} circulation patterns (also known as teleconnections). Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, the impacts of the changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are more clearly observed in the more humid eastern parts of the country (between Uruguay and southern Brazil). During El Niño events, <b>precipitation</b> is more higher than normal while during La Niña events, <b>precipitation</b> is lower than normal in the Pampas. In general, El Niño tends to increase <b>precipitation</b> during late spring and summer, particularly in the north. The impacts of La Niña in the eastern parts of the country (northeast and the Pampas) are observed in winter where <b>precipitation</b> is lower. In Northwest Argentina, El Niño events are associated with a strong reduction in rainfall during summer. In contrast, La Niña events increase <b>precipitation</b> in northwest Argentina. In the central–western parts of Patagonia, spring <b>precipitation</b> tends to be lower during La Niña events and higher during El Niño events. Summer <b>precipitation</b> exhibits an opposite pattern where La Niña years involve wetter summers while El Niño years featuring drier summers. On the Andes in central western Argentina, <b>precipitation</b> is higher during El Niño year.|$|E

30|$|All alkalis {{employed}} {{in this study}} were incompatible with the synthetic brine.

This is attributed to the interaction between the Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and the sulfonate groups of the surfactant. Therefore, in order to use alkali or surfactant with the synthesized brine, the sodium acrylate must be used to keep solutions without <b>precipitations.</b>|$|R
