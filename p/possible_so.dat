5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E

London's purpose-built Olympic venues and facilities, including the Olympic Village itself, were designed to be accessible as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> they could easily accommodate the Paralympics.

5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that it may be approached from all directions. The view from the top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E
5|$|With Chadwick {{involved}} {{the main goal}} was {{to show that the}} Quebec Agreement was a success. It was Britain's duty to co-operate to the fullest and speed along the process. Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that they might carry that experience to post-war Britain. He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat's integrity to the cause, and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality. Rotblat had been left in charge of the Tube Alloys research, and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left.|$|E

5|$|During 1989 Prost {{began to}} {{contemplate}} starting his own team, as {{his relationship with}} his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993. In 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people began to assume that a Prost-Renault team would be formed in the near future. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Bunaâ€“Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on as long as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{informed}} Whitehead of {{the proposed}} convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as {{to allow for a}} large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> that they could be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February.|$|E

5|$|Operation Torch, the Allied {{invasion}} of French North Africa, precipitated {{a crisis in}} Kesselring's command. He ordered Walther Nehring, the former commander of the Afrika Korps who was returning to action after recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, to proceed to Tunisia to take command of a new corps (XC Corps). Kesselring ordered Nehring to establish a bridgehead in Tunisia and then to press west as far as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> as to gain freedom to manoeuvre. By December, the Allied commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, was forced to concede that Kesselring had won the race; {{the final phase of}} Torch had failed and the Axis could only be ejected from Tunisia after a prolonged struggle.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists as <b>possible</b> <b>so</b> long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give}} up his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E

5|$|From Maryland's {{earliest}} days, Cecil Calvert had enjoined its colonists {{to leave}} religious rivalries behind. Along with giving {{instructions on the}} establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants and Catholics. He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately as <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> as not to disturb that peace. The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland's earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment {{to the rights of}} man, but did not specifically detail protections for religious minorities of any kind. Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert's control of Maryland. In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable. This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of highly {{sensitive}} mass spectrometers, an application of 231Pa as a tracer in geology and paleoceanography has become <b>possible.</b> <b>So,</b> the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 is used for radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling {{of the formation of}} minerals. In particular, its evaluation in oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of North Atlantic water bodies during the last melting of Ice Age glaciers. Some of the protactinium-related dating variations rely on the analysis of the relative concentrations for several long-living members of the uranium decay chain â€“ uranium, protactinium, and thorium, for example. These elements have 6, 5 and 4 valence electrons and thus favor +6, +5 and +4 oxidation states, respectively, and show different physical and chemical properties. So, thorium and protactinium, but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, and precipitate into sediments; the precipitation rate is faster for thorium than for protactinium. Besides, the concentration analysis for both protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years) and thorium-230 (half-life 75,380 years) allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured; this double-isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their precipitation rate.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom {{possessed the}} largest navy {{in the world}} for the whole of the ironclad period. The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them {{worldwide}} in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was no longer <b>possible,</b> <b>so</b> the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of 'coast-defence battleships', starting with the Devastation class. These 'breastwork monitors' were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship. As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War. The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to 'overwhelm' enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their low-profile and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running gauntlets. Mines and obstructions, however, negated these advantagesâ€”a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough Devastation-class 'battleships' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act, which promulgated the idea of a 'two-power standard', that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
