40|$|International audienceWe analyze flame {{propagation}} through a homogeneous three-component <b>premixture</b> composed of fuel gas, small fuel droplets, and air. This analytical study {{is carried out}} {{within the framework of}} a diffusional-thermal model with the simplifying assumption that both fuels [...] the fuel in the gaseous phase and the gaseous fuel evaporating from the droplets [...] have the same Lewis number. The parameter that expresses the degree of substitution of spray for gas is δ, the liquid loading, i. e., the ratio of liquid fuel mass fraction to overall fuel mass fraction in the fresh <b>premixture.</b> In this substitution of liquid fuel for gaseous fuel, the overall equivalence ratio is lean and is kept identical. We hence obtain a partially prevaporized spray, for which we analytically study the dynamics of the plane spray-flame front. The investigated model assumes the averaged distance between droplets to be small compared with the premixed flame thickness (i. e., small droplets and moderate pressure). Le, the Lewis number, Ze, the Zeldovich number, and δ are the main parameters of the study. Our stability analysis supplies the stability diagram in the plane {Le,δ} for various Ze values and shows that, for all Le, the plane front becomes unstable for high liquid loading. At large or moderate Lewis number, we show that the presence of droplets substantially diminishes the onset threshold of the oscillatory instability, making the appearance of oscillatory propagation easier. Oscillations can even occur for Le< 1 when sufficient spray substitution is operated. The pulsation frequency occurring in this regime is a tunable function of δ. At low Lewis number, substitution of spray for gas leads to a more complex situation for which two branches can coexist: the first one still corresponding to the pulsating regime, the other one being related to the diffusive-thermal cellular instability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{experiments}} on spray flames propagating in a Wilson cloud chamber have established that spray flames {{are much more}} sensitive to wrinkles or corrugations than single-phase flames.

Both approaches provide us with results in deep agreement.

40|$|Active {{control of}} a lifted flame is {{investigated}} using a coaxial nozzle with magnetic flap actuators arranged on the inner periphery of the annular nozzle. Near-field vortical structures of the methane/air coaxial jet are manipulated by introducing disturbances directly to the initial shear layer. Through the manipulation, we can improve flame stability and flexibly control the liftoff height. It is found that the large-scale vortical structures play a dominant role in the flame stabilization, and its spatio-temporal evolution is examined {{with the aid of}} PIV and LIF to elucidate the control mechanism. By introducing flap motion driven with a saw-wave signal, we can force the outer shear layer to roll up into strong vortices in synchronization with the flaps. When the flapping Strouhal number is unity, the lifted flame is anchored at x/Do ~ 1. 5. The strong vortices induced by the flaps produce a blob of flammable mixture, which has velocity smaller than the flame speed. The possible stabilization mechanism is that the time period of the <b>premixture</b> supply is balanced with the consumption time of the <b>premixture</b> at the flame base. On the other hand, when the jet is manipulated by a square-wave signal, the lifted flame is located stably at x/Do ~ 4, which is downstream of the inner potential core. It is found that vortical structures in the shear layers break into turbulence close to the nozzle exit. The possible mechanism of the flame stabilization is that the flame propagating upstream is undisturbed due to the absence of intermittent passage of large-scale vortices.

In the present work, the partially premixed laminar flame structure is examined using a detailed-chemistry, one-dimensional simulation. The computational results are compared to unpublished single-point multiscalar measurements obtained at Sandia National Labs in 2001. The study is focused on axisymmetric laminar partially-premixed methane/air flames with varying <b>premixture</b> strength values of 1. 8, 2. 2, and 3. 17. The combination of computational and experimental results is used to analyze the spatial and scalar flame structure under the overarching concept of flamelets. The computations are based on the Cantera open-source software package developed at CalTech by D. Goodwin, and incorporating the GRI 3. 0 chemical kinetic mechanism utilizing 325 chemical reactions and 53 species for methane combustion. Cross-transport effects as well as an optically-thin radiation model are included in the calculations. Radiation changes the flame profiles due to its effect on temperature, and the attendant effects on a number of species. Using the detailed analysis of different reaction rates, the adiabatic and radiative nitric oxide concentrations are compared. The cross-transport effects, i. e. Soret and Dufour, were studied in detail. The Soret term has a small but important effect on the flame structure through a reduction of the hydrogen mass fraction, which changes the conserved scalar values. Based on the flamelet approach and a unique formulation of the conserved scalar, the flame thermochemistry can be analyzed and understood. A number of interesting effects on the flame thermochemistry can be discerned in both experiments and computations when the <b>premixture</b> strength is varied. An increase in premixing results in a counterintuitive decrease in intermediate species such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen, as well as an expected increase in nitric oxide concentrations.

40|$|A new, {{simple and}} {{fit for purpose}} method based on liquid {{chromatography}} with UV spectrophotometric detection and post-column derivatisation (LC-UV-PCD) for the determination of semduramicin in poultry compound feed, <b>premixtures</b> and feed additive {{as well as its}} discrimination from other coccidiostats in poultry compound feed has been developed and single-laboratory validated. The concentration levels of the target analyte at which the validation experiments have been carried out varied between 12. 8 and 51. 3 mg kg− 1 in compound feed, covering the authorised levels of semduramicin according to European Union legislation. Furthermore, the method has been validated for a premixture sample containing semduramicin at 3 g kg− 1 and the feed additive containing semduramicin at 51 g kg− 1. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats with acetonitrile from the feed samples followed by a filtration of the supernatants. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. When analysing the feed additive and the premixture samples, the extraction solution was appropriately diluted prior to LC-UV-PCD analysis. The analytes were quantified through an external calibration curve prepared with pure semduramicin standards. The relative standard deviations for repeatability and for intermediate precision varied from 2. 4 to 8. 8 % and from 2. 6 to 8. 8 %, respectively, and the values for the relative recovery rate ranged from 89 to 95 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were estimated to be below 1 mg kg− 1 and 3 mg kg− 1, respectively. Moreover, the results showed a comparable performance profile, when using methyl isobutyl ketone instead of acetonitrile as extraction solvent. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for the determination of semduramicin in poultry compound feed at authorised level, in <b>premixtures</b> and in the feed additive, hence allowing the enforcement of the European Union legislation regarding the control and the monitoring in feedingstuffs.

40|$|An ex-vessel steam {{explosion}} might occur when during a hypothetical severe reactor accident the reactor vessel fails and the molten core pours {{into the water}} in the reactor cavity. A {{steam explosion}} is a fuel coolant interaction process where the heat transfer from the melt to water is so intense and rapid that the timescale for heat transfer is shorter than the timescale for pressure relief. This could lead to the formation of shock waves and production of missiles at later times, during the expansion of the highly pressurized water vapour, that may endanger surrounding structures. The purpose of the article is to present how steam explosions can be treated with a general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, to give an insight of the steam explosion phenomenon in a typical Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) cavity, and to provide a rough assessment of the vulnerabilities of cavity structures to steam explosions.

40|$|International audienceRecently, {{experiments}} and theoretical investigations {{have shown that}} spray flame can exhibit oscillatory regimes for standard set of parameters. Theoretical and numerical investigations on flame propagation in two-phase <b>premixtures</b> have put forward an intrinsic (and robust) mechanism based on {{the interaction between the}} locus where droplets vaporize and the reaction zone. This mechanism invokes neither droplet inertia (very small droplets are studied) nor differential diffusive effects (pulsations take place for unity Lewis number, too). Self-oscillations of spray-flame occur as in a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, controlled by Zeldovich number (Ze, the reduced activation energy), the onset threshold being on the order of (Ze) c ≈ 10. The issue addressed in this contribution is whether acoustic wave and self-pulsating spray-flame can interact. This study was carried out in the open-loop context: a spray-flame was submitted to small amplitude fluctuations of pressure; the gain toward acoustics was found as depending on Zeldovich number because energy transfer is found magnified {{in the case of a}} close-frequency fit between acoustic resonator and natural spray-flame oscillations.

Unsteady flame response is investigated in terms of the Markstein transfer function which depends on the frequency of oscillation.

The air-fuel <b>premixture</b> in the chamber was divided into particles of equal mass, which in turn were distributed among control volumes considered as spherical concentric shells.

40|$|AbstractA steam {{explosion}} may occur during a severe accident, when the molten core comes {{into contact with}} water. The pressurized water reactor and boiling water reactor ex-vessel {{steam explosion}} study, which was carried out with the multicomponent three-dimensional Eulerian fuel–coolant interaction code under {{the conditions of the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Steam Explosion Resolution for Nuclear Applications project reactor exercise, is presented and discussed. In reactor calculations, the largest uncertainties in the prediction of the steam explosion strength are expected to be caused by the large uncertainties related to the jet breakup. To obtain some insight into these uncertainties, premixing simulations were performed with both available jet breakup models, i. e., the global and the local models. The simulations revealed that weaker explosions are predicted by the local model, compared to the global model, due to the predicted smaller melt droplet size, resulting in increased melt solidification and increased void buildup, both reducing the explosion strength. Despite the lower active melt mass predicted for the pressurized water reactor case, pressure loads at the cavity walls are typically higher than that for the boiling water reactor case. This is because of the significantly larger boiling water reactor cavity, where the explosion pressure wave originating from the <b>premixture</b> {{in the center of the}} cavity has already been significantly weakened on reaching the distant cavity wall...|$|R

A corresponding method for identification of model coefficients was developed and validated against test data generated with a linear time-domain model, designed to be qualitatively representative of a practical premix burner. The method for system identification of a MISO model is now applied to time series data generated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation {{in the presence of}} broadband forcing. The CFD model represents a generic, practical premixed swirl burner with multiple fuel injection stages.

(1981) and the mass and heat transfer equations from the two-phase model of Davidson and Harrison (1963). The focus is not on a new modeling approach, but on combining the classical models of the kinetics and other diffusional aspects to obtain a better insight into the events occurring inside a fluidized bed reactor. Experimental data are obtained to validate the model by testing the combustion of commercial propane, in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed, using four sand particle sizes: 400 – 500, 315 – 400, 250 – 315, and 200 – 250 µm. The mole fractions of CO 2, CO, and O 2 in the flue gases and the temperature of the fluidized bed are measured and compared with the numerical results...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbulent}} catalytically stabilized combustion (CST) of fuel-lean hydrogen/air <b>premixtures</b> over platinum {{was investigated}} experimentally and numerically {{in the entrance}} region of a channel. Experiments were carried out in an optically accessible catalytic channel reactor with incoming Reynolds numbers up to 3 × 104 and involved particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) for the characterization of the in-channel and the inlet flow, respectively, 1 -D spontaneous Raman measurements of major species concentrations over the catalyst boundary layer {{for the assessment of}} turbulent scalar transport, and planar laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of the OH radical for the determination of gaseous combustion. Additional PIV measurements were carried out with room-temperature air flows having Reynolds numbers comparable to those of the reacting cases. The numerical predictions included a Favre-averaged moment closure approach with different low-Reynolds number (LR) near-wall turbulence models. The reacting cases exhibited a strong relaminarization of the turbulent flow due to the intense heating from the catalytic surfaces and this was captured only by a recent LR heat-transfer model. Standard LR turbulence models performed excellently in the nonreacting flows but they overpredicted substantially the turbulence levels of the reacting cases. The suppression of turbulence led to a reduction of the catalytic hydrogen conversion and to a promotion of homogeneous ignition. Parametric numerical studies hav...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbulent}} catalytically stabilized combustion of lean hydrogen–air <b>premixtures</b> is investigated numerically {{in plane}} channels with platinum-coated isothermal walls. The catalytic wall temperature is 1220 K and the incoming mixture has a mean velocity of 15 m/s and a turbulent kinetic energy of 1. 5 m 2 /s 2. A two-dimensional elliptic model is developed with elementary heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions. The approach {{is based on}} a two-layer k– " model of tur-bulence, a Favre-average moment closure, a presumed-shape (Gaussian) probability density function for gaseous reactions, and a laminar-like closure for surface reactions. Gaseous combustion is confined close to the catalyst surface due to the diffusional imbalance of the limiting reactant (hydrogen). In addition, the peak rms temperature and species fluctuations are always located outside the extent of the homogeneous reaction zone indicating that thermochemical fluctuations have no significant influence on gaseous combustion. Turbulence is significantly suppressed by gaseous combustion resulting in higher turbulent transport for the leaner mixtures, a successive push of the gaseous reaction zone towards the wall, incomplete combustion, and subsequent catalytic conversion of the leaked fuel. Comparison between turbulent and laminar cases having the same incoming properties shows that turbulence inhibits homogeneous ignition due to increased heat transport away fro...|$|E
40|$|A steam {{explosion}} may occur during a severe accident, when the molten core comes {{into contact with}} water. The pressurized water reactor and boiling water reactor ex-vessel {{steam explosion}} study, which was carried out with the multicomponent three-dimensional Eulerian fuel–coolant interaction code under {{the conditions of the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Steam Explosion Resolution for Nuclear Applications project reactor exercise, is presented and discussed. In reactor calculations, the largest uncertainties in the prediction of the steam explosion strength are expected to be caused by the large uncertainties related to the jet breakup. To obtain some insight into these uncertainties, premixing simulations were performed with both available jet breakup models, i. e., the global and the local models. The simulations revealed that weaker explosions are predicted by the local model, compared to the global model, due to the predicted smaller melt droplet size, resulting in increased melt solidification and increased void buildup, both reducing the explosion strength. Despite the lower active melt mass predicted for the pressurized water reactor case, pressure loads at the cavity walls are typically higher than that for the boiling water reactor case. This is because of the significantly larger boiling water reactor cavity, where the explosion pressure wave originating from the <b>premixture</b> {{in the center of the}} cavity has already been significantly weakened on reaching the distant cavity wall...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{convection}} {{plays an}} important role in all terrestrial, Lunar, and Martian-based, unstirred, static reactor cool flame and low-temperature autoignitions, since the Rayleigh number (Ra) associated with the self-heating of the reaction exceeds the critical Ra (approximately 600) for onset of convection. At near-zero gravity, Ra 3 ̆c 600 can be achieved and the effects of convection suppressed. To systematically vary the Ra without varying the mixture stoichiometry, reactor pressure, or vessel size, cool flames are studied experimentally in a closed, unstirred, static reactor subject to different gravitational accelerations (terrestrial, 1 g; Martian, 0. 38 g; Lunar, 0. 16 g; a n dr e - duced gravity, ∼ 10 − 2 g). Representative results show the evolution of the visible light emission using an equimolar n-butane:oxygen <b>premixture</b> at temperatures ranging from 320 to 350 ◦C (593 – 623 K) at subatmospheric pressures. For representative reduced-gravity, spherically propagating cool flames, the flame radius based on the peak light intensity is plotted as a function of time and the flame radius (and speed) is calculated from a polynomial fit to data. A skeletal chemical kinetic Gray-Yang model developed previously for a one-dimensional, reactive– diffusive system by Fairlie and co-workers is extended to a two-dimensional axisymmetric, spherical geometry. The coupled species, energy, and momentum equations are solved numerically and the spatio-temporal variations in the temperature profiles are presented. A qualitative comparison is made with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{origins of}} cyclic {{combustion}} variability (CCV) in spark-ignition engines are investigated using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) {{of a stable}} (low CCV) and two unstable (high CCV) operating points of a specifically dedicated experimental test-rig set up around a four valve pentroof single cylindre spark-ignition engine fueled with a <b>premixture</b> of gaseous propane and air. The unstable points are obtained from the reference by reducing significantly the equivalence ratio and by an important dilution by nitrogen respectively. A LES methodology is proposed and shown {{to be able to}} reproduce the experimental findings concerning phase-averaged mean and statistical variations around it of a number of key engine combustion parameters. The CCV and factors causing it are first illustrated by comparing typical slow and fast burning cycles in combination with simple correlation plots of major engine parameters, this allows qualitatively showing how local and global sources concur to generate CCV. In a second step, single parameter and multivariate regressions build from the LES results allow quantifying the relative importance of different local and global CCV sources. Finally, the comparison of the obtained findings as to the relative importance of major parameters on CCV are compared with qualitative summary from an extensive experimental survey by Ozdor et al. The presented LES results overall confirm major findings from the survey, but also indicate that detailed causes of CCV depend on the type of engine and its operation...|$|R
