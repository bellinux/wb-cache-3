40|$|Injection {{of fluid}} waste into Precambrian {{crystalline}} {{rocks at the}} Rocky Mountain Arsenal triggered earthquakes in the 1960 s. Available {{data suggest that the}} waste fluid was injected into a reservoir composed of connected vertical fractures. Earthquakes are believed to be results of lateral sliding motions along fracture planes. A mathematical model is constructed to simulate fluid <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> caused by injection. Computed <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> is related to the spatial distribution of earthquake epicenters. The results show that the earthquakes are confined to that part of the reservoir where the <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> exceeds 32 bars. This critical value is interpreted as the <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> above which earthquakes occur. The existence of this critical pressure is consistent with the Hubbert-Rubey theory on the role of fluid pressure in fault movement. The migration of earthquake epicenters away from the injection well, a phenomenon noted by previous investigators, can be accounted for by the outward propagation of the critical <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up.</b> The analysis is extended to examining the effects of fracture widening under high injection pressure.

The refrigeration systems used consist of cryocoolers, a <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> tank, heat exchangers, and circulation pumps. Liquid nitrogen expands or shrinks according to the temperature variation inside the fixed volume of the refrigeration system and the cable cryostat. The system pressure also changes depending on the volume change of the liquid nitrogen. The pressure of the liquid nitrogen should be kept above a certain level to ensure its dielectric strength. In addition, the pressure should be kept below the allowable pressure level considering the mechanical strength of the refrigeration system. To enhance the pressure controllability, external heating and cooling should be possible in the <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> tank.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an experimental {{investigation of a}} compact aero engine centrifugal compressor stage with pipe-diffuser and tandem deswirler in which the vanes of the first deswirl row are immerged into the diffuser channel. This geometrical arrangement eliminates a vaneless space between diffuser and deswirler, which is present in current conventional centrifugal compressor stages and can result into much lower outer stage diameters. In addition to the nominal centered alignment of the first deswirl row vanes within the diffuser channel, {{a variation of the}} circumferential positioning of the deswirler towards diffuser suction and pressure side was conducted. Furthermore, a bleed extraction between impeller and diffuser was varied. For a comparison of the compact compressor stage to conventional stage designs, additionally three compressor stages with vaneless space between diffuser and deswirler were experimentally investigated, whereas each stage contained a different deswirl system. Impeller and diffuser inlet geometry of all four stages were the same. The study demonstrates that the compact centrifugal compressor stage reaches similar performance values in terms of <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> and efficiency as the stages with decoupled deswirlers. In comparison to a conventional stage with simple one row prismatic deswirl vanes, the compact stage even shows a significant increase in performance. However, the compact stage looses surge margin compared to all three reference stages. Also, a shift of the characteristics of the different stage components was detected. The impeller of the compact stage shows a slightly higher <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> and slightly lower work input. Furthermore, the diffuser inlet shows a significant increase in <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> which is linked to the loss in surge margin. Within the diffuser channel the <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> is lower due to the lower dynamic head at the channel inlet. This results from the increased diffusion at the diffuser inlet. The three-dimensionally designed deswirlers of the compact stage and of two reference stages are showing equal characteristics, whereas the <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> of the deswirler of the last reference stage with prismatic vanes is significantly decreased and the total pressure loss increased. With a total-to-static stage balancing, a variation of the circumferential positioning of the deswirler to the diffuser of the compact compressor stage shows very small changes in <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> and efficiency. However, the surge margin increases from suction to pressure sided positioning of the deswirler relative to the diffuser. With a total-to-total balancing of the stage, the pressure sided positioning of the deswirler relative to the diffuser shows the smallest losses but also the highest Mach-numbers at the stage exit...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the geomechanical {{impact of}} {{large-scale}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) storage in depleted Dutch gas fields is {{compared with the}} impact of CO 2 storage in saline aquifers. The geomechanical behaviour of four potential CO 2 storage sites is examined using flow and geomechanical simulations. Many gas reservoirs in the Netherlands are found in fault blocks, one to a few kilometres wide, laterally bounded by sealing faults. Aquifer depletion or re-pressurization in the lateral direction is seldom an issue {{because of a lack of}} active aquifers. Reservoir pressure changes are therefore limited to a gas-bearing fault block, while the induced stress changes affect the gas reservoir and extend 1 e 3 km away into the surrounding rock. Arguments in favour of CO 2 storage in depleted gas fields are: proven seal quality, availability of field data, no record of seal integrity failure by fault reactivation from the seismically active producing Dutch gas fields, and the potential benefits of restoring the virgin formation pressure and stress state to geomechanical stability. On the other hand, CO 2 injection in saline aquifers causes <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> that exceeds the virgin hydrostatic pressure. Stress perturbations resulting from <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> affect large areas, extending tens of kilometres away from the injection wells. Induced stresses in top seals are, however, small and do not exceed a few tenths of megapascal for a <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> of a few megapascals in the storage formation. Geomechanical effects on top seals are weak, but could be enhanced close to the injection zone by the thermal effects of injection. Uncertainties related to characterisation of large areas affected by <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> are significant, and seal quality and continuity are more difficult to be demonstrated for aquifers than for depleted gas reservoirs that have held hydrocarbons for millions of years...|$|R

40|$|Geological {{storage of}} CO 2 in deep saline {{formations}} {{is one of}} the promising ways to reduce emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere. This is because of the mature technology {{as a result of the}} experience in oil and gas extraction and the fact that saline formations offer large capacity and immediate availability. However, not all saline formations are suitable for CO 2 storage. One of the important selection criteria for a suitable formation is the existence of sufficient injectivity. Injectivity simply shows how much CO 2 can be injected into a saline formation for a constrained <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up.</b> One of the most important constraints in CO 2 storage is to keep injection well pressure below formation fracture pressure. Otherwise, formation can be fractured which can create pathways for CO 2 to escape from containment. Hence, significance of estimating injectivity should not be underestimated. Analytical models are preferred in preliminary studies to estimate <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up.</b> This thesis presents new analytical tools to estimate <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> at CO 2 injection wells in saline formations. The models developed in this thesis assume injection of CO 2 at constant rate through vertical wells into homogenous and horizontal formations of constant thickness. They model the effects of relative permeability, CO 2 dissolution in formation brine and drying-out on <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up.</b> Analytical solutions are presented for three types of formation outer boundary conditions: closed-boundary, constant pressure-boundary and infinite-acting formation. Using these models, transient pressure behaviour of fully-penetrating wells, partially-penetrating wells and multi-well injection are examined. The predictive capability of analytical models for each case is tested using numerical reservoir simulations. The results show a good agreement between the analytical and numerical computations. For partially-penetrating wells, a total skin factor which is composed of mechanical skin, partial penetration pseudo-skin and two-phase flow effects is introduced. Using the models developed for multi-well injection, the effects of number of injection and pressure relief wells as well as formation properties on total injection rate are studied...|$|R

In this paper, we present an engineering design to control the <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> during CO 2 storage in deep saline aquifers and we propose that the extracted saline formation water can be processed at the industrial level {{in order to produce}} commercial salt. We investigated the effects on various aquifer properties of pressure increases. Several design options for the injection operations are investigated: injection of CO 2 without saline formation water production, injection of CO 2 with one production well and, finally, injection of CO 2 with one left side and one right side production wells. We showed that an increase in saline formation water production rate leads to <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> decreases, when the production rate was tripled (from 61. 42 kg/s to 184. 26 kg/s); the maximum pressure was decreased by about 15 bar. About a half of base case temperature (89 °C to 45 °C) increased the maximum pressure by about 35 bar. The pore compressibility which is a key parameter defining the pressure response to CO 2 injection has also been investigated whereby an increase in pore compressibility leads to decreases in <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up.</b> Simulation results showed that the introduction of two wells (left side and right side of the production well) increases more or less the horizontal migration of the CO 2...|$|R

40|$|The {{scale and}} {{magnitude}} of pressure perturbation and brine migration induced by geologic carbon sequestration is discussed assuming a full-scale deployment scenario in which enough CO{sub 2 } is captured and stored to make relevant contributions to global climate change mitigation. In this scenario, the volumetric rates and cumulative volumes of CO{sub 2 } injection would be comparable to or higher than those related to existing deep-subsurface injection and extraction activities, such as oil production. Large-scale <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> {{in response to the}} injection may limit the dynamic storage capacity of suitable formations, because over-pressurization may fracture the caprock, may drive CO{sub 2 }/brine leakage through localized pathways, and may cause induced seismicity. On the other hand, laterally extensive sedimentary basins may be less affected by such limitations because (i) local pressure effects are moderated by pressure propagation and brine displacement into regions far away from the CO{sub 2 } storage domain; and (ii) diffuse and/or localized brine migration into overlying and underlying formations allows for pressure bleed-off in the vertical direction. A quick analytical estimate of the extent of <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> induced by industrial-scale CO{sub 2 } storage projects is presented. Also discussed are pressure perturbation and attenuation effects simulated for two representative sedimentary basins in the USA: the laterally extensive Illinois Basin and the partially compartmentalized southern San Joaquin Basin in California.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{development}} of commercially applied high pressure processes it is necessary to evaluate the impact of high pressure on the inactivation of bacterial populations. From the results kinetic models should reliably predict inactivation under dynamic conditions. High pressure processes imply an initial phase of <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up,</b> accompanied by a temperature increase due to adiabatic heating. Since pressure application leads to the generation of heat, the question may arise whether this dynamic p-T profile will influence the spore inactivation. The come-up time (the time needed to reach the constant treatment conditions) is an important variable that needs to be considered in the design and optimization of high hydrostatic pressure processes due to its significant contribution to microbial inactivation. The pressure-temperature inactivation kinetics of Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores was first studied under isobaric-isothermal conditions in the pressure range 50 � 400 MPa at temperatures between 25 � 70 °C. Isobaric-isothermal inactivation of spores appears to follow a fairly linear trend and can be described by a first order model. The kinetic parameters (kref, Ea and DV¹) were calculated at different pressure and temperature levels. Assuming first order kinetics for non-isobaric/non-isothermal inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores during the come-up time, the integral effect of the inactivation process under dynamic conditions was quantified. To do that, the above mentioned kinetic parameters were used to calculate the inactivation constants as a function of temperature and pressure. The total come-up time was divided in time steps of one second and the inactivation constants were calculated for each seconds time interval. The experimental <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> was carried out in two different ways: (a) fast � pressure was developed with the highest possible rate and the come-up time was between 118 and 677 seconds depending on the pressure level of the treatment; (b) slow � pressure was built-up with a rate of 20 MPa/min and the come-up time was between 180 and 1337 seconds. The inactivation effects during these come-up times after fast and slow <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> processes were measured and compared with the calculated effects.
