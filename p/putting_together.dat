5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E

The Sounds experienced their longest winning streak in franchise history when they won 15consecutive games from June 2 to June 20, 1999. Overall, the team improved from the previous year, <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> an 80–60 record, but their second-place finish left them out of the PCL playoffs where only division winners advance to the postseason.|$|E

The replay was played on 4 February with a solitary West Ham goal coming from defender Colin Foster, {{securing}} a 1–0 win in front of 17,995 fans at the Racecourse Ground. Arsenal's league form in the meantime stuttered as they recorded no wins in January. The team ended the campaign strongly, <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> a sequence of 16 games unbeaten to finish fourth. In the cup competitions the following season Arsenal performed better; Graham guided his team to success in the Football League and FA Cup finals.|$|E
5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E
5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He picked out the chapters by Driessen, Boyer and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> the book. Hooley concluded his review by claiming that the book offered something to those interested in the place of animals in politics, but that much of its contents would be of more interest for those looking to read about environmental political theory.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the summer}} Phillips was invited by Patrick {{to move to}} Nelson, British Columbia, where the latter was <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> a club of star players to {{challenge}} for the Cup. He played the 1909–10 with the local team, retiring after the season and taking up a position as a manager of a lumber company in Vancouver. However when Patrick and his brother Frank formed the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) in 1911, Phillips was convinced {{to come out of}} retirement and join one of the teams in the new league, the Vancouver Millionaires. Phillips finished the 1912 season fourth on Vancouver in goals, and seventh overall in the league, with seventeen in fourteen games. Phillips, who realized that his skills had diminished, retired {{at the end of the}} season. A close friend of the Patricks, he remained close to the league, and occasionally officiated matches after his retirement.|$|E
5|$|The {{dates of}} Æthelberht's birth and {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Kent are both matters of debate. Bede, the earliest source to give dates, {{is thought to have}} drawn his information from correspondence with Albinus. Bede states that when Æthelberht died in 616 he had reigned for fifty-six years, placing his accession in 560. Bede also says that Æthelberht died twenty-one years after his baptism. Augustine’s mission from Rome is known to have arrived in 597, and according to Bede, it was this mission that converted Æthelberht. Hence Bede’s dates are inconsistent. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, an important source for early dates, is inconsistent with Bede and also has inconsistencies among different manuscript versions. <b>Putting</b> <b>together</b> the different dates in the Chronicle for birth, death, and length of reign, it appears that Æthelberht's reign was thought to have been either 560–616, or 565–618, but that the surviving sources have confused the two traditions.|$|E
5|$|John Robson left Palace {{to manage}} {{neighbours}} Croydon Common F.C for the 1907–08 season, and Edmund Goodman {{took over as}} manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. Bill Davies became the first player from the club to win an international honour when he was called up for Wales. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing the league in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup they fell to their heaviest defeat, a second round replay to Burnley which finished 0–9, a record defeat for Palace and a record victory for Burnley. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish again the following season, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the London Challenge Cup in 1913, overcoming West Ham United 1–0. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913–14 season, the club <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to Swindon Town on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at Highbury, and provided their first England representative in Horace Colclough, who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.|$|E

Although he has no prior football experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback. The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon. Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property. Although she is in love with Tim, she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home. The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant. Even though she is a student at East Dillon, she seeks out Tami's help with the situation. Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion. Her mother goes with her to the procedure. Parents find out about this and led by Luke's mother, seek Mrs. Taylor's dismissal as principal.
