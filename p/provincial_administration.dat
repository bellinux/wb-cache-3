5|$|Diocletian {{reformed}} the <b>provincial</b> <b>administration,</b> {{establishing a}} three-tiered provincial hierarchy, {{in place of}} the previous single-tier structure. The original 42 provinces of the Principate were almost tripled in number to c. 120. These were grouped into 12 divisions called dioceses, each under a vicarius, in turn grouped into 4 praetorian prefectures, to correspond to the areas of command assigned to the four Tetrarchs, who were each assisted by a chief-of-staff called a praefectus praetorio (not be confused with the commanders of the Praetorian Guard, who held the same title). The aim of this fragmentation of <b>provincial</b> <b>administration</b> was probably to reduce the possibility of military rebellion by governors (by reducing the forces they each controlled).|$|E

Afterwards, {{the name of the}} bank was changed to [...] "İller Bankası" [...] on July 27, 1944 amid debates during Budget Committee due to fact that Special <b>Provincial</b> <b>Administrations</b> and villages were out of the scope of loans and assistances, along with increasing urbanization in conjunction with rapid population growth that created more demand on funds. İller Bankası, including Special <b>Provincial</b> <b>Administrations</b> and villages was formally established on June 13, 1945 with law number 4759. İlbank's organizational status was then transformed to an incorporated company with the Law #6107 enacted on January 26, 2011.|$|R

Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona <b>provincial</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many equestrians were publicans, {{in charge}} of tax-collecting in Asia (Asia in Roman times meant {{essentially}} the Roman-dominated area that is now referred to as western Anatolia), and of contracting for construction projects. The equestrian class would get to control a court that tried senators for misconduct in <b>provincial</b> <b>administration.</b> In effect, the equestrians replaced senators already serving at the court. Thus, Gaius became an opponent of senatorial influence. Other reforms implemented by Gaius included fixing prices on grain for the urban population and granting improvements in citizenship for Latins and others outside the city of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{officials}} {{were divided into}} three categories; officials attached to the palace, officials of central administration and officials of <b>provincial</b> <b>administration.</b> One {{of the most important}} positions was the purohita, the advisor of the king. The king also had a board of ministers called amati paheja. In central administration, senapati (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) was a position second only to the king, and held by a member of nobility. This position, and also the positions of yuvaraja (sub king), administrative positions in the country's provinces and major ports and provinces, were often held by relatives of the king.|$|E

Similar to the MMI, the Istanbul Special <b>Provincial</b> <b>Administration</b> has a governor, a democratically elected decision-making body—the Provincial Parliament—and an appointed Executive Committee. Mirroring {{the executive committee}} at the municipal level, the Provincial Executive Committee includes a secretary-general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial Parliament. The Provincial Administration's duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government buildings, and roads, {{and the promotion of}} arts, culture, and nature conservation.

Many of the <b>provincial</b> <b>administration</b> {{buildings}} are located in Badajoz, as well as the government buildings of the municipal administration. Politically, Badajoz belongs to the Spanish Congress Electoral District of Badajoz, which is the largest electoral district about of 52 districts in the Spanish Congress of Deputies in terms of geographical area and includes {{a significant part of the}} Extremadura region. The electoral district was first contested in modern times in the 1977 General Election.

5|$|Following its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the Akkadian empire, to form {{a center}} of the <b>provincial</b> <b>administration.</b> The city {{included}} the whole tell and a lower town at {{the southern edge of}} the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early Akkadian periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple and might have served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the desertification of the region.|$|E
5|$|Reinforced by {{aircraft}} from Sweden, United Nations peacekeepers {{completed the}} first phase of the operation, securing the Katangese capital, Élisabethville, and destroying much of the Katangese Air Force by the end of the year. In early January the United Nations forces turned their attention towards remaining strongholds in southern Katanga. Indian peacekeepers surpassed their orders and crossed the Lufira River ahead of schedule, generating panic behind the Katangese lines and embarrassing the United Nations leadership. Tshombe, realising that his position was untenable, sued Thant for peace. On 17January 1963, he signed an instrument of surrender and declared the Katangese secession to be over. The central government reorganised the <b>provincial</b> <b>administration</b> of Katanga to weaken its political structure. Tshombe initially participated but feared his arrest and fled to Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrene council {{consisted}} {{of about six}} hundred {{members of the local}} elite (such as the elders or heads of wealthy families or clans), representing the city's four-quarters. The council, headed by a president, managed civic responsibilities; it supervised public works (including the construction of public buildings), approved expenditures, collected taxes, and appointed two archons (lords) each year. Palmyra's military was led by strategoi (generals) appointed by the council. Roman provincial authority set and approved Palmyra's tariff structure, but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade most beneficial to Rome. An imposition of direct <b>provincial</b> <b>administration</b> would have jeopardized Palmyra's ability to conduct its trading activities in the East, especially in Parthia.|$|E

40|$|Masters in Public Administration - MPAIn its new democracy, South Africa is busy making {{endeavours}} {{to transform}} and correct the wrongs {{and problems of}} the past. In the process {{it is vital that}} obstacles to development such as corruption in the public sector should be uprooted as they inhibit quality service delivery and further damage the name of the public service. This study compares anti-corruption strategies in South Africa’s Western and Eastern Cape provinces, in particular by looking at both the achievements and limitations that have been experienced. The focus area is the <b>provincial</b> <b>administrations</b> in both provinces. In order to contextualise the evaluation of the anti-corruption strategies pursued by the two <b>provincial</b> <b>administrations,</b> the study also includes an examination of the role of provinces in general in combating corruption. The research methods employed include a detailed survey of documentation published by the provincial governments’ anti-corruption agencies, as well as reports by civil society organizations focusing on corruption in the public sector. The study also draws on semi-structured interviews conducted with key stakeholders in the two provinces. The study concludes by summarizing the successes and limitations of the two <b>provincial</b> <b>administrations</b> in dealing with corruption. A number of practical recommendations are provided to strengthen the future design and implementation of anti-corruption strategies. The empirical research for this research report was carried out in 2003 before the national and provincial elections of 2004. South Afric...|$|R

5|$|The Ming {{emperors}} {{took over}} the <b>provincial</b> <b>administration</b> system of the Yuan dynasty, and the thirteen Ming provinces are the precursors of the modern provinces. Throughout the Song dynasty, the largest political division was the circuit (lu 路). However, after the Jurchen invasion in 1127, the Song court established four semi-autonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units, with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Copied on the Yuan model, the Ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions: one civil, one military, and one for surveillance. Below {{the level of the}} province (sheng 省) were prefectures (fu 府) operating under a prefect (zhifu 知府), followed by subprefectures (zhou 州) under a subprefect. The lowest unit was the county (xian 縣), overseen by a magistrate. Besides the provinces, there were also two large areas that belonged to no province, but were metropolitan areas (jing 亰) attached to Nanjing and Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Tulun now {{seized the}} initiative. Having served {{in his youth}} in the border wars with the Byzantine Empire at Tarsus, he now {{requested}} to be conferred the command of the frontier districts of Cilicia (the Thughūr). Al-Muwaffaq initially refused, but following the Byzantine successes of the previous years al-Mu'tamid prevailed upon his brother and in 877/8 Ibn Tulun received responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the Cilician frontier. Ibn Tulun marched into Syria in person. He received the submission of the son of Amajur, who had recently died, whom he appointed governor at Ramla, and proceeded to take possession of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. At Damascus Ibn Tulun encountered his old rival Ibn al-Mudabbir, who since his eviction from Egypt had served as Amajur's ʿāmil for Palestine and Damascus. Ibn al-Mudabbir was fined 600,000 dinars and thrown into prison, where he died in 883/4. In {{the rest of the}} <b>provincial</b> <b>administration,</b> however, he largely left the people who had served under Amajur in place. Only the governor of Aleppo, Sima al-Tawil, resisted, and fled to Antioch. Ibn Tulun laid siege to the city until Sima was killed, reportedly by a local woman. He then continued on to Tarsus, where he began preparing for a campaign against the Byzantines. The presence of his numerous soldiers, however, led to a rapid rise in prices, causing great hostility among the Tarsians, who demanded that he either leave or reduce his army. At this juncture, news arrived from Egypt that his son Abbas, whom he had left as his regent, was preparing to usurp his position under the influence of his entourage. Ibn Tulun hastily withdrew from Tarsus, but as more information about the situation in Egypt began to arrive, clarifying that Abbas posed no real threat, Ibn Tulun decided to spend more time in Syria and consolidate his authority. He redressed the injustices of Sima, installed troops in Aleppo (under his ghulam Lu'lu') and Harran, secured the co-operation of the Banu Kilab tribe and their leader Ibn al-Abbas, and captured the rebel Musa ibn Atamish. At some point after his takeover of Syria, Ibn Tulun ordered the refortification of Akka, a task undertaken by Abu Bakr al-Banna, the grandfather of al-Muqaddasi, who provides {{a detailed description of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|The <b>provincial</b> <b>administration</b> {{is set up}} {{purely for}} {{administrative}} purposes. The province is headed by a minister appointed by the President and there are ministries of central government for each province. The administrative head of the province is the Permanent Secretary, appointed by the President. There is a Deputy Permanent Secretary, heads of government departments and civil servants at the provincial level. Central Province is divided into six districts: Chibombo District, Kabwe District, Kapiri Mposhi District, Mkushi District, Mumbwa District and Serenje District. All of the district headquarters {{are the same as}} the district names. There are six councils in the province, each of which is headed by an elected representative, called a councilor. Each councilor holds office for three years. The administrative staff of the council is selected based on the Local Government Service Commission from within or outside the district. The office of the provincial government is located in each of the district headquarters and has provincial local government officers and auditors. Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes and the budgets of the council are audited and submitted every year after the annual budget. The elected members of the council do not draw salaries, but are paid allowances from the council. Central Province is predominantly rural and hence there are no city or municipal councils. The government stipulates 63 different functions for the councils, with the majority of them being infrastructure management and local administration. Councils are mandated to maintain each of their community centres, zoos, local parks, drainage systems, playgrounds, cemeteries, caravan sites, libraries, museums and art galleries. They also work with specific government departments for helping in agriculture, conservation of natural resources, providing postal service, and establishing and maintaining hospitals, schools and colleges. The councils prepare schemes that encourage community participation.|$|E
