5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California.

5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
