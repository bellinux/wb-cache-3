Here, we reported the phototrophic features and proteome of an aerobic phototrophic bacterium Roseobacter denitrificans under starvation stress. The fluorescence induction and relaxation measurements suggested that the photosynthetic capacity in R. denitrificans was preserved but was lower than in the <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The existence of light-harvesting complexes (LH 1 and LH 2) and the reaction center (RC) in the native membrane were demonstrated through atomic force microscopy image analysis as direct evidence of their phototrophy. The homology-based LH 1 -RC complex structure {{was proposed in which}} RC was the Rb. sphaeroides homolog structure surrounded by the LH 1. Moreover, the protein expression profiles of cells in the stationary phase under heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions show that light enhanced or activated some proteins such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and NifU to cope with the low levels of amino acids and carbon sources under starvation conditions...|$|E
40|$|The first {{essential}} step {{in protein}} photoreception is the capture and storage of energy from a photon. We have recently identified and isolated, from the purple <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Ectothiorhodospira halophila, a 13, 000 -dalton photoactive yellow protein (PYP) {{that has a}} photocycle with kinetics similar to sensory rhodopsin and a very high quantum efficiency. To study the structural chemistry of protein photoreception, we determined, refined, and analyzed the crystallographic structure of PYP at 2. 4 A resolution and report here that it is composed of two perpendicular antiparallel beta-sheets that enclose the chromophore. Each of the 10 beta-strands of PYP is connected directly to its nearest neighbor with + 1 topology. Globally, an asymmetric distribution of side chains places aromatic and acidic side chains in an ellipsoidal band around the chromophore with a cluster of basic side chains on one side. Locally, the electron density maps place an internal lysine and the chromophore in an apparent Schiff base linkage stabilized by a buried glutamate and a tyrosine side chain. To our knowledge, the atomic resolution structure of a protein with a reversible photoisomerization has not been reported previously. Furthermore, PYP may also represent a class of proteins that bind conjugated molecules and interact with a secondary receptor system...|$|E
30|$|Based on ribosomal {{sequence}} analyses, bacterial associates {{were all}} found {{to belong to}} Rhodopseudomonas, a genus of alpha proteobacteria closely related to Bradyrhizobium (Giraud and Fleischman 2004). Among Rhodopseudomonas species, R. palustris is a <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> taxonomically close to some photoheterotrophic Bradyrhizobium species, that efficiently nodulates stems and roots of the legume Aeschynomene. At this time, no strains of R. palustris are described as nodulating legumes, but they quite commonly harbor nifH genes (Cantera et al. 2004). The low discriminatory power of 16 S rRNA has long been recognized within the Bradyrhizobiaceae (Willems et al. 2001), necessitating a complementary characterization using other targets, such as 16 S- 23 S ITS. Both these targets allowed us to confirm the close relationships between Rhodopseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium. Moreover, when we re-blasted the ITS sequences of Bradyrhizobium sp. CCBAU 85059, isolated, as strain CCBAU 85080, from Astragalus tatsienensis nodules in Tibet (Hou et al. 2009), the closest identified strains belonged to the genus Rhodopseudomonas. This is probably {{a result of the}} fact that these authors only considered the genus Bradyrhizobium in their phylogenetic analyses. Concerning strain R_ 45974 of T. robiniae, isolated from root nodules of Robinia pseudoacacia, it was previously described as Rhodopseudomonas sp. (De Meyer et al. 2011) {{on the basis of a}} 16 S rRNA gene phylogeny. More recently, it has been re-assigned to this new genus in Bradyrhizobiaceae after complementary characterization comprising physiological and biochemical tests, and sequencing of housekeeping genes (De Meyer et al. 2012).|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of banded iron formation (BIF) deposition is controversial, but classically {{has been interpreted}} to reflect ferrous iron [Fe(II) ] oxidation by molecular oxygen after cyanobacteria evolved on Earth.

Calculations based on experimentally determined Fe(II) oxidation rates by these organisms under light regimes representative of ocean water at depths {{of a few hundred}} meters suggest that, even in the presence of cyanobacteria, anoxygenic phototrophs living beneath a wind-mixed surface layer provide the most likely explanation for BIF deposition in a stratified ancient ocean and the absence of Fe in Precambrian surface waters...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} effects related to known and {{proposed}} biosynthetic pathways on the 13 C content of lipids and storage {{products of the}} <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Chloroflexus aurantiacus, the isotopic compositions of bulk cell material, alkyl and isoprenoid lipids, and storage products such as glycogen and polyhydroxyalkanoic acids have been investigated. The bulk cell material was 13 depleted in 13 C relative to the dissolved inorganic carbon. Evidently, inorganic carbon fixation by the main carboxylating enzymes used by C. aurantiacus, which are assumed to use bicarbonate rather than CO 2, results in a relatively small carbon isotopic fractionation compared with CO 2 fixation by the Calvin cycle. Even carbon numbered fatty acids, odd carbon numbered fatty acids, and isoprenoid lipids were 14, 15, and 17 - 18 depleted in 13 C relative to the carbon source, respectively. Based on the 13 C contents of alkyl and isoprenoid lipids, a 40 difference in 13 C content between the carboxyl and methyl carbon from acetyl-coenzyme A has been calculated. Both sugars and polyhydroxyalkanoic acid were enriched in 13 C relative to the alkyl and isoprenoid lipids. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this is the first report in which the stable carbon isotopic composition of a large range of biosynthetic products in a photoautotrophic organism has been investigated and interpreted based on previously proposed inorganic carbon fixation and biosynthetic pathways.

Here we report a widely applicable and straightforward method for light-limited batch cultivation of phototrophic bacteria at different, yet constant, growth rates. We illustrate its usage with Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a model cyanobacterium used as a chassis for sustainable cell-factories and capable of turning CO 2 into commodity products. The cultivation method we developed resembles a ‘photonfluxostat’. It enables {{the setting of the}} growth rate of phototrophs during batch cultivation by adjustment of the illumination intensity (‘photon dosing’). Using this method to study the growth-rate response of Synechocystis, we found that while the cell volume increased, the chlorophyll a content and the PSI/PSII ratio decreased, as growth rate increased. This method allows for a quantitative and controlled study of the light-dependent physiology of phototropic bacteria, a highly relevant group of bacteria for modern biotechnology...|$|R
40|$|By sensing {{changes in}} one or few {{environmental}} factors biological systems can anticipate future changes in multiple factors {{over a wide range}} of time scales (daily to seasonal). This anticipatory behavior is important to the fitness of diverse species, and in context of the diurnal cycle it is overall typical of eukaryotes and some <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria</b> but is yet to be observed in archaea. Here, we report the first observation of light-dark (LD) -entrained diurnal oscillatory transcription in up to 12 % of all genes of a halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC- 1. Significantly, the diurnally entrained transcription was observed under constant darkness after removal of the LD stimulus (free-running rhythms). The memory of diurnal entrainment was also associated with the synchronization of oxic and anoxic physiologies to the LD cycle. Our results suggest that under nutrient limited conditions halophilic archaea take advantage of the causal influence of sunlight (via temperature) on O 2 diffusivity in a closed hypersaline environment to streamline their physiology and operate oxically during nighttime and anoxically during daytime...|$|R
30|$|About 7000 algal {{species are}} found in the world. The reasons behind the choice of microalgae as {{pollutant}} removal agent are numerous. Some of them are: (1) microalgae are capable of biofixing CO 2 from waste gas/atmosphere; (2) they can utilize low-quality water, such as agricultural and municipal run-off, industrial wastewater containing toxic metals, organic matters; (3) algal bodies can live in natural weather condition; (4) they provide much higher yields of biomass when grown in wastewater; and (5) high-quality agricultural land is not required to grow the algal cells (Ramanan et al. 2010; Sen et al. 2017). Cyanobacteria, a <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> also known as blue green algae, are recommended to have some additional advantages such as higher mucilage volume, greater binding affinity, simple nutrient requirements and larger surface area which leads to a better treatment in combating pollution over other microorganisms (Sen et al. 2017).

40|$|Microbial mats are structured, {{small-scale}} microbial ecosystems, andsimilar as biofilms cover a substratum like a tissue. A general {{characteristic of}} amicrobial mat is the steep physicochemical gradients {{that are the}} result of the metabolicactivities of the mat microorganisms.

In illuminated environments photoautotrophic organisms are the drivingforce and these mats are subject of this chapter. In the vast majority of cases, primaryproduction by the oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacteria is the basis of adiverse community that forms a living entity with a macroscopic habitus.

40|$|Phytoplankton and {{bacterial}} pigment compositions {{were determined}} by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LCMS) in two freshwater reservoirs (Tillari Dam and Selaulim Dam), which are located at {{the foothills of the}} Western Ghats in India. These reservoirs experience anoxia in the hypolimnion during summer. Water samples were collected from both reservoirs during anoxic periods while one of them (Tillari Reservoir) was also sampled in winter, when convective mixing results in well-oxygenated conditions throughout the water column. During the periods of anoxia (summer), bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) e isomers and isoreneiratene, characteristic of brown sulfur bacteria, were dominant in the anoxic (sulfidic) layer of the Tillari Reservoir under low light intensities. The winter observations showed the dominance of small cells of Chlorophyll-b containing green algae and cyanobacteria, with minor presence of fucoxanthin-containing diatoms and peridinin-containing dinoflagellates. Using total BChl-e concentration observed in June, the standing stock of brown sulfur bacteria carbon in the Tillari Reservoir was computed to be 2. 4 gC m− 2 , which is much higher than the similar estimate for carbon derived from oxygenic photosynthesis (0. 82 gC m− 2 ). These results highlight the importance of anoxygenic photosynthetic biomass in tropical freshwater systems. The Selaulim Reservoir also displayed similar characteristics with the presence of BChl-e isomers and isorenieratene in the anoxic hypolimnion during summer. Although sulfidic conditions prevailed in the water column below the thermocline, the occurrence of <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria</b> was restricted only to mid-depths (maximal concentration of BChl-e isomers was noted at 0. 2 % of the surface incident light). This shows that the vertical distribution of <b>photoautotrophic</b> sulfur <b>bacteria</b> is primarily controlled by light penetration in the water column where the presence of H 2 S provides a suitable biogeochemical environment for them to flourish...|$|R

Several aquatic bloom-forming species of cyanobacteria produce toxic secondary metabolites that are hazardous to humans and animals. This thesis presents the study of cyanobacterial communities and cyanotoxins in relation to water quality parameters in two coastal lagoons - Lake Paliastomi and Lake Nurigeli situated in Georgia. Microscopic, immunological (ELISA) and molecular techniques (PCR) combined with physical-chemical parameters were applied to evaluate ecological conditions of Lake Paliastomi and Lake Nurigeli with the focus on cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. Cyanobacteria species identified by microscopy in these lakes belong to genera Anabaena, Anabaenopsis and Microcystis. Microscopic analyses were in accordance with PCR amplification, which was positive for oxyphotobacteria specific primers. Negative results on PCR when amplifying mcy gene regions could also be linked to low concentrations of microcystin. Toxin analyses demonstrated low concentrations of microcystin and saxitoxin and high concentrations of anatoxin-a in two lakes. On the bases of total phosphorus concentrations (0, 1 - 0, 2 mg/L), temperature (25, 2 - 29, 2 °C) and pH (7, 4 - 9, 2) Lake Paliastomi and Lake Nurigeli provide good environments for cyanobacteria...|$|R

Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 contains genes encoding a well-characterized Ktr-type K uptake transporter (Ktr) and a putative ATP-dependent transporter specific for K (Kdp). The contributions {{of each of these}} K trans-port systems to cellular K homeostasis have not yet been defined conclusively. To verify the functionality of Kdp, kdp genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, where Kdp conferred K uptake, albeit with lower rates than were conferred by Ktr. An on-chip microfluidic device enabled monitoring of the biphasic initial volume recovery of single Synechocystis cells after hyperos-motic shock. Here, Ktr functioned as the primary K uptake system during the first recovery phase, whereas Kdp did not con-tribute significantly. The expression of the kdp operon in Synechocystiswas induced by extracellular K depletion. Correspondingly, Kdp-mediated K uptake supported Synechocystis cell growth with trace amounts of external potassium. This induction of kdp expression depended on two adjacent genes, hik 20 and rre 19, encoding a putative two-component system. The circadian expression of kdp and ktr peaked at subjective dawn, which may support the acquisition of K required for the regular diurnal photosynthetic metabolism. These results indicate that Kdp contributes to the maintenance of a basal intracellular...|$|R

Here we provide evidence that phosphorus (P) is deficient and limiting in the supraglacial environment on a Svalbard glacier, we show how the microbial community responds to the P stress and we quantify the contribution of the microbes to the cycling of the dominant organic P in the supraglacial environment. Incubation of cryoconite debris revealed significant phosphatase activity in the samples (19 – 67 nmol MUP g&minus; 1 h&minus; 1 ), which was controlled by the concentration of inorganic P during incubations and had its optimum at around 30 &deg;C. The phosphatase activity rates measured at near-in situ temperature and substrate concentration imply that the available dissolved organic P can be turned over by microbes within ~ 3 – 11 h on the glacier surface. By contrast, the amount of potentially bioavailable debris-bound organic P is sufficient for a whole ablation season. However, it is apparent that some of this potentially bioavailable debris-bound P is not accessible to the microbes...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen is an {{essential}} and major component of biomass. While virtually all life depends on combined forms of nitrogen that are usually limited in availability, some prokaryotes, including many groups of cyanobacteria, can use the ubiquitous atmospheric dinitrogen (N 2). As <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria</b> they can easily meet the energy demand that is required by nitrogenase, the enzyme that reduces N 2 to NH 3. However, nitrogenase is very sensitive to oxygen and the oxygenic cyanobacteria have evolved various strategies {{to cope with this}} paradox. Primary production in the ocean is generally considered to be limited by nitrogen. In recent years it has become clear that N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria are important in the nitrogen budget of the surface oceans. Estimates of N 2 fixation indicate that approximately half of global N 2 fixation occurs in the sea. N 2 fixation is not distributed homogenously throughout the oceans. Pelagic diazotrophic cyanobacteria are only found in (sub) tropical oceans and are notably absent in temperate and colder seas. However, at lower salinities in estuaries and other brackish environments, N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria can be abundant. N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria are also abundant in benthic mats in coastal and aquatic environments all over the globe, including polar regions. This demonstrates that N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria are not excluded from temperate and cold marine environments, even though they are only found in the water column of warm oceans. In this chapter we will discuss these aspects and review the existing knowledge of the diversity of N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria and the factors that determine their global distribution. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that oxidize {{ferrous iron}} (Fe[II]) under {{anaerobic}} conditions {{are thought to}} be ancient in origin, and the ferric (hydr) oxide mineral products of their metabolism are likely to be preserved in ancient rocks. Here, two enrichment cultures of Fe(II) -oxidizing photoautotrophs and a culture of the genus Thiodictyon were studied with respect to their ability to fractionate Fe isotopes. Fe isotope fractionations produced by both the enrichment cultures and the Thiodictyon culture were relatively constant at early stages of the reaction progress, where the ^(56) Fe/^(54) Fe ratios of poorly crystalline hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) metabolic products were enriched in the heavier isotope relative to aqueous ferrous iron (Fe[II]_(aq)) by ∼ 1. 5 ± 0. 2 ‰. This fractionation appears to be independent of the rate of photoautotrophic Fe(II) -oxidation, and is comparable to that observed for Fe isotope fractionation by dissimilatory Fe(III) -reducing bacteria. Although there remain a number of uncertainties regarding how the overall measured isotopic fractionation is produced, the most likely mechanisms include (1) an equilibrium effect produced by biological ligands, or (2) a kinetic effect produced by precipitation of HFO overlaid upon equilibrium exchange between Fe(II) and Fe(III) species. The fractionation we observe is similar in direction to that measured for abiotic oxidation of Fe(II) _(aq) by molecular oxygen. This suggests that the use of Fe isotopes to identify phototrophic Fe(II) -oxidation in the rock record may only be possible during time periods in Earth’s history when independent evidence exists for low ambient oxygen contents...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Fe(II) -oxidizing <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria</b> may have catalyzed the precipitation of an ancient class of sedimentary deposits known as Banded Iron Formations. In order to evaluate this claim, it is necessary to define and understand this process at a molecular level so that putative Fe-isotope "biosignatures" in ancient rocks can be interpreted. In this report, we characterize the substrates and products of photoautotrophic Fe(II) -oxidation by three phylogenetically distinct Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria. In every case, dissolved Fe(II) is used as the substrate for oxidation, and there is no evidence for active dissolution of poorly soluble Fe(II) -minerals by biogenic organic ligands. Poorly crystalline Fe(III) (hydr) oxide mineral phases are initially precipitated, and as they age, rapidly convert to the crystalline minerals goethite and lepidocrocite. Although the precipitates appear to associate with the cell wall, they do not cover it entirely, and precipitate-free cells represent {{a significant portion of the}} population in aged cultures. Citrate is occasionally detected at nanomolar concentrations in all culture fluids, whereas an unknown organic molecule is always present in two out of the three bacterial cultures. Whether these molecules are released by the cell to bind Fe(III) and prevent the cell from encrustation by Fe(III) (hydr) oxides is uncertain, but seems unlikely if we assume Fe(II) -oxidation occurs at the cell surface. In light of the energetic requirement the cell would face to produce ligands for this purpose, and given the local acidity metabolically generated in the microenvironment surrounding Fe(II) -oxidizing cells, our results suggest that Fe(III) is released in a dissolved form as an inorganic aqueous complex and/or as a colloidal aggregate prior to mineral precipitation. The implication of these results for the interpretation of Fe-isotope fractionation measured for this class of bacteria (Croal et al., 2004) is that equilibrium processes involving free biological ligands do not account for the observed fractionation...|$|R

Freshwater bacteria {{play a key}} role in the regulation of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems. Bacteria mediate the availability of nutrients tied up in organic molecules and are therefore capable of constraining both primary production and higher trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems. To assess how changes in temperature and phosphorus availability impact three diverse strains of heterotrophic bacteria (Agrobacterium sp., Flavobacterium sp.,and Arthrobacter sp. isolated from Lake Itasca State Park, MN, I investigated 1) the effects of phosphorus availability on bacterial biomass composition, 2) the effects of temperature on bacterial biomass composition and 3) the combined effects of phosphorus availability and temperature on bacterial biomass composition. To assess how phosphorus availability impacts biomass composition in <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria</b> Synechocystis sp PCC 6803, the effect of phosphorus availability was investigated. Under phosphorus limitation I observed two distinct strategies adopted by the three heterotrophic strains. Either the cells became large, long and thin or they stayed relatively small and coccoid in shape. Both strategies observed under phosphorus limitation resulted in different patterns of cellular phosphorus allocation. Controlling for growth rate across changing temperatures, I observed that as temperature increased, all three strains decreased their cellular size, and their carbon, phosphorus, and nucleic acid content. However, a pronounced decrease in DNA content was observed in only one strain. The combined impact of increasing temperature and phosphorus limitation resulted in a more dramatic decrease in cellular size and cellular carbon than when phosphorus was not limiting. These findings suggest no one strategy is adopted by heterotrophic bacteria under phosphorus limitation or across changing temperature. Secondly, I observed that changes in phosphorus availability resulted in a much more flexible C:P biomass composition in Synechocystis than changes in nitrogen availability. These findings suggest that less carbon may be in bacterial biomass when cells are nitrogen limited than when cells are phosphorus limited. These results provide insights into the impact that both increasing temperature and phosphorus has on microbial composition and the potential effects of that composition on the microbial loop in aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthesis is {{the process}} by which light energy is {{converted}} into chemical products, in <b>photoautotrophic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> algae and plants. The principal idea is the production of reducing agents by photo-induced oxidation of a sacrificial electron donor. Photosystem II in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, absorbs light and catalyzes the oxidation of water, liberating electrons that are used to form reductants. By capturing light, plants and algae provide the entire biosphere with an electron source for the buildup of living tissue. The active site for photosynthetic water oxidation contains a tetranuclear manganese cluster and a redox active tyrosyl residue. Together with the photosensitizer chlorophylls in the reaction center of Photosystem II, the manganese and the tyrosine activate and split water molecules into molecular oxygen, electrons and protons. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the nature of the manganese binding site, and the electron transfer reactions involved in the assembly of the manganese cluster were investigated. Selective chemical modification of histidyl and carboxylic acid residues was conducted on the manganese binding area of Photosystem II. Kinetic studies of manganese binding after chemical modification revealed binding sites with different affinity for manganese. Two binding sites containing histidines were found, and two or more sites of carboxylic acid residues. The participation of the redox active cofactors Tyrosine-D and cytochrome-b 559 in the activation of the water oxidizing center was studied using EPR spectroscopy. Tyrosine-D and cytochrome-b 559 was found to aid Photosystem II in the assembly of a functional manganese cluster, by acting as auxilliary electron donors, and in the case of cytochrome-b 559 under high light intensities, also as auxilliary electron acceptor. The two cofactors thereby prevent light-induced protein damadge during activation of the water oxidizing complex. In the second part of the thesis, the properties and reactions of novel compounds, synthesized with the objective to mimic the water oxidizing complex, were studied by optical and EPR spectroscopy. A ruthenium complex, serving as photosensitizer, was covalently connetced to a tyrosine. Light-induced electron transfer from the tyrosine to the ruthenium part was generated in the complex, similar to the reactions in Photosystem II. This super-molecule was then allowed to react with a synthetic dinuclear manganese complex. Electron transfer from manganese to the photooxidized tyrosine was observed, thereby mimicking the stepwise electron transfer reactions that take place on the electron donor side of Photosystem II. This is the first functional mimic of the water oxidizing triad in Photosystem II, and a new platform for regenerative electron donor systems in artificial photosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Green sulfur {{bacteria}} (GSB) {{constitute a}} closely related group of <b>photoautotrophic</b> and thiotrophic <b>bacteria</b> with limited phenotypic variation. They typically oxidize sulfide and thiosulfate to sulfate with sulfur globules as an intermediate. Based on genome sequence information from 15 strains, {{the distribution and}} phylogeny of enzymes involved in their oxidative sulfur metabolism was investigated. At least one homolog of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is present in all strains. In all sulfur-oxidizing GSB strains except the earliest diverging Chloroherpeton thalassium, the sulfide oxidation product is further oxidized to sulfite by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR) system. This system consists of components horizontally acquired partly from sulfide-oxidizing and partly from sulfate-reducing bacteria. Depending on the strain, the sulfite is probably oxidized to sulfate by one of two different mechanisms that have different evolutionary origins: adenosine- 5 ’-phosphosulfate reductase (APR) or polysulfide reductase-like complex 3 (PSRLC 3). Thiosulfate utilization by the SOX system in GSB has apparently been acquired horizontally from proteobacteria. SoxCD does not occur in GSB, and its function in sulfate formation in other bacteria {{has been replaced by}} the DSR system in GSB. Sequence analyses suggested that the conserved soxJXYZAKBW gene cluster was horizontally acquired by Chlorobium phaeovibrioides DSM 265 from the Chlorobaculum lineage and that this acquisition was mediated by a mobile genetic element. Thus, the last common ancestor of currently known GSB was probably photoautotrophic, hydrogenotrophic, and contained SQR but not DSR or SOX. In addition, the predominance of the Chlorobium-Chlorobaculum-Prosthecochloris lineage among cultured GSB could be due to the horizontally acquired DSR and SOX systems. Finally, based upon structural, biochemical, and phylogenetic analyses, a uniform nomenclature is suggested for sqr genes in prokaryotes...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{hypothesis}} that <b>photoautotrophic</b> Fe(II) -oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> catalyzed the deposition of Banded Iron Formations (BIFs), an enigmatic class of ancient sedimentary rocks is explored. Ecophysiological, geochemical, genetic and biochemical approaches are taken to elucidate the molecular mechanism of photoautotrophic Fe(II) oxidation {{in an effort to}} identify molecular biosignatures that are unique to this metabolism and capable of being preserved BIFs. In an ecophysiological approach, we show that Fe(II) oxidation by these phototrophs proceeds at appreciable rates in the presence of high concentrations of H 2 when CO 2 is abundant. These findings substantiate a role for the involvement of these phototrophs in BIF deposition under the presumed geochemical conditions of the Archean. In a geochemical approach, we find that although phylogenetically distinct phototrophs fractionate Fe isotopes {{in a way that is}} consistent with Fe isotopic values found in Precambrian BIFs, it is unlikely that this fractionation can be used as a biosignature for this metabolism given its similarity to fractionations produced by abiotic Fe(II) oxidation reactions. In two distinct genetic approaches, we identify genes involved in Fe(II) oxidation in Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE- 1 and Rhodobacter SW 2. Genes identified in TIE- 1 encode a predicted integral membrane protein that appears to be part of an ABC transport system and a putative CobS, an enzyme involved in cobalamin (vitamin B 12) biosynthesis. Candidate genes on a cloned fragment of the Rhodobacter SW 2 genome that confer Fe(II) oxidation activity to a non-oxidizing strain include those predicted to encode permeases and a protein with potential redox capability. Finally, in a preliminary biochemical approach, c-type cytochromes and other proteins that are exclusive or more highly expressed under Fe(II) growth conditions in TIE- 1 and SW 2 are identified in SDS-PAGE gels. The work described here furthers our search for a biosignature unique to photoautotrophic Fe(II) oxidation by providing mechanistic information on this metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acids {{produced}} by H 2 -metabolizing bacteria are sometimes observed {{to be more}} D-depleted than those of photoautotrophic organisms, a trait that has been suggested as diagnostic for chemoautotrophic bacteria. The biochemical reasons for such a depletion are not known, but are often assumed to involve the strong D-depletion of H 2. Here, we cultivated the bacterium Cupriavidus necator H 16 (formerly Ralstonia eutropha H 16) under aerobic, H 2 -consuming, chemoautotrophic conditions and measured the isotopic compositions of its fatty acids. In parallel with the wild type, two mutants of this strain, each lacking one of two key hydrogenase enzymes, were also grown and measured. In all three strains, fractionations between fatty acids and water ranged from - 173 ‰ to - 235 ‰, and averaged - 217 ‰, - 196 ‰, and - 226 ‰, respectively, for the wild type, SH- mutant, and MBH- mutant. There was a modest increase in δD {{as a result of}} loss of the soluble hydrogenase enzyme. Fractionation curves for all three strains were constructed by growing parallel cultures in waters with δDwater values of approximately - 25 ‰, 520 ‰, and 1100 ‰. These curves indicate that at least 90 % of the hydrogen in fatty acids is derived from water, not H 2. Published details of the biochemistry of the soluble and membrane-bound hydrogenases confirm that these enzymes transfer electrons rather than intact hydride (H-) ions, providing no direct mechanism to connect the isotopic composition of H 2 to that of lipids. Multiple lines of evidence thus agree that in this organism, and presumably others like it, environmental H 2 plays little or no direct role in controlling lipid δD values. The observed fractionations must instead result from isotope effects in the reduction of NAD(P) H by reductases with flavin prosthetic groups, which transfer two electrons and acquire H+ (or D+) from solution. Parallels to NADPH reduction in photosynthesis may explain why D/H fractionations in C. necator are nearly identical to those in many <b>photoautotrophic</b> algae and <b>bacteria.</b> We conclude that strong D-depletion is not a diagnostic feature of chemoautotrophy...|$|R
