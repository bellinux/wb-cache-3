5000|$|A Tullgren funnel, {{also known}} as Berlese funnel or Berlese trap, is an {{apparatus}} used to extract living organisms, particularly arthropods, from samples of soil.

40|$|Methods {{used for}} sample storage, {{specimen}} clearing, slide mounting, species illustration and morphometric description in alpha-taxonomic studies {{are essential for}} the Eriophyoidea. Eriophyoid mites are very tiny and delicate, for which truly permanent specimen slides currently cannot be prepared, resulting in eventual loss of material, including type specimens. Often, published descriptions and drawings have not achieved the required level of quality, and thus many relevant taxonomic details have been permanently lost or neglected. These shortcomings can make certain identifications impossible and cause significant confusion. Consequently, there is a considerable need for accurate and uniform descriptive and illustrative data for the Eriophyoidea.

40|$|Most {{available}} predictive {{models are}} developed {{on the basis}} of data obtained in liquid microbiological media, or by challenge tests in real foods. Although liquid microbiological media are convenient and reproducible, they do not include the effect of different food (micro) structures, such as aqueous gels, emulsions and gelled emulsions. On the other hand, in challenge tests all factors influencing microbial growth are included, but they lack in reproducibility, are expensive and time-consuming. The aim of this dissertation was to investigate the effect of the food matrix complexity on the growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes, with particular focus on the influence of (i) the background microflora and (ii) the physicochemical characteristics and processing technology on Frankfurter sausages and (iii) the food (micro) structure by means of food (model) systems. The target microorganism was Listeria monocytogenes, as {{it is one of the}} major microbial threats in the food industry. The target food system was Frankfurter sausages, as they are easily available in market, complex in (micro) structure and related to cases of listeriosis. Model systems, which cover the whole spectrum of (micro) structural complexity and at the same time approach the compositional and physicochemical characteristics of the target food system, were produced. Firstly, it was necessary to define the fastest growing strain of L. monocytogenes, among three isolates from meat products. Growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes strains were compared with the aid of the Time-To-Detection (TTD) method, under physicochemical conditions similar to Frankfurters. This method exhibited a few limitations at stressing conditions and low inoculum levels. A sensitivity analysis of the factors that influence the output of this method (growth parameters) was carried out. Results demonstrated that the output of the method was significantly affected by all factors. The factors exhibiting the highest influence on the results were (i) the calibration curve relating viable plate counts and Optical Density (OD) data; (ii) the approach to estimate TTD values; (iii) the detection limit of OD measurements; and (iv) the range of the initial cell concentrations considered (N 0). Overall, lag phase (λ) estimates were more sensitive than maximum specific growth rate (μmax) estimates. The approach to estimate TTD values and the OD detection limit were the most influential factors for the μmax and λ estimation. Secondly, the effect of the dominant indigenous microflora (Leuconostoc carnosum) was studied on L. monocytogenes growth on vacuum packed Frankfurter sausages. Results demonstrated that at low temperature and high L. carnosum inoculum level, L. monocytogenes stops growing earlier than L. carnosum and the lowest maximum population is reached. Two models were used to fit the experimental data in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results. The Dens et al. model described species interactions, which revealed a predominant effect of L. carnosum on L. monocytogenes, and described the decrease phase of L. monocytogenes population. The Baranyi and Roberts model, a special case of the Dens et al. model for monoculture, estimated the apparent maximum population and brought into question the validity of the Jameson effect at low temperature, which describes the simultaneous halt of growth of two species in co-culture. Furthermore, compositional, physicochemical and processing aspects were evaluated on their influence on the growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes on real vacuum-packed Frankfurters. This work demonstrated that even products of the same commercial type might exhibit significant differences on their growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes. Results indicated that there were no major significant differences in physicochemical characteristics for two types of sausages but, there was statistically significant variability at the concentration of <b>preservatives.</b> <b>Liquid</b> systems, with the same preservatives’ level as the two types of sausages, exhibited a lower variability in growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes than the two types of sausages. This observation led to the conclusion that other factors, such as the presence or absence of the sausage casing, and differences in the (micro) structure and processing factors affect the growth dynamics ofL. monocytogenes on different types of Frankfurter sausages. The previous results served as a benchmark for the design and production of the model systems. The growth dynamics of L. monocytogenes were studied in/on these food (model) systems (liquids, aqueous gels, emulsions, gelled emulsions and canned meat, which was specifically ordered for the needs of this study and had specified composition). Results showed that L. monocytogenes grows faster on canned meat, then in the liquids followed by aqueous gels, gelled emulsions and finally in emulsions. These findings emphasised that predictive models that do not include the effect of food (micro) structure might underestimate the growth of foodborne pathogens, which poses a risk for the microbiological food safety. The importance of developing suitable food (model) systems that approach real food products and isolate the effect of the (micro) structure has been introduced in this dissertation, as it still remains a challenge. Overall, experimental data need to be collected and predictive models, which incorporate the combination of all factors influencing microbial growth need to be developed, in order to contribute and ensure microbiological food safety. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Ethanol {{serves as}} a solvent and {{microbial}} <b>preservative</b> in oral <b>liquid</b> medications and {{is the second most}} commonly used solvent in liquid medications following water. Despite widespread use of ethanol in liquid medications for neonates, the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of ethanol in young children are not well described. The aim of the current study is to quantify blood ethanol levels in neonates secondary to oral ethanol containing medications. Methods: Neonates who received either oral phenobarbital (15 % ethanol) and/or oral dexamethasone (30 % ethanol) per standard of care were eligible for enrollment. A maximum of 6 blood samples per patient (4. 5 mL total) were taken over the study period. Blood samples were collected via heel stick at the time of clinical laboratory collections or following a specific collection for study purposes. In addition, blood samples were collected from neonates receiving sublingual buprenorphine (30 % ethanol) for neonatal abstinence syndrome from a separate clinical study. Blood ethanol levels were measured using a validated headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method utilizing micro-volume (̴ 100 uL) plasma samples. The limit of detection and lower limit of quantification for the assay were 0. 1 mg/L and 0. 5 mg/L respectively. Results: A total of 39 plasma samples from 15 neonates who were on ethanol containing medications were collected over the study period. Four neonates were exposed to phenobarbital and/or dexamethasone, while eleven neonates were exposed to buprenorphine alone or in combination with phenobarbital. Patients were exposed to an average of 71. 6 mg/kg (range 13. 1 to 215 mg/kg) of ethanol after a single dose of an ethanol containing medication. Blood ethanol levels were detectable in 98 % (38 / 39) of samples, quantifiable in 67 % (26 / 39) of samples, and ranged from below detection to 85. 4 mg/L. Ethanol was rapidly cleared and did not accumulate with current dosing regimens. Conclusion: Ethanol intake secondary to medication administration varied widely. Blood ethanol levels in neonates were low and ethanol was eliminated rapidly after a single dose of oral medications that contained a sizable fraction of ethanol. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{taxonomic study}} of this genus is, and always has been, {{severely}} hampered by the almost universal incompleteness of the material available in the herbarium. The vast majority of herbarium specimens, at least of the terrestrial species which comprise some 70 % of the genus, consist of inflorescences alone, i. e. without vegetative parts. The aquatic species fare little better and although specimens are often more complete they are usually badly prepared so that vital characters such as the specifically characteristic branching of the foliar organs is completely obscured. Furthermore, {{in view of the}} very delicate nature of both the floral and vegetative parts, especially the complex and often very small traps, drying is rarely as satisfactory as preservation in liquid. This latter method, which has been increasingly used in recent years, can however produce relatively useless specimens if the incorrect <b>liquid</b> <b>preservative</b> is used. Having personally collected some 25 % of the 180 known species both in Europe and the tropics of Africa and America the author feels qualified to offer some advice on the preparation of specimens of this genus for taxonomic study. 1) Dried specimens — Aquatic species should be put into a suitable receptacle (at least 0. 5 m square) full of clean water about 15 - 20 cm deep. Gentle agitation will cause the vegetative parts to assume their natural position. A sheet of paper, either thin and suitably supported on a rigid sheet of metal or thicker and unsupported, is then carefully introduced beneath the floating plant and very gradually raised out of the water so that the plant eventually lies on the paper with all of its parts in their natural positions. The whole should then be dried as rapidly as possible in a ventilated press. Additional separate inflorescences (and infructescences) may of course be dried normally. Terrestrial species often have no very obvious vegetative parts as they are usually beneath the substrate. However it is the experience of the author that they are in fact almost always present and may be found by carefully removing a small piece of the substrate with the inflorescence. Gentle agitation in water may wash away the sand, soil or mud and these vegetative parts are again best displayed by ’floating out’ as for the aquatic species. If, as is frequently the case, the substrate is bound together by filamentous algae or the subterranean parts of other plants, the vegetative parts are difficult to separate and display, at least in the field, and in such cases the whole should be pressed...|$|R
40|$|The mucus {{surface layer}} of corals plays {{a number of}} {{integral}} roles in their overall health and fitness. This mucopolysaccharide coating serves as vehicle to capture food, a protective barrier against physical invasions and trauma, {{and serves as a}} medium to host a community of microorganisms distinct from the surrounding seawater. In healthy corals the associated microbial communities are known to provide antibiotics that contribute to the coral’s innate immunity and function metabolic activities such as biogeochemical cycling. Culture-dependent (Ducklow and Mitchell, 1979; Ritchie, 2006) and culture-independent methods (Rohwer, et al., 2001; Rohwer et al., 2002; Sekar et al., 2006; Hansson et al., 2009; Kellogg et al., 2009) have shown that coral mucus-associated microbial communities can change with changes in the environment and health condition of the coral. These changes may suggest that changes in the microbial associates not only reflect health status but also may assist corals in acclimating to changing environmental conditions. With the increasing availability of molecular biology tools, culture-independent methods are being used more frequently for evaluating the health of the animal host. Although culture-independent methods are able to provide more in-depth insights into the constituents of the coral surface mucus layer’s microbial community, their reliability and reproducibility rely on the initial sample collection maintaining sample integrity. In general, a sample of mucus is collected from a coral colony, either by sterile syringe or swab method (Woodley, et al., 2008), and immediately placed in a cryovial. In the case of a syringe sample, the mucus is decanted into the cryovial and the sealed tube is immediately flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen vapor shipper (a. k. a., dry shipper). Swabs with mucus are placed in a cryovial, {{and the end of the}} swab is broken off before sealing and placing the vial in the dry shipper. The samples are then sent to a laboratory for analysis. After the initial collection and preservation of the sample, the duration of the sample voyage to a recipient laboratory is often another critical part of the sampling process, as unanticipated delays may exceed the length of time a dry shipper can remain cold, or mishandling of the shipper can cause it to exhaust prematurely. In remote areas, service by international shipping companies may be non-existent, which requires the use of an alternative preservation medium. Other methods for preserving environmental samples for microbial DNA analysis include drying on various matrices (DNA cards, swabs), or placing samples in <b>liquid</b> <b>preservatives</b> (e. g., chloroform/phenol/isoamyl alcohol, TRIzol reagent, ethanol). These methodologies eliminate the need for cold storage, however, they add expense and permitting requirements for hazardous liquid components, and the retrieval of intact microbial DNA often can be inconsistent (Dawson, et al., 1998; Rissanen et al., 2010). A method to preserve coral mucus samples without cold storage or use of hazardous solvents, while maintaining microbial DNA integrity, would be an invaluable tool for coral biologists, especially those in remote areas.

40|$|The {{research}} {{is presented as}} a composite thesis containing a theoretical explanatory review based on four scientific articles. The thesis covers the investigation of wood modification methods, which in the future could possibly be developed further to enhance the performance of wood products in an efficient and economical way. The target applications for the studied methods were non-structural wooden materials for outdoor exposure, such as cladding, facades and decking. Therefore, weather resistance, appearance and durability were the qualities to be studied. The methods were based on the combination of heat and impregnation with <b>liquid</b> <b>preservatives.</b> The following methods were included in the study: heat treatment in steam, heat treatment in oil with subsequent oil impregnation of heat treated wood and impregnation with artificial chemicals (copper, furfuryl alcohol and phenol formaldehyde) enhanced by preheating the wood. All the treatments were performed mainly on Scots pine, but also on Norwegian spruce and European varieties of ash, aspen, birch and beech. The first article covers the investigation of methods for oil heat treatment and oil impregnation of wood. The oil treatments were designed and performed at laboratory scale. The second and third articles cover studies concerning the behaviour of steam heat treated, oil heat treated and oil impregnated wood boards in terms of their resistance to cyclical climate conditions and brown rot fungi. The climate conditions were recreated in laboratory by letting the samples to soak in water, freeze in a freezer and absorb heat from an infrared lamp. The fourth article covers the study of impregnation of preheated wood with copper-based, furfuryl alcohol and phenol formaldehyde solutions; phenol formaldehyde treated wood was tested in the accelerated weathering test in order {{to find out if the}} treatment blocks wood resin coming out from the knots. The results showed that degradation processes within wood during oil heat treatment were similar to the degradation processes during heat treatment in steam, but with the difference of a small oil uptake when heat treating in oil. When heated wood is directly placed to cool down in oil at room temperature, then it absorbs significantly more oil than during the process of heat treatment in oil; similarly, impregnation with copper-based preservative after preheating was deeper compared to impregnation without preheating. However, oil seems to be rather unstable inside wood. After the samples were impregnated with oil in the experiments, the oil migrated throughout the wood and leached out when exposed to water and heat. By visual observation it was found that colour degraded to a certain extent in all untreated and treated species exposed to the cyclical weather conditions used in the study. It could also be noticed that the method used to create the cyclical weather conditions (mentioned above), in which the wood was exposed to periods of soaking, freezing and warming, showed to be an effective method to test the wood for outdoor applications. It was observed that both heat treatment and oil impregnation improved durability of wood against brown rot fungi. However, the oil impregnation method needs, probably, to be further developed to protect wood in the long term due to oil leakage from the wood. It was found that the phenol formaldehyde treatment using hot-and-cold bath process significantly reduced the migration of resin and extractives through knot in painted wood panels.
