5000|$|The first {{cargo ships}} {{specially}} fitted for {{the transport of}} large quantities of cars came into service in the early sixties. These ships still had their own loading gear and so-called hanging decks inside. They were, for example, chartered by the German Volkswagen AG to transport vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. During the 1970s, the market for exporting and importing cars has increased dramatically and the number and type of ROROs has increased also. In 1970 Japan’s K Line built the [...] "Toyota Maru No. 10", Japan's first <b>pure</b> <b>car</b> <b>carrier,</b> and in 1973 built the European Highway, the largest <b>pure</b> <b>car</b> <b>carrier</b> (PCC) at that time, which carried 4,200 automobiles. Today’s pure car carriers and their close cousins, the pure car/truck carrier (PCTC), are distinctive ships with a box-like superstructure running the entire length and breadth of the hull, fully enclosing the cargo. They typically have a stern ramp and a side ramp for dual loading of thousands of vehicles (such as cars, trucks, heavy machineries, tracked units, Mafi trailers, and loose statics), and extensive automatic fire control systems.|$|E

Keeping this in mind, we studied emergency unberthing without tug assistance by conducting numerical simulations and full-mission ship maneuvering simulator (SMS) experiments. A panamax class medium-sized bulker and a <b>pure</b> <b>car</b> <b>carrier</b> (PCC) were used as test ships. In the experiments, we established the limitations of basic shiphandling techniques such as stern kick out, backing, and accelerating turn in windy conditions using a mathematical modeling group (MMG) -type mathematical maneuvering model. On {{the basis of the}} results, we produced a shiphandling scenario and evaluated it using SMS experiments. We concluded that unberthing without tug assistance in 5 m/s onshore winds is possible. Furthermore, the use of thrusters can greatly reduce the time required for unberthing...|$|E
40|$|Concern for {{the safe}} navigation, the {{presence}} of an external force which directly induced on the ship maneuvering behavior is important to be captured. This paper discusses the course stability and yaw motion of ships traveling under steady wind condition in an analytical way. A course stability criterion and approximate formulas of yaw motion in steady wind including aero/hydro-dynamic force derivatives on the ship are derived. To confirm the reliability of the criterion and the formulas, the investigation results are introduced for the <b>Pure</b> <b>Car</b> <b>Carrier</b> (PCC) in steady wind. The results reveal that the course instability appears in head and following wind directions is mainly caused by the influence of aerodynamic derivatives with respect to the yaw restoring forces. However, the course instability can be easily improved by using a steering control. In the range from head wind to beam wind, the yaw oscillation appears where the period is relatively long and the damping is small. The analytical formulas newly derived are useful for {{a better understanding of the}} ship maneuvering behavior in steady wind. ...|$|E

Firstly, interviews are made to shipmasters who have experiences to have operated the subject ships to identify major elements for route selection in the North Pacific Ocean.

This thesis investigates whether ocean wave energy could also beused for propulsion of commercial ships, with <b>Pure</b> <b>Car</b> and Truck Carriers(PCTC's) being the model ship type used. Based on current wave energyresearch four technologies are selected as candidates for wave energy propulsion:bow overtopping, thrust generating foils, moving multi-point absorberand turbine-tted anti-roll tanks. Analyses of the selected technologies indicate that the generated propulsivepower does not overcome the added resistance from the system at the shipdesign speed and size used in the study. Conclusions are that further waveenergy propulsion research should focus on systems for ships that are slowerand smaller than current PCTC's.

40|$|Stiffened panels play a {{significant}} role in marine industry because of their high strength-weight ratio, they account for {{a significant}} amount of a vessel’s weight. Hence, weight optimization of these structures can reduce the material costs and to a great extent increase the cargo capacity of a vessel. This thesis looks into the performance of three steel car deck panels with respect to their weights for a <b>Pure</b> <b>Car</b> and Truck <b>Carrier</b> (PCTC). The focus is on the structural arrangement rather than a comparison of steel and alternative materials, since lightweight materials are still not economically viable for these types of ships. Two of the car deck panels have conventional structural arrangement stiffened with longitudinal and transverse stiffeners while the third one uses diagonally positioned beams. In order to carry out a consistent comparison, the car deck panels are optimized by means of finite element analysis and parametric sensitivity analysis. The panels are modelled with linear elastic materials and a global strength analysis is made with a uniformly distributed load. Results prove the accuracy of the way tha...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a master}} thesis {{conducted}} during the autumn and winter 2010 - 2011 at KTH Centre for Naval Architecture in collaboration with Wallenius Marine AB. Traditionally the hull lines of typical <b>Pure</b> <b>Car</b> and Truck <b>Carriers</b> have been optimized for minimum resistance when going on a straight path and for maximum cargo capacity. This has resulted in vessels with slender underwater body, very high vertical centre of gravity and large flares in the waterlines of the aft body to provide form stability. Dynamic behaviour, such as manoeuvrability, has not been in main focus while designing the hulls. To create a tool for assessing the manoeuvrability, a model describing the motions in four degrees of freedom of a vessel have been developed. The equations of motion in surge, sway, yaw and roll are set up and solved numerically in Matlab. The code has been validated against available benchmark results and calibrated using trial data {{from a number of}} vessels from the Wallenius fleet. Good compliance to trial results is achieved for the initial part of a turn but some problems occur in the later part. Both trials and simulations indicate on very good turning and yaw checking abilities among the investigated vessels but also a tendency of dynamic instability...|$|R

40|$|This thesis evaluates if {{parts of}} the {{structural}} elements in a liftable car deck can be replaced with aluminium to obtain a lower weight. In {{order to be able}} to compare the final solution to an existing one, two car deck panels with different dimensions(14. 37 x 14. 64 and 14. 37 x 10. 22) on a <b>Pure</b> <b>Car</b> and Truck <b>Carrier</b> (PCTC) were used as a reference. Different concept designs where the steel top plate was replaced by an aluminium structure were evaluated by utilizing engineering beam theory, goal driven optimization and finite element analysis. The evaluation resulted in a steel/aluminium car deck design with extruded aluminium profiles as a stiffened top plate and a conventional steel beam system structure as support. The final design of the larger car deck panel resulted in a weight reduction of 7. 5 % while the smaller car deck panel was weight reduced with 28. 7 %. Based on this difference, studies of how the free length between supports affects the steel structural weight were carried out. A cost analysis was performed to evaluate whether the design was economically feasible. It was found that the payback time of the proposed design is 2. 4 times the desired payback time, compared to the average life time of a PCTC which is 23 years, it was concluded that with the aluminium cost of 2014 the design is too expensive...|$|R

The panels’ performance is compared against criteria such as weight and strength.

The panels were modelled with linear elastic materials and a global strength analysis was made with a uniformly distributed load according to DNV rules. For the composite car deck structures, sys-tems engineering methods were used to develop concepts for the joining of and lashing in a predetermined composite car deck section. Conceptual designs were optimized and evaluated by means of finite element analyses with respect to stakeholder defined criteria, such as strength and the maximum allowed deflection during loading. The evaluation and analyses resulted in a composite car deck design composed of a glass fibre reinforced plastic sandwich with balsa core material.
