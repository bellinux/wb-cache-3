5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take <b>place.</b> <b>As</b> the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
