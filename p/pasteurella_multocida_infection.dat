40|$|<b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> is a {{zoonotic}} Gram-negative cocco-bacillus {{often associated}} with soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites. Here we report 3 patients who developed life-threatening P. <b>multocida</b> respiratory tract <b>infections</b> after providing palliative care to their dying pets. The majority of patients with <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> <b>infections</b> are bitten or scratched by the offending animal [1]. The mor-tality of P. <b>multocida</b> <b>infections,</b> especially severe and invasive infections like pneumonia, could be more pronounced than that seen with bite infections [2, 3]. We report 3 patients with life-threatening P. <b>multocida</b> respiratory tract <b>infections</b> associated with palliative pet care. A PubMed search revealed no report of zoonotic illness associated with palliative pet care. Because more than 50 % of pet owners consider pets as family members [4] {{and because of the}} likely expansion of palliative pet care services [5], providers of palliative pet care will likely have more frequent close contact with dying animals and may be at risk for invasive P. <b>multocida</b> <b>infections.</b> Pet owners, veterinarians, animal care-takers, and physicians should therefore be aware of the potential risk of life-threatening respiratory P. <b>multocida</b> <b>infections</b> in the setting of palliative pet care.

Broiler breeders (120) of 66 -week-old from two breeder farms in Selangor and Malacca were used in the study. They were divided into 4 groups namely groups A 1 (30 hens) or A 2 (30 cocks) and B 1 (36 hens) or B 2 (24 cocks) of chickens from Selangor and Malacca, respectively. The broiler chickens (125) of 5 -week-old were sampled from four broiler farms in Johor identified as groups C, D, E and F. The clinical signs were recorded and serum samples were collected for ALV-J antibody detection using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) technique.

Over this period, there was no significant evolution of MIC(90) for any bacterial species studied and no development of resistance was observed. Marbofloxacin was the most active antibiotic against P. multocida isolates and had the lowest MIC.

40|$|Introduction: Pets are {{not always}} the human’s best friends, {{particularly}} {{in the presence of}} comorbidities such as wounds. The following case report describes a <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> <b>infection</b> of a reconstructive breast implant due to a close contact between a cat and its owner. Presentation of case: A 33 -year-old woman developed a breast implant infection 13 days after an immediate breast reconstruction following a mastectomy for a multifocal ductal carcinoma. The wound was explored surgically and the implant removed. Culture extracted from fluid around the prosthesis evidenced the presence of P. multocida, a Gram-negative coccobacillus which is present in the oral commensal flora of cats and dogs. Conclusion: In the case of breast infection, surgical revision – with or without removal of the implant – is required in order to carry out a meticulous intraoperative cleaning. Antibiotherapy is always necessary in such cases. Particularly when patients presenting comorbidities are concerned, the focus must be put on avoiding close contact of the wound with pets...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{possible}} cause {{of disease and}} mortality in corvids on an outdoor pig unit {{in the north of}} England between August 2007 to March 2008 was investigated. Nine carrion crows (Corvus corone corone) and 9 rooks (Corvus frugilegus), comprising five live-caught birds with clinical signs of respiratory disease, one live-caught bird without respiratory disease, and 12 birds submitted dead were examined. Clinical signs, gross and histopathological examination, microbiology and toxicology, indicated that <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> <b>infection</b> was the cause of disease. Molecular and serotyping analyses showed that P. multocida isolates (obtained from live-caught birds with clinical respiratory disease) were all capsular type F with a mix of somatic serotypes 3, 4 and 7. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) increased the diagnostic sensitivity of the analysis and detected P. multocida within the pulmonary lesions of all affected live-caught birds and 10 of 12 birds found dead.

40|$|<b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> <b>infection</b> in cattle causes serious {{epidemic}} {{diseases and}} leads to great economic losses in livestock industry; however, {{little is known about}} the interaction between host and P. multocida in the lungs. To explore a fully insight into the host responses in the lungs during P. multocida infection, a mouse model of Pasteurella pneumonia was established by intraperitoneal infection, and then transcriptomic analysis of infected lungs was performed. P. multocida localized and grew in murine lungs, and induced inflammation in the lungs, as well as mice death. With transcriptomic analysis, approximately 107 clean reads were acquired. 4236 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were detected during P. multocida infection, of which 1924 DEGs were up-regulated. By gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichments, 5, 303 GO enrichments and 116 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the context of P. multocida infection. Interestingly, genes related to immune responses, such as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), chemokines and inflammatory cytokines, were significantly up-regulated, suggesting the key roles of these genes in P. multocida infection. Transcriptomic data showed that IFN-γ/IL- 17 -related genes were increased, which were validated by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and immunoblotting.

We report a case of <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> <b>infection</b> from cat bites leading to endocarditis and subsequent aortic valve replacement. Presentation of caseA 70 -year-old male was admitted because of fever, tachycardia, and malaise. He {{had a history of}} alcohol abuse and was living alone with a cat in a rural area. A sepsis of unknown origin was suspected, and intravenous treatment with gentamicin and cefotaxime was initiated. Blood cultures yielded Pasteurella multocida, and the patient history revealed repeated cat bites. After four days, the patient was discharged with oral penicillin V treatment. Two weeks later, the patient returned with fever and a new systolic murmur. An aortic valve endocarditis was diagnosed, and {{it became clear that the}} patient had not completed the prescribed penicillin V treatment. The patient underwent a biological aortic valve replacement with debridement of an annular abscess, and the postoperative course was uneventful. DiscussionEndocarditis due to Pasteurella is extremely rare, and there are only a few reports in the literature. Predisposing factors in the present case were alcohol abuse and reduced compliance to treatment. ConclusionCat bites are often deep, and in rare circumstances can lead to life-threatening endocarditis. Proper surgical revision, antibiotic treatment, and patient compliance are necessary components in patient care to avoid this complication...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{myeloperoxidase}} (MPO) {{is essential}} {{in the killing of}} phagocytosed bacteria. Certain steroid hormones increase MPO plasma concentration. Our aim was to test the effect of MPO, its inhibitor indomethacin, and certain steroid hormones on bactericidal activity. METHODS: Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were incubated with opsonised Escherichia coli and either MPO, indomethacin, estradiol, or hydrocortisone. Intracellular killing capacity was evaluated with UV microscopy after treatment with fluorescent dye. Next, an in vivo experiment was performed with nine groups of rats: in {{the first phase of the}} study indomethacin treatment and <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> <b>infection</b> (Ii), indomethacin treatment without infection (I 0), untreated control with infection (Mi) and untreated control without infection (M 0); in the second phase of the study rats with infection and testosterone treatment (NT), castration, infection and testosterone treatment (CT), castration, infection and estradiol treatment (CE), non-castrated infected control (N 0), and castrated infected control (C 0). After treatment bacteria were reisolated from the liver and heart blood on agar plates, and laboratory parameters were analyzed. For the comparison of laboratory results ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test and LSD post hoc test was used. RESULTS: Indomethacin did not have a remarkable effect on the bacterial killing of PMNs, while the other compounds increased bacterial killing to various degrees. In the animal model indomethacin and infection caused a poor clinical state, a great number of reisolated bacteria, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin levels. Testosterone treatment resulted in less bacterial colony numbers in group NT, but not in group CT compared to respective controls (N 0, C 0). Estradiol treatment (CE) decreased colony numbers compared to control (C 0). Hormone administration resulted in lower WBC counts, and in group CE, a decreased CRP. CONCLUSIONS: MPO, estradiol, and hydrocortisone improve bacterial killing activity of PMNs. Indomethacin treatment and castration weaken immune responses and clinical state of infected rats, while testosterone and estradiol have a beneficial effect...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory tract {{infections in}} cattle are {{commonly}} associated with the bacterial pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica and <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida.</b> These <b>infections</b> can generally be successfully treated in the field with one of several groups of antibiotics, including macrolides. A few recent isolates of these species exhibit resistance to veterinary macrolides with phenotypes that fall into three distinct classes. The first class has type I macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotic resistance and, consistent with this, the 23 S rRNA nucleotide A 2058 is monomethylated by the enzyme product of the erm(42) gene. The second class shows no lincosamide resistance and lacks erm(42) and concomitant 23 S rRNA methylation. Sequencing of the genome of a representative strain from this class, P. multocida 3361, revealed macrolide efflux and phosphotransferase genes [respectively termed msr(E) and mph(E) ] that are arranged in tandem and presumably expressed from the same promoter. The third class exhibits the most marked drug phenotype, with high resistance {{to all of the}} macrolides tested, and possesses all three resistance determinants. The combinations of erm(42), msr(E), and mph(E) are chromosomally encoded and intermingled with other exogenous genes, many of which appear to have been transferred from other members of the Pasteurellaceae. The presence of some of the exogenous genes explains recent reports of resistance to additional drug classes. We have expressed recombinant versions of the erm(42), msr(E), and mph(E) genes within an isogenic Escherichia coli background to assess their individually contributions to resistance. Our findings indicate what types of compounds might have driven the selection for these resistance determinants...|$|R

The most typical damages in FB 1 treated pigs were the strong oedema in the lung and the slight oedema in the other internal organs and mild degenerative changes in the kidneys, whereas the typical pathomorphological fi ndings in pigs infected with <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida</b> was broncho-interstitial pneumonia. FB 1 was found to aggravate pneumonic changes provoked by P. multocida in the cranial lobes of the lung and to complicate pneumonic damages with interstitial oedema in the lung. No macroscopic damages were observed in the pigs infected only with <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida.</b> It can be concluded that the feed intake of FB 1 in pigs may complicate or exacerbate the course of P. <b>multocida</b> serotype A <b>infection...</b>|$|R
