2500|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have said}} and Senator Kerry {{has said that}} you are going to do in order to get us out of the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And now, Deerslayer," [...] said Judith, [...] "we may talk of yourself, and of {{the means}} of getting you {{out of the hands of}} the Hurons.

6000|$|In {{the broken}} story which Dylks told, Braile had {{the air of}} mentally {{checking}} off the successive facts, and he permitted the man a measure of self-pity, though he caught him up at the close. [...] "Well, you've got a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> deserve, but as usually happens with us rascals, you've got too much, at the same time. And what did Nancy advise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{precautions}} I mean to take," [...] Harding {{informed him}} dryly. [...] "However, I haven't {{come here to}} argue. For reasons of your own, you sent us into a belt of country which you thought we couldn't possibly get through. You expected us to be held up there until our provisions ran out and winter set in, when these Stonies would no doubt have moved on. Well, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wished has happened; but the matter is taking a turn you couldn't have looked for. You led us into difficulties--and now you're {{going to get us}} out. I guess delay means danger. Get ready to start." ...|$|E

A great <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have heard is {{perfectly}} true, allowing for the exaggeration which always {{takes place in the}} accounts of an eccentric character. But there are other parts of Turner's conduct of which you have never heard; and which, if truly reported, would set his niggardliness in a very different light. Every person from whom Turner exacted a due shilling, proclaimed the exaction far and wide; but the persons to whom Turner gave hundreds of pounds were prevented, by their [...] "delicacy," [...] from reporting the kindness of their benefactor. I may, however, perhaps, be permitted to acquaint you with one circumstance of this nature, creditable alike to both parties concerned.|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy, {{whose face}} once more grew a trifle flushed, {{raised a hand}} in protest. [...] "I feel I have {{to thank you for}} sending Burnell to me. It must have seemed very ungrateful that I didn't close with him; but, after all, that is only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I mean. <b>You</b> see----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{it seems}} to me," [...] he said, [...] "that I am only wasting my time by trying to make you see reason and common-sense. You look upon me as a brute. Well! perhaps I am. At any rate I am that which your father and you have made me. Four years ago, when you had power over me and over mine, you brutalised us. To-day we--the people--are your masters and we make you suffer, not for all--that were impossible--but for <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> made us suffer. That, after all, is only bare justice. By making you my wife I would have saved you from death--not from humiliation, for that you must endure, and at my hands in a full measure--but I would have made you my wife because I still have {{pleasant}} recollections of that kiss which I snatched from you on that never-to-be-forgotten night and in the darkness--a kiss for which you would gladly have seen me hang then, {{if you could have}} laid hands on me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 34. In {{this and}} the two next {{following}} lectures, I shall endeavour therefore {{to show you the}} grave relations of human art, in these three functions, to human life. I can do this but roughly, as you may well suppose--since each of these subjects would require for its right treatment years instead of hours. Only, remember, I have already given years, not a few, to each of them; and what I try to tell you now will be only so much as is absolutely necessary to set our work on a clear foundation. You may not, at present, see the necessity for any foundation, and may think that I ought to put pencil and paper in your hands at once. On that point I must simply answer, [...] "Trust me a little while," [...] asking you however also to remember, that--irrespectively of any consideration of last or first--my true function here is not that of your master in painting, or sculpture, or pottery; but to show you what it is that makes any of these arts fine, or the contrary of fine: essentially good, or essentially base. You need not fear my not being practical enough for you; all the industry you choose to give me, I will take; but far the better <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> may gain by such industry would be lost, if I did not first lead you to see what every form of art-industry intends, and why some of it is justly called right, and some wrong.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hugh Clifford (he was not {{decorated}} then) {{had just}} published his {{first volume of}} Malay sketches. I was naturally delighted {{to see him and}} infinitely gratified by the kind things he found to say about my first books and some of my early short stories, the action of which is placed in the Malay Archipelago. I remember that after saying many things which ought to have made me blush to the roots of my hair with outraged modesty, he ended by telling me with the uncompromising yet kindly firmness of a man accustomed to speak unpalatable truths even to Oriental potentates (for their own good of course) that {{as a matter of fact}} I didn't know anything about Malays. I was perfectly aware of this. I have never pretended to any such knowledge, and I was moved--I wonder to this day at my impertinence--to retort: [...] "Of course I don't know anything about Malays. If I knew only one hundredth <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> and Frank Swettenham know of Malays I would make everybody sit up." [...] He went on looking kindly (but firmly) at me and then we both burst out laughing. In the course of that most welcome visit twenty years ago, which I remember so well, we talked of many things; the characteristics of various languages was one of them, and it is on that day that my friend carried away with him the impression that I had exercised a deliberate choice between French and English. Later, when moved by his friendship (no empty word to him) to write a study in the North American Review on Joseph Conrad he conveyed that impression to the public.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] cried von Horn impatiently. [...] "Let us have no foolishness. You know {{perfectly}} well what I mean--it will go far better with you if we work together as friends. I want the girl--if she is unharmed--and I will divide the treasure with you if you will help me to obtain them; otherwise you shall have no <b>part</b> <b>of</b> either. <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> say? Shall we be friends or enemies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see. Well, {{before you}} decide to go I'd {{like to have a}} little talk with you. My {{daughter}} has told me <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened to <b>you</b> on the trail. I want to know all of it. You're young, but you've been out in the world, and <b>you</b> know <b>what</b> people can say about you and my girl." [...] His voice became level and menacing, as he added: [...] "And I don't intend to have her put in wrong on account of you." ...|$|R
500|$|Bat Out of Hell was {{released}} by Cleveland International on October 21, 1977. Cleveland International's parent label was Epic Records, where almost everyone hated it. Steve Popovich, the head of Cleveland International Records, was relentless {{in his efforts to}} get Epic and all of CBS Records and radio on board. In 1993, Steinman reflected that the album is [...] "timeless in that it didn't fit into any trend. It's never been a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going on. <b>You</b> could release that record at any time and it would be out of place." ...|$|R

Choose, then, {{a subject}} that {{interests}} you; and so far as failure of time or materials compels you to finish one part, or express one character, rather than another, of course dwell on the features that interest you most. But beyond this, forget, or even somewhat repress yourself, and make it your first object to give a true idea of the place to other people. You are not to endeavor to express your own feelings about it; if anything, {{err on the side}} <b>of</b> concealing them. <b>What</b> is best is not to think of yourself at all, but to state as plainly and simply as you can the whole truth <b>of</b> the thing. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> think unimportant in it may to another person be the most touching <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it: <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think beautiful may be in truth commonplace and of small value.

You never know what <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do has any validity. Time tells it. Good architecture will become ruins. Bad architecture disappears. But for you to know it is a ruin, you have to wait a lot of time. I hope the Parque Towers not to be ruins today but one thousand years from now".|$|E

5000|$|Realize {{that your}} aim is a fully {{comparative}} {{understanding of the}} social structures that have appeared and that do now exist in world history. Realize that {{to carry it out}} you must avoid the arbitrary specialization of prevailing academic departments. Specialize your work variously, according to topic, and above all according to significant problem. In formulating and in trying to solve these problems, do not hesitate, indeed seek, continually and imaginatively, to draw upon the perspectives and materials, the ideas and methods, of any and all sensible studies of man and society. They are your studies; they are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are a part of; do not let them be taken from you by those who would close them off by weird jargon and pretensions of expertise.|$|E

What we realised after a long time is that that actually can end up sucking the life out of things, and that perhaps the better way to do things is to fly by the seat of your pants and rely on the spontaneous energy of the moment. Some of our past records have suffered a bit from too much nitpicking, and this latest record really has zero nitpicking. There's plenty of audible mistakes and weird moments where we just went fuck it, just leave it, it's all <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happens when <b>you</b> hit record." ...|$|R

It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> it, that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|R
50|$|For {{those of}} you who focus on the victims of war well that is just <b>part</b> <b>of</b> war. <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> think war is about? People DIE in wars that is why I am against wars. It brought me to tears because I used to think all of those horrible things about him Hitler until I learned the truth about the war and what Hitler truly did and he was not a bad person as they have painted him out to be. Here is a man who was not a coward, stood up for his country in a DESPERATE TIME OF NEED (unlike all of our cowardly leaders), and yet not only did he try his best to help his country and people get out <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was a time of depression, {{economic}} collapse, high unemployment, amongst many other things.|$|R
