5|$|The Tora {{hartebeest}} {{is listed}} as Critically Endangered; the IUCN has ascertained that fewer than 250 mature individuals survive as of 2008. They are <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> in Sudan due to excessive hunting and agricultural expansion, but may still exist in smaller numbers in Eritrea and Ethiopia. There have been unconfirmed reports of sightings by locals of the Tora hartebeest southeast of the Dinder National Park, from where it had disappeared before 1960.|$|E
5|$|Endemic to Africa, the bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Formerly {{widespread}} in western, central and eastern Africa, its present range extends from Senegal {{in the west to}} Ethiopia in the east. Among the three reedbuck species, bohor reedbuck is the most widespread in Tanzania. Its status in Burundi, Eritrea, Ghana and Togo is uncertain, while it is rare in Niger and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} species are {{classified}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The populations {{of all three}} are large, {{with that of the}} magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing, while the great and lesser frigatebird decreasing. Monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low reproductivity. The status of the Atlantic populations of the great and lesser frigatebirds are unknown and <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the Pondicherry shark {{was caught}} {{and used for}} meat. Fewer than 20 {{specimens}} have been deposited in museum collections, {{most of which were}} collected prior to 1900. This shark's rarity originally led to fears that it may be <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct.</b> However, in 2016, the Pondicherry shark was rediscovered in the Sri Lankan Menik and Kumbukkam rivers. Two photographs of this species exist; one taken from above by a group of nature enthusiasists, as well as one taken from the side by a freshwater fish survey. Given that artisanal and commercial fishing activity across its range is heavy, unregulated, and intensifying, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Pondicherry shark as Critically Endangered and placed a high priority on locating any surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|The bohor reedbuck inhabits moist grasslands and swamplands {{as well as}} woodlands. The bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Reckless hunting and loss of habitat {{as a result of}} human {{settlement}} have led to significant decline in the numbers of the bohor reedbuck, although this antelope tends to survive longer in such over-exploited areas as compared to its relatives. The total populations of the bohor reedbuck are estimated to be above 100,000. Larger populations occur in eastern and central Africa than in western Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern.|$|E

The spectacled bear is very rare and <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct.</b> The white tailed deer, the main ingredient of the diet of the Muisca and pre-Muisca, has been extensively hunted and captured over time.|$|E
25|$|St Clair Cave, one of Jamaica's {{more famous}} caves, {{is found in}} the parish. This large, complex cave {{contains}} one of the most notable bat roosts on the island, {{and is one of the}} few known historical sites for the <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> bat, Phyllonycteris aphylla. Because of the biological importance of the system, and the inherent dangers involved in exploring it (i.e. noxious gases, histoplasmosis, Cutaneous larva migrans, difficult footing), casual visitation is discouraged.|$|E
25|$|Jewel-babblers {{are found}} on New Guinea and the {{neighbouring}} islands of Yapen, Batanta, Misool and Salawati. They occur in forest, generally replacing {{each other at}} different altitudes. The painted quail-thrush {{is also found in}} the forests of New Guinea. The other quail-thrushes are restricted to Australia where they are found in drier habitats, occurring in open forest, scrub and on stony ground. None of the species are thought to be threatened but one subspecies of the spotted quail-thrush is <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct.</b>|$|E

25|$|The IUCN {{regard the}} Spix's macaw as {{critically}} endangered and <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> {{in the wild}}. Its last known stronghold in the wild was in northeastern Bahia, Brazil, and sightings are very rare. After a 2000 sighting of a male bird, the next sighting was in 2016. The species is now maintained through a captive breeding program at several conservation organizations {{under the aegis of}} the Brazilian government. It is listed on CITES Appendix I, which makes trade illegal except for legitimate conservation, scientific or educational purposes.|$|E
25|$|The South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is a tiger {{subspecies}} in {{the provinces}} of Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi in southern China. It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996, and is <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> in the wild since no wild individual has been recorded since the early 1970s. Already in the late 1990s, continued survival was considered unlikely due to low prey density, widespread habitat degradation and fragmentation, and other human pressures. The name Amoy tiger {{was used in the}} fur trade. It is also known as the South Chinese, the Chinese, and the Xiamen tiger.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the birds}} were {{captured}} for trade in 1987. A single male, paired with a female blue-winged macaw, was discovered at the site in 1990. A female Spix's macaw released from captivity at the site in 1995 was killed by collision with a power line after seven weeks. The last wild male disappeared from the site in October 2000; his disappearance was thought to have marked the extinction of this species in the wild. However, wild Spix's macaws may have been sighted in 2016.. While the IUCN Red List views its status as Critically Endangered and <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> in the wild, ornithologist Nigel Collar of Birdlife International, the authority for the IUCN Redlist of birds now calls this bird extinct in the wild.|$|E

25|$|When {{a diesel}} {{locomotive}} has been {{attached to the}} train for operational reasons such as assistance on a bank, shunting, or for generation in the heating role, this is also often removed. The locomotive livery may also be changed to simply demonstrate what a locomotive would look like in an alternative, and <b>possibly</b> <b>extinct</b> or never used, livery. Photographers also often compensate for poor weather conditions {{at the time of}} the photograph, for example when the wrong wind direction causes the smoke trail from the locomotive chimney to obscure all or part of the train. Livery changes or scene reinstatement for smoke removal is often achieved through the use of short term rephotography, where the photographer takes two images at the same site and overlays one onto the other.|$|E
