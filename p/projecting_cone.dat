40|$|Purpose: We have {{developed}} an instrument for computerized surgical videokeratography. A corneal central region of approximately 7. 00 mm in diameter may be analyzed, providing the surgeon with information of {{the power and the}} astigmatism. Methods: The system is based on a fiber optic Placido disc <b>projecting</b> <b>cone,</b> which is attached to the objective lens of a Zeiss compatible surgical microscope. At the beam splitter we installed a monochromatic high resolution camera. A frame grabber is installed on a PC and images are digitized at a 480 x 640 resolution. Image processing is used for edge detection of rings. Results: Calibrating curves based on 4 spherical surfaces were generated and approximately 3600 points are calculated for each examination. Preliminary measurements on 10 healthy corneas were compared with those of an EyeSys System 2000 Corneal Topographer. Mean deviation was 0. 05 for radius of curvature, 0. 24 D for the power and 5. 0 degrees for the cylinder. Conclusions: This surgical VKS, with some hardware and software improvements, may be used to reduce residual astigmatisms in conventional cataract and keratoplasty.

40|$|The phylogenetic {{origin of}} the hair of mammals has puzzled compara-tive anatomists for a century. Many {{structures}} of lower vertebrates have been suggested as ancestral to the hair. Among them were certain tactile orgalns of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles; reptilian scales and birds' feathers were also suggested. Reviews of these opinions have been presented by Oppenheimer (1895), Botezat (1914) and Pinkus (1927). During a survey of elevations in the amplhibian skin by Elias and Sha-piro (1957), certain stnrctures were found that resemble hairs. These re-cently found struct:ures, when related appropriately to those previously de-scribed, seem to fill the remainin-g gap in our uniiderstanding of evolution of {{the scale of the}} Amniota and of the hair.

40|$|Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) {{provides}} a theoretically efficient method for coding. The drawbacks {{associated with it}} are {{the complexity of the}} decoding and the overhead resulting from the encoding vector. Increasing the field size and generation length presents a fundamental trade-off between packet-based throughput and operational overhead. On the one hand, decreasing the probability of redundant packets' being transmitted is beneficial for throughput and, consequently, reduces transmission energy. On the other hand, the decoding complexity and amount of header overhead increase with field size and generation length, leading to higher energy consumption. The main findings of this work are bounds for the transmission overhead due to linearly dependent packets. The optimal trade-off is system and topology dependent, as it depends on the cost in energy of performing coding operations versus transmitting data. We show that moderate field sizes are the correct choice when trade-offs are considered. The results show that sparse binary codes perform the best, unless the generation size is very low.

40|$|Constraint-based methods (CBMs) are {{promising}} tools {{for the analysis}} of metabolic networks, as they do not require detailed knowledge of the biochemical reactions. Some of these methods only need information about the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactions and their reversibility types, i. e., constraints for steady-state conditions. Nevertheless, CBMs have their own limitations. For example, these methods may be sensitive to missing information in the models. Additionally, they may be slow {{for the analysis of}} genome-scale metabolic models. As a result, some studies prefer to consider substructures of networks, instead of complete models. Some other studies have focused on better implementations of the CBMs. In Chapter 2, the sensitivity of flux coupling analysis (FCA) to missing reactions is studied. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions are comprehensive, yet incomplete, models of real-world metabolic networks. While FCA has proved an appropriate method for analyzing metabolic relationships and for detecting functionally related reactions in such models, {{little is known about the}} impact of missing reactions on the accuracy of FCA. Note that having missing reactions is equivalent to deleting reactions, or to deleting columns from the stoichiometric matrix. Based on an alternative characterization of flux coupling relations using elementary flux modes, we study the changes that flux coupling relations may undergo due to missing reactions. In particular, we show that two uncoupled reactions in a metabolic network may be detected as directionally, partially or fully coupled in an incomplete version of the same network. Even a single missing reaction can cause significant changes in flux coupling relations. In case of two consecutive E. coli genome-scale networks, many fully-coupled reaction pairs in the incomplete network become directionally coupled or even uncoupled in the more complete reconstruction. In this context, we found gene expression correlation values being significantly higher for the pairs that remained fully coupled than for the uncoupled or directionally coupled pairs. Our study clearly suggests that FCA results are indeed sensitive to missing reactions. Since the currently available genome-scale metabolic models are incomplete, we advise to use FCA results with care. In Chapter 3, a different, but related problem is considered. Due to the large size of genome-scale metabolic networks, some studies suggest to analyze subsystems, instead of original genome-scale models. Note that analysis of a subsystem is equivalent to deletion of some rows from the stoichiometric matrix, or identically, assuming some internal metabolites to be external. We show mathematically that analysis of a subsystem instead of the original model can lead the flux coupling relations to undergo certain changes. In particular, a pair of (fully, partially or directionally) coupled reactions may be detected as uncoupled in the chosen subsystem. Interestingly, this behavior is the opposite of the flux coupling changes that may happen due to the existence of missing reactions, or equivalently, deletion of reactions. We also show that analysis of organelle subsystems has relatively little influence on the results of FCA, and therefore, many of these subsystems may be studied independent of the rest of the network. In Chapter 4, we introduce a rapid FCA method, which is appropriate for genome-scale networks. Previously, several approaches for FCA have been proposed in the literature, namely flux coupling finder algorithm, FCA based on minimal metabolic behaviors, and FCA based on elementary flux patterns. To the best of our knowledge none of these methods are available as a freely available software. Here, we introduce a new FCA algorithm FFCA (Feasibility-based Flux Coupling Analysis). This method is based on checking the feasibility of a system of linear inequalities. We show on a set of benchmarks that for genome-scale networks FFCA is faster than other existing FCA methods. Using FFCA, flux coupling analysis of genome-scale networks of S. cerevisiae and E. coli can be performed in a few hours on a normal PC. A corresponding software tool is freely available for non-commercial use. In Chapter 5, we introduce a new concept which can be useful in the analysis of fluxes in network substructures. Analysis of elementary modes (EMs) is proven to be a powerful CBM in the study of metabolic networks. However, enumeration of EMs is a hard computational task. Additionally, due to their large numbers, one cannot simply use them as an input for subsequent analyses. One possibility is to restrict the analysis to a subset of interesting reactions, rather than the whole network. However, analysis of an isolated subnetwork can result in finding incorrect EMs, i. e. the ones which are not part of any steady-state flux distribution in the original network. The ideal set of vectors to describe the usage of reactions in a subnetwork would be the set of all EMs projected onto the subset of interesting reactions. Recently, the concept of “elementary flux patterns” (EFPs) has been proposed. Each EFP is a subset of the support (i. e. non-zero elements) of at least one EM. In the present work, we introduce the concept of ProCEMs (<b>Projected</b> <b>Cone</b> Elementary Modes). The ProCEM set can be computed by <b>projecting</b> the flux <b>cone</b> onto the lower-dimensional subspace and enumerating the extreme rays of the <b>projected</b> <b>cone.</b> In contrast to EFPs, ProCEMs are not merely a set of reactions, but from the mathematical point of view they are projected EMs. We additionally prove that the set of EFPs is included in the set of ProCEM supports.
