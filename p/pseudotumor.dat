Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis retinoic acid, can produce the syndrome of <b>pseudotumor</b> cerebri. This syndrome includes headache, blurring of vision and confusion, associated with increased intracerebral pressure. Symptoms begin to resolve when intake of the offending substance is stopped.|$|E

2500|$|In 1961, a Danish {{ophthalmologist}} named Mette Warburg reported about a Danish {{family that}} showed seven cases of a hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations. The first {{member of the}} family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating. The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass. [...] Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of retinoblastoma, a cancerous tumor on the retina. A histologic examination showed a hemorrhagic necrotic mass in the posterior chamber, surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) glial tissue. The diagnosis included a <b>pseudotumor</b> of the retina, hyperplasia of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment epithelium, hypoplasia and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and phthisis bulbi. This means his eye was removed because the physician suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells already began to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well. She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, Gordon Norrie (1855–1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Twenty-four orbital tumors and 4 <b>pseudotumors</b> {{diagnosed}} in biopsy material among 596 ophthalmic tumors examined during the 1998 - 2003 period are presented according to patient age and sex, tumor histology and immunohistochemistry. The most common orbital tumors were lipomas, meningiomas and lymphomas, with a peak incidence {{in the seventh}} decade of life. Most orbital tumors of childhood are distinguished from those occurring in adults. Most pediatric orbital tumors are benign (developmental cysts, capillary hemangioma, hamartoma), with a peak incidence {{in the first decade}} of life. Orbital tumors show a bimodal age distribution. Benign orbital tumors are more common than the malignant ones. Rhab-domyosarcoma (embryonal type) is the most common orbital malignancy in childhood, and lymphoma in adults. Orbital <b>pseudotumors</b> is a term that has been widely accepted to describe inflammatory lesions of the orbital tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with a varying grade of fibrosis. Histologic classifica-tion of orbital <b>pseudotumors</b> is presented. Orbital <b>pseudotumors</b> occur predominantly in older individuals and are infrequent in children and young individuals. These imply a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology, and have been included as part of the differential diagnosis of orbital tumors...|$|R

40|$|Background: Complications with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties {{have been}} known for several years. Increased cobalt and {{chromium}} levels and soft-tissue reactions known as <b>pseudotumors</b> have been revealed in an increasing amount of patients with MoM hip arthroplasties. <b>Pseudotumors</b> damage both soft-tissue and bone surrounding the prosthesis. We have followed a group of patients with MoM hip resurfacing arthroplasties in Norway to reveal complications and treat these adequatelly. Material and method: 36 patients (27 men) after MoM resurfacing hip arthroplasties were examined for hip function and whole-blood levels of cobalt and chromium at a mean of 4 and 5, 4 years after surgery. Hip function were assessed with Harris Hip Score, UCLA Activity Score and Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. 19 patients were examined using MARS-MRI. Results: No significant reduction in hip function {{was found in the}} group with complications. Women had significantly higher levels of cobalt (p= 0, 030) and chromium (p= 0, 037). Four patients had <b>pseudotumors</b> (3 women) and the incidense was higher in women (p= 0, 011). <b>Pseudotumors</b> were also associated with increased levels of cobalt (p= 0, 026) and chromium (p= 0, 019) at 5, 4 years. Formation of <b>pseudotumors</b> correlated with smaller femoral components (r=- 0, 520; p= 0, 016). Five patients were revised giving a cumulative survival rate of 92, 9 % and 82, 6 % at five and eight years. Conclusion: The functional outcome of MoM hip resurfacing is generally good, but does not justify the risk of severe complications. Regular postoperative observation of patients with MoM articulations is necessary because of pseudotumores without symptoms. Comparable clinical results have been shown in recent studies with alternative articulations eliminating the risk of adverse effects caused by metal particles. We therefore do not recommend to continue MoM resurfacing as standard treatment for primary arthritis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory <b>pseudotumors</b> (inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors) of {{the lung}} are myofibroblastic lesions of {{controversial}} nosology. The concept {{that these are}} benign lesions has been recently questioned given their capacity for local invasion and recurrence. PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: We observed five children with inflammatory <b>pseudotumors</b> of the lung in whom the tumor was resected using the most limited excision possible. Unusually, in all five cases the tumor was localized in the right upper lobe: Three were parenchymal, and the others involved the bronchus. The three parenchymal masses underwent wedge resection, whereas the two bronchial lesions required ex-cision followed by a bronchoplasty and an up-per lobectomy, respectively. In all, the pathology showed a complete resection, and the patients had uneventful recoveries. Follow-ups, including CT and bronchoscopies, ranged from 4 to 8 years (mean of 6. 4 years) with no signs of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our limited experience supports the idea that excisional surgery is the treatment of choice for inflammatory <b>pseudotumors</b> of the lung. Such excisions, both diagnostic and curative, carry minimal risks and avoid unnecessary mutilation. Closely monitored follow-up is mandatory, as {{the natural history of}} this lesion is not yet well understood...|$|R
