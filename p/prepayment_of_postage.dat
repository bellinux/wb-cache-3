25|$|President Don Ignacio Comonfort, {{authorized}} the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> using adhesive stamps by decree of February 21, 1856. New regulations were drawn up and {{were supposed to}} be published on July 15, but problems with the engraving delayed this until July 31. On August 1, 1856 Mexico issued its first postage stamps. The design, a portrait of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the parish priest who led an unsuccessful bid for Mexican independence in 1810, reflected the reform politics of the Comonfort government. The stamps were somewhat crudely engraved and imperforate. Five values were issued from 1856-1859; ½ real, 1r, 2r, 4r, and 8r. The stamps usually, but not always, had district overprints with the name of the district post office.|$|E

British stamps were made available in Malta in August 1857, and <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> became compulsory on 1 February 1858. These British stamps were cancelled with [...] "M" [...] or later [...] "A25" [...] postmarks. The [...] "A25" [...] postmark was also used to cancel other countries' stamps on maritime mail, and it is known on French, Tunisian, Italian, Egyptian and Indian stamps.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. {{the use of}} {{postage stamps}} caught on quickly and became more {{widespread}} when on March 3, 1851, {{the last day of}} its legislative session, Congress passed the Act of March 3, 1851 (An Act to reduce and modify the Rates of Postage in the United States). Similarly introduced {{on the last day of}} the Congressional session four years later, the Act of March 3, 1855 required the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> on all mailings. Thereafter, postage stamp use in the U.S. quickly doubled, and by 1861 had quadrupled.|$|E
40|$|Contact author. 1 Although {{extensive}} {{studies have}} been done to examine the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> primary mortgages, not much has been done to analyze the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper studies the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fixed-rate home equity loans using a large loan-level sample for the period 1995 to 1998. We find that <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans is sensitive to changes in market interest rates, indicating that borrowers refinance their loans when market interest rates are lower than coupon interest rates. We also find that trends in interest rate changes {{play an important role in}} borrower prepayment decisions. When borrowers expect market interest rates to decrease further, they will wait for better opportunities to prepay their home equity loans even when the loans are already “in the money. ” Loan size and borrower creditworthiness also affect the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. However, the loan-to-value ratio, an important factor in primary mortgage prepayment, has little effect on the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper also documents the effect of payment delinquencies on prepayment behavior. Borrowers with either minor or major delinquencies in making monthly payments are less likely to prepay their home equity loans. ...|$|R

A varying coefficient model depicts prepayment as a dynamic process, allowing for changes in factors, reflecting differences in time, debt, and borrowers' characteristics.

Also, the model captures the impact on <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> interactions between financial and nonfinancial variables. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the probabilities <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> or default for Fixed Rate Mortgages (FRMs) and Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs). Using {{data from the}} period 1985 - 1992, the analysis indicates that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> thirty year FRMs was determined primarily by house price appreciation and personal income growth and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fifteen year FRMs was determined primarily by interest rate changes. ARMs were prepaid less frequently than FRMs, {{were less likely to}} be prepaid when interest rates declined and defaulted more often than FRMs. The analysis provides evidence that ARM holders are less mobile than FRM holders.

25|$|A {{postage meter}} is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> or franking, to mailed matter.
