5|$|Five {{years later}} in 1950, he became <b>prosector</b> for the Zoological Society of London and {{remained}} there for twelve years. When he left the London Zoo in 1962, the old prosectorium that has been his office was closed, many preserved biological specimens were discarded, and the era of anatomists working at the London Zoo—starting {{from the time of}} Richard Owen—came to a close. Between 1957 and 1958, Osman Hill also acted as a visiting scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Later in 1958, primatologist Jane Goodall studied primate behaviour under him in preparation for her studies of wild chimpanzees. In 1962, he was hired as the assistant director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) in Atlanta after being turned down for the position of director.|$|E

In 1859, in association with Étienne Eugène Azam, Charles-Pierre Denonvilliers, François Anthime Eugène Follin, and Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau, Broca performed the first experiments in Europe using hypnotism as surgical anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The name {{silicosis}} (from the Latin silex, or flint) {{was originally}} used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), <b>prosector</b> in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances {{in the lungs}} of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The pneumatic hammer drill was introduced in 1897 and sandblasting was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of silicosis.|$|E

25|$|Leydig studied {{philosophy}} in Munich from 1840, and {{medicine at the}} University of Würzburg from 1842 under Martin Münz (1785–1848), Schenk, and Franz von Rinecker (1811–1883). He received his doctorate in medicine at Würzburg on August 27, 1847, becoming an assistant in the physiology department, while also teaching histology and developmental anatomy under Albert von Kölliker (1817–1905). In 1848 he became <b>prosector</b> at the zootomic institution in Würzburg in 1848. The following year he qualified as a lecturer, and on May 9, 1855 he was appointed professor. In the winter of 1850–1851, Leydig made a journey to Sardinia, where {{he became aware of}} the rich marine life that was to become the subject of some of his most important researches. That journey, coupled with his early preoccupation with microscopy, directed the course of his life’s work.|$|E
60|$|The Professor {{obtained}} {{his first}} hint of the new body by a mere accident. His friend, the Deputy <b>Prosector</b> of the Zoological Society, had mixed a draught for a sick raccoon at the Gardens, and, by some mistake in a bottle, had mixed it wrongly. (I purposely refrain from mentioning the ingredients, as they are drugs which can be easily obtained in isolation at any chemist's, though when compounded they form {{one of the most}} dangerous and difficult to detect of organic poisons. I do not desire to play into the hands of would-be criminals.) The compound on which the Deputy <b>Prosector</b> had thus accidentally lighted sent the raccoon to sleep in the most extraordinary manner. Indeed, the raccoon slept for thirty-six hours on end, all attempts to awake him, by pulling his tail or tweaking his hair being quite unavailing. This was a novelty in narcotics; so Sebastian was asked to come and look at the slumbering brute. He suggested the attempt to perform an operation on the somnolent raccoon by removing, under the influence of the drug, an internal growth, which was considered the probable cause of his illness. A surgeon was called in, the growth was found and removed, and the raccoon, to everybody's surprise, continued to slumber peacefully on his straw for five hours afterwards. At the end of that time he awoke, and stretched himself as if nothing had happened; and though he was, of course, very weak from loss of blood, he immediately displayed a most royal hunger. He ate up all the maize that was offered him for breakfast, and proceeded to manifest a desire for more by most unequivocal symptoms.|$|E
60|$|When I {{got back}} to London the box with the skull in it was put away in my book-room, and rested there {{forgotten}} {{for two or three}} years. Then one day I was talking on natural history subjects to my publisher, {{and he told me that}} his son, just returned from Oxford, had developed a keen interest in osteology and was making a collection of mammalian skulls from the whale and elephant and hippopotamus to the harvest- mouse and lesser shrew. This reminded me of the long-forgotten skull, and I told him I had something to send him for his boy's collection, but before sending it I would find out what it was. Accordingly I sent the skull to Mr. Frank E. Beddard, the <b>prosector</b> of the Zoological Society, asking him to tell me what it was. His reply was that it was the skull of an adult gorilla--a fine large specimen.|$|E

50|$|Prosecting is {{intricate}} work where numerous {{tools are}} used to produce a desired specimen. Scalpels and scissors allow for sharp dissection where tissue is cut, e.g. the biceps brachii muscle can {{be removed from the}} specimen by cutting the origin and insertion with a scalpel. Probes and the <b>prosector's</b> own fingers are examples of tools used for blunt dissection where tissue may be separated from surrounding structures without cutting, i.e. the bellies of biceps brachii and coracobrachialis muscle were made clearer by loosening the fascia between the two muscles with a blunt probe.|$|R
50|$|These radical {{statements}} and his minor {{part in the}} revolution caused the government to remove him (1849) from his position, although within a year he was reinstated as <b>prosector</b> 'on probation'. <b>Prosector</b> was a secondary position in the hospital.

50|$|The act of prosecting {{differs from}} that of dissecting. A prosection is a professionally {{prepared}} dissection prepared by a <b>prosector</b> - a person who is well versed in anatomy and who therefore prepares a specimen so that others may study and learn anatomy from it. A dissection is prepared by a student who is dissecting the specimen for the purpose of learning more about the anatomical structures pertaining to that specimen. The term dissection may also be used to describe the act of cutting. Therefore, a <b>prosector</b> dissects to prepare a prosection.|$|E

40|$|Hypothesis: External palpable {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} the facial nerve trunk quickly and safely. Design Prospective anatomical dissection study. Setting University department of human anatomy and university hospital. Methods A total of 40 human cadaver heads (79 facial nerves) were dissected by 2 <b>prosectors,</b> a surgeon with experience in the anatomy of the parotid region (J. A. P.; n = 3 D 39) and a medical student with experience in anatomical dissection and basic knowledge of the facial nerve disposition (A. M.; n = 3 D 40). A 3 -cm skin incision was made {{in the center of the}} triangle formed by the temporomandibular joint, the mastoid process, and the angle of the mandible, and dissection was continued deep until the main facial nerve trunk was identified. Main Outcome Measures The time taken from the skin incision to the identification of the nerve was monitored with a chronometer by an independent observer. The distance between the predicted and actual position of the facial nerve was measured. Results :In all cases, the facial nerve was identified and there were no significant differences in the dissection time between the 2 <b>prosectors</b> (144 vs 148 seconds). The mean distance between the predicted and the actual position of the nerve was 1. 42 mm. Conclusion :The proposed localization landmarks allowed a fast and safe identification of the facial nerve and may be of significant help during surgery around the parotid region...|$|R
50|$|Contracting infections {{caused by}} {{contaminated}} cadavers {{is a constant}} danger among <b>prosectors,</b> particularly if a skin puncture accident results from the sharp surgical instruments used {{in this kind of}} work (about 70% of pathology workers report having at least one percutaneous incident). In this case, thin surgical gloves are not enough to protect. There are many cases of pathologists who died of acute septicemia (blood poisoning) because of this. Another example, a famous historical case, is that of Dr. Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, an Austrian physician, pathologist and physiologist, who infected his finger during an autopsy and became dependent on morphine, due to the pain; and, later, on cocaine, at the instigation of his friend, Sigmund Freud.|$|R
