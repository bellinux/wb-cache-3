5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was <b>postponed</b> by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was <b>postponed</b> to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself <b>postponed</b> to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being <b>postponed</b> by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E

5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by {{a tropical storm}} watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state. Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and <b>postponed</b> {{a search for the}} wreck of TWA Flight 800.
