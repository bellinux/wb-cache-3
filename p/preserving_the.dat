5|$|The ice trade revolutionised the {{way that}} food was {{preserved}} and transported. Before the 19th century, preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking, but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead. Although using ice to chill foods was a relatively simple process, it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling the flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems. In {{the early stages of}} the ice trade there was also a tension between <b>preserving</b> <b>the</b> limited supply of ice, by limiting the flow of air over it, and <b>preserving</b> <b>the</b> food, which depended on circulating more air over the ice to create colder temperatures.|$|E
