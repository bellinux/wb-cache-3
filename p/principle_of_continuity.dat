25|$|As a mathematician, {{his most}} notable work was in {{projective}} geometry, although an early collaboration with Charles Julien Brianchon provided {{a significant contribution}} to Feuerbach's theorem. He also made discoveries about projective harmonic conjugates; relating these to the poles and polar lines associated with conic sections. He developed the concept of parallel lines meeting at a point at infinity and defined the circular points at infinity that are on every circle of the plane. These discoveries led to the principle of duality, and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> and also aided in the development of complex numbers.|$|E

It seems that his canon (κανών:norm, standard) was a standardization which in his opinion led to the ideal form. He was probably influenced by the metaphysical theory of Pythagoras who believed that behind each object [...] there was a mathematical relation that led to order and balance. The discovery of the perfect mathematical relation was a continuous attempt of the Greek [...] architects.|$|E
2500|$|Te Weehi v Regional Fisheries Office (1986) was {{the first}} modern case to {{recognize}} an aboriginal title claim in a New Zealand court since Wi Parata, granting non-exclusive customary fishing rights. [...] The Court cited the writings of Dr Paul McHugh and indicated that whilst the Treaty of Waitangi confirmed those property rights, their legal foundation was the common law <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>continuity.</b> [...] The Crown did not appeal Te Weehi which was regarded as the motivation for Crown settlement of the sea fisheries claims (1992). [...] Subsequent cases began meanwhile – and apart from the common law doctrine – to rehabilitate the Treaty of Waitangi, declaring it the [...] "fabric of New Zealand society" [...] and thus relevant even to legislation of general applicability. New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General held that the government owed a duty analogous to a fiduciary duty toward the Māori. This {{cleared the way for}} a variety of Treaty-based non-land Māori customary rights. By this time the Waitangi Tribunal in its Muriwhenua Fishing Report (1988) was describing Treaty-based and common law aboriginal title derived rights as complementary and having an 'aura' of their own.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Leibniz's work {{went on to}} have a {{great impact}} on the field of psychology. Leibniz thought that there are many petites {{perceptions}}, or small perceptions of which we perceive but of which we are unaware. He believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default, it was likely that the transition between conscious and unconscious states had intermediary steps. [...] For this to be true, there must also be a portion of the mind of which we are unaware at any given time. His theory regarding consciousness in relation to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> can be seen as an early theory regarding the stages of sleep. In this way, Leibniz's theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the unconscious. Leibniz was a direct influence on Ernst Platner, who is credited with originally coining the term Unbewußtseyn (unconscious). Additionally, the idea of subliminal stimuli {{can be traced back to}} his theory of small perceptions. Leibniz's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wilhelm Wundt.|$|E
60|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mental continuity throughout organic evolution {{may be used}} in two different ways. On the one hand, it may be held that we have more knowledge of our own minds than those of animals, and that we should use this knowledge to infer the existence of something similar to our own mental processes in animals and even in plants. On the other hand, it may be held that animals and plants present simpler phenomena, more easily analysed than those of human minds; on this ground it may be urged that explanations which are adequate in the case of animals ought not to be lightly rejected in the case of man. The practical effects of these two views are diametrically opposite: the first leads us to level up animal intelligence with what we believe ourselves to know about our own intelligence, while the second leads us to attempt a levelling down of our own intelligence to something not too remote from what we can observe in animals. It is therefore important to consider the relative justification of the two ways of applying the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>continuity.</b>|$|E
