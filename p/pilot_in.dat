5|$|Widerøe Flight 744 was a {{scheduled}} flight from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Namsos Airport, Høknesøra operated with a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter. The aircraft had registration LN-BNM and serial number 408, and {{was delivered to}} Widerøe in 1974. The aircraft had flown 40,453 hours and had met all service requirements. The <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> command, Jan Bjørstad, was 43 years old, had held a pilot's license since 1974 and had been employed in Widerøe since 1985. He had held a C certificate since 4 January 1993, and had been a <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> command since 20 January. He had flown 4,835 hours in total and had landed 13 times at Namsos Airport in the 12 {{months prior to the}} accident. The first officer, Trond Hamre, was 34 years old, had training from the United States which had been converted to a C certificate in 1988. He had 6,354 hours of flight, of which 1,356 was in a Twin Otter. He had been a <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> command for 3,441 hours prior to working for Widerøe, where he had been employed since 1990.

5|$|Although not the <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident.

5|$|As {{would emerge}} in later {{testimony}} at the post-crash hearing, this crewing combination led to {{confusion in the}} cockpit during the final flight segment, as to who was making the decisions and giving the orders as <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> command, and who was operating the engine and fuel controls as flight engineer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, the {{relationship}} between time and frequency domain joint channel estimation (JCE) in multi-branch, i. e., multi-user and/or multiple antenna, systems is explained. It is proved that the design criterion of optimum pilots for frequency domain JCE can be deduced from the design criterion of optimum pilots for time domain JCE, and vice versa. This uncovers that the optimum <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> time domain multi-branch systems, after discrete Fourier transform (DFT), will also be the optimum <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> frequency domain multi-branch systems. Similarly, the optimum <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> frequency domain multi-branch systems, after inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT), will also be the optimum <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> time domain multi-branch systems. These properties {{increase the number of}} available optimum pilots for either time or frequency domain JCE in multi-branch systems. Key-Words:- joint channel estimation; multiple antennas; multi-user; pilots; MIMO; OFDM; Multi-branch...|$|R
