He never spoke publicly about the incident, and it was quickly sidelined by the press and politely ignored by writers during his lifetime. Privately he made donations to gay campaign groups, but did not endorse them in public. In his later years {{he said to the}} actor Simon Callow, [...] "I do admire <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Ian McKellen for coming out, but I can't be doing with that myself." ...|$|E

On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me, {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening to <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me", whereas [...] "stars {{bring a lot of}} memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E

2500|$|Rodney Stark {{argues that}} [...] "the {{fundamental}} problem facing Muslim theologians vis-à-vis {{the morality of}} slavery is that Muhammad bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves", though he states that Muhammad did advise that slaves be treated well: [...] "Feed them what <b>you</b> eat yourself <b>and</b> clothe them with what you wear...They are God's <b>people</b> <b>like</b> unto <b>you</b> <b>and</b> be kind unto them".

On June 24, 2010 the band signs with <b>People</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> Records <b>and</b> later that year they announce that their new album would be released in 2011.

5000|$|The band {{recorded}} Wolves in Nashville, Tennessee, a {{city with}} a majority pro-Trump population. McIlrath recalled [...] "It was clear we'd also put ourselves physically outside of our comfort zone by leaving Chicago, which is this liberal nest where you're hard-pressed to find someone who disagrees with the progressive politics of Rise Against... I think it's really good for anybody to see both sides of the fence and spend time in a place that is hurting—and helping to create the narrative of the country you live in. That was something that was kind of always on my mind, knowing that {{there are people out there}} who fell for someone like Donald Trump, who were conned by him, and that these are <b>people</b> just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me. So we have to work out how to bridge that gap and figure out where the truth lies in a lot of our arguments with each other." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} an example of the crew of SpongeBob SquarePants eclectic musical tastes.

I don't <b>like</b> those commercial <b>people.</b> I <b>like</b> <b>you</b> guys, <b>and</b> Wilco and Ween.” The Flaming Lips performed [...] "SpongeBob & Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy" [...] on Late Night with Conan O'Brien the night before the film's release on November 19, 2004. During the performance, Wayne Coyne was encased in a giant bubble (similar to zorbs). A music video for the song was filmed as well.|$|R

[...] He resumed; [...] "it's {{too big a}} sacrifice! <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>people</b> about <b>you</b> <b>and</b> {{would see}} nobody but me and the hired man, while I admit I'm enough to jar a woman's nerves. Then think of the work; the manual work. You couldn't live as the bachelors live among dust and dirt, and it's a big {{undertaking}} to keep a homestead clean when you can't get proper help. Besides, there's the baking, cooking, <b>and</b> washing, while <b>you</b> have done nothing but superintend. I'd hate to see <b>you</b> worn <b>and</b> tired, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> know you're not so patient then.

6000|$|... "I don't want to rub it in, {{but you can}} see for {{yourself}} now, this is all a result of your being so discontented and not appreciating the dear good people here. And another thing: <b>People</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me, who want to reform things, have to be particularly careful about appearances. Think how much better you can criticize conventional customs if you yourself live up to them, scrupulously. Then people can't say you're attacking them to excuse your own infractions." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{interviews}} in October 2004 and February 2006, Schilling said about Gomez:There {{are a lot}} of people in that industry, Pedro Gomez, Joel Heyman, to name a few. People with so little skill in their profession that they need to speculate, make up, fabricate, to write something interesting enough to be printed. What makes them bad people? I am sure I cannot nail the exact reason, but I know some. Jealousy, bitterness, the need to be 'different,' I am sure there are others, but those are the ones I know off hand ... You just kind of have to realize that there are <b>people</b> that don't <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and,</b> unfortunately, sometimes those people have a voice, disliking me probably matches my dislike for him (Gomez), but I have a problem with people who don't have integrity and principle, so that stuff happens.

6000|$|A sudden {{flash of}} {{intelligence}} lit {{up for a}} moment the swarthy features of the pirate. It passed quickly. Then he spoke in an undertone to one of his men, who, with the assistance of another, led the captain of the schooner to the forward part of the ship. A stifled groan, followed by a plunge, was heard by the horrified survivors. That was all they ever knew of the fate of their late captain. But for what some would term a mere accident, even that and their own fate would have remained unknown to the world--at least during the revolution of Time.

He described the credits sequence where Aykroyd dances to Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a 1,000 Dances" [...] as the only genuine fun and energy in the entire film.
