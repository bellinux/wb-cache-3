Transmission risk appears higher in “high risk” dyads, yet this is not well defined, possibly exposing more infants to combination ARV compared with standard care. Objective. To describe characteristics of mother-infant dyads where infants received ARVs and how these characteristics relate to specific ARV regimens. Methods. Retrospective chart review of ARV-receiving newborns at St. Michael’s Hospital from 2007 to 2012 (and their mothers). Numerical and categorical variables were analyzed using t-tests/ANOVA F-tests and Fisher’s exact tests, respectively. Results. Maternal HIV status at delivery was as follows: 69 % positive and 24 % unknown. Maternal factors significantly associated with newborn-triple therapy are Canadian origin, substance abuse, unstable housing, lost custody of previous children, and sex work. Neonatal factors are child protective services involvement, NICU, and lengthier admission. Maternal factors associated with monotherapy are African origin, HIV-positive, employment, and education. Further analysis based on maternal presentation at delivery demonstrated unequal distribution of many aforementioned factors. Discussion.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the association between}} mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and maternal neutralizing antibodies to heterologous primary isolates of various HIV- 1 clades, {{to test the hypothesis}} that protective antibodies are those with broad neutralizing activity. Our study sample included 90 Thai women for whom the timing of HIV- 1 transmission (in utero or intrapartum) was known. The statistical analysis included a conditional logistic-regression model to control for both plasma viral load and duration of zidovudine prophylaxis. The higher the titer of neutralizing antibodies to a heterologous strain of the same clade, the lower the rate of MTCT of HIV- 1. More specifically, high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the MBA (CRF 01 _AE) strain were associated with low intrapartum transmission of HIV- 1. This suggested that such heterologous neutralizing antibodies may be involved in the natural prevention of late <b>perinatal</b> HIV <b>transmission.</b> These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the use of some antibodies might help to prevent <b>perinatal</b> HIV <b>transmission,</b> through passive immunoprophylaxis. Moreover, the study of humoral factors associated with MTCT of HIV- 1 may identify correlates of protection that should help in the design of efficient HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome vaccines.

40|$|Background. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infections are}} perinatally {{transmitted}} from chronically infected mothers. Supplemental antiviral therapy during late pregnancy with lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (LdT), or tenofovir (TDF) can substantially reduce <b>perinatal</b> HBV <b>transmission</b> compared to postnatal immunoprophylaxis (IP) alone. However, the cost-effectiveness {{of these measures}} is not clear. Aim. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective of supplemental antiviral agents for preventing <b>perinatal</b> HBV <b>transmission</b> in mothers with high viral load (> 6 log 10 copies/mL). Methods. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed for the risk of <b>perinatal</b> HBV <b>transmission</b> with antiviral therapies. A decision analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes in China of four competing strategies: postnatal IP alone (strategy IP), or in combination with perinatal LAM (strategy LAM + IP), LdT (strategy LdT + IP), or TDF (strategy TDF + IP). Antiviral treatments were administered from week 28 of gestation to 4 weeks after birth. Outcomes included treatment-related costs, number of infections, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to identify influential clinical and cost-related variables. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to estimate the probabilities of being cost-effective for each strategy. Results. LdT + IP and TDF + IP averted the most infections and HBV-related deaths, and gained the most QALYs. IP and TDF + IP were dominated as they resulted in less or equal QALYs with higher associated costs. LdT + IP had an incremental $ 2, 891 per QALY gained (95 % CI [$ 932 –$ 20, 372]) compared to LAM + IP (GDP per capita for China in 2013 was $ 6, 800). One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness of LdT + IP was only sensitive to the relative risk of HBV transmission comparing LdT + IP with LAM + IP. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that LdT + IP was cost-effective in most cases across willingness-to-pay range of $ 6, 800 ∼ $ 20, 400 per QALY gained. Conclusions. For pregnant HBV-infected women {{with high levels of}} viremia, supplemental use of LdT during late pregnancy combined with postnatal IP for infants is cost-effective in China...|$|R

HLA typing of samples from mothers and infants enrolled in the Ariel study, a <b>perinatal</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> cohort including 203 mother-infant pairs, was performed by serological and molecular methods. HLA effects were evaluated alone and by multivariate modeling considering also other known predictors of <b>perinatal</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> (maternal viral load, antiretroviral therapy, duration of rupture of membranes, and histological chorioamnionitis). Modest associations were seen with specific HLA markers (increased risk with infant B 67 and B 58 and maternal DR 1; decreased risk with maternal B 12), but these {{were not statistically significant}} after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Mother-infant concordance at any class I locus was a strong predictor of transmission (odds ratio [OR], 4. 16; p = 0. 028). Transmission was not associated with class II concordance. Class I HLA concordance retained its importance after adjusting for maternal viral load, antiretroviral therapy, duration of rupture of membranes or histological chorioamnionitis. In multivariate modeling, only class I concordance (OR, 3. 59; p = 0. 069) and chorioamnionitis (OR, 3. 79; p = 0. 030) were retained as independent predictors of transmission.

40|$|Since 1994, the {{availability}} of increasingly effective antiretroviral drugs for both the prevention of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and maternal treatment {{has resulted in a}} greater emphasis on prenatal HIV testing and substantial increases in prenatal testing rates. In 2000, preliminary data indicated that 766 (93 %) of 824 HIV-infected women in 25 states knew their HIV status before delivery (CDC, unpublished data, 2002). However, an estimated 280 – 370 <b>perinatal</b> HIV <b>transmissions</b> continue to occur in the United States each year (1). The primary strategy to prevent <b>perinatal</b> HIV <b>transmission</b> is to maximize prenatal HIV testing of pregnant women. States and Canadian provinces have implemented three different prenatal HIV-testing approaches. To assess their effectiveness, CDC reviewed prenatal HIV-antibody testing rates associated with these approaches. Medical record data suggest that the “opt-in ” voluntary testing approach is associated with lower testing rates than either the “opt-out ” voluntary testing approach or the mandatory newborn HIV testing approach. Under the opt-in approach, women typically are provided pre-HIV test counseling and must consent specifically to an HIV-antibody test. Under the opt-out approach, women are notified that an HIV test will be included in a standard battery of prenatal tests and procedures and that they may refuse testing (2). Under mandatory newborn HIV testing, newborns are tested for HIV, with or without the mother’s consent, if the mother’s HIV status is unknown at delivery. Three methods were used to estimate prenatal testing rates among all women who delivered, regardless of whether they received prenatal care. First, eight U. S. areas that participated during 1998 – 1999 in CDC’s Active Bacterial Core Surveillance/Emerging Infections Program (ABC) Network assessed HIV testing during prenatal care and < 2 days before delivery by reviewing a stratified random sample of labor and delivery records and prenatal records forwarded to birthing hospital...|$|R
