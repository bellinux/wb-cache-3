Firstly, it investigates the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on axial superresolution. It proves theoretically that axial superresolution can not be obtained by two-zone phase filter with <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> pi, and it gets the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> with which axial superresolution can be brought by two-zone phase filter. Secondly, it studies the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on transverse superresolution. It finds that the three-zone phase filter with arbitrary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> has an almost equal optimal transverse gain to that of commonly used three-zone phase filter, but can produce a much higher axial superresolution gain. Thirdly, it investigates the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on three-dimensional superresolution. Three-dimensional superresolution capability and design margin of three-zone complex filter with arbitrary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> are obtained, which presents the theoretical basis for three-dimensional superresolution design. Finally, it investigates the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on focal shift. To obtain desired focal shifts, it designs a series of three-zone phase filters with different <b>phase</b> <b>shifts.</b> A spatial light modulator (SLM) is used to implement the designed filters.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method: wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method. By {{different}} combinations of a quarter-wave-plate, a half-wave-plate, and an analyzer, phase delays are introduced in the interference light path {{in order to achieve}} the <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> digital holog-raphy. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiments are conducted to verify the validity of this method. The numerical simulation shows that the result of the wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method is consistent with that of the traditional four-step <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method. The experimen-tal results successfully reconstruct the object light intensity in the image plane. Based on the wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method, a pixelated wave-plate array structure is designed to achieve real-time <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> digital holography. The wave-plate array <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method not only can reconstruct object image of high quality, but also can be used in dynamic phase measurement. Therefore, pixelated wave-plate array structure and wave-plate array <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method could be widely used in practical applications. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10. 1117 / 1.
