5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E
5|$|Monotype {{licensed}} {{and released}} the font Centaur {{around the same}} time as Bembo. It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers. Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo, the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 (the so-called Venetian style). Like Bembo, its italic (by Frederic Warde) comes from the 1520s, being again loosely {{based on the work of}} Arrighi from around 1520. Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure, something <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> its digital facsimile. Penguin often used it for headings and titles of 'classic' editions, particularly its capitals and italic; its lower-case does not so effectively harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted 'e'.|$|E

5000|$|The {{case was}} criticised as {{representing}} {{an example of}} judicial activism, and that Parliament {{did not intend to}} offer financial compensation for breaches of the act. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> because <b>in</b> New Zealand, the act is not entrenched nor does it achieve the status of [...] "Supreme Law" [...] like similar nations have in their constitutions. However, following the decision, the Law Commission advised Parliament not to overrule the decision, and Parliament has since followed this advice.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 1813, {{some of the}} Tejanos who colonized Texas in the Spanish Colonial Period {{established}} a government in Texas that desired independence from Spanish-ruled Mexico. In those days, there was no concept of identity as Mexican. Many Mexicans were more loyal to their states/provinces than to their country as a whole, which was a colony of Spain. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> frontier regions such as Zacatecas, Texas, Yucatán, Oaxaca, New Mexico, etc.|$|E
25|$|Standards of play {{can vary}} from semi-professional to {{occasional}} recreational level. While many clubs train in similar ways to professional teams, village or park cricket is played purely for fun, and club cricket is often enjoyed {{as much for the}} social element as for the competition.

25|$|Despite the {{political}} unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it {{develop into a}} more economically coherent and viable entity. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> Greater Poland, Silesia and Eastern Pomerania controlled by Prussia (later becoming {{a part of the}} German Empire); areas which eventually, thanks largely to the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918 and Silesian Uprisings, were reconstituted {{as a part of the}} Second Polish Republic, becoming the country's most prosperous regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} his sacred music varies from simple homophony, {{designed}} for absolute clarity of textual expression in conformance with {{the dictates of}} the Council of Trent (as Mantua was a center of the Counter-Reformation, {{this was to be}} expected), to motet settings similar in expressive intensity to his madrigals including passages of surprising chromaticism not unlike that of Gesualdo. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the 1581 collections: Ascendente Jesu, for example, contains colorful examples of text-painting such as he used in the works he was composing for the Ferrarese court at the time.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{many of these}} {{relationships}} might be more clearly understood as mentoring relationships between adult men and young boys rather than an analog of marriage. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of Sparta, where the relationship was intended to further a young boy's military training. While the relationship was generally lifelong and of profound emotional significance to the participants, it was not considered marriage by contemporary culture, and the relationship continued even after participants reached age 20 and married women, as was expected in the culture.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} {{professional}} bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving {{and fail to}} follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of professions <b>in</b> which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.|$|R

Norman Rockwell's first cover for Life, Tain't You. was published May 10, 1917. Rockwell's paintings were featured on Life cover 28 times between 1917 and 1924. Rea Irvin, the first art director of The New Yorker and creator of the character [...] "Eustace Tilley", got his start drawing covers for Life.|$|R
40|$|During World War I public {{libraries}} in the United States functioned in multiple ways as civic spaces.

25|$|Since the 1980s, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} trend to split up railway companies, with companies owning the rolling stock separated from those owning the infrastructure. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> Europe, where this arrangement is required by the European Union. This has allowed open access by any train operator to any portion of the European railway network. In the UK, the railway track is state owned, with a public controlled body (Network Rail) running, maintaining and developing the track, while Train Operating Companies have run the trains since privatization in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|By 1300, {{starting}} with Giotto and his pupils, still-life painting was revived {{in the form}} of fictional niches on religious wall paintings which depicted everyday objects. Through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, still life in Western art remained primarily an adjunct to Christian religious subjects, and convened religious and allegorical meaning. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the work of Northern European artists, whose fascination with highly detailed optical realism and symbolism led them to lavish great attention on their paintings' overall message. Painters like Jan van Eyck often used still-life elements as part of an iconographic program.|$|E
25|$|Aboriginals {{are also}} more likely to be the victims of crime. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the younger {{population}} (aged 15–34), where acts of violence are two and a half times more likely to occur than in the older population. Domestic violence and sexual abuse against children is more prevalent in the Aboriginal population with sexual abuse affecting 25–50% of Aboriginal female children versus 20–25% of female children in the general population. Children who come from homes with a history of violence are at a greater risk of becoming the perpetrators of violence later in life. This is especially true of males.|$|E
2500|$|Protestants did {{not abandon}} all icons and symbols of Christianity. They {{typically}} avoid {{the use of}} images, except the cross, in any context suggestive of veneration. The cross remained their central icon. Technically both major sects of Christianity have had their icons, states Carlos Eire, a professor of religious studies and history, but its meaning has been different to each and [...] "one man's devotion was another man's idolatry". This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> not only <b>in</b> the intra-Christian debate, states Eire, but also when soldiers of Catholic kings replaced [...] "horrible Aztec idols" [...] in the American colonies with [...] "beautiful crosses and Mary idols".|$|R
30|$|The samples {{used for}} this study were highly educated and very urban groups.

25|$|This was {{the first}} major {{military}} victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a European nation. Russia's defeat was met with shock in the West and across the Far East. Japan's prestige rose greatly as it came {{to be seen as a}} modern nation. Concurrently, Russia lost virtually its entire Pacific and Baltic fleets, and also much international esteem. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the eyes of Germany and Austria-Hungary before World War I. Russia was France's and Serbia's ally, and that loss of prestige had a significant effect on Germany's future when planning for war with France, and Austria-Hungary's war with Serbia.|$|E
25|$|Much {{but not all}} of {{the area}} now suffers from high {{unemployment}} and parts of it are amongst the most economically deprived communities in the UK.

According to the Government's 2007 Index of Deprivation (ID 2007), Sandwell is the third most deprived authority in the West Midlands region, after Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent, and the 14th most deprived of the UK's 354 districts.

Walsall is the fifth most deprived district in the West Midlands region, and the 45th most deprived in the country.|$|E
25|$|At {{very low}} doses, doxepin has not shown {{discontinuation}} or withdrawal effects nor rebound insomnia. Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies {{of up to}} 12weeks duration. This {{appears to be in}} contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of tolerance and dependence (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness. It is for this reason that, unlike doxepin, they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1week). It is not entirely clear why doxepin and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but {{it has been suggested that}} it may have to do with the lack of selectivity for the H1 receptor of the latter or may have to do with the use of optimal doses. Unlike very-low-dose doxepin, most first-generation antihistamines also have marked anticholinergic activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> older people, and antihistamines with concomitant anticholinergic effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65. Anticholinergic activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H1 receptor blockade.|$|E

She was particularly happy that this year's Seminar was being held outside of Dublin because she felt that this would emphasise that the difficulties faced by organisations working with mobile population groups and addressing their needs were no longer limited to agencies in Dublin but were being experienced throughout Ireland. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> now <b>in</b> relation to refugees and asylum seekers as. the dispersal policy has been in force {{for more than a year}} now. While there are many positive aspects to the cultural diversity this is bringing throughout Ireland, it has also emphasised the special needs of these people and the lack of services to address them.

40|$|This paper’s {{objective}} {{is to take a}} more in-depth look at, and encourage debate on, the mechanism that were in force in the birth, growth and crisis of traditional electrical systems. The merit of Arteta, as with other SMEs in the electrical sector, resided in its ability to provide, almost from the outset (1896), the benefits of hydroelectricity. This supply was aimed at towns that and been ignored by the larger Spanish providers due to their not being sufficiently industrialized or urbanized (as was the case of Pamplona). When these firms agreed to integrate the peripheral electrical systems in the mid- 20 th century, they inherited a series of consumer markets which, though mature, were poorly attended to in terms of {{the quantity and quality of}} the service provided. In this sense, the history of Arteta shows the many production drawbacks this type of electrical company had to face in order to satisfy a growing demand. Something that was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> when, <b>in</b> a scenario of competitive or cartelized markets, they adopted merely defensive strategies to avoid being ousted from the market. ...|$|R
40|$|Systematic {{review of}} {{structural}} interventions for intimate partner violence in low- and middle-income countries: organizing evidence for prevention Christine Bourey 1 *, Whitney Williams 1, Erin Elizabeth Bernstein 2 and Rob Stephenson 2, 3 Background: Despite growing attention to intimate partner violence (IPV) globally, systematic evaluation {{of evidence for}} IPV prevention remains limited. This <b>particularly</b> is <b>true</b> <b>in</b> relation to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where researchers often organize evidence by current interventions strategies rather than comprehensive models of IPV. Applying the concept of structural interventions to IPV, we systematically reviewed the quantitative impact of such interventions for prevention of male-to-female IPV in LMIC in order to (a) highlight current opportunities for IPV research and programming and (b) demonstrate how structural interventions may provide an organizing framework through which to build an evidence base for IPV prevention. Methods: We identified articles by systematically searching PubMed and Web of Science, reviewing references of selected studies, and contacting 23 experts. Inclusion criteria included original research, written in English...|$|R
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} cultural capital that sometimes {{comes into play}} in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts between parents and children. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are {{more familiar with the}} rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face {{as the result of the}} penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.|$|E
500|$|Shelley was {{particularly}} interested in tying private, domestic history to public, political history. She emphasises romance, the family, sympathy, and compassion {{in the lives of}} the people she writes about. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> her essays on Petrarch and Vincenzo Monti. Her belief that these domestic influences would improve society, and that women could be at the forefront of them, ties her approach to that of other early feminist historians such as Mary Hays and Anna Jameson. Shelley argues that women possess a [...] "distinctive virtue" [...] in their ability to sympathise with others and should use this ability to improve society. She castigates Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for example, for abandoning his children at a foundling hospital, decrying the [...] "masculine egotism" [...] associated with his philosophy—a criticism similar to the one she makes of Victor Frankenstein in Frankenstein (1818).|$|E
500|$|Many constituencies, {{especially}} those with small electorates, were {{under the control of}} rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or pocket boroughs, because they were said to be in the pockets of their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large landed estate. Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven, while the Earl of Lonsdale controlled nine. Writing in 1821, Sydney Smith proclaimed that [...] "The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!" [...] T. H. B. Oldfield claimed in his Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons. A member who represented a pocket borough was expected to vote as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election.|$|E
40|$|With recent {{advances}} in computer hardware as well as numerical techniques, many complicated three-dimensional flows directly relevant to engineering interests can now be modelled and solved.

40|$|Abstract—The {{branching}} of streamers in atmospheric-pressure air, dense gases, and liquids is {{a common}} occurrence whose ori-gins are likely found with many causes, both deterministic and stochastic. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of sto-chastic inhomogeneities on the propensity of branching of stream-ers in high-pressure gases. Index Terms—Branching, corona, streamers. THE BRANCHING of streamers, which is a phenomenonthat occurs in nearly all high-pressure gases and liquids, is being investigated from many experimental and computational perspectives [1]. Branching likely depends on many parameters (e. g., gas or liquid type, pressure, and rate of voltage rise). How-ever, this dependence cannot be too system specific because branching is so common. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for streamers <b>in</b> liquids where branching is nearly universal. One proposed mechanism for streamer branching is inhomogeneities in th...|$|R
