25|$|Another {{adaptive}} use of fluorescence is {{to generate}} red {{light from the}} ambient blue light of the photic zone to aid vision. Red light can only be seen across short distances due to attenuation of red light wavelengths by water. Many fish species that fluoresce are small, group-living, or benthic/aphotic, and have conspicuous patterning. This patterning is caused by fluorescent tissue and is visible to {{other members of the}} species, however the patterning is invisible at other visual spectra. These intraspecific fluorescent patterns also coincide with intra-species signaling. The patterns present in ocular rings to indicate directionality of an individual’s gaze, and along fins to indicate directionality of an individual’s movement. Current research suspects that this red fluorescence is used for <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> between members of the same species. Due to the prominence of blue light at ocean depths, red light and light of longer wavelengths are muddled, and many predatory reef fish have little to no sensitivity for light at these wavelengths. Fish such as the fairy wrasse that have developed visual sensitivity to longer wavelengths are able to display red fluorescent signals that give a high contrast to the blue environment and are conspicuous to conspecifics in short ranges, yet are relatively invisible to other common fish that have reduced sensitivities to long wavelengths. Thus, fluorescence can be used as adaptive signaling and intra-species communication in reef fish.|$|E

500|$|On February 16, 1824, de la Torre {{mandated}} a more-aggressive pursuit {{and prosecution}} of pirates. In March the governor ordered {{a search for}} the schooner Caballo Blanco, reportedly used in the boarding of Boniton and Bonne Sophie and similar attacks. In <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> with Mayagüez military commander José Rivas, he asked Rivas to find someone trustworthy who could launch a mission to capture [...] "the so-called Cofresin" [...] and to notify him personally of the pirate's arrest. Authorizing the use of force, the governor described Cofresí as [...] "one of the evil ones that I am pursuing" [...] and acknowledged that the pirate was protected by Cabo Rojo authorities. The mayor was unable (or unwilling) to cooperate, despite orders from de la Torre. Rivas tracked Cofresí to his house twice, but found it empty. When the captain lost contact with the pirate and his wife, he was also unable to communicate with the mayor. A similar search was undertaken in San Germán, whose mayor reported to de la Torre on March 12, 1824.|$|E
2500|$|The Nash {{equilibrium}} defines stability only {{in terms}} of unilateral deviations. In cooperative games such a concept is not convincing enough. Strong Nash equilibrium allows for deviations by every conceivable coalition. Formally, a strong Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which no coalition, taking the actions of its complements as given, can cooperatively deviate in a way that benefits all of its members. However, the strong Nash concept is sometimes perceived as too [...] "strong" [...] in that the environment allows for unlimited <b>private</b> <b>communication.</b> In fact, strong Nash equilibrium has to be Pareto efficient. As a result of these requirements, strong Nash is too rare to be useful in many branches of game theory. However, in games such as elections with many more players than possible outcomes, it can be more common than a stable equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|Members of a {{tribunal}} {{should not}} communicate independently or privately to any material witness. If they do so, {{the fact that}} communication has occurred must be disclosed to the parties concerned right away. The justification for this rule {{is that it would}} be unfair for a person to be judged on an issue based on information obtained by an adjudicator which is unknown to that person. In Re Low Fook Cheng Patricia (1998), a lawyer appealed to set aside the penalty for misconduct imposed on her by the Law Society of Singapore. The appeal was based on the ground that the chairman of the Inquiry Committee had contacted a witness to enquire if the witness could assist the committee in its inquiry, but this was not made known to the appellant. Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck considered such an act of <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> with a material witness as [...] "pierc the veritable armour of impartiality which every tribunal exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions must don". Thus, the penalty imposed by the Law Society was set aside.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1971, disputed {{elections}} in Pakistan led the then East Pakistan to declare independence as Bangladesh. Repression and violence by the Pakistani army led 10 million refugees to cross border in to India {{over the coming}} months. Finally in December 1971, Gandhi directly intervened in the conflict to liberate Bangladesh. India emerged victorious in the resulting conflict to become the dominant power of South Asia. India had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union promising mutual assistance {{in the case of}} war, while Pakistan received active support from the United States during the conflict. U.S. President Richard Nixon disliked Gandhi personally, referring to her as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "clever fox" [...] in his <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Nixon later wrote of the war: [...] " [...] suckered [...] Suckered us.....this woman suckered us.". Relations with the U.S. became distant as Gandhi developed closer ties with the Soviet Union after the war. The latter grew to become India's largest trading partner and its biggest arms supplier for much of Gandhi's premiership. India's new hegemonic position as articulated under the [...] "Indira Doctrine" [...] led to attempts to bring the Himalayan states under the Indian sphere of influence. Nepal and Bhutan remained aligned with India, while in 1975, after years of building up support, Gandhi incorporated Sikkim into India, after a referendum in which a majority of Sikkimese voted to join India. This was denounced as a [...] "despicable act" [...] by China.|$|E

40|$|Collins and Popescu {{realized}} {{a powerful}} analogy between several resources in classical and quantum information theory. The Collins-Popescu analogy states that public classical <b>communication,</b> <b>private</b> classical <b>communication,</b> and secret key interact {{with one another}} somewhat similarly to the way that classical communication, quantum communication, and entanglement interact. This paper discusses the information-theoretic treatment of this analogy for the case of noisy quantum channels. We determine a capacity region for a quantum channel interacting with the noiseless resources of public classical <b>communication,</b> <b>private</b> classical <b>communication,</b> and secret key. We then compare this region with the classical-quantum-entanglement region from our prior efforts and explicitly observe the information-theoretic consequences of the strong correlations in entanglement and the lack of a super-dense coding protocol in the public-private-secret-key setting. The region simplifies for several realistic, physically-motivated channels such as entanglement-breaking channels, Hadamard channels, and quantum erasure channels, and we are able to compute and plot the region for several examples of these channels.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{and compares}} the moderating impact of organisational communication {{on the level}} of job satisfaction experienced by public sector administrative employees compared with private sector administrative employees. The findings from this pilot study suggest the significance of communication variables in moderating the job satisfaction of employees within all workplaces. In addition, the research findings suggest that there are significant organisational communication differences experienced by public and private sector employees in the workplace. There are implications emerging from this research. Firstly, management must acknowledge the importance of communication factors in moderating the impact of job satisfaction variables because these variables in turn affect employees' productivity. Secondly, this study has provided some evidence that the assumptions about the superiority of <b>private</b> sector <b>communication</b> and organisational processes are probably not warranted. The perception that <b>private</b> sector <b>communication</b> practices are significantly better than public sector practices appears not to have been substantiated in this study.
