Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be isolated from blastocyst stage embryos and cultured in the laboratory environment.

Indirect evidence suggests the existence of temporally distinct intermediate <b>pluripotent</b> <b>cell</b> populations as primitive ectoderm is formed. We coupled an in vitro model of primitive ectoderm formation (the transition of embryonic stem cells to early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells) with ddPCR-based techniques to identify three novel genes, Psc 1, CRTR- 1 and PRCE, that were expressed differently during <b>pluripotent</b> <b>cell</b> progression. Detailed mapping of these genes with Oct 4, Rex 1 and Fgf 5 on pregastrulation embryos provided the first molecular evidence {{for the existence of}} successive, temporally distinct <b>pluripotent</b> <b>cell</b> populations in the embryo between the ICM and primitive ectoderm.

The formation of early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells from mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells provides a model to understand how one such transition is regulated. EPL cells form from mES cells in response to l-proline uptake through the transporter Slc 38 a 2.

Inhibition of these pathways prevented the acquisition of most, but not all, features of EPL cells, suggesting that other pathways are required.
