40|$|This study {{estimates}} the earnings losses associated with workplace injuries {{that lead to}} <b>permanent</b> <b>partial</b> disability. <b>Using</b> unique administrative data from California, injured workers are matched to their co-workers with similar pre-injury earnings. Earnings loss is estimated as the difference in earnings between these two groups following injury. It is found that earnings losses are large. Moreover, {{despite the fact that}} earnings rebound after an initial steep fall, four to five years after injury earnings losses are 25 percent. A large share of the earnings loss is due to lower employment after injury among injured workers. Earnings losses are smaller for workers: with less severe injuries, lower pre-injury earnings, employed in larger firms, and injured when the labor market is robust. Workers suffering from spinal cord injuries and psychiatric disorders experienced particularly large losses. Workers employed in manufacturing industries experience the largest losses; however, the disparities across industries are an artifact of differential severity of injuries and pre-injury earnings. There is some evidence that suggests that benefits are not equitable: some workers receiving different disability ratings and benefits experience the same loss in earnings. Finally, {{there is no evidence that}} the 21 percent increase in temporary total disability benefits in California in 1994 affected employment or earnings losses in the long run. ...|$|R

40|$|Using a new {{and rich}} data source on {{permanent}} disability claims, this article explores two issues relating to <b>permanent</b> <b>partial</b> disability (PPD) benefits. First, the process of determining the final disability rating, which affects the actual level of PPD benefits, is modeled. Differences between the initial impairment rating provided by the treating physician and the final disability rating are investigated to determine what factors, in addition to physical impairment, influence {{the determination of the}} final <b>permanent,</b> <b>partial</b> disability rating and, hence, the amount of indemnity benefits. This investigation highlights and measures some of the equity concerns inherent in establishing PPD benefits. Second, the influence of the final disability rating on the dollar amount of the <b>permanent</b> <b>partial</b> and total indemnity benefit award is measured. The empirical findings suggest that the same injuries, as measured by a physician impairment rating, may receive very different final disability ratings and thus have very different claim costs as a result of factors unrelated to the injury. These differences are magnified across states...|$|R

More specifically, the LHWCA entitles a worker to reasonable and necessary medical benefits and indemnity benefits. There are four categories of disability benefits: temporary total, temporary <b>partial,</b> <b>permanent</b> total, and <b>permanent</b> <b>partial.</b> The difference between the types of benefits depends on whether the injured worker has achieved medical permanency, and whether the injured worker can return to his pre-injury employment, or return {{to some form of}} suitable alternative employment.

Human capital investments or job accommodations can reduce productivity losses, but the significant determinants of losses differ for the stable versus unstable employment groups.

30|$|Many {{economic}} studies have assessed {{factors that may}} affect the labour supply {{of people with disabilities}} (for literature surveys, see Bound and Burkhauser 1999;Currie and Madrian 1999). In contrast, few studies have investigated conditions that influence whether workers remain in the workforce after the onset of a health condition (Burkhauser et al. 1995;Butler et al. 1995;Daly and Bound 1996;Campolieti 2005) 1. These studies have focused on how reductions of job demands may improve the labour market attachment of disabled workers. Daly and Bound (1996) showed that job demands can be lowered through workplace accommodations or a job change. Thus after the onset of a disability the worker may either continue to work for the employer, which provides accommodations that reduce job demands, or change employer. Burkhauser et al. (1995) found that accommodations increase the employment duration of US workers acquiring a disability by a factor of almost three. Butler et al. (1995) found that Canadian workers with <b>permanent</b> <b>partial</b> impairments who returned to work with modified equipment, light workloads or reduced working hours had significantly more stable labour market attachment than workers who did not have their working conditions accommodated. Campolieti (2005), who studied the employment duration of workers with <b>permanent</b> <b>partial</b> impairments who returned to work after a work injury, also found a positive effect of workplace accommodations. However, the size of the accommodation estimates was much smaller than those found by Burkhauser et al. (1995). Campolieti (2005 : 497) concludes that this difference suggests that workplace accommodations may be more effective in preventing departures from employment for workers who have not previously left the workforce for health reasons than for workers who are re-entering after an occupational injury.|$|R

40|$|Sentinel- 1 A is a 2 -ton {{spacecraft}} of the Copernicus Earth observation program {{operated by}} ESA's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Sentinel- 1 A and its sister spacecraft Sentinel- 1 B {{operate in a}} sun-synchronous orbit at about 700 km altitude. On 2016 / 08 / 23 17 : 07 : 37 UTC, Sentinel- 1 A suffered from an anomaly resulting in a sudden <b>permanent</b> <b>partial</b> power loss and significant impulsive orbit and attitude changes. A deeper investigation identified that an impulsive orbit change against flight direction of 0. 7 mm/s, estimated {{at the time of}} the event, gave the best results in terms of GPS residuals. At the same time, a peak attitude off-pointing of 0. 7 ° (around the spacecraft yaw axis) and peak attitude rate increase of 0. 04 °/s (around the same axis) were observed. The simultaneous occurrence of these anomalies, starting from a sudden attitude change and ending with a <b>permanent</b> <b>partial</b> power loss, made an MMOD (Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris) impact onto a solar array a possible explanation for this event. While the spacecraft is able to continue its mission nominally, a detailed investigation involving ESA's Space Debris and Flight Dynamics experts was conducted. An MMOD impact as an explanation gained further credibility, due to the pictures of the solar array taken by the on-board camera displaying a significant damage area. On September 7 th, JSpOC (US Joint Space Operations Centre) informed SDO on 8 tracked fragments that are considered to be released by Sentinel- 1 A after the impact. This paper addresses the analysis that was performed on the data characterising the attitude and orbit change, the on-board camera image, and the tracked fragments. The data helped to identify the linear momentum vector while a flux analysis helped to identify the origin of the impactor and allowed to understand its mass and size characteristics...|$|R
