25|$|In the semi-finals, the Islanders {{faced the}} Buffalo Sabres, who had {{finished}} second {{overall in the}} NHL standings. The Islanders won {{the first two games}} in Buffalo, including a 2-1 victory in game two on Bob Nystrom's goal in double overtime. They {{went on to win the}} series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the Philadelphia Flyers, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25–0–10) during the regular season. In game one in Philadelphia, the Islanders won 4–3 on Denis Potvin's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3–2, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4-2 lead in the third period but Bob Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup. This was the most recent Stanley Cup clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win a Stanley Cup (in 1980) with Europeans (Stefan Persson, Anders Kallur) on its roster.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton {{explained that they}} [...] "wanted {{to bring her back}} in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic." [...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, [...] "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally. We think we <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> and because we <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, and we think that's a good thing." ...|$|E

Executive producer David Mirkin thought {{it was difficult to}} make Abe funny because he is a [...] "boring and tedious" [...] character. He thinks that even though [...] "Abe's doing all these complaints, what makes him funny is that the things he says are actually funny {{in the context of the}} boring and tedium." [...] Mirkin thought this was a [...] "big challenge, and Bill and Josh <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> very well." ...|$|E

500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{continued its}} near-deification {{of the event}} as a defining moment {{in the evolution of}} rock 'n' roll, with Jon Landau declaring, [...] "The Concert for Bangla Desh is rock reaching for its manhood." [...] As for Harrison, [...] "the spirit he creates through his own demeanor is inspirational. From the personal point of view, Concert for Bangla Desh was George's moment. He put it together; and he <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> and for that he deserves the admiration of all of us." [...] To the Rolling Stone writer, the highpoint of the album was the closing [...] "Bangla Desh", whose lyrics were no longer [...] "an expression of intent but of an accomplished mission". Landau had praise for the pacing and professionalism of the entire show, the only [...] "incongruous" [...] moment being Leon Russell's [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash"/"Youngblood" [...] segment, since it was straight from the singer's usual repertoire.|$|E
500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. I feel like we <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and were able to show people what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, and from what I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those people are working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Ian Youngs of BBC News {{noted that}} the song was another {{diatribe}} about fame and {{how difficult it is}} being in the public eye. He further added that it [...] "ranks among the disappointments" [...] on the album saying it feels lacklustre and commented about the [...] "embarrassing rap". Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine commented that barring Madonna's rapping, [...] "Hollywood" [...] is at least engaging. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought [...] "following up 'American Life' with 'Hollywood' was nearly as ballsy" [...] due to its lyrical content. Edna Gundersen of USA Today {{noted that the}} song [...] "attest to her undiminished skills as a shrewd pop composer". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH commented that everything rhymes with [...] "Hollywood", and after commented the song would be better without these lazy lyrics, adding [...] " [...] has the name Madonna on it so it will sell, but it's hardly vintage stuff. Time for some musical reinvention to go with the incessant changes of image." [...] In another review, Chuck Taylor from Billboard expressed his disappointment with the song. He explained that [...] "Hollywood" [...] is [...] "a far cry from the ingenious fortitude displayed on so many previous singles of [...] two decades of career". He panned Ahmadzaï's limited electronic production and Madonna's excessive usage of acoustic guitar on the track, along with [...] "whiney, preachy lyrics". Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Bernard Zuel called Ahmadzaï a [...] "one-trick pony" [...] for his production, but felt he <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> [...] "on the groove-rich 'Hollywood'". Ben Wener from The Beaver County Times condemned the track as a [...] "knowingly hypocritical attack on Hollywood".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} acclaim from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it an A-, {{praising the}} unlikely pairing of Bender and Hermes, writing: [...] "If I had {{to name a}} character on the show least likely to pluck at my heartstrings, Bender and Hermes would be {{near the top of}} the list...and yet they <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> I'm not sure if Baby Bender violates continuity or not, but I don't care. It worked." [...] Handlen called the episode [...] "more thoughtful" [...] and also felt that the episode provided depth and growth to both Bender and Hermes without compromising characterization. [...] In the case of Hermes, Handlen stated, [...] "Hermes can be an obsessive, number-loving accountant, and still have that memory of his younger self saving Baby Bender from the trash heap. It works because the twist is the discovery of compassion in someone we liked and wanted to love." [...] Danny Gallagher of TVSquad felt that the episode marked the return of the Futuramas [...] "true sense of emotion," [...] comparing it to previous episodes like season four's [...] "Jurassic Bark". In particular, Gallagher noted the highly effective use of the Central Bureaucracy, stating that it allowed the show to use a Douglas Adams-feel. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects stated that the episode worked [...] "99.9%" [...] and that it recovered what he felt had been lacking from the previous episodes of season six. [...] While he disliked the opening Star Wars gag, he felt that the rest of the episode made up for it, stating that [...] "Lethal Inspection" [...] was [...] "by far, the funniest episode since the shows return. If the writers can keep this up, then my faith will have been fully restored." ...|$|E

2500|$|Third baseman Bill Coughlin, {{known as}} [...] "Scranton Bill", was named team captain in 1907 and 1908.

[...] Although no known comprehensive list is known to exist of all times when the hidden ball trick has worked, Coughlin reportedly <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> seven times (and at three different positions) – more than any other player in MLB history.

2500|$|Marquis {{became a}} {{full-time}} starter in 2004 with the Cardinals, and {{came under the}} wing of pitching coach Dave Duncan who observed that Marquis [...] "always had a devastating skinner (sinker), and ... needs {{to get back to}} it more." [...] "It's just the pitch I had growing up, and I got away from it", Marquis said. He stole a base against former Atlanta Braves teammate and mentor Greg Maddux on May 3, who also stole a base in the same game. It marked the first time since June 11, 1950, when Warren Spahn of the Braves and Bob Rush of the Cubs <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> that opposing pitchers stole a base in the same game. Marquis strung together a Cardinals' season-high 11-game winning streak from May 31 – September 4, the longest by a Cards pitcher since 1985 when John Tudor also won 11 straight games. He had a shutout streak of 18⅓ innings from August 24 – September 10.

[...] The performance was also considered as [...] "a rocker booming with guitar solos and fireworks," [...] commended for [...] "utilizing illusions" [...] to entertain the crowd. Dave Tianen of The Sentinel added, [...] "Shifting emotions as quickly as she shifted her head, shoulders, and hips, Jackson and crew launched into a thrashing version of [...] "Black Cat," [...] completed by whining guitar rifts comparable to much heavy metal." [...] On the tour's opening night, Jackson stated, [...] "The black cat, he peed - on stage!," [...] causing her and several dancers to slip and fall while performing. The panther, named Rhythm, was subsequently removed from the tour after the first leg due to safety concerns, as well as her own love of animals.|$|E
