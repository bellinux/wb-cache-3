2500|$|Starting in 1902, Quaker Oats oatmeal boxes {{came with}} a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford. The lots, {{sometimes}} as small as [...] by 10 feet, were carved out of a [...] tract in a never-built subdivision called [...] "Liberty Park". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, collected the deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the [...] "oatmeal lots". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several lots {{would need to be}} combined before building could start. Since the subdivision into small lots predated Milford's planning and zoning regulations, the deeds were entirely legal, although they created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from the lots.In the mid-1970s, when the town wanted to develop the area, town officials {{put an end to the}} oatmeal lots in a [...] "general foreclosure" [...] that avoided the enormous expense of individual foreclosures by condemning nearly all of the property in one legal filing. One of the streets in the Liberty Park subdivision plans, Shelland Street, was later built in the late 1990s as an access road to the Milford Power Company. The site is currently home to the BIC Corporation's lighter factory at 565 Bic Drive. (In a separate land giveaway in 1955 tied to the Sergeant Preston of the Yukon television show, Quaker Oats offered in its <b>Puffed</b> <b>Wheat</b> and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike.) ...|$|E

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method {{was developed for}} determination of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) in foods using a monolithic column with sample clean up on an immunoaffinity column. The method was validated for analysis of AFB 1 in rice, bread, <b>puffed</b> corn snack, <b>wheat</b> flour and peanut samples. The average recoveries for AFB 1 in different foods ranged from 94. 4 to 102. 5 % with the coefficient of variation lower than 10 % for all foods. Limit of detection was 0. 01 ng/g. A survey of AFB 1 was performed on 90 samples collected from Tehran retail market in June 2005. The results showed {{that none of the}} bread and wheat flour samples were contaminated with AFB 1. The mean AFB 1 levels in rice, puffed corn snack and peanut samples were 4. 17, 0. 11, and 1. 97 ng/g, respectively. The level of contamination of 3 samples (one rice sample and two peanuts samples) to AFB 1 was found to be higher than 5 ng/g. Although all food samples had mean concentration of AFB 1 below the maximum tolerated level in Iran, the mean intake of AFB 1 from rice was estimated 3. 49 times higher than the guidance value of 1 ng AFB 1 /Kg body weight/day. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to monitor AFB 1 in foods, especially in rice, in Iran. This is the first study on exposure assessment of Iranian population to AFB 1...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{unhealthy}} {{lifestyles and}} diets among Americans {{is leading to}} an influx of health-conscious consumers on the search for more nutritious, health-promoting food options that match their taste preferences. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine consumer preferences and specific attributes of whole grain and high fiber products that drive acceptability through descriptive analysis and preference mapping on whole wheat breads and an extruded pinto bean and brown rice flour snack <b>puff.</b> Commercial whole <b>wheat</b> breads, characterized by 26 appearance, aroma, flavor, and texture attributes, were separated into two distinct groups. The first group consisted of attributes similar to white bread: sweet, moist, and sticky. While the second group, had attributes associated with traditional wheat breads: wheaty, earthy, bitter. Consumers were clustered into three groups for clearer understanding of market segmentation. The first cluster liked all breads equally, while the second liked the breads associated with white bread attributes and the third cluster liked the classic wheat breads more. This was confirmed through partial least squares (PLS) regression, which showed if each attribute positively or negatively affected overall liking for each respective cluster. In the second study, composite flours were extruded with varying pinto bean flour levels and feed moisture conditions to produce an acceptable puffed snack product. The level of bean flour affected the majority of the fifteen descriptive attributes, while feed moisture only affected texture and appearance attributes. Consumers found the extruded puffs with up to 15 % bean flour to be the most acceptable. Preference mapping and PLS regression showed higher overall liking scores for samples characterized by rice flavor and larger diameter and lower scores for extrudates with higher bean flavor and grittier textures. Overall, these studies were successful in determining descriptive attributes as well as their relationship to consumer acceptability through preference mapping. These data may be helpful for future researchers when developing new whole grain and high fiber products. Advisor: Devin J. Ros...|$|R

50|$|The {{show was}} {{initially}} sponsored by Ovaltine, a flavored milk supplement, and its scripts {{were written by}} Ovaltine's Chicago ad agency staff.

Fans could redeem Ovaltine proofs of purchase for a secret decoder badge that decoded brief messages airing in the last moments of the show. Contrary to an urban legend made popular by the film A Christmas Story, the messages were never advertisements for Ovaltine, but were usually related to the following episode. In 1940, Quaker <b>Puffed</b> <b>Wheat</b> Sparkies became the show's sponsor and brought fictional aviator Captain Sparks to the show.

50|$|A {{number of}} foods are {{claimed to have}} been invented at the fair. The most popular claim is that the waffle-style ice cream cone was invented and first sold during the fair. However, it is widely {{believed}} that it was not invented at the Fair, but instead, it was popularized at the Fair. Other claims are more dubious, including the hamburger and hot dog (both traditional American foods), peanut butter, iced tea, and cotton candy. It is more likely, however, that these food items were first introduced to mass audiences and popularized by the fair. Dr Pepper and <b>Puffed</b> <b>Wheat</b> cereal were first introduced to a national audience at the fair. Daughter of slaves, Annie Fisher, brought her beaten biscuits, which were already famous in her hometown of Columbia, Missouri. The exposition awarded Fisher's biscuits a gold medal.

50|$|The Village of Weirdale {{was founded}} between 1929 and 1931. The village was given life {{because of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway, which opened a new {{frontier}} on the Canadian Prairies. When the pioneers arrived in the area, they cleared out the thick forest and muskeg by hand creating rich farmland. The pioneers had large families that lived on every quarter of farmland. In turn, these large families brought the population to the area. In {{the early part of}} 20th century, transportation was much slower than it is today so it was much more difficult to travel long distances. Because of the difficulties in travelling, many small communities had to become self-sustaining in order to survive. At one point, Weirdale housed a hospital, school, flour mill, <b>puffed</b> <b>wheat</b> factory, and a lumber yard as well as numerous other small business that sustained the community. As transportation advanced and became more efficient, which was aided by the construction of modern highways, small villages across the prairies began to die economically.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1933 and {{the late}} 1940s, the yields from an average {{cigarette}} varied from 33 to 49 mg [...] "tar" [...] and from < 1 to 3 mg nicotine. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, the average yield from cigarettes in Western Europe and the USA was around 16 mg tar and 1.5 mg nicotine per cigarette. Current average levels are lower. This has been achieved {{in a variety of}} ways including use of selected strains of tobacco plant, changes in agricultural and curing procedures, use of reconstituted sheets (reprocessed tobacco leaf wastes), incorporation of tobacco stalks, reduction of the amount of tobacco needed to fill a cigarette by expanding it (like <b>puffed</b> <b>wheat)</b> to increase its [...] "filling power", and by the use of filters and high-porosity wrapping papers. The development of lower [...] "tar" [...] and nicotine cigarettes has tended to yield products that lacked the taste components to which the smoker had become accustomed. In order to keep such products acceptable to the consumer, the manufacturers reconstitute aroma or flavor.|$|E
5000|$|The tobacco {{industry}} has reduced tar and nicotine yields in cigarette smoke since the 1960s.

However, just as a drinker tends to drink a larger volume of beer than of wine or spirits, so many smokers tend to modify their smoking pattern inversely according to the strength of the cigarette being smoked. In contrast to the standardized puffing of the smoking machines on which the tar and nicotine yields are based, when a smoker switches to a low-tar, low nicotine cigarette, they smoke more cigarettes, take more puffs and inhale more deeply. Conversely, when smoking a high-tar, high-nicotine cigarette there is a tendency to smoke and inhale less.|$|E
