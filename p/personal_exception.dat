This unexpected retaliation and steadfast resistance to the hazing is one {{that he has never}} encountered from a victim before, and sparks a nearly obsessive fixation with her within Tsukasa. Initially, Tsukushi hates all of the F4 with the <b>personal</b> <b>exception</b> of Rui Hanazawa, for whom she harbors romantic feelings. But, after Rui goes off to chase after his childhood sweetheart Shizuka, Tsukushi slowly falls in love with Tsukasa. In this process, she allows her fierce determination and her stubborn, hardworking ways show through, and in the end, turns the F4 into her close friends. In the end, Tsukushi and Tsukasa became a couple. It is hinted that they will get married when the time is right.|$|E

40|$|The {{story of}} 2 ̆ 2 {{personal}} equities 2 ̆ 2 in Singapore {{is a fascinating}} one. The first successful claim of a 2 ̆ 2 personal equity 2 ̆ 2 outside the statutory regime in Singapore surfaced some forty years after {{the introduction of the}} Torrens system in 1956. Subsequently, the 2 ̆ 2 <b>personal</b> equities <b>exception</b> 2 ̆ 2 was affirmed by one Court of Appeal and rejected by another. Since then, the Singapore courts have proceeded on the basis that there is a finite list of 2 ̆ 2 personal equities 2 ̆ 2 listed in section 46 (2) of the Land Titles Act. This article proposes to explore these developments and demonstrate that the 2 ̆ 2 <b>personal</b> equities <b>exception</b> 2 ̆ 2 is in truth not an exception to indefeasibility. As a matter of statutory interpretation, such claims are simply not caught in the first place by the principle of indefeasibility as conferred by section 46 (1) of the Land Titles Act. As such, potential 2 ̆ 2 personal equities 2 ̆ 2 claims ought not to be limited by section 46 (2) exclusively...|$|R

2500|$|In 1925, {{the family}} settled in Paris, {{where they would}} live for the next 14 years. At about this time Tsvetaeva {{contracted}} tuberculosis. Tsvetaeva received a small stipend from the Czechoslovak government, which gave financial support to artists and writers {{who had lived in}} Czechoslovakia. In addition, she tried to make whatever she could from readings and sales of her work. She turned more and more to writing prose because she found it made more money than poetry. Tsvetaeva did not feel at all at home in Paris's predominantly ex-bourgeois circle of Russian émigré writers. Although she had written passionately pro-'White' poems during the Revolution, her fellow émigrés thought that she was insufficiently anti-Soviet, and that her criticism of the Soviet régime was altogether too nebulous. She was particularly criticised for writing an admiring letter to the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. In the wake of this letter, the émigré paper The Latest News, to which Tsvetaeva had been a frequent contributor, refused point-blank to publish any more of her work. She found solace in her correspondence with other writers, including Boris Pasternak, Rainer Maria Rilke, the Czech poet Anna Teskova, the critics D. S. Mirsky and Aleksandr Bakhrakh, and the Georgian émigré princess Salomea Andronikova, who became her main source of financial support. Her poetry and critical prose of the time, including her autobiographical prose works of 1934–7, is of lasting literary importance. [...] "Consumed by the daily round", resenting the domesticity that left her no time for solitude or writing, her émigré milieu regarded Tsvetaeva as a crude sort who ignored social graces. Describing her misery, she wrote to Teskova [...] "In Paris, with rare <b>personal</b> <b>exceptions,</b> everyone hates me, they write all sorts of nasty things, leave me out in all sorts of nasty ways, and so on". To Pasternak she complained [...] "They don't like poetry and what am I apart from that, not poetry but that from which it is made. [...] an inhospitable hostess. An young woman in an old dress." [...] She began to look back at even the Prague times with nostalgia and resent her exiled state more deeply.|$|R

40|$|Background Exclusive {{breastfeeding}} for {{six months}} is recommended by the World Health Organisation and the NHS. Mothers who are breastfeeding need the appropriate support and guidance from health professionals {{in order for them}} to continue breastfeeding. Staff on paediatric wards come into contact with many infants under the age of six months and therefore need a high standard of knowledge so that they can support and advise mothers on the ward appropriately. However evidence suggests that some health professionals do not have the knowledge to be able to support mothers. Method A survey questionnaire was distributed to nursing staff on the paediatric wards at Nottingham Children’s Hospital to assess their attitudes towards and knowledge of breastfeeding, along with their confidence levels when supporting mothers who are breastfeeding. The results were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results Sixty-seven nursing staff out of 240 responded from twelve wards. There was a positive correlation between attitudes towards and knowledge of breastfeeding. Personal experience of breastfeeding was shown to increase knowledge and confidence when supporting mothers who were breastfeeding. There was no statistical difference between qualified nurses, care support workers or student nurses and attitudes towards and knowledge of breastfeeding or confidence levels. Conclusion The study highlighted that although knowledge was high, there were some gaps, and although attitudes towards breastfeeding were positive, there were some <b>exceptions.</b> <b>Personal</b> experience increased knowledge and confidence and therefore needs to be taken into consideration when creating a training programme for the staff. Ensuring training is given as part of an induction will help to increase new staffs knowledge and attitudes towards breastfeeding, as well as their confidence when supporting mothers who are breastfeeding which is crucial...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} {{relatively}} few studies focusing specifically on earnings differentials between and within sectors in Ireland, though a number have used sector dummies in estimating individual earnings equations where the principal interest was {{in the relationship between}} earnings and <b>personal</b> characteristics. An <b>exception</b> is provided by O'Donnell (1999), which uses household survey data to estimate earnings functions including sectoral dummies and document the scale of differentials across industrial sectors controlling for individual characteristics Dispersion within broad sectors is also analysed. Hughes and Nolan (1997) looked at wage dispersion across sectors from a segmented labour market perspective, which distinguishes between primary labour markets providing "good " jobs with high wages and stable employment and secondary labour markets providing "bad " jobs with low pay and unstable employment. The core hypothesis of the approach is that jobs in primary labour markets are rationed, with substantial barriers to entry from secondary labour markets. The rationing hypothesis cannot be tested for Ireland with the data available, but this paper tests the hypothesis that wage determination differs across sectors, using data from a 1987 ESRI household survey. Two formulations of the segmented labour market model are tested, one distinguishing only primary and secondary sectors and the other distinguishing four sectors employed in recent US research by Gordon. Estimating standard earnings functions for both variants suggested that returns to education are lower in secondary markets, as predicted by segmentation theory, but contrary to the theory's predictions returns to work experience did not differ across sectors. It is suggested {{that there may be a}} less clear-cut divide between sectors in European countries than in the USA, partly because of the role of trade unions. Since the policy implications of adopting a segmented labour market perspective are markedly different from those of human capital theory on some central issues of labour market policy, it is argued that further investigation of wage dispersion from that perspective is warranted...|$|R
