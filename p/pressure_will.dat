5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy <b>pressure,</b> <b>will</b> eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E

5000|$|The boiling {{temperature}} of a liquid {{is dependent on}} pressure - high <b>pressures</b> <b>will</b> yield high {{boiling temperature}}s, and low <b>pressures</b> <b>will</b> yield low boiling temperatures. A common simple experiment is to place {{a cup of water}} in a vacuum chamber, and then reduce the pressure in the chamber until the water boils. By reducing the <b>pressure</b> the water <b>will</b> boil even at room temperature. This works both ways - if the pressure is increased beyond normal atmospheric pressures, the boiling of hot water could be suppressed far beyond normal temperatures. The cooling system of a modern internal combustion engine is a real-world example.|$|R
25|$|The {{solubility}} of one {{substance in}} another {{is determined by}} the balance of intermolecular forces between the solvent and solute, and the entropy change that accompanies the solvation. Factors such as temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> alter this balance, thus changing the solubility.|$|E
25|$|This D {{shape is}} not ideal for a {{pressure}} drum though, as <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> tend to distort {{it into a}} more circular section. Experience of boiler explosions had shown that sharp internal corners inside boilers were also prone to erosion by grooving.|$|E
25|$|Borehole {{and well}} hydrologic and {{hydraulic}} measurements are increasingly {{used to monitor}} changes in a volcanoes subsurface gas pressure and thermal regime. Increased gas <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> make water levels rise and suddenly drop right before an eruption, and thermal focusing (increased local heat flow) can reduce or dry out aquifers.|$|E

25|$|Chronic aortic {{insufficiency}} If the individual survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AI presents as, the left ventricle adapts by eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation {{of the left}} ventricle, and the volume overload is compensated for. The left ventricular filling <b>pressures</b> <b>will</b> revert to normal and the individual will no longer have overt heart failure. In this compensated phase, the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a latency period) the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling <b>pressures</b> <b>will</b> increase.Some individuals enter this decompensated phase asymptomatically, treatment for AI involves aortic valve replacement prior to this decompensation phase.|$|R
30|$|Further {{increases}} in active tension {{are accompanied by}} {{increases in}} hydrostatic pressure and cannot be accompanied by continued inward collapse; however, the exact functional form of the hydrostatic <b>pressures</b> <b>will</b> differ from that given by Equations  30 and 32.|$|R
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in a system remains constant (isobaric), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy (heat) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.|$|E
25|$|This D {{shape is}} not ideal for a {{pressure}} drum though, as <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> tend to distort {{it into a}} more circular section. This flexing led to leakage where the water tubes entered the drum; a problem, termed 'wrapperitis', which was shared with the White-Forster. Experience of boiler explosions had shown that sharp internal corners inside boilers were also prone to erosion by grooving. Later boilers used a more rounded section, although still asymmetrical rather than fully cylindrical.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} behind IWR {{treatment is}} the same as that behind the treatment of DCS in a recompression chamber: an increase in ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> reduce the volume of the bubbles allowing better blood transport downstream of the bubbles. If the casualty can breathe pure oxygen further improvements will occur because the increase in the proportion of oxygen in the blood may keep previously oxygen-starved tissues alive and the oxygen will remove other inert gases from the bubbles making the bubbles smaller.|$|E

25|$|The {{core of a}} star is {{kept from}} {{collapsing}} by the heat generated by the fusion of nuclei of lighter elements into heavier ones. At various stages of stellar evolution, the nuclei required for this process are exhausted, and the core collapses, causing it to become denser and hotter. A critical situation arises when iron accumulates in the core, since iron nuclei are incapable of generating further energy through fusion. If the core becomes sufficiently dense, electron degeneracy <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> play a significant part in stabilizing it against gravitational collapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{fit of the}} {{underwear}} {{should allow}} the same range of movement as the suit itself, and together should allow the diver to bend, squat, kneel, climb a ladder, fin and reach all critical parts of the diving equipment. Underwear which is flexible and stretches, particularly at the joints, will allow the diver more freedom of movement, and {{is less likely to}} chafe, and materials which resist compaction under light <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> maintain a more even thickness in use, which will provide better insulation for the same overall volume.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if that is possible, and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands during ascent, but have to be equalized during compression of descent.|$|E

5000|$|If {{formation}} pressure increases, mud density {{should also be}} increased to balance pressure and keep the wellbore stable. The most common weighting material is barite. Unbalanced formation <b>pressures</b> <b>will</b> cause an unexpected influx (also known as a kick) of formation fluids in the wellbore possibly leading to a blowout from pressured formation fluids.|$|R

25|$|The {{prolonged}} exposure to breathing gases at high partial <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> result in increased amounts of non-metabolic gases, usually nitrogen and/or helium, (referred {{to in this}} context as inert gases) dissolving in the bloodstream as it passes through the alveolar capillaries, and thence carried to the other tissues of the body, where they will accumulate until saturated. This saturation process has very little immediate effect on the diver. However, when the pressure is reduced during ascent, the amount of dissolved inert gas that can be held in stable solution in the tissues is reduced. This effect is described by Henry's Law.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{actively}} expel {{water from the}} airway by abdominal thrusts or positioning head downwards should be avoided as they delay the start of ventilation and {{increase the risk of}} vomiting, with a significantly increased risk of death, as aspiration of stomach contents is a common complication of resuscitation efforts. Administration of oxygen at 15 litres per minute by face mask or bag mask is often sufficient, but tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against the need for oxygenisation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> generally improve oxygenation.|$|E

25|$|Wankel engines {{operating}} within their original design parameters are almost immune to catastrophic failure. A Wankel engine that loses compression, or cooling or oil <b>pressure,</b> <b>will</b> lose {{a large amount}} of power and fail over a short period of time. It will, however, usually continue to produce some power during that time, allowing for a safer landing when used in aircraft. Piston engines under the same circumstances are prone to seizing or breaking parts, which will almost certainly result in catastrophic failure of the engine, and the instant loss of all power. For this reason, Wankel engines are very well-suited to snowmobiles, which often take users into remote places where a failure could result in frostbite or death, and in aircraft, where abrupt failure is likely to lead to a crash or forced landing in a remote place.|$|E
25|$|In {{the arch}} dam, {{stability}} is obtained {{by a combination}} of arch and gravity action. If the upstream face is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the upstream face is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in <b>pressure</b> <b>will</b> cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if that is possible, and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands, but have to be equalized during compression, others, such as the buoyancy compensator bladder, will expand until the over-pressure valve opens. The ears are a special case, as they will usually vent naturally through the Eustachian tubes, but these may be blocked. During descent they do not usually equalize automatically, and must be intentionally equalized by the diver, using one of several possible methods. Most of the physiological airway automatically equalizes {{as long as the}} diver is breathing normally, but holding the breath can prevent equalization of the lower airways and lungs, which can lead to barotrauma.|$|E

The pressure requirement is at least 74 bar, and most extractions are conducted at under 350 bar.
