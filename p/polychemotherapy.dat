2500|$|One common way of {{reconciling}} {{these two}} opposing forces {{is simply to}} exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [...] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused {{by the presence of}} symbols (whether known or novel) and they know where to look them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more general target readerships, this action leaves the readers without any explanatory annotation and can leave them wondering what the apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the formal requirement (the presence of a gloss) and the functional requirement (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; AMA says, [...] "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention." [...] Thus [...] "188del11" [...] is glossed as [...] "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." [...] This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the [...] "abbreviation-leading" [...] style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as clinical trial acronyms [...] or standardized <b>polychemotherapy</b> regimens [...] ), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{long-term}} effects of adjuvant <b>polychemotherapy</b> regimens in oestrogen-receptor-poor (ER-poor) breast cancer, {{and the extent to}} which these effects are modified by age or tamoxifen use, can be assessed by an updated meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials. METHODS: Collaborative meta-analyses of individual patient data for about 6000 women with ER-poor breast cancer in 46 trials of <b>polychemotherapy</b> versus not (non-taxane-based <b>polychemotherapy,</b> typically about six cycles; trial start dates 1975 - 96, median 1984) and about 14 000 women with ER-poor breast cancer in 50 trials of tamoxifen versus not (some trials in the presence and some in the absence of polychemotherapy; trial start dates 1972 - 93, median 1982). FINDINGS: In women with ER-poor breast cancer, <b>polychemotherapy</b> significantly reduced recurrence, breast cancer mortality, and death from any cause, in those younger than 50 years and those aged 50 - 69 years at entry into trials of <b>polychemotherapy</b> versus not. In those aged younger than 50 years (1907 women, 15 % node-positive), the 10 -year risks were: recurrence 33 % versus 45 % (ratio of 10 -year risks 0. 73, 2 p< 0. 00001), breast cancer mortality 24 % versus 32 % (ratio 0. 73, 2 p= 0. 0002), and death from any cause 25 % versus 33 % (ratio 0. 75, 2 p= 0. 0003). In women aged 50 - 69 years (3965 women, 58 % node-positive), the 10 -year risks were: recurrence 42 % versus 52 % (ratio 0. 82, 2 p< 0. 00001), breast cancer mortality 36 % versus 42 % (ratio 0. 86, 2 p= 0. 0004), and death from any cause 39 % versus 45 % (ratio 0. 87, 2 p= 0. 0009). Few were aged 70 years or older. Tamoxifen had little effect on recurrence or death in women who were classified in these trials as having ER-poor disease, and did not significantly modify the effects of <b>polychemotherapy.</b> INTERPRETATION: In women who had ER-poor breast cancer, and were either younger than 50 years or between 50 and 69 years, these older adjuvant <b>polychemotherapy</b> regimens were safe (ie, had little effect on mortality from causes other than breast cancer) and produced substantial and definite reductions in the 10 -year risks of recurrence and death.

40|$|In a {{worldwide}} collaboration, information was sought and centrally checked on mortality and recurrence for each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1985 of {{any aspect of}} systemic adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer. Checked data were available for 75 000 women (about 90 % of those ever randomised), of whom 32 % had died and another 10 % had experienced recurrence. The parts now reviewed include 30 000 women in tamoxifen trials, 3000 in ovarian ablation trials, 11 000 in <b>polychemotherapy</b> trials, 15 000 in other chemotherapy comparisons, and 6000 in immunotherapy trials. Highly significant reductions in the annual rates both of recurrence and of death are produced by tamoxifen (25 % SD 2 recurrence and 17 % SD 2 mortality: 2 p < 0. 00001), by ablation below age 50 (26 % SD 6 recurrence and 25 % SD 7 mortality: 2 p = 0. 0004),and by <b>polychemotherapy</b> (28 % SD 3 recurrence and 16 % SD 3 mortality: 2 p < 0. 00001), but not by ablation at older ages or by immunotherapy. (Tamoxifen also reduced the risk of development of contralateral breast cancer by 39 % SD 9 : lp < 0 - 00001.) For tamoxifen and for <b>polychemotherapy</b> the avoidance of recurrence is chiefly during years 0 - 4 (this difference being maintained but not increased afterwards), but the avoidance of mortality is highly significant both during and after years 0 - 4, so the cumulative differences in survival produced by these relatively brief treatments (median: 2 years tamoxifen, 1 year <b>polychemotherapy)</b> are larger at 10 than at 5 years. There is little information beyond year 10 (except for ovarian ablation, which produces separately significant mortality reductions both during and after years 0 - 9). Both direct and indirect randomised comparisons show long-term <b>polychemotherapy</b> (eg, 12 months) to be no better than shorter (eg, 6 months) regimens, but do show <b>polychemotherapy</b> to be significantly better than single-agent chemotherapy. Indirect randomised comparisons do not reveal significant differences between different forms of <b>polychemotherapy,</b> or differences between different tamoxifen doses, but do show that long-term tamoxifen (eg, 2 years, Gr even 5 years) is significantly more effective than shorter tamoxifen regimens. In old age (70 +) tamoxifen is of demonstrated efficacy, but chemotherapy has not been evaluated. Between ages 50 and 69 direct comparisons show that chemotherapy plus tamoxifen is better (1 p < 0. 00001) than chemotherapy alone both for recurrence and for mortality, and better (1 p < 0. 00001) than tamoxifen alone for recurrence. in women aged under 50 chemotherapy and ovarian ablation appear, by an indirect comparison, to be of comparable efficacy, and the combination may be still better. The 30 - 40 % proportional risk reductions that can be produced by combined chemo-endocrine therapy in middle age are similar for node-positive and for node-negative patients, but the absolute improvement in 10 -year survival is about twice as great for the former (at least 12 deaths avoided per 100 women treated) as for the latter...|$|E

40|$|During <b>polychemotherapy,</b> {{cytotoxic}} {{drugs are}} given in combinations to enhance their anti-tumor effectiveness. For most drug combinations, underlying signaling mechanisms responsible for positive drug-drug interactions remain elusive. Here, we prove a decisive role for the Bcl- 2 family member NOXA to mediate cell death by certain drug combinations, even if drugs were combined which acted independently from NOXA, when given alone. In proof-of-principle studies, betulinic acid, doxorubicin and vincristine induced cell death in a p 53 - and NOXA-independent pathway involving mitochondrial pore formation, release of cytochrome c and caspase activation. In contrast, when betulinic acid was combined with either doxorubicine or vincristine, cell death signaling changed considerably; the drug combinations clearly depended on both p 53 and NOXA. Similarly and of high clinical relevance, in patient-derived childhood acute leukemia samples the drug combinations, but not the single drugs depended on p 53 and NOXA, as shown by RNA interference studies in patient-derived cells. Our data emphasize that NOXA represents an important target molecule for combinations of drugs that alone do not target NOXA. NOXA might have a special role in regulating apoptosis sensitivity in the complex interplay of <b>polychemotherapy.</b> Deciphering the differences in signaling of single drugs and drug combinations might enable designing highly effective novel <b>polychemotherapy</b> regimens...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{have been}} many {{randomised}} trials of adjuvant prolonged <b>polychemotherapy</b> among women with early breast cancer, and an updated overview of their results is presented. OBJECTIVES: In this report, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group present their updated systematic overview (meta-analysis) of treatment with <b>polychemotherapy.</b> SEARCH STRATEGY: Trial identification procedures for the EBCTCG overviews have been described elsewhere. See under "EBCTCG" in the Breast Cancer Collaborative Review Group module. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials that began before 1990 and involved treatment groups that differed only {{with respect to the}} chemotherapy regimens that were being compared. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 and involved treatment groups that differed only with respect to the chemotherapy regimens that were being compared. Analyses involved about 18, 000 women in 47 trials of prolonged <b>polychemotherapy</b> versus no chemotherapy, about 6000 in 11 trials of longer versus shorter <b>polychemotherapy,</b> and about 6000 in 11 trials of anthracycline-containing regimens versus CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). MAIN RESULTS: For recurrence, <b>polychemotherapy</b> produced substantial and highly significant proportional reductions both among women aged under 50 at randomisation (35 % [SD 4] reduction; 2 p< 0. 00001) and among those aged 50 - 69 (20 % [SD 3] reduction; 2 p< 0. 00001); few women aged 70 or over had been studied. For mortality, the reductions were also significant both among women aged under 50 (27 % [SD 5] reduction; 2 p< 0. 00001) and among those aged 50 - 69 (11 % [SD 3] reduction; 2 p= 0. 0001). The recurrence reductions emerged chiefly during the first 5 years of follow-up, whereas the difference in survival grew throughout the first 10 years. After standardisation for age and time since randomisation, the proportional reductions in risk were similar for women with node-negative and node-positive disease. Applying the proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged under 50 at randomisation would typically change a 10 -year survival of 71 % for those with node-negative disease to 78 % (an absolute benefit of 7 %), and of 42 % for those with node-positive disease to 53 % (an absolute benefit of 11 %). The smaller proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged 50 - 69 at randomisation would translate into smaller absolute benefits, changing a 10 -year survival of 67 % for those with node-negative disease to 69 % (an absolute gain of 2 %) and of 46 % for those with node-positive disease to 49 % (an absolute gain of 3 %). The age-specific benefits of <b>polychemotherapy</b> appeared to be largely irrespective of menopausal status at presentation, oestrogen receptor status of the primary tumour, and of whether adjuvant tamoxifen had been given. In terms of other outcomes, there was a reduction of about one-fifth (2 p= 0. 05) in contralateral breast cancer, which has already been included in the analyses of recurrence, and no apparent adverse effect on deaths from causes other than breast cancer (death rate ratio 0. 89 [SD 0. 09]). The directly randomised comparisons of longer versus shorter durations of <b>polychemotherapy</b> did not indicate any survival advantage with the use of more than about 3 - 6 months of <b>polychemotherapy.</b> By contrast, directly randomised comparisons did suggest that, compared with CMF alone, the anthracycline-containing regimens studied produced somewhat greater effects on recurrence (2 p= 0. 006) and mortality (69 % vs 72 % 5 -year survival; log-rank 2 p= 0. 02). But this comparison is one of many that could have been selected for emphasis, the 99 % CI reaches zero, and the results of several of the relevant trials are not yet available. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Some months of adjuvant <b>polychemotherapy</b> (eg, with CMF or an anthracycline-containing regimen) typically produces an absolute improvement of about 7 - 11 % in 10 -year survival for women aged under 50 at presentation with early breast cancer, and of about 2 - 3 % for those aged 50 - 69 (unless their prognosis is likely to be extremely good even without such treatment). Treatment decisions involve consideration not only of improvements in cancer recurrence and survival but also of adverse side-effects of treatment, and this report makes no recommendations as to who should or should not be treated...|$|E

40|$|It’s well {{documented}} that cytokines {{in patients with}} breast cancer are indicators of survival, assessing the risk of recurrence and mortality. However, the obtained data about serum levels of cytokines are contradictory. The problem of participation of cytokines in the growth and spread of tumors requires further study. The purpose was the determination of serum level of cytokine in experimental model of breast cancer in Wistar rat. Material and methods: Breast cancer was induced by intramammalirian injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Some of the rats were subjected to only surgery or only <b>polychemotherapy</b> (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5 -fluorouracil). Serum levels of cytokines: Bio-Plex Pro Rat Cytokines 24 -Plex Assay (Bio-Rad, USA) were used. It {{was found that the}} serum levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 12, IL- 13, IL- 17 A, IFN -γ, MIP- 1 α, MIP- 3 α, RANTES, TNF-α in rats with experimental breast cancer were significantly higher compared with intact rats. We obtained that pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with progression of breast cancer in rats. The serum levels of IL- 1 α, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 12, IL- 18, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO/KC, IFN-γ, MIP- 1 α, RANTES in rats after surgical treatment were significantly higher compared to those in rats without surgical treatment. It was also observed that in rats after surgical treatment,the serum levels of IL- 1 α, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 12, IL- 18, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO/KC, IFN-γ, MIP- 1 α, RANTES were decreased. We suppose that these data may indicate that tumor cells can also produce cytokines. Moreover, we obtained that in intact rats, serum levels of IL- 1 α, IL- 18, EPO, G-CSF, GRO/KC, MIP- 1 α were higher compared to those in rats with breast cancer treated with surgery. However, the serum levels of IL- 6 and IL- 1 β (markers of pro- inflammation and tumor metastasis) were higher in surgically treated rats compared to those in intact rats. It has been proved that the removal of primary tumors (without regional lymph node removal and subsequent <b>polychemotherapy)</b> can lead to accelerated growth of metastases. It was found that the <b>polychemotherapy</b> resulted in a significant decrease in the serum levels of IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 10, IL- 12, IL- 13, IL- 17 A, IL- 18. <b>Polychemotherapy</b> also leads to suppression in serum levels RANTES, VEGF, MCP- 1.

Moreover, the cellular characteristics of round rhabdomyoblasts and strap cells with or without cross-striations became more distinct after treatment. However, cell types that were not present in the initial specimens were never found in follow-up specimens. It was concluded that the major role of <b>polychemotherapy</b> is the selective destruction of undifferentiated tumor cells; further differentiated cells are stimulated either directly or indirectly to reach their maximal inherent differentiation levels, but it does not appear that transitions from one cell type to the other occur...|$|E
30|$|The {{treatment}} {{of more than}} 95 % of children with malignant disease occurs according to TOPs. The patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma, B-NHL, ALCL, and relapse of ALCL were treated according to the TOPs Euro-LB 02, B-NHL BFM 2004, ALCL 99, and ALCL-relapse, respectively. All TOPs include intensive multi-drug chemotherapy for 6 to 9 months. In patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma, intensive <b>polychemotherapy</b> is followed by oral maintenance chemotherapy for a total therapy duration of 2 years.|$|E
30|$|Treatment {{involves}} surgical excision {{followed by}} radiochemotherapy. Gross-total resection {{of the tumor}} is typically not possible because of the infiltrative nature of the tumor [12]. High-dose methotrexate-based <b>polychemotherapy</b> is given [7]. Whole brain irradiation may improve outcome, but has the risk of neurotoxicity in elderly patients. Age (>[*] 65 [*]years) is a major negative prognostic factor and is associated with reduced survival [7, 13]. PCNSL has a poor outcome than does systemic DLBCL.|$|E
40|$|Intensification using {{peripheral}} {{blood stem cells}} collected after chemotherapy followed by growth factors is being increasingly investigated {{as an alternative to}} conventional chemotherapy for mantle cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, We investigated 14 grades III-IV, t(11; 14) -positive cases for contamination of PBSC collected after a <b>polychemotherapy</b> regimen followed by G-CSF, Patients were first treated with a <b>polychemotherapy</b> regimen There were four CR, seven PR, two refractory and one early death. Seven patients have been transplanted, in whom PBSC were mobilized, using either cyclophosphamide/VP 16 or Dexa-BEAM followed by G-CSF, For all patients, whether actually autografted or not, PB cells were tested at the time of regeneration on G-CSF after the first <b>polychemotherapy</b> or after the mobilizing regimen. PCR evaluation of contamination was performed first by a semi-quantitative approach, using serial dilutions of initial DNA, then confirmed using a limiting-dilution analysis. Two patients were not informative (one early death and one without an available molecular marker). PB cells collected at regeneration contained at least one log more lymphoma cells than steady-state blood or marrow, apart from in two cases. Moreover, where a mobilizing treatment diminished tumor burden in the patient, {{at the same time it}} increased PB contamination in most cases, We conclude that advanced mantle cell NHL appears to be largely resistant to significant in vivo purging by conventional chemotherapy, Where treatment brings benefits by reducing tumor load, it may at the same time negate it by mobilizing malignant cells into the collections used to intensify. Although the clonogenic potential of this massive infiltration is unknown (only gene marking studies could provide a definitive answer regarding the source of relapses), strategies aimed at reducing the level of contamination in the graft should be considered when designing future protocols...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Venous {{access ports}} (VAPs) con {{be used to}} {{administer}} <b>polychemotherapy</b> to patients with malignancies, The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate perioperative and late complications related to VAP implantations and to analyze factors that may predict the development of complications. Patients and Methods: During the period 1983 to 1994, 135 VAPs were implanted in 132 patients with disseminated testicular tumors. In a retrospective study, the perioperative and late complications were recorded in this homogeneous patient group, Multivariate analysis was performed to detect factors that may predict the development of complications. Results: The median age of the patients was 28 years (range, 16 to 55). Perioperative complications were recorded in five patients (3. 7 %) : pneumothorax in two (1. 5 %), blood loss in two (1. 5 %), and mediastinal bleeding in one (0. 7 %). The ports remained in situ for a total of 55, 247 days (median, 413; range, 7 to 1, 607). In 31 patients (23 %), 42 late complications developed (31 %) : system obstruction in 13 (9. 6 %), thrombosis in 11 (8. 1 %), infection in six (4. 4 %), catheter defect in six (4. 4 %), extravasation in four (3. 0 %), and local skin necrosis in two (1. 5 %). Late complications were significantly more common in patients who had received chemotherapy before VAP implantation (P Conclusion: <b>Polychemotherapy</b> could be administered in an adequate manner using a VAP, Complications occurred in 26. 7 % of a homogeneous group of patients who received a VAP implantation for <b>polychemotherapy</b> for disseminated testicular cancer. Chemotherapy treatment before VAP implantation was the only independent risk factor For late complications. (C) 1996 by American Society of Clinical Oncology...|$|E
