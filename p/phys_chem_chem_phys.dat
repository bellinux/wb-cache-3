40|$|Predicting which {{crystalline}} modifications can {{be present}} in a chemical system requires the global exploration of its energy landscape. Due to the large computational effort involved, in the past this search for sufficiently stable minima has been performed employing a variety of empirical potentials and cost functions followed by a local optimization on the ab initio level. However, this entails the risk of overlooking important modifications that are not modeled accurately using empirical potentials. In order to overcome this critical limitation, we develop an approach to employ ab initio energy functions during the global optimization phase of the structure prediction. As an example, we perform a global exploration of the landscape of LiF on the ab initio level and show that the relevant crystalline modifications are found during the search.

Multi-site support functions, which are linear combinations of pseudo-atomic orbitals on a target atom and those neighbours within a cutoff, have been recently proposed {{to reduce the number}} of support functions to the minimal basis while keeping the accuracy of a large basis [J. <b>Chem.</b> Theory Comput., 2014, 10, 4813]. The coefficients were determined by using the local filter diagonalization (LFD) method [Phys. Rev. B, 2009, 80, 205104]. We analyse the effect of numerical optimization of the coefficients produced by the LFD method. Tests on crystalline silicon, a benzene molecule and hydrated DNA systems show that the optimization improves the accuracy of the multi-site support functions with small cutoffs. It is also confirmed that the optimization guarantees the variational energy minimizations with multi-site support functions.

40|$|Invited Feature Article, with journal coverAbstract The Leuven Isoprene Mechanism, {{proposed}} {{earlier to}} aid in rationalizing the unexpectedly high hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations in isoprene-rich, low-nitric-oxide (NO) regions (Peeters et al. <b>Phys.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Phys.</b> 2009, 11, 5935), is presented in an upgraded and extended version, LIM 1. The kinetics of the crucial reactions in the proposed isoprene-peroxy radical interconversion and isomerisation pathways are re-evaluated theoretically, based on energy barriers computed at the much higher CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pVTZ//QCISD/ 6 - 311 G(d,p) level of theory, and using multi-conformer partition functions obtained at the M 06 - 2 X/ 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 2 p) level that, different from the B 3 LYP level used in our earlier work, accounts for the crucial London dispersion effects in the H-bonded systems involved. The steady-state fraction of the specific Z-δ-OH-peroxy radical isomers/conformers that can isomerise by 1, 6 -H shift is shown to be largely governed by hydrogen-bond strengths, while their isomerisation itself is found to occur quasi-exclusively by hydrogen atom tunneling. The isomer-specific Z-δ-OH-peroxy 1, 6 -H shift rate coefficients are predicted {{to be of the}} order of 1 s- 1 at 298 K, but the experimentally accessible bulk rate coefficients, which have to be clearly distinguished from the former, are two orders of magnitude lower due to the very low Z-δ-OH-peroxy steady-state fractions that are only around or below 0. 01 at low to moderate NO and depend on the peroxy lifetime. Two pathways subsequent to the peroxy radical 1, 6 -H shift are identified, the earlier predicted route yielding the photolabile hydroperoxy-methyl-butenals (HPALDs), and a second, about equally important path, to di-hydroperoxy-carbonyl peroxy radicals (di-HPCARP). Taking this into account, our predicted bulk peroxy isomerisation rate coefficients are about a factor 1. 8 higher than the available experimental results for HPALD production (Crounse et al. <b>Phys.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Phys.</b> 2011, 13, 13607), which is within the respective uncertainty margins. We also show that the experimental temperature dependence of the HPALD production rates as well as the observed kinetic isotope effect for per-deuterated isoprene support quantitatively our theoretical peroxy interconversion rates. Global modeling implementing LIM 1 indicates that on average about 28 % of the isoprene peroxys react via the 1, 6 -H shift isomerisation route, representing 100 - 150 Tg carbon per year. The fast photolysis of HPALDs we proposed earlier as primary OH regeneration mechanism (Peeters and Muller, <b>Phys.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Phys.</b> 2010, 12, 14227) found already experimental confirmation (Wolfe et al. <b>Phys.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Phys.</b> 2012, 14, 7276); based on further theoretical work in progress, reaction schemes are presented of the oxy co-product radicals from HPALD photolysis and of the di-HPCARP radicals from the second pathway following peroxy isomerisation that are both expected to initiate considerable additional OH recycling. status: publishe...|$|E

Using a spherically curved Ge crystal an energy resolution better than 15 eV {{has been achieved}} which eliminates influence from Compton scattering. The high quality of the data allows a precise oxygen-oxygen pair correlation function (PCF) to be directly derived from the Fourier transform of the experimental data resolving shell structure out to 12 Å, i. e. 5 hydration shells. Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the TIP 4 P/ 2005 force-field reproduce excellently the experimental shell-structure in the range 4 - 12 Å although less agreement is seen for the first peak in the PCF. The Local Structure Index [J. <b>Chem.</b> <b>Phys.</b> 104, 7671 (1996) ] identifies a tetrahedral minority giving the intermediate-range oscillations in the PCF and a disordered majority providing a more featureless background in this range.

40|$|The {{correlation}} {{energy in}} density functional theory {{can be expressed}} exactly {{in terms of the}} change in the probability of finding two electrons at a given distance r_ 12 (intracule density) when the electron-electron interaction is multiplied by a real parameter λ varying between 0 (Kohn-Sham system) and 1 (physical system). In this process, usually called adiabatic connection, the one-electron density is (ideally) kept fixed by a suitable local one-body potential. While an accurate intracule density of the physical system can only be obtained from expensive wavefunction-based calculations, being able to construct good models starting from Kohn-Sham ingredients would highly improve the accuracy of density functional calculations. To this purpose, we investigate the intracule density in the λ→∞ limit of the adiabatic connection. This strong-interaction limit of density functional theory turns out to be, like the opposite non-interacting Kohn-Sham limit, mathematically simple and can be entirely constructed from the knowledge of the one-electron density. We develop here the theoretical framework and, using accurate correlated one-electron densities, we calculate the intracule densities in the strong interaction limit for few atoms. Comparison of our results with the corresponding Kohn-Sham and physical quantities provides useful hints for building approximate intracule densities along the adiabatic connection of density functional theory.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} polymer translocation through a nanopore under an externally applied field using the 2 D fluctuating bond model with single-segment Monte Carlo moves. We concentrate {{on the influence of}} the field strength E, length of the chain N, and length of the pore L on forced translocation. As our main result, we find a crossover scaling for the translocation time τ with the chain length from τ∼ N^ 2 ν for relatively short polymers to τ∼ N^ 1 + ν for longer chains, where ν is the Flory exponent. We demonstrate that this crossover is due to the change in the dependence of the translocation velocity v on the chain length. For relatively short chains v ∼ N^- ν, which crosses over to v ∼ N^- 1 for long polymers. The {{reason for this is that}} with increasing N there is a high density of segments near the exit of the pore, which slows down the translocation process due to slow relaxation of the chain. For the case of a long nanopore for which R_∥, the radius of gyration R_g along the pore, is smaller than the pore length, we find no clear scaling of the translocation time with the chain length. For large N, however, the asymptotic scaling τ∼ N^ 1 + ν is recovered. In this regime, τ is almost independent of L. We have previously found that for a polymer, which is initially placed in the middle of the pore, there is a minimum in the escape time for R_∥≈ L. We show here that this minimum persists for a weak fields E such that EL is less than some critical value, but vanishes for large values of EL. Comment: 25 Pages, 10 figures.

J. Dobbyn, J. N. L. Connor, N. A. Besley, P. J. Knowles, and G. C. Schatz [Phys. <b>Chem.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Phys.</b> 1999, 1, 957], as refined by T. W. J. Whiteley, A. J. Dobbyn, J. N. L. Connor, and G. C. Schatz [Phys. <b>Chem.</b> <b>Chem.</b> <b>Phys.</b> 2000, 2, 549]. The long-range van der Waals portions of the potential surfaces are derived from multisurface empirical potentials due to M. -L. Dubernet and J. M. Hutson [J. <b>Phys.</b> <b>Chem.</b> 1994, 98, 5844]. Spin-orbit coupling has been included using a spin-orbit parameter that is assumed to be independent of nuclear geometry, and Coriolis interactions are calculated accurately. Reactive scattering calculations have been performed for total angular momentum quantum number J = (1) /(2) using a hyperspherical-coordinate coupled-channel method in full dimensionality. The scattering calculations are used to study the influence of the spin-orbit coupling parameter lambda on the fine-structure-resolved cumulative reaction probabilities and transition-state resonance energies with lambda varying from - 150...|$|R
