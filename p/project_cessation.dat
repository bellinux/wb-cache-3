40|$|Few studies {{explicitly}} {{assess the}} {{temporal and spatial}} dynamics of agroforestry adoption occurring beyond the project cycle. Where ex-post evaluations are published, abandonment of introduced agroforestry after <b>project</b> <b>cessation</b> is often reported. This paper presents an analysis of agroforestry adoption in a poor, peri-urban village in semi-arid south India, where 97 % of initial adopters had retained their plots six to eight years after implementation. The intervention was facilitated by BAIF, an Indian non-governmental organisation specialising in natural resource management. The complex technological package promoted was known as â��wadiâ�� and comprised fruit trees planted in crop fields, with a boundary of multi-purpose trees and integrated {{soil and water conservation}} measures. Sixty four agroforestry plots belonging to 43 households were surveyed in 2010 / 11 and interviews were held with both adopting and non-adopting farmers. Beyond retention, a quarter of adopters had expanded the practice on to additional areas of land and some diffusion to initially non-adopting farmers had also occurred. Adopters were found to have modified the practice to suit their own objectives, capabilities and constraints, highlighting that adoption is more than a simple binary choice. The study demonstrates the importance of external support for adoption of agroforestry. The intervention was not, however, especially pro-poor with adoption occurring disproportionately among relatively wealthier households with larger landholdings. Where poorer households adopted, this tended to occur later. Participation was entirely voluntary and, by 2011, conversion of suitable farmland to agroforestry had reached 18 %; while beneficial to individual adopters, this patchy coverage arguably limits the potential for enhanced ecosystem service provision at landscape-scale...|$|E

The majority accepted more than seven <b>project</b> delivered telephone <b>cessation</b> counselling calls (52 %), and reported NRT use during more than half of their accepted calls (70 %). Older age, higher nicotine dependence, irregular smoking and seeing oneself as a non-smoker were associated with uptake of behavioural cessation aids. Higher nicotine dependence was similarly associated with use of pharmacological aids, as was NRT use whilst an inpatient. Most smokers with a mental illness took up a proactive offer of aids to support their stopping smoking.

40|$|Shifts in oxic and anoxic {{conditions}} in soil {{are most frequently}} caused by water table fluctuations, heavy rain, snowmelt or flooding, with potentially significant impacts on microbial processes {{and the ability of}} soils to convert mineral nitrogen gases efficiently. The impact of oxic/anoxic cycles on nitrogen transformation rates was therefore explored in the upper layer (0 - 30 cm) of partially degraded peat soil. We hypothesized that high denitrification potential would be conserved due to the high organic matter content of this soil. Mineral nitrogen was applied to approximately 1 -cm deep layers of homogenized soil in microcosms, with no external source of readily degradable carbon. Microcosms were subjected to three cycles, each consisting of an oxic phase of 8 - 11 days and an anoxic phase of 21 - 28 days. Approximately 2 % of the ammonium load was lost through ammonia volatilization during oxic phases and the remainder was nitrified. The accumulated nitrate decreased soil ph from 8. 0 to 6. 8 before its transformation through denitrification. Nitrification and denitrification rates during the three oxic/anoxic cycles (approximately three months) were. 29 - 3. 2 kg N ha [up]- 1 and 1. 0 - 2. 3 kg N ha[up]- 1, respectively. Extrapolation of these values to 30 -cm deep soil layers gave rates that were sufficient for complete transformation of at least 1700 kg N ha [up]- 1 of ammonium to nitrogen gases, which is ten-fold greater than the annual nitrogen application of 170 kg N ha[up]- 1 permitted by the European directive. Denitrification rates decreased linearly during the three cycles (from 36 +- 2 to 16 +-ug N g [up- 1] d [up]- 1 drysoil <b>projecting</b> <b>cessation</b> of denitrification activity and Co 2 production during the fifth cycle. Storage of peat at 4 oC most probably allowed slow degradation of organic matter that was completely oxidized to Co 2 after the soil was exposed to higher temeprature (28 oC). Storage of soil for one year did not affect nitrification rate, but reduced denitrifation rate, unless soilwas amended with a readily degradable carbon source. The data suggest thatthe high carbon content of this soil, it cannot sustain transformations ofhigh N loads to nitrogen gases for prolonged periods without amendment with readily available carbon...|$|R

40|$|Smoking {{represents}} a serious public health burden that crosses gender, racial, and socioeconomic lines. Although {{the majority of}} smoking cessation counseling traditionally occurs {{in the setting of}} a Primary Care Provider’s office, clinicians often lack the necessary time and/or cultural and language skills to provide adequate help to smokers prepared to quit. A Community Health Worker (CHW) smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>project</b> utilizing CHWs in San Diego, CA evaluated by Woodruff, et al effectively increased patient’s abstinence rates in the intervention group. A similar project undertaken by the University of New Mexico Department of Family and Community Medicine employed bilingual CHWs to counsel patients regarding smoking cessation in a clinic with both Spanish and English-speaking patients. This study analyzes the differences in CHW counseling time required (using visitations and phone calls) based on gender. Ancillary outcomes of counseling time required based on language and ethnicity are also evaluated. Female smokers (N = 25) averaged mean total counseling times of 247. 4 minutes (80 - 410) and male smokers (N = 9) averaged 217. 8 (90 - 350), a difference that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0. 4343). English speakers (N = 20) averaged total mean counseling times of 198. 8 minutes while Spanish speakers (N = 14) averaged 297. 9 minutes, a statistically significant result (p = 0. 0017). Our findings are inconclusive with respect to the influence of gender on counseling times for a Community Health Worker based smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>project.</b> The difference in counseling times between men and women, though not reaching statistical significance, could be of clinical importance but would require further study with a larger sample size.

Results The internal validity of questionnaire was high (Cronbach's a = 0. 92). The reliability of equivalent types in 16 stabilized patients also was high (ICC = 0. 99). In general the domains within the CCQ were strongly correlated with each other, while each domain in separate was strongly correlated with the overall CCQ score (r 2 = 0. 953, r 2 = 0. 915 and r 2 = 0. 842 in regards to the functional, symptomatic and mental domain, respectively).

The consensus development process forms part of the activities performed by the UICC (International Union Against Cancer) <b>Project</b> Smoking <b>Cessation,</b> which is a project within the framework of the UICC Tobacco and Cancer Programme. The 1988 Report of the US Surgeon General states very clearly, that the use of tobacco products is not a matter of free choice, but is the result of an addiction as scientifically valid as the addiction to heroin and other narcotics. The scientific literature provides informations on many methods and techniques for a smoking cessation, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological.

40|$|Abstract Background Web-based health {{behavior}} change programs can reach {{large groups of}} disparate participants and thus they provide promise of becoming important public health tools. Data on participant rurality can complement other demographic measures to deepen {{our understanding of the}} success of these programs. Specifically, analysis of participant rurality can inform recruitment and social marketing efforts, and facilitate the targeting and tailoring of program content. Rurality analysis can also help evaluate the effectiveness of interventions across population groupings. Methods We describe how the RUCAs (Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes) methodology can be used to examine results from two Randomized Controlled Trials of Web-based tobacco cessation programs: the ChewFree. com project for smokeless tobacco cessation and the Smokers' Health Improvement Program (SHIP) <b>project</b> for smoking <b>cessation.</b> Results Using RUCAs methodology helped to highlight the extent to which both Web-based interventions reached a substantial percentage of rural participants.

In Phase II, all subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three maintenance conditions: a 4 -week support group which offered an opportunity to discuss feelings and thoughts, a 4 -week telephone contact system which enabled group members to call one another, and a no-contact control group. To evaluate efficacy, extensive follow-up data were collected at the end of treatment and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The treatment program was extremely effective; 100 % of the subjects were abstinent at the end of treatment, and at 1 year post-treatment, 63 % of the subjects reported total abstinence.

Schools were randomly assigned to conditions. Control groups included 2 ̆ 2 treatment as usual 2 ̆ 2 and an 2 ̆ 2 attention control 2 ̆ 2 with the same outcome expectancies as the treatment conditions. Students were surveyed twice in grade 7 and once in each of grades 8 and 9. The interventions occurred during grade 7. Results. We observed significant effects on mediating variables such as knowledge, prevalence estimates, and coping effort. The knowledge and prevalence estimates effects decayed partially but remained significant up to a 2 -year follow-up. The coping effort effect did not persist at follow-ups. There were significant main effects of both classroom training and TV programming on knowledge and prevalence estimates and significant interactions of classroom and TV programming on knowledge (negative), disapproval of parental smoking, and coping effort. There were no consistent program effects on refusal/self-efficacy, smoking intentions, or behavior. Conclusions.

40|$|After acceding to {{political}} independence in 1975, Papua New Guinea 2 ̆ 7 s (PNG) overall relations with Australia were generally described as dependent. The relationship {{was described as}} dependent because PNG 2 ̆ 7 s reliance upon Australia for economic input (trade, aid and investment), education and as {{the major source of}} skilled manpower recruitment was substantial. Consequently, PNG 2 ̆ 7 s conduct of bilateral relations with Australia were constrained - this socio-economic dependence also restricted PNG from pursuing relations with others independent of Australia particularly, between 1975 - 1979. But socio-economic and skilled manpower recruitment were not the only reasons contributing toward a dependent relationship with Australia. Other factors such as, firstly, the inexperience of the PNG foreign affairs officials and politicians and their getting to know how to conduct the bilateral relations also helped to make the dependent relationship much deeper than it appeared. Secondly, PNG 2 ̆ 7 s proximity to Australia implied substantial and continuing interest amongst Australia 2 ̆ 7 s military-strategic and political planners, thereby increasing Australia 2 ̆ 7 s influence. The dependent situation did not emerge suddenly at PNG 2 ̆ 7 s political independence in 1975. The foundations were already set during the period of Australian colonial rule, particularly beginning in 1962 following the United Nations Visiting Mission (1962) and the World Bank Mission (1964). However, PNG 2 ̆ 7 s dependence upon Australia was not necessarily, as argued by other writers, a consequence of an official policy per se, but stems from the desire of the colonial Administration (and the Australian Federal Government) to help develop PNG toward economic self-sufficiency in preparation toward eventual political independence. Economic self-sufficiency for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was to be achieved under policies recommended and espoused by the World Bank and the colonial Administration such as for example, increased foreign participation to boost economic activity within the territory which incidentally {{led to the development of}} linkages between foreign investors in the territory and business interests overseas. In spite of these linkages between domestic and foreign business interests and the fact that aid relations continued to be the focus of the relationship, PNG 2 ̆ 7 s relations with Australia in the 1980 s were thought to have 2 ̆ 2 become relatively, but not absolutely, less important to PNG 2 ̆ 2. The relative decline in importance of relations with Australia occurred because PNG began to diversify its trading partners toward South East Asia and North East Asia including Japan and Germany (West) with Japan becoming an important export destination (though Australia retained its status as the major origin of PNG 2 ̆ 7 s imports). Japan also became a substantial aid donor and increasingly Asia was replacing Australia as an important area of recruitment of skilled personnel. These developments led to greater independence by PNG in the conduct of its relations with Australia. But other issues such as the <b>projected</b> <b>cessation</b> of Australian budget support by the year 2000, and its gradual replacement by project and program aid, point to the potential erosion of PNG 2 ̆ 7 s independence. How has the shift from budget support to tied aid impinged upon policy independence? is a question which is answered in the course of the dissertation. The analysis of the conduct of PNG 2 ̆ 7 s bilateral relations with Australia considered against the background described above can lead to two possible conclusions: firstly, that foreign policy directions as enunciated - universalism and active and selective engagement - were responsible for increasing policy independence in the conduct of bilateral relations with Australia, and secondly that the manifestation of PNG 2 ̆ 7 s policy independence from Australia was a consequence of its economic diversification (in trade, aid and investment) and the desire by PNG to be in control of its own destiny. The successive universalist and selective and active engagement foreign policy directions had differing impacts on the conduct of external relations. Universalism was intended to accommodate existing global divisions, whilst selective and active engagement was intended to define in clear terms PNG 2 ̆ 7 s basic orientations. In my view, PNG 2 ̆ 7 s policy independence reflects economic diversification as the principal source of independence because, without 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 independence (particularly economic), PNG would and could not be able to sustain a continuous and consistent level of independence over a longer period of time, which I am suggesting PNG has done since 1980. However, as I argue in the introduction, PNG 2 ̆ 7 s policy independence can also be attributed to other explanations such as for example, the power of the weak (many competing diverse interests and Australia 2 ̆ 7 s more broader regional and global interests), political decolonisation and coinciding interests. I intend in this dissertation to show how these explanations are relevant in defining PNG 2 ̆ 7 s policy independence...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveEngaging natural {{supports}} may be {{a promising}} strategy to promote the use of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) who smoke. This qualitative study explored preferences for support for quitting {{from family and friends}} among individuals with SMI who participated in cessation treatment. MethodsParticipants were 41 individuals with SMI enrolled in a Medicaid Demonstration <b>Project</b> of smoking <b>cessation</b> at community mental health centers. Open-ended questions asked during a social network interview explored participants' preferences for more support for quitting smoking from family and friends. The qualitative data was coded and common themes were identified across the data. ResultsThree primary preferences emerged for smoking cessation support from family members and friends: 1) more practical support for quitting (e. g., financial help with purchasing cessation medications); 2) more emotional support for quitting (e. g., encouraging progress toward quitting); and 3) changing their own smoking behaviors in the presence of participants (e. g., don't smoke around them or offer them cigarettes). ConclusionsIndividuals with SMI who participated in smoking cessation treatment at community mental health centers indicated several ways that family members and friends could support their efforts to quit smoking. Understanding how people with SMI want support from family and friends to quit smoking will inform strategies to leverage these natural resources to promote the use of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment and support smoking abstinence for this population.

[...] University of Washington, 2014 In this thesis, I propose {{new models}} for {{clustered}} data, design estimators of covariate effects, implement model inference algorithms, and show asymptotic properties of my estimators, including consistency and asymptotic normality. I also present Monte Carlo simulations and real dataset analyses for demonstration. In this thesis three inherently related marginalizable mixed effects models for datasets with clustered binary, ordinal and right-censored, i. e. survival outcomes are proposed. These models can evaluate population-level covariate effects, and model a diverse variety of cluster correlation structures. The marginalizable {{property of the}} models is obtained via a pair of conjugate distributions. Chapter I contains literature review of various models designed for clustered datasets, focusing on binary, ordinal and survival data. Chapter II discusses and compares different inference methods for models in Part I. In Chapter III, I first give the motivation of the new marginalizable mixed effects model. Then I introduce the multivariate exponential random variables, which serve as random effects in the new models.

We retrieved and analyzed archival PM documents from 1998 - 2005. We supplemented information from the documents with scholarly articles assessing QuitAssist and archived versions of the PM and QuitAssist websites. PM's Youth Smoking Prevention department began funding youth <b>cessation</b> <b>projects</b> and programs soon after its creation in 1998, motivated by the same issue that drove its interest in youth smoking prevention: regulatory threats posed by public and policymaker concern about youth smoking. The department took a similar approach to youth smoking cessation as it did with prevention, rejecting curricula with "anti-industry" themes. In 2002, a "cessation exploration team" examined a variety of rationales for and approaches to company support for adult smoking cessation. Ultimately, PM chose QuitAssist, a limited and less expensive option that nonetheless provided opportunities for engagement {{with a variety of}} public health and government officials. Independent research indicates that QuitAssist is not an effective cessation tool. While the transformation of ambitious plans into a mundane final product is a recurring theme with PM's corporate responsibility efforts, it would be inappropriate to dismiss PM's smoking cessation endeavors as half-hearted attempts to appear responsible. Such endeavors have the potential to inflict real harm by competing with more effective programs and by helping to maintain a tobacco-favorable policy environment.

P 1 - 0044 Introduction and <b>Project</b> Objectives: Smoking <b>cessation</b> after cancer diagnosis can {{lower the risk}} of disease advancement, minimize adverse treatment-related effects and improve the prognosis and quality of life of patients. We examined the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention using a risk communication approach with motivational counseling. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial, in which 528 smoking cancer patients (average age 58. 9 years, 455 male) were allocated either into an intervention group (n= 268) or a control group (n= 260). About 72. 9 % of the subjects were pre-contemplating quitting. Subjects' mean daily tobacco consumption was 12. 5 cigarettes, they had been smoking for over 42 years on average, and were moderately nicotine dependent. The intervention group received 15 - 30 min individual risk communication and counseling by a nurse counselor while the control group received standard care. Smoking status in both groups was checked at follow-ups at 1 week and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: The primary outcome was self-reported point-prevalence 7 -day abstinence at 6 months. No {{significant differences were found between}} the intervention and control groups (15. 7 % vs 16. 5 %; OR 0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 59 - 1. 50). The secondary outcome, the rate of at least 50 % self-reported reduction of smoking at 6 months, was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (16. 8 % vs 12. 3 %; OR 1. 43, 95 % CI 0. 88 - 2. 35). The biochemically validated quit rate at the 6 -month follow-up was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (5. 2 % vs 3. 8 %; OR 1. 38, 95 % CI 0. 60 - 3. 16). Conclusions: The risk communication intervention was not effective for quitting but improved the rate of smoking reduction among smoking cancer patients. Project Number: 0910099...|$|R
40|$|The Early Anglo-Saxon Period is characterised archaeologically by {{the regular}} {{deposition}} of artefacts in human graves in England. The scope for dating these objects and graves {{has long been}} studied, but it has typically proved easier to identify and enumerate the chronological problems of the material than to solve them. Prior {{to the work of}} this project, there was no comprehensive chronological framework for Early Anglo-Saxon Archaeology, and the level of detail and precision in dates that could be suggested was low. The evidence has been studied afresh using a co-ordinated suite of dating techniques, both traditional and new: a review and revision of artefact-typology; seriation of grave-assemblages using correspondence analysis; high-precision radiocarbon dating of selected bone samples; and Bayesian modelling using the results of all of these. This integrated strategy was focussed primarily on the later part of the Early Anglo-Saxon Period, starting in the 6 th century. The work has produced a new chronological framework, consisting of sequences of phases that are separate for male and female burials but nevertheless mutually consistent and co-ordinated. These will allow archaeologists to assign grave-assemblages and a wide range of individual artefact-types to defined phases that are associated with calendrical date-ranges whose limits are expressed to a specific degree of probability. Important unresolved issues include a precise adjustment for dietary effects on radiocarbon dates from human skeletal material. Nonetheless the results of this <b>project</b> suggest the <b>cessation</b> of regular burial with grave goods in Anglo-Saxon England two decades or even more {{before the end of the}} seventh century. That creates a limited but important discrepancy with the current numismatic chronology of early English sceattas. The digital data-set includes data-matrices and tables in spreadsheet form that are too large for paper publication. These are referred to in the printed report of the project as 'e-Figures'. E-Figure 7. 4 is a directory containing five files that define the structure of a Bayesian model examining the chronological distribution of types of glass bead...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management (EM-OR) {{requested}} that Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), {{working under the}} Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) contract, provide technical and independent waste management planning support using funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Specifically, DOE EM-OR requested ORAU to plan and implement a survey approach, focused on characterizing the Isotope Row Facilities located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for future determination of an appropriate disposition pathway for building debris and systems, should the buildings be demolished. The characterization effort was designed to identify and quantify radiological and chemical contamination associated with building structures and process systems. The Isotope Row Facilities discussed in this report include Bldgs. 3030, 3031, 3032, 3033, 3033 A, 3034, 3036, 3093, and 3118, and {{are located in the}} northeast quadrant of the main ORNL campus area, between Hillside and Central Avenues. Construction of the isotope production facilities was initiated in the late 1940 s, with the exception of Bldgs. 3033 A and 3118, which were enclosed in the early 1960 s. The Isotope Row facilities were intended for the purpose of light industrial use for the processing, assemblage, and storage of radionuclides used for a variety of applications (ORNL 1952 and ORAU 2013). The Isotope Row Facilities provided laboratory and support services as part of the Isotopes Production and Distribution Program until 1989 when DOE mandated their shutdown (ORNL 1990). These facilities performed diverse research and developmental experiments in support of isotopes production. As a result of the many years of operations, various <b>projects,</b> and final <b>cessation</b> of operations, production was followed by inclusion into the surveillance and maintenance (S&M) project for eventual decontamination and decommissioning (D&D). The process for D&D and final dismantlement of facilities requires that the known contaminants of concern (COCs) be evaluated and quantified and to identify and quantify any additional contaminants in order to satisfy the waste acceptance criteria requirements for the desired disposal pathway. Known facility contaminants include, but are not limited to, asbestos-containing material (ACM), radiological contaminants, and chemical contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and metals...|$|R
40|$|Intent: The {{process and}} {{findings}} of a research <b>project</b> on driving <b>cessation</b> in urban and rural seniors {{will be used to}} illustrate and discuss the benefits of a sequential mixed model design for understanding occupational adaptation. Argument: According to Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998) in sequential mixed-model approaches, conclusions made following the result of the first phase of a research project are used to design the next study, often to explore unexpected results. This approach is proposed here as a useful one in occupational science. While a common process in building a conceptual framework consists of initially conducting inductive qualitative research, it will be argued that an initial quantitative phase may in some cases be more fruitful. As an illustration, the pattern of results of the quantitative strand of our project informed the development of relevant questions which then could be elucidated through the collection and analysis of phenomenological data. The first phase of our research allowed us to uncover the unexpected quantitative result that rural seniors didn’t seem to experience as great a decline in occupational participation and quality of life as urban participants. Those initial results guided the design of the qualitative strand of the project in which extensive interviews were conducted with 25 urban and rural seniors allowing us to shed light on the rich and complex reasons for that pattern of results. Importance to Occupational Science. Occupational science has been developed in part for the purpose of contributing to the theoretical basis of occupational therapy (Clark, 2006). Occupational therapists are increasingly involved in helping seniors with transition to other modes of community mobility and are in need of conceptual frameworks supporting that emerging practice area. In addition to helping develop a framework, a sequential mixed model study can point to areas worth prioritizing, help with a client centered approach, as well as lead to the most relevant further research questions. Conclusions: While qualitative approaches have been strongly favored by occupational scientists (Cook, 2001, Molke et al, 2004), there are clear benefits for both theory building and practice to using a sequential mixed-model design and to start by a quantitative approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of {{maternal}} pre-pregnancy weight status on the relationship between prenatal smoking and infant birth weight (IBW). Prenatal cigarette smoking and maternal weight exert opposing effects on IBW; smoking decreases birth weight while maternal pre-pregnancy weight is positively correlated with birth weight. As such, mutual effect modification may be sufficiently significant to alter the independent effects of these two birth weight correlates. Finding of such an effect has implications of prenatal smoking cessation education. Perception of risk is an important determinant of smoking cessation, and reduced or low birth weight (LBW) as a smoking-associated risk predominates prenatal smoking counseling and education. In a population such as the US, where obesity is becoming epidemic, particularly among minority and low-income groups, perception of risk may be lowered should increased maternal size attenuate the effect of smoking. Previous studies have not found a significant interaction effect of prenatal smoking and maternal pre-pregnancy weight on IBW; however, use of self-reported smoking status may have biased findings. Reliability of self-reported smoking status reported in the literature is variable, with deception rates ranging from a low of 5 % to as high as 16 %. This study, using data from a prenatal smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>project,</b> in which smoking status was validated by saliva cotinine, was an opportunity to assess effect modification of smoking and maternal weight using biochemically determined smoking status in lieu of self report. Stratified by saliva cotinine, 151 women from a prenatal smoking cessation cohort, who were 18 years and older and had full-term, singleton births, were included in this study. The effect of smoking in terms of mean birth weight across three levels of maternal pre-pregnancy weight was assessed by general linear modeling procedures, adjusting for other known correlates of IBW. Effect modification was marginally significant, p =. 104, but only with control for differential effects among racial/ethnic groups. A smaller than planned sample of nonsmokers, or women who quit smoking during the pregnancy, prohibited rejection of the null hypothesis of no difference in the effect of smoking across levels of pre-pregnancy weight. ...|$|R
40|$|Existing Research In 2009, a {{comprehensive}} review of evidence relating to young people and smoking was published. Few studies were identified which focused specifically on smoking prevention or cessation interventions for young people, and the majority of the existing evidence focused on school-based programmes. We searched for Cochrane reviews and peer reviewed literature from 2009 - 2015. There was little research on the acceptability and effectiveness of training professionals who work with young people to deliver smoking prevention and cessation messages. There was also a dearth of evidence regarding the effectiveness of direct youth involvement in smoking prevention and cessation programmes. Evidence relating to online health promotion and young people focused primarily on educational programmes involving highly structured content, with very little evidence regarding a less formal approach. Research design A multi-faceted process evaluation of The Filter was undertaken. First, tweets sent to or from The Filter Twitter account were subjected to thematic analysis. Second, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with The Filter staff, professionals who had undergone training from The Filter and young people who had either interacted with The Filter online or as part of face-to-face workshops. Finally, surveys were developed based on the findings of the interview study, which asked professionals and young people about their experiences of all elements of The Filter programme. Results: Training for professionals working with young people The Filter training team reported that initially they designed and delivered training based on the key tobacco topics identified in Wales. This was later amended, to include smoking cessation training, and bespoke training packages. Professionals who took part in interviews reported that they valued this flexible approach to training courses and had put some of the techniques they had learnt into practice in their work with young people. This was found to be the case by professionals {{who took part in the}} online survey. Professionals also reported that the training was relevant, enjoyable and gave them new knowledge about smoking. 5 Results: Youth development, education and smoking cessation support The Filter developed a workshop-based approach to transmitting tobacco control and smoking cessation messages, which was delivered to small groups of young people in their own communities. The Filter staff reported that delivering these sessions was unproblematic, and all respondents identified a very strong rapport between The Filter staff and young people. The range of activities included in workshops was also identified as a key way of sustaining interest from young people, and visual aids were identified as particularly engaging. Some young people suggested that their interaction with The Filter had changed their planned behaviour in relation to smoking, or encouraged them to cut down or quit if they were existing smokers. Results: Online health promotion The Filter team shared tobacco control messages via a wide range of online platforms. They have achieved some level of success in terms of reach on The Filter website and potential reach on Twitter and Facebook. However, it was not possible within the confines of this research to understand if these users fit within the target demographic for the intervention, and how much overlap there was between The Filter face-to-face services and online services. The Filter staff reported that the intervention was deliverable by using a flexible approach, including the use of multiple and changing online platforms. It was not possible to understand how acceptable this intervention was to young people, as only one of The Filter’s followers agreed to take part in an online interview, and only 11 respondents to the online survey had interacted with the online resources. The evaluation of social media based interventions has been acknowledged to be a challenging area (Bailey et al., 2015) and this low response does not mean that the intervention is not reaching the targeted individuals, but that the individuals were not willing to take part in a brief evaluation. Conclusion To carry out this evaluation, we were given full access to The Filter team and their contacts in order to gather samples for the interviews and surveys. The Filter team were adaptable in their approaches to training and the use of social media over the course of the <b>project,</b> ensuring smoking <b>cessation</b> and prevention information was maintained as up to date and relevant. Professionals noted the rapport the Filter Team developed with young people was excellent. Training was high quality and professionals were able to use what they had learned from The Filter when working directly with young people. Young people liked the visual aspects of The Filter and they preferred the informal youth work approach to school based sessions on smoking. The use of The Filter social media platforms and online resources was encouraging, showing maintained growth over the course of evaluation period. Online resources were reported to be used by the majority of professionals taking part in the evaluation, however, engaging young people in the evaluation of The Filter via social media proved challenging. The data in this evaluation suggests that The Filter is a service which is feasible to deliver. The methodology of this evaluation did not allow us to examine the effectiveness of The Filter in terms of smoking prevention or cessation...|$|R
