It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt.

2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent</b> is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

Ultracentrifugation {{has been the most}} widely used methodology but rapid methods, including Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and/or <b>precipitating</b> <b>agents</b> such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or PRotein Organic Solvent PRecipitation (PROSPR) have emerged. To evaluate the impact of these different methods on the resulting EV preparations, plasma EVs were isolated using SEC, PEG and PROSPR, and their total protein content, NTA and Cryo-electron microscopy profiles, and EV-markers were compared. Also, their effect on recipient cells was tested. Low protein content and Cryo-EM analysis showed that SEC removed most of the overabundant soluble plasma proteins, which were not removed using PEG and partially by PROSPR. Moreover, only SEC allowed the detection of the EV-markers CD 9, CD 63 and CD 81, LGALS 3 BP and CD 5 L, suggesting a putative interference of the <b>precipitating</b> <b>agents</b> in the structure/composition of the EVs. Furthermore, PEG and PROSPR-based EV isolation resulted in reduced cell viability in vitro.

40|$|The correct {{study of}} {{diffusive}} time evolution of concentration boundaries in n-component systems requires {{the use of}} all the (n- 1) (2) diffusion coefficients defined by Fick's law. However, to simplify the analysis, the so-called pseudo-binary approximation is very often used. This can lead to very misleading results. On the other hand, the possibility to predict the diffusional behaviour of rt-component systems from the properties of corresponding binaries and from the knowledge of the solute-solute cross-interactions should be a very important goal. If no "chemical" solute-solute interactions are present in solution, the diffusion coefficients depend only on the "hydrodynamic" or volumetric solute-solute interactions. This contribution, which is mostly reflected in the cross-diffusion coefficient values, is always present and assumes an important role in solutions containing macromolecular solutes. It is then very important in modelling the diffusion phenomena in systems where a protein can crystallise in the presence of polymeric solutes as <b>precipitating</b> <b>agents.</b> The present paper is devoted {{to the study of the}} hydrodynamic effects on the diffusion coefficients of poly(ethyleneglycol) samples, which is one of the widely <b>precipitating</b> <b>agents</b> used in the protein precipitation.

5000|$|... 1. Preparation of the Solution: This {{may involve}} several steps {{including}} adjustment of the pH {{of the solution}} {{in order for the}} precipitate to occur quantitatively and get a precipitate of desired properties, removing interferences, adjusting the volume of the sample to suit the amount of <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent</b> to be added. 2. Precipitation: This requires addition of a <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent</b> solution to the sample solution. Upon addition of the first drops of the <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent,</b> supersaturation occurs, then nucleation starts to occur where every few molecules of precipitate aggregate together forming a nucleous. At this point, addition of extra <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent</b> will either form new nuclei or will build up on existing nuclei to give a precipitate. This can be predicted by Von Weimarn ratio where, according to this relation the particle size is inversely proportional to a quantity called the relative supersaturation where Relative supersaturation = (Q - S)/S The Q is the concentration of reactants before precipitation, S is the solubility of precipitate in the medium from which it is being precipitated. Therefore, in order to get particle growth instead of further nucleation we need to make the relative supersaturation ratio as small as possible. The optimum conditions for precipitation which make the supersaturation low are: a. Precipitation using dilute solutions to decrease Qb. Slow addition of <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent</b> to keep Q as low as possiblec. Stirring the solution during addition of <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent</b> to avoid concentration sites and keep Q lowd. Increase solubility by precipitation from hot solutione. Adjust the pH in order to increase S but not a too much increase np as {{we do not want to}} loose precipitate by dissolutionf. Usually add a little excess of the <b>precipitating</b> <b>agent</b> for quantitative precipitation and check for completeness of the precipitation 3. Digestion of the precipitate: The precipitate is left hot (below boiling) for 30 min to 1 hour in order for the particles to be digested. Digestion involves dissolution of small particles and reprecipitation on larger ones resulting in particle growth and better precipitate characteristics. This process is called Ostwald ripening. An important advantage of digestion is observed for colloidal precipitates where large amounts of adsorbed ions cover the huge area of the precipitate. Digestion forces the small colloidal particles to agglomerate which decreases their surface area and thus adsorption. You should know that adsorption is a major problem in gravimetry in case of colloidal precipitate since a precipitate tends to adsorb its own ions present in excess, Therefore, forming what is called a primary ion layer which attracts ions from solution forming a secondary or counter ion layer. Individual particles repel each other keeping the colloidal properties of the precipitate. Particle coagulation can be forced by either digestion or addition of a high concentration of a diverse ions strong electrolytic solution in order to shield the charges on colloidal particles and force agglomeration. Usually, coagulated particles return to the colloidal state if washed with water, a process called peptization.|$|E
