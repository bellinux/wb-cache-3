The size of air bubbles generated by passing air through a bubble diffuser/sparger can be reduced by changing the air flow pattern from steady to oscillatory. In the present work, coal flotation with oscillatory air supply generated by a fluidic oscillator was investigated and the results were compared with those obtained with steady air flow. The flotation tests were carried out at semi-continuous mode using a laboratory-scale flotation column. The results suggest that use of the fluidic oscillator can lead to substantial reagent cost savings and help improve coal flotation efficiency.

We suggest that mind perception {{is the essence of}} moral judgment. In particular, we suggest that moral judgment is rooted in a cognitive template of two perceived minds—a moral dyad of an intentional agent and a suffering moral patient. Diverse lines of research support dyadic morality. First, perceptions of mind are linked to moral judgments: dimensions of mind perception (agency and experience) map onto moral types (agents and patients), and deficits of mind perception correspond to difficulties with moral judgment. Second, not only are moral judgments sensitive to perceived agency and experience, but all moral transgressions are <b>fundamentally</b> <b>understood</b> as agency plus experienced suffering—that is, interpersonal harm—even ostensibly harmless acts such as purity violations.

40|$|Criminalization of Sex within Authority Relations (SAR) —such as {{sex in the}} {{relationship}} between a therapist and a patient or an employer and an employee—is a growing phenomenon. Current theories conceptualize and consequently justify SAR offenses either under a liberal conception of sexual autonomy or under a feminist conception of gender inequality. Yet both conceptualizations are inadequate and fail to capture the distinctiveness of this new legal category. Specifically, they fail to explain the main puzzle underlying SAR offenses, which proscribe sexual contact in the absence of coercion by the offender. Rejecting both liberal and feminist analytical frameworks, this Article draws on Max Weber’s theory of authority to suggest that SAR offenders engage in a novel type of abuse of authority. This abuse involves the overstepping of bureaucratic power into personal relationships and specifically the use of charisma of the office in sexual relations. This new conceptualization calls for a reconsideration of SAR criminalization as sex offenses and paves the way for an alternative regulation based on the notion of abuse of office, which is <b>fundamentally</b> <b>understood</b> as anticorruption regulation...|$|R
