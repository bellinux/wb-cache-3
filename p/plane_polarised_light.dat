50|$|When {{dealing with}} {{unfamiliar}} types or with rocks so fine grained that their component minerals cannot be determined {{with the aid}} of a hand lens, a microscope is used.

50|$|Any crystal {{which has}} a mirror plane {{as one of its}} {{symmetry}} elements has the property that its mirror image (with any plane as the mirror plane) can always be superimposed on the original crystal by translation or rotation or both. If there are no mirror planes as symmetry elements then the mirror image of a crystal cannot be brought into superposition with the original crystal by rotation or translation. This is enantiomorphism, and the mirror images are said to be enantiomorphs of each other. The possibility of enantiomorphic crystals is determined by the crystal symmetry, i.e., by the point group of the crystal species. There are 32 possible point groups, and 22 of these are capable of forming enantiomorphs. The enantiomorphs are designated right or left handed, according to whether they rotate the <b>plane</b> of <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> to the right or to the left. Sometimes {{it is clear from the}} outward form of the crystal whether it is right or left handed, and sometimes optical methods are needed to determine this.|$|R

To do this they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different colour filters. They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision.

40|$|The Apollo virtual {{microscope}} is a {{means of}} viewing, over the Internet, polished thin sections of every rock in the Apollo lunar sample collections via software, duplicating many of the functions of a petrological microscope, is described. Images from the Apollo 11 and 12 missions may be viewed at: www. virtualmicroscope. org/content/apollo. Introduction: During the six NASA missions to the Moon from 1969 - 72 a total of 382 kilograms of rocks and soils, often referred to as "the legacy of Apollo", were collected and returned to Earth. A unique collection of polished thin sections (PTSs) was made from over 400 rocks by the Lunar Sample Curatorial Facility at the Johnson Spacecraft Center (JSC), Houston. These materials have been available for loan to approved PIs but of course they can't be simultaneously investigated by several researchers unless they are co-located or the sample is passed back and forward between them by mail/hand carrying which is inefficient and very risky for irreplaceable material. When The Open University (OU), the world's largest Distance Learning Higher Education Establishment found itself facing a comparable problem (how to supply thousands of undergraduate students with an interactive petrological microscope and a personal set of thin sections), it decided to develop a software tool called the Virtual Microscope (VM). As a result it is now able to make the unique and precious collection of Apollo specimens universally available as a resource for concurrent study by anybody in the world's Earth and Planetary Sciences community. Herein, we describe the first steps of a collaborative project between OU and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Curatorial Facility to record a PTS for every lunar rock, beginning with those collected by the Apollo 11 and 12 missions. Method: Production of a virtual microscope dedicated to a particular theme divides into four main parts - photography, image processing, building and assembly of virtual microscope components, and publication on a website. Two large research quality microscopes are used to collect all the images required for a virtual microscope. The first is part of an integrated package that utilizes Leica PowerMosaic software and a motorised XYZ stage to generate large area mosaics. It includes a fast acquisition camera and depending on the PTS size normally is used to produce seamless mosaic images consisting of 100 - 500 individual photographs. If the sample is suitable, three mosaics of each sample are recorded - <b>plane</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>light,</b> between crossed polars and reflected light. In order for the VM to be a true petrological microscope it is necessary to recreate the features of a rotating stage and perform observations using filters to produce polarised light. Thus the petrological VM includes the capability of seeing changes in optical properties (pleochroism and birefringence) during rotation allowing mineral identification. The second microscope in the system provides the functions of the rotating stage. To this microscope we have added a robotically controlled motor to acquire seventy-two images (5 degree intervals) in <b>plane</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> and between crossed polars. To process the images acquired from the two microscopes involves a combination of proprietary software (Photoshop) and our own in-house code. The final stage involves assembling all the components in an HTML 5 environment. Pathfinder investigations: We have undertaken a number of pilot studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the petrological microscope with lunar samples. The first was to make available on-line images collected from the Educational Package of Apollo samples provided by NASA to the UK STFC (Science and Technical Facilities Council) for loan as educational material e. g. for schools. The real PTSs of the samples are now no longer sent out to schools removing the risks associated with transport, accidental breakage and eliminating the possibility of loss. The availability of lunar sample VM-related material was further extended to include twenty-eight specimens from all of the Apollo missions. Some of these samples were made more generally available through an ibook entitled "Moon Rocks: an introduction to the Geology of the Moon," free from the Apple Bookstore. Research possibilities: Although the Virtual Microscope was originally conceived as a teaching aid and was later recognised as a means of public outreach and engagement, we now realize that it also has enormous potential as a high level research tool. Following discussions with the JSC Curators we have received Curation and Analysis Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials (CAPTEM) permission to embark on a programme of digitizing the entire lunar sample PTS collection for all three of the above purposes. By the time of the 47 th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) we will have completed 81 rocks collected during the Apollo 11 and 12 missions and the data, with cross-links to the Lunar Sample Compendium will go live on the Web at the 47 th LPSC. The VM images of the Apollo 11 (41 VM images) and 12 (40 VM images) missions can be viewed at: [URL] The lunar sample VM will enable large numbers of skilled/unskilled microscopists (professional and amateur researchers, educators and students, enthusiasts and the simply curious non-scientists) to share the information from a single sample. It will mean that all the PTSs already cut, even historical ones, could be available for new joint investigations or private study. The scientific return from the collection will increase exponentially as a result of further debate and discussion. Simultaneously the VM will remove the need for making unnecessary multiple samplings, avoid consignment of delicate/breakable specimens (all of which are priceless) to insecure mail/courier services and reduce direct labour and indirect costs, travel budgets and unproductive travelling time necessary for co-location of collaborating researchers. For the future we have already recognized further potential for virtual technology. There is nothing that a petrologist likes more than to see the original rock as a hand specimen. It is entirely possible to recreate virtual hand specimens with 3 -D hard and software, already developed for viewing fossils, located within the Curatorial Facility, [URL]...|$|E

Ten synovial fluid samples from patients with acute gout were used as a reference. The examination was performed after placing a fluid sample in a Niebauer haemocytometric chamber; a crystal count was done first under ordinary light, then in the area corresponding to a 0. 1  ml, under <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> RESULTS—The percentages of birefringence appreciated for CPPD were 18 % (confidence intervals (CI) 12,  24) for observer 1, and 17 % (CI 10,  24) for observer 2  (difference NS). The percentages of birefringence for monosodium urate were 127 % (CI 103,  151) for observer 1  and 107 % (CI 100,  114) for observer 2  (difference NS).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with properties of the excited states of flavins. They {{may be involved in}} some photobiological processes and are models for flavoprotein catalysis. Understanding the spectral properties of flavins is important for interpreting the nature of intermolecular interactions in flavoproteins. The absorption spectra of many flavin derivatives are similar, but the two long wavelength bands are sensitive to both solvent and substituents. Two independent methods for finding the angle between these absorption oscillators are described. The first, measurement of the fluorescence polarisation of a random but rigid array of the chromophore, is a well known technique. The second is novel, and requires the preparation of a partially ordered solution of flavin by selective blanching with <b>plane</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> of wavelengths absorbed by only one of the absorption bands. The theory of this technique is developed, and it shows that the angle between the absorption oscillators can be calculated from the dichroic ratios of the extinctions of the two bands after bleaching. This angle does not vary much for different flavins, and the same value (around 30 °) is found from both fluorescence polarisation and dichroic bleaching. The directions of the oscillators relative to the axes of the molecule cannot be measured by either technique, but the effects of substituents on absorption spectra suggest that the visible band is polarised approximately parallel to the long axis of the flavin. The first excited singlet of a flavin loses some of its energy by emission as fluorescence, but it also participates in singlet-to-singlet energy transfer. This is demonstrated by fluorescence for two flavin derivatives, using a methyl cellulose film as the supporting matrix. Optical observations are possible under these conditions at higher flavin concentrations than are easily studied in liquid solutions. Excited singlets may also lose energy by intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet state, but no delayed light emission can be detected from aqueous flavin solutions. In a rigid polyacrylamide matrix, however, there is delayed emission, even at room temperature. This is identified as E-type delayed fluorescence on the basic of its spectrum, its temperature and its exciting light intensity dependence. At lower temperatures the delayed fluorescence decreases, and phosphorescence emission dominates. The intensities and lifetimes of the delayed emissions of 12 flavins have been measured in the range 77 °- 315 °K. On plotting the logarithm of intensity or of the reciprocal of half-life (decay is exponential) against the reciprocal of temperature biphasic Arrhenius plots are obtained. These can be interpreted in terms of the activation energies of the various rate processes associated with triplet production and inactivation. The activation energies from delayed fluorescence intensities and half-lives (5. 9 and 2. 6 kcal/mole respectively for FMN) add to a value close to the energy separating the spectroscopic fluorescence and phosphorescence maxima. A kinetic scheme is proposed to account for this. The activation energy for non-radiative decay of the triplet to the ground state can be calculated from the temperature dependence of phosphorescence, and values of about 100 cal/mole are found. Photochemical reactions of the flavin triplet both in the presence and absence of oxygen have been studied. Anaerobically flavins photo-oxidise many amino acids and amines in their high pH forms, with production of dihydroflavin. When DL-phenylglycine is the reducing agent equimolar amounts of benzaldehyde, carbon dioxide and dihydroflavin are produced. The dependence of reaction rate on reducing agent concentration shows saturation behaviour at high concentrations, which is consistent with a steady state kinetic treatment for the reaction. The sensitivity of rates to substituents in the DL-phenylglycine can be described by a Hammett andrho;-value of andminus; 1. 1. On the basis of their photo reactivities towards a series of flavin derivatives it is suggested that DL-phenylglycine and benzylamine react with a similar rate determining step (probably hydrogen abstraction). This is different from the photoaddition of phenylacetate. Anaerobic photoreductions are quenched by some aromatic compounds. From the effects of temperature and by comparison with quenching by potassium iodide it is concluded that inhibition is not simply a collisional process. FAD reacts more slowly in photo seduction than FMN, but in concentrated urea solutions the difference is reduced. Inhibition by aromatic compounds is also reduced under these conditions. This surges to that the forces between flavin triplet and quencher are at least partially hydrophobic. Aerobic flavin photochemistry is followed by measuring oxygen uptake. Two general types of behaviour are found for oxygen concentrations from 2 andmu;M upwards. Either the reaction rate increases as oxygen is consumed (type I) or it falls (type II). The type I reaction pathway is slow photoreduction followed by rapid reoxidation of dihydroflavin. Evidence for this comes from the dependence of reaction rate on oxygen concentration and pH, and from the Hammett andrho;-value for substituted phenylglycines which {{is similar to that of}} anaerobic photoreduction. Oxygen is also a triplet quencher. Rate constants for the reduction and quenching of FMN triplets by EDTA, diethanolamine and DL-phenylglycine (all type I substrates) are deduced from the dependence of reaction rates on oxygen concentration. In each case quenching is over 10 times as efficient as reaction. The rate constants for all three substrates are similar, increasing in the order DL-phenylglycine andlt; EDTA andlt; diethanolamine. The values for EDTA are 1. 38 andsdot; 10 7 M andminus; 1 sec andminus; 1 for reaction and 1. 6 andsdot; 10 8 M andminus; 1 sec andminus; 1 for quenching. These rate constants can be used to predict a concentration dependence of anaerobic photoreduction which agrees well with experiment. The most likely mechanism for quenching is a rapidly reversed electron transfer. Whereas type I substrates are reducing agents for flavin triplets, type II substrates are typically aromatic molecules which quench anaerobic photoreduction. Tryptophan, for example, has type II kinetics and reacts by a complex mechanism in which product inhibition of reaction occurs. The potential of flavin photosensitized destruction of amino acids as a method for selective chemical modification of proteins is investigated. Tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, methionine, cysteine and phenylalanine all react but none of them has the same pH-profile of reactivity. Preliminary experiments on two proteins, L-glutamate dehydrogenase and D-amino acid oxidase show that the method has promise. An investigation of the behaviour of flavins when they act as Hill oxidants with isolated spinach chloroplasts has also been made. In this reaction light is absorbed t-y the chloroplast and flavin reacts in its ground state. The rates of reduction of 10 derivatives have been compared. The order of reactivity la different from that found for some model systems; dark reduction by NADH or dihydrolipoic acid, the redox potentials, and -photo re duct ion by DL-phenylglycine. The rates are independent of flavin concentration, but vary with the concentration of chloroplasts and light intensity. It is suggested that the reactivity to reduction by chloroplasts depends on binding between chloroplasts and flavin as well as on the electronic character of the flavin. The partition coefficients of flavins between water and butan- 1 -ol lend some support to this hypothesis. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We have {{previously}} investigated foams with monodispersed bubbles using a <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> scattering technique. The liquid fraction and the bubble size distribution {{were found to}} influence scattering properties of <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> and correlate with the Mueller matrix elements. This paper focused on {{an investigation of the}} Mueller matrix of a bidispersed foam. Comparisons were made between the results of bidispersed foam and monodispersed foam...|$|R
