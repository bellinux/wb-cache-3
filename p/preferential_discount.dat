40|$|Although {{rational}} consumers without bequest {{motives are}} better off investing exclusively with annuitized instruments in partial equilibrium, we demonstrate the welfare effect of annuitization is ambiguous in general equilibrium on account of pecuniary externalities. Absent institutional constraints like prices and budgets, the optimal consumption rule would have marginal utility increase at the <b>preferential</b> <b>discount</b> rate. In a rational competitive equilibrium where households fully annuitize, {{the growth rate of}} marginal utility will be the discount rate minus the interest rate, resulting in a consumption profile that is too flat. Accidental bequests transfer wealth from the old to the young, steepening the consumption profile and yielding a better equilibrium. If households are restricted to Keynesian consumption functions, the optimal irrational equilibrium with standard preferences can replicate observed consumption and macroeconomic behavior, and the equilibrium without annuities delivers higher utility than the equilibrium with annuities. Whereas preceding papers have merely hypothesized that households might engage in socially optimal, yet irrational behavior, the failure of households to annuitize is a real-world example of this. Policymakers should not take steps to encourage more annuitization by the public...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the economic basis {{for what is}} termed "rational discounting," which entails full recognition of policy effects over time and exponential discounting at a riskless rate of return. Policies often cannot be ranked unambiguously {{in terms of their}} present or future orientation. Both failure to <b>discount</b> and <b>preferential</b> intergenerational <b>discounting</b> generate inconsistencies and economic anomalies. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) discounting guidelines now stipulate more reasonable discount rates than earlier guidelines, but err in permitting open-ended preferential rates for intergenerational effects. This Article presents a methodology for monetizing the value of statistical life for people of different ages and at different points in time. Review of regulatory analyses indicates increased consistency of discounting practices. However, an examination of two policies with intergenerational effects, stratospheric ozone regulation and nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain, reveals failures to adopt a rational discounting approach. The influence of behavioral anomalies such as hyperbolic discounting may make full recognition of intertemporal effects in benefit-cost analysis more consequential than the use ofpreferential discount rate...|$|R
30|$|The targetâ€™s {{location}} probability {{not only}} enhanced search RT, but also induced {{a tendency to}} direct the first saccade toward the high-probability quadrant. Consistent with RT, the first-saccade bias acquired in the discrimination task did not transfer to the detection task. However, the saccade preference acquired in the detection task only gradually declined when the task changed to discrimination. This latter finding was not accompanied by an RT advantage. This discrepancy suggests that a habit involving saccades is harder to correct than the covert search habit indexed by RT. The lack of an RT advantage suggests that information gathered from the <b>preferential</b> saccades is <b>discounted</b> at a later level; hence, there was no RT advantage even though eye movements showed a residual preference toward the previously high-probability quadrant.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of my {{dissertation}} was {{to evaluate}} {{the development of the}} individual income tax. To compare single years and to show, what the differences between them are. There are always changes in the individual income tax. The aim of these changes is to improve the individual income tax so {{that it would be better}} for the taxpayer. The basic changes in the individual income tax are tax <b>discounts,</b> <b>preferential</b> tax for a child and common taxation for married couples. I analysed single assessment bases and compared them in the years 1997 - 2007. With the paid employment income, I gave an example of the development of the tax when the gross pay was 10 000, 15 000 and 20 000,-crowns. With the enterprise income, I gave an example of the minimal assessment base and of lump-sum expenses. With the hire income, I gave an example of the yearly income of 165 000 and 220 000,-crowns. The individual income tax is always decreasing for the taxpayers, every year people pay less the individual income tax...|$|R
