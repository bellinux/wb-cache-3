40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Currently, feeding the ICU patient is highly discussed. Energy feeding {{has been the}} topic of {{randomized}} studies, but <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> has not. Study results are contradictory on early feeding; however, {{little is known about}} early protein requirement. What is this protein requirement based on, therefore what are the fundamental determinants? Recent findings Recent studies have addressed the importance of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> and/or muscle (<b>protein)</b> wasting in critically ill patients. Targeted feeding has been shown to improve protein balance in one study, and infection rate in one study. Low muscle mass that is already present during ICU admission {{has been shown to be}} related to higher mortality, in two studies. Four studies have related muscle wasting to (<b>protein)</b> <b>feeding</b> strategies with very diverse results: Two small studies have reported no advantage [nâ€Š=â€Š 15, computed tomography] or negative impact (nâ€Š=â€Š 62, ultrasound, 50 % sepsis patients) of protein on muscle wasting. Two studies, one small (nâ€Š=â€Š 33, computed tomography) and one very large (nâ€Š=â€Š 1372, Subjective Global Assessment), have reported a positive impact of (early) feeding on muscle wasting. Summary Fundamental to adequate <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> in critically ill patients, at least 1. 2 â€Šg protein/kg per day, is targeted energy feeding using indirect calorimetry. The level of protein requirement is related to fat free mass or muscle mass, which makes sex and BMI also relevant. Targeted early <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> is found to improve short-term outcome, reduction of muscle wasting and hospital mortality. Long-term outcome of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> has not been studied. However, targeted <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> may be harmful in sepsis patients. Up to now, we lack biomarkers that provide caregivers with an instrument to increase <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> up to the individual protein requirement of the critically ill patient.

40|$|ABSTRACT Four egg-type pullet feeding {{systems were}} {{compared}} {{for the production}} of egg-type pullets. The dietary regimens consisted of either a step-down <b>protein,</b> high energy <b>feeding</b> program; a step-down protein, low energy program; a step-up protein, high energy program; or a step-up protein, low energy program. At 150 days of age all pullets were housed 2 birds per 25. 4 X 45. 7 cm laying cage and fed a standard layer diet (16 % protein). The experiment utilized 2880 birds grown on the floor in a conventional growing house. At 140 days of age, birds subjected to the step-up <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> programs were 82 g smaller in mean body weight, had higher mortality, and consumed less feed than the birds on the step-down <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> programs. Body weights at 140 days of age were 1. 17 and 1. 09 kg for the step-down and step-up feeding programs, respectively. Energy levels fed had no significant effect on pullet weight, feed consumed, or mortality to 140 days of age. During the laying phase, hens that had been on the step-down <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> program reached 50 % production 2. 0 days earlier than birds subjected to the step-up <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> program. Hen-day production for the step-down and step-up pullet feeding systems based on 308 days' records was 76. 09 and 76. 86 %, respectively. Feed efficiency and mature body weight were not significantly affected by grower feeding programs. The largest egg size and highest laying house mortality were noted in hens grown on the step-down <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> program...|$|R

40|$|The {{anabolic}} {{response of}} muscle to resistance exercise and <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> {{is influenced by}} multiple factors, including the timing of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding.</b> A common perception is that a 45 - 60 min post-exercise ‘anabolic window of opportunity' time frame exists, within which dietary protein must be consumed to achieve muscle anabolism (and ultimately muscle growth). In this review, we argue the importance of <b>feeding</b> <b>protein</b> immediately following exercise is not as critical as has been espoused. Indeed, muscle remains responsive to protein ingestion for at least 24 h post-exercise. On the other hand, given that <b>feeding</b> <b>protein</b> immediately post-exercise is unlikely to impair the muscle anabolic response, and could improve it, from a practical standpoint, we recommend athletes and exercisers consume some protein, as a meal or supplement, in the immediate period following resistance exercise...|$|R

40|$|Associations between <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> and {{reproductive}} efficiency in the dairy cow are reviewed. Examination of published {{data indicated that}} reproductive responses assessed as days open, services per conception or conception rate following changes in <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> tend to be inconsistent. Discrepancies can arise due to between-study variations in experimental design, statistical analysis, sample population size, uterine health, cow age, parity, reproductive management or nutrient intake. Detri-mental effects on reproductive efficiency following periods of excessive <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> are often attributed to increases in tissue urea and ammonia oncentrations leading to impaired reproductive hysiology, modified endocrine function or exacerbated postpartum negative energy balance. Examination of data collected from Finnish dairy herds (n = 16 051) participating in the national milk recording scheme during 1993 indicated that milk production was maximised in herds fed diets containing 180 g crude protein/kg dry matter. In contrast, no consistent relationships were identified between increases in on-farm <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> necessary to secure higher milk production and herd reproductive efficiency assessed as calving interval, first service interval and number of inseminations per calving. Further examination of data derived from 5 437 herds within the National recording scheme indicated that on-farm reproductive efficiency was independent of large variations in the mean annual urea concentration of bulk tank milk. It is concluded that increases in the crude protein content of Finnish dairy cow rations from 150 to between 170 and 180 g/kg dry matter would allow improvements in milk production to be realised without leading to significant reductions in reproductive efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{there is}} no clear {{consensus}} as to whether <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> harnesses any ergogenic benefit for endurance athletes. In this thesis demonstrate no effect of protein on endurance performance. Furthermore, data presented herein indicates that protein co-ingestion does not enhance recovery 24 hours after exercise. Consequently, there is currently no basis on which to recommend <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> for endurance performance and recovery. Nutrient strategies implemented after exercise can markedly alter the acute response of muscle protein synthesis and, potentially, long-term phenotypic adaptation. Protein nutrition has traditionally been considered in the context of resistance exercise. Endurance exercise followed by protein ingestion increases the synthesis of mixed muscle protein via increased mRNA translation. Herein, we demonstrate that <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> after endurance exercise elevates the synthetic rate of contractile proteins and specific mRNA signalling intermediates. Insulin resistance that precedes Type II diabetes is characterized by blunted sensitivity of the pancreas to glucose and impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Lifestyle interventions including nutrient and exercise have the potential to improve glycemic control. The final experimental chapter in this thesis provides mechanistic evidence to support the benefits of resistance exercise for lowering post-prandial glucose concentrations. Interestingly, protein ingestion did not augment the glucose-lowering effects of prior resistance exercise. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Both males and females showed increased attraction as they aged and matured. Flies with continuous access to protein were least attracted. Whereas males tended to approach cue-lure traps in the morning, females tended to respond at dusk. This sex difference is consistent with the possibility that cue-lure resembles natural chemicals on which males feed and use as precursors for sex pheromones. The implications of these results for Q-fly reproductive behavior and management will be discussed. 1 page(s...|$|R

Global beef, pig and chicken production and per capita consumption increased between 2000 and 2010, with growth in broiler production and consumption outpacing both beef and swine. The increased production and consumption requires readily available feed ingredients in regions where animal production is rapidly developing. Animal-based <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> ingredients are often difficult to move from country to country due to real or perceived risk of animal disease.

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> for maximising the anabolic effect of resistance exercise is well established. Ingestion of amino acids or intact protein sources {{with and without}} carbohydrate during exercise recovery further stimulates muscle protein synthesis. Less clear {{is the impact of}} an acute bout of resistance exercise on the protein synthetic rate of muscle already stimulated by food intake. This thesis demonstrates that an acute bout of resistance exercise further augments the protein synthetic rate of muscle already stimulated by food intake. Simulating everyday practice, whereby resistance exercise is typically performed in the fed state, an exercise-induced elevation in muscle protein synthesis was accompanied by an increased phosphorylation status of signaling proteins downstream of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Recent studies advocate the potential role for <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> in improving subsequent performance following acute bouts of fatiguing endurance-type exercise. However, previous studies have focussed upon carbohydrate nutrition, rather than examining the role of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> for exercise recovery {{in the context of an}} intense period of endurance training. Increasing dietary protein intake partially countered the blunted minimal mobilisation of antiviral lymphocytes during exercise following intensified training. In addition, the number of negative symptoms of psychological stress experienced following intensified training was attenuated with additional dietary protein intake. The mechanism(s) underpinning the suggestion that a high protein diet may potentiate a better maintainence of endurance performance following intensified training could not be definitively elucidated from our experimental design. The most likely explanation appears to be related to psychological status. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The feeds (heat treated and untreated as a control) were incubated in vitro as components in complete diets for dairy cows utilising the method uCP. All diets were isonitrogenous with concentrations of 18 % crude protein (CP) on dry matter (DM) basis. The diets consisted of grass silage (50 % of DM) and varying proportions of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and <b>protein</b> <b>feeds</b> depending on the CP concentrations. The complete diets were incubated in buffered rumen fluid and the concentration uCP was calculated based on ammonia nitrogen measurements at different intervals in the liquid of the in vitro vessels. The gas productions during the fermentation in vitro were continuously recorded by an automatic system. The two methods for heat treatments, autoclaving with steam and dry oven-heating at medium and high levels were effective methods to increase the uCP concentrations. However, low heating temperatures decreased uCP concentrations for the pea diets and had no significant effect for the diets with lupines. Short exposure time (30 min) at the highest temperature in the autoclave increased uCP concentrations for the diets with field beans by 31 %, lupines by 10 % and peas by 7 %, whereas the same time in the dry oven treatment decreased uCP concentrations by 10 %, 14. % and 12 %, respectively. Increasing the heat exposure time from 60 to 90 minutes at the highest treatment levels did not have any improving effects, except for the diets with the oven-treated peas. However at medium temperatures there was significant increase of the uCP concentrations for all evaluated diets.
