25|$|Activated carbon is {{used for}} {{adsorption}} of organic substances and non-polar adsorbates {{and it is also}} usually used for waste gas (and waste water) treatment. It is the most widely used adsorbent since most of its chemical (e.g. surface groups) and physical properties (e.g. <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> and surface area) can be tuned according to what is needed. Its usefulness also derives from its large micropore (and sometimes mesopore) volume and the resulting high surface area.|$|E
25|$|Another use {{for nuclear}} {{magnetic}} resonance is data acquisition in the petroleum industry for petroleum and natural gas exploration and recovery. Initial research in this domain began in the 1950s, however, the first commercial instruments were not released until the early 1990s. A borehole is drilled into rock and sedimentary strata into which {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} logging equipment is lowered. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of these boreholes is used to measure rock porosity, estimate permeability from <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> and identify pore fluids (water, oil and gas).

Compared to traditional porosimeters, Ellipsometer porosimeters are well suited to very thin film pore size and <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> measurement.

The strong contrast in refractive index between pores and solid parts of sintered alumina results in very strong scattering, with light completely changing direction each 5 micrometers on average.

2500|$|Carbon-based {{electrodes}} exhibit predominantly static double-layer capacitance, {{even though}} {{a small amount of}} pseudocapacitance may also be present depending on the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> Pore sizes in carbons typically range from micropores (less than 2nm) to mesopores (2-50nm), but only micropores (<2nbsp&nm) contribute to pseudocapacitance. As pore size approaches the solvation shell size, solvent molecules are excluded and only unsolvated ions fill the pores (even for large ions), increasing ionic packing density and storage capability by faradaic [...] intercalation.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, if the {{elasticity}} is {{inferred from}} the {{measurements of the}} scattering intensity, and the viscosity is determined independently (via mechanical methods such as ultrasonic attenuation) measurement of the relaxation rate yields information on the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> contained within the polymer network, e.g. large fluctuations in polymer density near the critical point yield large density differentials with a corresponding bimodal distribution of porosity. The difference in average size between the smaller pores (in the highly dense regions) and the larger pores (in regions of lower average density) will therefore depend upon the degree of phase separation which is allowed to occur before such fluctuations become thermally arrested or [...] "frozen in" [...] {{at or near the}} critical point of the transition.|$|E

Two pairs of soil samples were collected in plots with different topographic position and soil use, with each pair differentiated by distinct proportion of fine particles and organic matter contents. Macropore volume was higher on samples with higher clay and organic matter content. Mass exponent function, singularity spectra and generalized dimension spectra showed that multifractal distribution was a suitable model for mercury injection curves. Multifractal parameters extracted from singularity spectra and generalized dimension spectra reflected the main characteristics of the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> (PSDs).

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{number of}} {{investigators}} have proposed equations {{to predict the}} permeability of porous media. Most of their equations {{are based on the}} <b>distributions</b> of the <b>sizes</b> of the various contributing pores in the medium. Presently the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> of agricultural soils are most commonly obtained from soil water release curves. The pressure scale is converted into an equivalent pore diameter scale by means of the pressure of displacement equation. This method is time consuming. The study reported in this thesis was initiated to (1) use a mercury intrusion method to obtain <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> of porous materials similar to agricultural soils, (2) use the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> thus obtained with existing equations to calculate intrinsic permeability and (3) compare the calculated permeability values with measured values for a range of particle <b>size</b> <b>distributions.</b> The permeabilities and the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> of 54 systematically selected particle size classes of glass beads and crushed quartz sand were measured. The particle size classes ranged from 44 to 246 microns in diameter. The <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> were evaluated and used in Marshall's proposed permeability prediction equation. The measured permeabilities did not agree with the calculated values until a correction factor which {{is a function of the}} pore diameter was used. It is apparent that the pressure of displacement equation measures only an effective pore dimension. Permeability prediction equations require the evaluation of an effective hydraulic dimension. These two dimensions are different and are influenced by the geometry of the pore aperture. A necessary correction factor has been developed which accounts for the difference between the measured and hydraulic dimension when the mercury intrusion technique is used to measure <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions.</b> The results of this study have improved and given a better theoretical basis for permeability predictions equations...|$|R

2500|$|Activated carbon can be {{manufactured}} from carbonaceous material, including coal (bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite), peat, wood, or nutshells (e.g., coconut). The manufacturing process {{consists of two}} phases, carbonization and activation. The carbonization process includes drying and then heating to separate by-products, including tars and other hydrocarbons from the raw material, {{as well as to}} drive off any gases generated. The process is completed by heating the material over [...] in an oxygen-free atmosphere that cannot support combustion. The carbonized particles are then [...] "activated" [...] by exposing them to an oxidizing agent, usually steam or carbon dioxide at high temperature. This agent burns off the pore blocking structures created during the carbonization phase and so, they develop a porous, three-dimensional graphite lattice structure. The size of the pores developed during activation {{is a function of the}} time that they spend in this stage. Longer exposure times result in larger pore sizes. The most popular aqueous phase carbons are bituminous based because of their hardness, abrasion resistance, <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution,</b> and low cost, but their effectiveness needs to be tested in each application to determine the optimal product.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{determine}} the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas adsorption, mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent {{on the size of the}} pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its saturation pressure. [...] The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula (BET), which gives the specific surface area of the sample. [...] At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of the sample. [...] In mercury porosimetry, the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force. [...] The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample. [...] The sample can be solid particles or pores. [...] The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network. [...] The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons. [...] Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores. The high porosity and surface area of silica aerogels allow them to be used in a variety of environmental filtration applications.|$|E
