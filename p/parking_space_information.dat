40|$|Urban street-parking {{availability}} {{statistics are}} challenging to obtain in real-time but would greatly benefit society by reducing traffic congestion. In this paper we present the design, implementation {{and evaluation of}} ParkNet, a mobile system comprising vehicles that collect <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> occupancy <b>information</b> while driving by. Each ParkNet vehicle {{is equipped with a}} GPS receiver and a passenger-side-facing ultrasonic rangefinder to determine parking spot occupancy. The data is aggregated at a central server, which builds a real-time map of parking availability and could provide this information to clients that query the system in search of parking. Creating a spot-accurate map of parking availability challenges GPS location accuracy limits. To address this need, we have devised an environmental fingerprinting approach to achieve improved location accuracy. Based on 500 miles of road-side parking data collected over 2 months, we found that parking spot counts are 95 % accurate and occupancy maps can achieve over 90 % accuracy. Finally, we quantify the amount of sensors needed to provide adequate coverage in a city. Using extensive GPS traces from over 500 San Francisco taxicabs, we show that if ParkNet were deployed in city taxicabs, the resulting mobile sensors would provide adequate coverage and be more cost-effective by an estimated factor of roughly 10 - 15 when compared to a sensor network with a dedicated sensor at every <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> as is currently being tested in San Francisco...|$|R
40|$|VANET {{applications}} are often providing street traffic information to vehicles and drivers, regarding, for instance, traffic conditions and <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> availability. This <b>information</b> influences in turn the driving behavior in real-world settings. Mobility models used in current VANET simulations are mostly ignoring this feedback entirely. In cases the feedback is included, {{it is mainly based}} on ad-hoc approaches with lack of generality. With this paper, we {{contribute to the}} investigation of such feedback loops within VANETs by describing the levels at which feedback loops can be introduced, i. e., on strategic, tactical, and operational levels of mobility. We further describe how feedback loops can be introduced in arbitrary mobility models and in particular in elementary mobility models. We exemplify our approach by introducing two types of feedback loops for the Manhattan Mobility model, the Random Trip model, and the Constrained Random Trip model. One feedback loop represents points of interest attracting vehicles, such as free <b>parking</b> <b>spaces</b> attracting vehicles searching for parking. The other feedback loop focuses on repelling vehicles, such as a traffic jam. We discuss the impacts of the feedback in terms of the mobility metrics: vehicle density per area, number of direction changes, and intensity of direction changes. Furthermore, we discuss the effects in terms of information availability and delays of transmission in an opportunistic vehicular network. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{planning}} {{is responsible for}} the arrangement of environments that we are living in {{as well as for the}} design of urban parks that allow us to escape from everyday stressors. However, we no longer live in culturally homogenous societies, and people of different backgrounds seem to have different perspectives on urban park aesthetics as well as the range of facilities and features that parks should provide. This study focuses on preferences and perspectives that people of different cultural backgrounds have of urban parks. This research was based on a single-case study of a multi-functional park – Waterloo Park, located in Kitchener-Waterloo (Ontario, Canada), and was focused on investigating urban park preferences of seven ethnic groups: Caucasian Canadians, East and North Asians, South Asians, Middle- Eastern, Arabic, African/Caribbean and African/Zimbabwean or Kenyan. The feedback obtained from face-to-face interviews with Waterloo-Park users have been analyzed in order to establish how do people of different cultural backgrounds conceptualize urban parks and what their breadth of needs are when utilizing <b>park</b> <b>space.</b> Demographic <b>information,</b> such as ethnic association, was obtained from the participants on a self-descriptive basis. Findings from this study indicates that there are apparent differences in expectations and needs that culturally diverse users have regarding urban parks, and provides substantial evidence that culture plays an influential role in perception and evaluation of urban parks. Recommendations for professional practice advocate shifting Canadian design practices towards a true comprehensive and multifunctional park design and incorporating the various motives and needs of a culturally diverse Canadian society...|$|R

This study examined the socioeconomic status of urban residents who live within one-mile distance to a public park {{in the city of}} Atlanta. Park accessibility was investigated with respect to distances to parks and park acreage using Euclidean distance and street-network distance. Socioeconomic status was examined using five variables: population density, median household income, percentage of population living below poverty, percentage of minority population and percentage of female population. A site suitability analysis was conducted to determine where additional <b>park</b> <b>space</b> could be most beneficial for the populations lacking access to the benefits of <b>park</b> <b>space.</b> Using Geographic <b>Information</b> Systems to analyze socioeconomic data from U.

40|$|<b>Parking</b> <b>space</b> is a {{basic and}} {{important}} public facility in urban areas. Problems of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> {{are said to be}} always occuring in urban areas, especially in the city centre or busy commercial and services zones. In Malaysia, the common parking system adopted is shared-parking turn-time system, whereby members of the public share limited <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the city centre and have to take turns to keep their vehicle temporarily in parking lots. City centres are said to be suffering from insufficient <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> forcing people to park their vehicles on road shoulders or outside the gazetted parking lots. This causes traffic congestion and arouses question of sufficiency of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in such areas. The basic task in addressing this issue is by carrying out supply and demand analysis of <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} apply a spatial technique using the Geographic Information System (CIS) in modelling the supply and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> taking Johor Bahru city centre as a study case. Maps of buildings, land cadastre, urban land use, and others such as road and street networks are digitally constructed to form a spatial database of supply and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the study area. Attribute data on building inventory, building characteristics, land use, space supply, and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> are obtained from the Johor Bahru City Council, private parking companies operating in the city, observational, as well as interview surveys in the study area. The shared-parking turn-time model - the "SpaTT model" - is developed to analyse spatial distribution of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> supply and demand in the study area. The "SpaTT model" is then incorporated into Arc View 3. 1 to determine <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> equilibrium across the study area. This, in turn, is used to determine zones with <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> deficit and, thus, which need additional parking lots. The study discloses that there is reasonable level of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> equilibrium in the study area. In other words, there is no evidence of acute supply problem of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the Johor Bahru city centre as perceived, although there are zones where additional on-street parking could be provided to add parking supply...|$|R
