5|$|In 1959, Varian and {{her mother}} Wenonah {{purchased}} a two-year-old bay stallion named Bay-Abi (Errabi × Angyl). Trained and shown by Varian, he was the judges' unanimous choice for U.S. National Champion Arabian Stallion in 1962, later won U.S. National Top Ten awards in both Arabian English <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> Western <b>pleasure,</b> <b>and</b> thereafter was awarded the Legion of Merit. Even though he was not bred to any mares until after he was fully trained, and thus his first foals did {{not appear in the}} show ring until he was 7, he sired 275registered Arabians, including 65 champions and 24 national winners.|$|E

5|$|Arabians are {{versatile}} {{horses that}} compete in many equestrian fields, including horse racing, the horse show disciplines of saddle seat, Western <b>pleasure,</b> <b>and</b> hunt seat, {{as well as}} dressage, cutting, reining, endurance riding, show jumping, eventing, youth events such as equitation, and others. They are used as pleasure riding, trail riding, and working ranch horses {{for those who are}} not interested in competition.|$|E

5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and <b>Pleasure,</b> <b>and</b> considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E

2500|$|Bentham {{stated that}} <b>pleasures</b> <b>and</b> pains can be ranked {{according}} to their value or [...] "dimension" [...] such as intensity, duration, certainty of a pleasure or a pain. He was concerned with maxima <b>and</b> minima of <b>pleasures</b> <b>and</b> pains; and they set a precedent for the future employment of the maximisation principle in {{the economics of the}} consumer, the firm and the search for an optimum in welfare economics.|$|R
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white {{baby in her arms}} and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E
5|$|Fielding {{started work}} on his fourth play, The Temple Beau, in April 1729, but did not finish {{until the end of}} the year. Rejected by his first theatre, the play had to be {{performed}} at another one, where it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek <b>pleasure,</b> <b>and</b> his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on hypocrisy and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.|$|E
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
5|$|Swaminarayan's philosophical, {{social and}} {{practical}} teachings {{are contained in}} the Vachanamrut, a collection of dialogues recorded by five prominent saints (Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Nityanand Swami, Shukanand Muni, & Brahmanand Swami) from his spoken words. The Vachanamrut is the scripture most commonly used in the Swaminarayan sect. It contains views on dharma (moral conduct), jnana (understanding {{of the nature of}} the self), vairagya (detachment from material <b>pleasure),</b> <b>and</b> bhakti (pure, selfless devotion to God), the four essentials Hindu scriptures describe as necessary for a jiva (soul) to attain moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse {{developed}} from small gaited pinto ponies of Spanish ancestry. These were crossed with larger American breeds {{such as the}} Morgan and Standardbred, developed after the American Revolution, to increase size while retaining coloration and the desired gait. After the American Civil War, additional gaited blood was added, with contributing breeds including the Tennessee Walking Horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Paso Fino and Peruvian Paso. Mustangs from the American West were also incorporated. Originally developed in central Tennessee, and selectively bred for pinto coloration, they were used for general <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> trail riding.|$|E

5|$|The, Tennessee Walking Horse or Tennessee Walker is a {{breed of}} gaited horse {{known for its}} unique four-beat running-walk and flashy movement. It was {{originally}} developed in the southern United States for use on farms and plantations. It is a popular riding horse due to its calm disposition, smooth gaits and sure-footedness. The Tennessee Walking Horse is often seen in the show ring, but is also popular as a <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> trail riding horse using both English and Western equipment. Tennessee Walkers are also seen in movies, television shows and other performances.|$|E
5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> pain, good and evil, and point to a way of transcending them.|$|E
