Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary <b>policies</b> <b>to</b> mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions.

5|$|New Jersey and {{all other}} U.S. states comport with the {{requirement}} of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which sought to set a national standard of 21 as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages.

Federal law requires colleges and universities that accept federal financial aid institute <b>policies</b> <b>to</b> sanction students who violate underage drinking and other alcohol laws, and to track the number of liquor laws violations. The Chronicle of Higher Education has reported that many colleges fail to comply with these laws, and federal enforcement is minimal.|$|E

The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different <b>policies</b> <b>to</b> each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E
