5|$|As the {{national}} dish of Cornwall, several oversized {{versions of the}} <b>pasty</b> have been created in the county. For example, a giant <b>pasty</b> is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week. Similarly, a giant <b>pasty</b> is paraded around the ground of the Cornish Pirates rugby team on St Piran's Day before it is passed over the goal posts.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a <b>pasty</b> tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison <b>pasty.</b> This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the <b>pasty</b> was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included the price of the <b>pasty</b> in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term <b>pasty</b> appears in much earlier written records {{from other parts of the}} country, as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In some areas, pasties are a {{significant}} tourist attraction, including an annual <b>Pasty</b> Fest in Calumet, Michigan in late June. Pasties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have a particularly unusual history. Many ethnic groups adopted the <b>pasty</b> {{for use in the}} Copper Country copper mines; the Finnish immigrants to the region mistook it for the traditional piiraat and kuuko pastries. The <b>pasty</b> has become strongly associated with all cultures in this area, and in the similar Iron Range in northern Minnesota.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{women wear}} <b>pasties</b> when wearing a strapless or backless dress. Some women {{who choose to}} be braless may at times wear <b>pasties.</b> They may wear <b>pasties</b> so that their nipples and areolae are not visible through sheer {{clothing}} [...] or lingerie, or in case they experience a nipple erection. Some women wear <b>pasties</b> to avoid irritation of the nipples by rubbing against {{the fabric of the}} outer garment. When worn under clothing <b>pasties</b> are sometimes called breast petals or nipple covers.|$|R
50|$|A sideless bikini {{bottom is}} {{sometimes}} worn to complement a <b>pasties</b> top outfit, {{this can be}} a C-string held by an internal flexible frame or other <b>pasties</b> sustained with adhesive, commonly known as a merkin. These <b>pasties</b> for the genitalia are known as maebari in Japanese.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pasties</b> come in {{a variety}} of colors, diameters, and shapes. Though <b>pasties</b> {{come in a}} variety of sizes, they usually are not much larger than the areola. <b>Pasties</b> are usually applied with a special tape or glue fixative, often gum arabic. However, in some {{situations}} keeping <b>pasties</b> from falling off can be an issue, as can be their removal. Some women are allergic to some adhesives or pastie material. Due to this, most high quality nipples are made of hypoallergenic silicone and use special adhesives to reduce the chances of an allergic reaction. Some <b>pasties</b> are for single-use, while others are washable and can be reused.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>pasty</b> are unclear, though there are many {{references}} to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The <b>pasty</b> is now popular worldwide due {{to the spread of}} Cornish miners, and variations can be found in Australia, the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Ulster and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} Cornish <b>pasty,</b> which since 2011 has Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) {{status in}} Europe, {{is filled with}} beef, sliced or diced potato, swede (also known as yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and is baked. Today, the <b>pasty</b> is the food most associated with Cornwall. It {{is regarded as the}} national dish and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made and some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties.|$|E
5|$|Michael Ball, a Cornish-born {{businessman}} who is {{chief executive of}} WMC Retail Partners, Oxfordshire, is planning to establish a Cornish <b>pasty</b> museum at Cornish Market World near St Austell. He hopes to collect pasty-making artifacts and memorabilia for the museum.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pasties</b> are {{sometimes}} worn by erotic dancers or burlesque entertainers to given {{the impression of}} toplessness while avoiding prosecution under local public indecency laws which prohibit exposure of the nipple and areola. To stay within the law, liquid latex <b>pasties</b> may be used. <b>Pasties</b> may be worn by neo-burlesque performers and are also found in night clubs, fetish parties and parades, such as Pride Parades.|$|R
50|$|In {{parts of}} the United States, erotic dancers wear <b>pasties</b> in strip clubs to avoid {{prosecution}} under local public indecency laws. In extreme cases, liquid latex <b>pasties</b> are used to comply with local laws, raising criticism by strippers that lawmakers are engaging in cruelty by requiring use of adhesive material on the nipple. <b>Pasties</b> are worn by many neo-burlesque performers and are also found in night clubs, fetish parties and parades, such as Pride Parades.|$|R
5|$|The Anthracite {{regions of}} northeastern Pennsylvania, {{including}} {{the cities of}} Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, and Hazleton, had an influx of miners to {{the area in the}} 1800s and brought the <b>pasty</b> with them. To this day, pasties are still a local favourite. In 1981, a Pennsylvania entrepreneur started marketing pasties under the brand name Mr. Pastie.|$|E
5|$|British dishes include {{fish and}} chips, the Sunday roast, and bangers and mash. British cuisine has several {{national}} and regional varieties, including English, Scottish and Welsh cuisine, {{each of which has}} developed its own regional or local dishes, many of which are geographically indicated foods such as Cheddar cheese, Cheshire cheese, the Yorkshire pudding, Arbroath Smokie, Cornish <b>pasty</b> and Welsh cakes.|$|E

A little larger than cocktail <b>pasties</b> common to the UK, the Mexican-made versions are widely varied including: meat and potato, black bean, shredded chicken, and sausage, all heavily laced with chillies plus a range of sweet <b>pasties</b> including: pineapple, apple, strawberry, and blackberry. A number have developed into national chains with shops in towns and cities across Mexico. The town of Real del Monte {{is the site of}} a museum of Cornish <b>pasties,</b> opened in 2011.|$|R
5|$|The Mexican {{state of}} Hidalgo, and the twin silver mining cities of Pachuca and Real del Monte (Mineral del Monte), have notable Cornish {{influences}} from the Cornish miners who settled there, with pasties being considered typical local cuisine. In Mexican Spanish, they {{are referred to}} as pastes. The town of Real del Monte in Mexico is the site of a museum of pasties. The annual International <b>Pasty</b> Festival is held in Real del Monte for three days each October.|$|E
5|$|The type of pastry used is not defined, {{as long as}} it {{is golden}} in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, {{although}} modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good <b>pasty</b> should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the <b>pasty</b> became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E

5|$|Members of the CPA {{made about}} 87 million pasties in 2008, amounting to sales of £60 million (about 6% {{of the food}} economy of Cornwall). In 2011, over 1,800 {{permanent}} staff were employed {{by members of the}} CPA and some 13,000 other jobs benefited from the trade. Surveys by the South West tourism board have shown that one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall is the food and that the Cornish <b>pasty</b> is the food most associated with Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a <b>pasty</b> soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the area}} around the Taman Sari castle complex is {{occupied}} by a settlement called Kampung Taman with 2,700 residents. The community is known for their batik and traditional painting craft traditions. Also located in this area is the Ngasem Traditional Market (Pasar Ngasem), which hosted the biggest bird market in Yogyakarta for a long time (until the bird market was relocated to <b>PASTY</b> on Jl. Bantul in 2010), and the Sokotunggal mosque, a unique mosque built in the early 20th century with a single pillar that is different from the usual Javanese traditional architecture.|$|E
5000|$|The Ginsters {{family were}} {{farmers in the}} small Cornish town of Callington. In 1967 they started buying in fresh pies and <b>pasties</b> to sell by van sales to various local retail outlets. After a while, founder {{and head of the}} company, Geoffrey Ginster saw the {{limitations}} of this trade and decided that the family itself should start manufacturing <b>pasties.</b> They started the business in a near-derelict egg-packing station, with a staff of four. [...] Geoffrey Ginster started production of <b>pasties</b> from a 'secret recipe' he claimed to have obtained from a ship's cook. Production slowly increased until by 1970 a staff of 30 was producing 48,000 units a day. Initially Ginsters <b>pasties</b> were sold to pubs, cafés, corner shops and other small stores in Plymouth and nearby seaside towns, before expanding further to cover southern England.|$|R

5|$|Traditional {{examples}} of English food include the Sunday roast, featuring a roasted joint (usually beef, lamb, chicken or pork) served with assorted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, and gravy. Other prominent meals include {{fish and chips}} and the full English breakfast (generally consisting of bacon, sausages, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, and eggs). Various meat pies are consumed such as steak and kidney pie, steak and ale pie, cottage pie, pork pie (the latter usually eaten cold) and the Cornish <b>Pasty.</b>|$|E
5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet <b>pasty</b> (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
