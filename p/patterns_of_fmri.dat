40|$|SummaryExperiences unfold over time, {{but little}} is known about the {{mechanisms}} that support the formation of coherent episodic memories for temporally extended events. Recent work in animals has provided evidence for signals in hippocampus that could link events across temporal gaps; however, it is unknown whether and how such signals might be related to later memory for temporal information in humans. We measured <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> BOLD activity as people encoded items that were separated in time and manipulated the presence of shared or distinct context across items. We found that hippocampal pattern similarity in the BOLD response across trials predicted later temporal memory decisions when context changed. By contrast, pattern similarity in lateral occipital cortex was related to memory only when context remained stable. These data provide evidence in humans that representational stability in hippocampus across time may be a mechanism for temporal memory organization...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{regions of}} the human occipito-temporal cortex are {{consistently}} activated in functional imaging studies of face processing. To understand the contribution of these regions to face processing, we examined the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activation in four congenital prosopagnosic (CP) individuals who are markedly impaired at face processing despite normal vision and intelligence, and with no evidence of brain damage. These individuals evinced a normal <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activation in the fusiform gyrus (FFA) and in other ventral occipito-temporal areas, in response to faces, buildings, and other objects, shown both as line drawings in detection and discrimination tasks and under more naturalistic testing conditions when no task was required. CP individuals also showed normal adaptation levels in a blockdesign adaptation experiment and, like control subjects, exhibited evidence of global face representation in the FFA. The absence of a BOLD–behavioral correlation (profound behavioral deficit, normal face-related activation in the ventral occipito- temporal cortex) challenges existing accounts of face representation, and suggests that activation in these cortical regions per se {{is not sufficient to}} ensure intact face processing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAre objects coded by a {{small number}} of neurons or {{cortical}} regions that respond preferentially to the object in question, or by more distributed <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> responses, including neurons or regions that respond only weakly? Distributed codes can represent a larger number of alternative items than sparse codes [1 - 3] but produce ambiguities when multiple items are represented simultaneously (the "superposition" problem) [1, 4]. Recent studies found category information in the distributed <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> response across the ventral visual pathway, including in regions that do not "prefer" the object in question [5 - 8]. However, these studies measured neural responses to isolated objects, a situation atypical of real-world vision, where multiple objects are usually present simultaneously ("clutter"). We report that information in the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> response about standard object categories is severely disrupted by clutter and eliminated when attention is diverted. However, information about preferred categories in category-specific regions is undiminished by clutter and partly preserved under diverted attention. These findings indicate that in natural conditions, the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> response provides robust category information only for objects coded in selective cortical regions and highlight the vulnerability of distributed representations to clutter [1, 2] and the advantages of sparse cortical codes in mitigating clutter costs...|$|R

Reports of reliable orientation-selective modulations in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity have demonstrated the potential for investigating the representation of orien-tation in the human visual cortex. Orientation-selective voxel responses could arise from anisotropies in the preferred orientations of pooled neurons due to the random sampling of the cortical surface. However, {{it is unclear whether}} orientation-selective voxel re-sponses reflect biases in the underlying distribution of neuronal orientation preference, such as the demonstrated over-representation of radial orientations (those collinear with fixation). Here, we investigated whether stimuli balanced in their radial components could evoke orientation-selective biases in voxel activity. We attempted to discriminate the sense <b>of</b> spiral Glass <b>patterns</b> (opening anti-clockwise or clockwise), in which the local orientation structure was defined by the placement of paired dots at an orientation offset from the radial. We found that information within the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> responses in each of V 1, V 2, V 3, and V 3 A/B allowed discrimination of the spiral sense with accuracies significantly above chance. This result demonstrates that orientation-selective voxel responses can arise without the influence of a radial bias.

40|$|How {{content is}} stored in the human brain during visual {{short-term}} memory (VSTM) is still an open question. Different theories postulate storage of remembered stimuli in prefrontal, parietal, or visual areas. Aiming at a distinction between these theories, we investigated the content-specificity of BOLD signals from various brain regions during a VSTM task using multivariate pattern classification. To participate in memory maintenance, candidate regions would need to have information about the different contents held in memory. We identified two brain regions where local <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> signals represented the remembered content. Apart from the previously established storage in visual areas, we also discovered an area in the posterior parietal cortex where activity patterns allowed us to decode the specific stimuli held in memory.

Thus, while frontal and parietal areas typically coactivate during VSTM, maintenance of content in the frontoparietal network might be limited to parietal cortex...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMulti-voxel pattern {{analysis}} (MVPA), or ‘decoding’, <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity has gained {{popularity in the}} neuroimaging community in recent years. MVPA differs from standard fMRI analyses by focusing on whether information relating to specific stimuli is encoded in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> activity across multiple voxels. If a stimulus can be predicted, or decoded, solely from the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity, it must mean there is information about that stimulus represented in the brain region where the pattern across voxels was identified. This ability to examine the representation of information relating to specific stimuli (e. g., memories) in particular brain areas makes MVPA an especially suitable method for investigating memory representations in brain structures such as the hippocampus. This approach could open up new opportunities to examine hippocampal representations {{in terms of their}} content, and how they might change over time, with aging, and pathology. Here we consider published MVPA studies that specifically focused on the hippocampus, and use them to illustrate the kinds of novel questions that can be addressed using MVPA. We then discuss some of the conceptual and methodological challenges that can arise when implementing MVPA in this context. Overall, we hope to highlight the potential utility of MVPA, when appropriately deployed, and provide some initial guidance to those considering MVPA as a means to investigate the hippocampus...|$|R

40|$|SummarySome {{everyday}} {{objects are}} associated with a particular color, such as bananas, which are typically yellow. Behavioral studies show that perception of these so-called color-diagnostic objects is influenced by our knowledge of their typical color, referred to as memory color [1, 2]. However, neural representations of memory colors are unknown. Here we investigated whether memory color can be decoded from visual cortex activity when color-diagnostic objects are viewed as grayscale images. We trained linear classifiers to distinguish <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> responses to four different hues. We found that activity in V 1 allowed predicting the memory color of color-diagnostic objects presented in grayscale in naive participants performing a motion task. The results imply that higher areas feed back memory-color signals to V 1. When classifiers were trained on neural responses to some exemplars of color-diagnostic objects and tested on others, areas V 4 and LOC also predicted memory colors. Representational similarity analysis showed that memory-color representations in V 1 were correlated specifically with patterns in V 4 but not LOC. Our findings suggest that prior knowledge is projected from midlevel visual regions onto primary visual cortex, consistent with predictive coding theory [3]...|$|E

To reach best performances, localizer experiments and on-site expert supervision are required for ROI definition. To automate this step, we developed two unsupervised computational techniques based on the general linear model (GLM) and independent component analysis (ICA) of rt-fMRI data, and compared their performances on a communication BCI.  Approach. 3 T fMRI data of six volunteers were re-analyzed in simulated real-time. During a localizer run, participants performed three mental tasks following visual cues. During two communication runs, a letter-spelling display guided the subjects to freely encode letters by performing one of the mental tasks with a specific timing. GLM- and ICA-based procedures were used to decode each letter, respectively using compact ROIs and whole-brain distributed spatio-temporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity, automatically defined from subject-specific or group-level maps. MAIN RESULTS: Letter-decoding performances were comparable to supervised methods. In combination with a similarity-based criterion, GLM- and ICA-based approaches successfully decoded more than 80 % (average) of the letters. Subject-specific maps yielded optimal performances.  Significance.

Integration through EEG-fMRI trial-by-trial coupling has been proposed as a method to combine the different data sets and achieve temporal expansion of the fMRI data (Eichele et al., 2005). To fully benefit of this type of analysis simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions are necessary (Debener et al., 2006).

We show that multivariate regression is a valuable approach for predicting evoked and induced oscillatory EEG responses from fMRI time series.

40|$|Conventional voxel-based group {{analysis}} of functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data typically requires warping each subject’s brain images onto a common template to create an assumed voxel correspondence.

Moreover, wholebrain warping is likely to distort the spatial <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> activation, which {{have been shown to be}} important markers of task-related activation. To reduce the amount of mis-registration and distortions, warping at the brain region level has recently been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the effects of both whole-brain and region-level warping on the spatial <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> activation statistics within certain regions of interests (ROIs). We have chosen to examine the bilateral thalami and cerebellar hemispheres during a bulb-squeezing experiment, as these regions are expected to incur taskrelated activation changes.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundRecent {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) decoding techniques allow us to predict the contents of sensory and motor events or participants’ mental states from multi-voxel <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> signals. Sparse logistic regression (SLR) is a useful pattern classification algorithm that has the advantage of being able to automatically select voxels to avoid over-fitting. However, SLR suffers from over-pruning, in which many voxels that are potentially useful for prediction are discarded. New methodWe propose an ensemble solution for over-pruning, called “Iterative Recycling” (iRec), in which sparse classifiers are trained iteratively by recycling over-pruned voxels. ResultsOur simulation demonstrates that iRec can effectively rectify over-pruning in SLR and improve its classification accuracy. We also conduct an fMRI experiment in which eight healthy volunteers perform a finger-tapping task with their index or middle fingers. The results indicate that SLR with iRec (iSLR) can predict the finger used more accurately than SLR. Further, iSLR is able to identify a voxel cluster representing the finger movements in the biologically plausible contralateral primary sensory-motor cortices in each participant. We also successfully dissociated the regularly arranged representation for each finger in the cluster. Conclusion and comparison with other methodsTo the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to propose a solution for over-pruning with ensemble-learning that is applicable to any sparse algorithm.

Rev. 10, 241 – 261) relates the inferior dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex to a retrieval buffer that holds information retrieved from memory and the posterior parietal cortex to an imaginal buffer that holds problem representations. Because the number of changes in a problem representation is not necessarily correlated with retrieval difficulties, {{it is possible to}} dissociate prefrontal–parietal activations. In two fMRI experiments, we examined this dissociation using the fan effect paradigm. Experiment 1 compared a recognition task, in which representation requirement remains the same regardless of retrieval difficulty, with a recall task, in which both representation and retrieval loads increase with retrieval difficulty. In the recognition task, the prefrontal activation revealed a fan effect but not the parietal activation. In the recall task, both regions revealed fan effects. In Experiment 2, we compared visually presented stimuli and aurally presented stimuli using the recognition task. While only the prefrontal region revealed the fan effect, the activation patterns in the prefrontal and the parietal region did not differ by stimulus presentation modality. In general, these results provide support for the prefrontal–parietal dissociation in terms of retrieval and representation and the modality-independent nature of the information processed by these regions. Using ACT-R, we also provide computational models that explain <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> responses in these two areas during recognition and recall...|$|E
40|$|Category {{information}} for visually presented objects {{can be read}} out from multi-voxel <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> activity in ventral–temporal cortex. What is the nature and reliability of these patterns {{in the absence of}} any bottom–up visual input, for example, during visual imagery? Here, we first ask how well category information can be decoded for imagined objects and then compare the representations evoked during imagery and actual viewing. In an fMRI study, four object categories (food, tools, faces, buildings) were either visually presented to subjects, or imagined by them. Using pattern classification techniques, we could reliably decode category information (including for non-special categories, i. e., food and tools) from ventral–temporal cortex in both conditions, but only during actual viewing from retinotopic areas. Interestingly, in temporal cortex when the classifier was trained on the viewed condition and tested on the imagery condition, or vice versa, classification performance was comparable to within the imagery condition. The above results held even when we did not use information in the specialized category-selective areas. Thus, the patterns of representation during imagery and actual viewing are in fact surprisingly similar to each other. Consistent with this observation, the maps of “diagnostic voxels” (i. e., the classifier weights) for the perception and imagery classifiers were more similar in ventral–temporal cortex than in retinotopic cortex. These results suggest that {{in the absence of any}} bottom–up input, cortical back projections can selectively re-activate specific patterns of neural activity. ...|$|E
2500|$|Studies from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT, using a false-belief versus false-photograph task {{contrast}} {{aimed at}} isolating the mentalizing {{component of the}} false-belief task, have very consistently found activation in mPFC, precuneus, and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right-lateralized. [...] In particular, it has been proposed that the right TPJ (rTPJ) is selectively involved in representing the beliefs of others. [...] However, some debate exists, as some scientists have noted that the same rTPJ region has been consistently activated during spatial reorienting of visual attention; Jean Decety from the University of Chicago and Jason Mitchell from Harvard have thus proposed that the rTPJ subserves a more general function involved in both false-belief understanding and attentional reorienting, rather than a mechanism specialized for social cognition. However, {{it is possible that}} the observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be due to adjacent, but distinct, neuronal populations that code for each. The resolution <b>of</b> typical <b>fMRI</b> studies may not be good enough to show that distinct/adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these processes. In a study following Decety and Mitchell, Saxe and colleagues used higher-resolution fMRI and showed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately 6-10mm above the peak for representing beliefs. Further corroborating that differing populations of neurons may code for each process, they found no similarity in the <b>patterning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> response across space.|$|R
40|$|Background: Emotion dysregulation {{is central}} to the {{clinical}} conceptualization of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), with individuals often displaying instability in mood and intense feelings of negative affect. Although existing data suggest important neural and behavioral differences in the emotion processing of individuals with BPD, studies thus far have only explored reactions to overt emotional information. Therefore, it is unclear if BPD-related emotional hypersensitivity extends to stimuli presented below the level of conscious awareness (preattentively). Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure neural responses to happy, angry, fearful, and neutral faces presented preattentively, using a backward masked affect paradigm. Given their tendency toward emotional hyperreactivity and altered amygdala and frontal activation, we hypothesized that individuals with BPD would demonstrate a distinct <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> responses relative to those without BPD during the viewing of masked affective versus neutral faces in specific regions of interest (ROIs). Results: Results indicated that individuals with BPD demonstrated increases in frontal, cingulate and amygdalar activation represented by number of voxels activated and demonstrated a different <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> activity within the ROIs relative to those without BPD while viewing masked affective versus neutral faces. Conclusions: These findings suggest that in addition to the previously documented heightened responses to overt displays of emotion, individuals with BPD also demonstrate differential responses to positive and negative emotions, early in the processing stream, even before conscious awareness...|$|R
40|$|Predicting a {{particular}} cognitive state from a specific <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> voxel values {{is still a}} methodological challenge. Decoding brain activity is usually performed in highly controlled experimental paradigms characterized {{by a series of}} distinct states induced by a temporally constrained experimental design. In more realistic conditions, the number, sequence and duration of mental states are unpredictably generated by the individual, resulting in complex and imbalanced fMRI data sets. This study tests the classification of brain activity, acquired on 16 volunteers using fMRI, during mental imagery, a condition in which the number and duration of mental events were not externally imposed but self-generated. To deal with these issues, two classification techniques were considered (Support Vector Machines, SVM, and Gaussian Processes, GP), as well as different feature extraction methods (General Linear Model, GLM and SVM). These techniques were combined in order to identify the procedures leading to the highest accuracy measures. Our results showed that 12 data sets out of 16 could be significantly modeled by either SVM or GP. Model accuracies tended {{to be related to the}} degree of imbalance between classes and to task performance of the volunteers. We also conclude that the GP technique tends to be more robust than SVM to model unbalanced data sets. Peer reviewe...|$|R
