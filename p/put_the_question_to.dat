25|$|Queen-regent Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont and Queen Wilhelmina {{were able}} to recover much of the popular support lost under William III. They {{successfully}} changed {{the role of the}} royal family to symbolise the nation's unity, determinacy and virtuousness. In 1890, when Wilhelmina took office, rumours were spread by Socialist satirical magazine De Roode Duivel ("The Red Devil") that William III was not her real father, but Emma's confidant S.M.S. de Ranitz. This would undermine the legitimacy of Wilhelmina's reign. Although no hard evidence exists for the allegations, and the consensus amongst historians is that they are false, the rumours were stubborn, and still feature in conspiracy theories circulating in republican circles. The author of the rumour, the later parliamentarian and senator Louis Maximiliaan Hermans, was sentenced to six months imprisonment for lèse-majesté in 1895 for a different article and cartoon in De Roode Duivel, mocking the two queens. There were considerably more concerns over the royal dynasty's future, when Wilhelmina's marriage with Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (since 1901) repeatedly resulted in miscarriage. Had the House of Orange died out, the throne would likely have passed to Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz, leading the Netherlands into an undesirable strong influence of the German Empire that would threaten Dutch independence. Not just Socialists, but now also Anti-Revolutionary politicians including Prime Minister Abraham Kuyper and Liberals such as Samuel van Houten advocated the restoration of the Republic in Parliament in case the marriage remained childless. The birth of Princess Juliana in 1909 <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> rest.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> {{his cousin}} Timothy Folger, a Nantucket whaler captain, {{who told him}} that {{merchant}} ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of [...] Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the Gulf Stream, by which it is still known today.|$|E

2500|$|After this, Judge Willis <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the jury, who {{unanimously}} {{decided that}} Bonjon {{did not have}} the capacity to enter a plea to the jurisdiction. At Judge Willis' suggestion, and with the agreement of the parties, the question as to the general plea was put to the jury without recalling the witnesses: the jury decided that Bonjon had capacity to know whether he did or did not kill Yammowing, but not to plead guilty or not guilty, [...] "as murder is not always considered a crime with the Aborigines".|$|E
2500|$|The Seattle City Council {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} in March 2014 that capped {{the number of}} drivers from any TNC on the road {{at any given time}} to 150. City Council Member Kshama Sawant argued in favor of the caps as a means to protect traditional taxi drivers. However, on April 17, 2014, the council's ordinance was suspended by a coalition that obtained 36,000 signatures to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> voters in a referendum. As a result, Mayor Ed Murray announced a 45-day negotiation process to find an alternative approach. Uber donated over $613,000 to [...] "Seattle Citizens to Repeal Ordinance 124441", a political group seeking to overturn the ordinance limiting the number of TNC vehicles in Seattle. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray worked with the TNCs to reach a deal to legalize them in July 2014.|$|E

60|$|When your Committee came {{to examine}} into those private {{opinions}} of the Judges, they found, to their no small concern, that the mode both of <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Judges, and their answers, was still more unusual and unprecedented than the privacy with which those questions were given and resolved.|$|R

50|$|Before <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Yudhishthira, <b>the</b> crane {{revealed}} {{itself as}} a Yaksha. The Yaksha asked 18 questions with philosophical and metaphysical ramifications.

60|$|Accordingly, next day, {{as soon as}} we {{were alone}} {{together}} I <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> her, although not without a nervous qualm.|$|E
6000|$|I lost {{no time in}} {{beginning}} my inquiries; I {{wasted no}} words in prefatory phrases. In the plainest terms I <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{got as far}} as that, I {{stopped to}} {{consider}} how I should <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> him that I was burning to ask. But I was too confused, I suppose, or perhaps too impatient to consider. I let out what was uppermost in my mind, in the words that came first.|$|R
6000|$|... "Occasionally. Of {{course the}} matter is of no vital {{interest}} now. But {{at the time you}} spoke of it, I could not help wondering if I had said or done anything during my rather intimate acquaintance with Mother Anastasia which would give you good cause <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> which you just now alluded." ...|$|R
60|$|Chinn <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{directly}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old {{man that}} night, {{and the answer}} surprised him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ask him {{if there}} are any snakes there, sir," [...] he said, and foolishly enough I <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> give me time to think of other things.|$|E

5000|$|Six {{weeks ahead}} of the Schützenfest the [...] "Assembly of Citizens and Sons of Citizens" [...] (Versammlung der Bürger und Bürgerssöhne) takes place. On this occasion, a speaker <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> vote, whether <b>the</b> Schützenfest should be held again in the {{respective}} year.

5000|$|Two {{minutes into}} the {{division}} <b>the</b> Speaker <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House again. If {{it is clear that}} a division is still required, the Speaker announces the Tellers, two each for the [...] "ayes" [...] and [...] "nos". These are appointed by those voting. [...] The tellers are automatically included in the tally of those voting. Some Parliamentary sources will report the vote, for instance as, [...] "247 + 2 tell".|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the second}} time she had <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> him, but this time its purport was a very {{different}} one. He understood it nevertheless, for he replied simply: ...|$|E
6000|$|Did it? Did what? What was she talking about? I {{tried to}} <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> her. I struggled--quite vainly--to say only these words: [...] "What {{are you talking}} about?" ...|$|E

60|$|The servant {{threw open}} the drawing-room door, and the most honoured guest present led Mrs. Farnaby to the dining-room. I roused myself to some {{observation}} {{of what was going}} on about me. No ladies had been invited; and the men were all of a certain age. I looked in vain for the charming niece. Was she not well enough to appear at the dinner-party? I ventured on <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Farnaby.|$|R
