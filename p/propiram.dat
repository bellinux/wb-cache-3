5000|$|With about 10% of the {{analgesic}} {{potency of}} morphine, 50 mg of <b>propiram</b> {{is equivalent to}} about 60 mg of codeine or 50 mg of pentazocine. In many patients, <b>propiram</b> is an effective analgesic comparable to other drugs such as these as well as pethidine, with a normal dose of around 50-100 mg and a duration of action of 3 to 6 hours. It is more potent and effective than codeine, and longer-lasting and with a faster onset of action compared to pethidine. Side effects include sedation, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. [...] <b>Propiram</b> has been available in oral, rectal, and injectable formulations, with bioavailability above 97% after oral administration. Many related compounds are known, although only <b>propiram</b> was ever commercialized.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Propiram</b> (Algeril, Dirame, Bay 4503) is {{a partial}} mu opioid {{receptor}} agonist and weak mu antagonist analgesic from the ampromide family of drugs. It {{was invented in}} 1963 in the United Kingdom by Bayer but was not widely marketed, although it saw some limited clinical use, especially in dentistry. <b>Propiram</b> reached Phase III clinical trials in the United States and Canada.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propiram</b> is {{currently}} a Schedule I/Narcotic controlled substance in the United States with an ACSCN of 9649 and a zero annual aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014. It has been almost exclusively formulated as the fumarate salt.|$|E
5000|$|Diampromide is an opioid {{analgesic}} from the ampromide family of drugs, related to other {{drugs such as}} <b>propiram.</b> It was invented in the 1960s by American Cyanamid, and {{can be described as}} a ring-opened analogue of fentanyl.http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/ectoc/echet98/pub/028/index.htm ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Propiram</b> {{exhibits}} weak {{opioid antagonist}} {{activity on the}} mu receptor—quite a bit weaker than its agonist effects—and the effect on kappa and delta opioid, sigma receptors, or the NMDA system are not well understood. Other drugs of the partial mu-opioid agonist/antagonist type include meptazinol, buprenorphine, butorphanol, phenazocine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, dezocine and its relatives.|$|E
5000|$|Phenampromide is an opioid {{analgesic}} from the ampromide family of drugs, related to other {{drugs such as}} <b>propiram</b> and diampromide. It was invented in the 1960s by American Cyanamid Co. Although never given a general release, it was trialled and 50mg codeine ≈ 60mg phenampromide. Tests on the 2 isomers showed {{that all of the}} analgesic effects were caused by the (S) isomer. In the book [...] a 4-benzyl group added to the piperidine-ring produces a drug some x60 morphine. When overlaid with the most potent isomer of 3-methylfentanyl, the 2 compounds overlay perfectly. This is of academic interest only since the synthetic complexity is beyond clandestine drug manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), <b>propiram</b> (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
40|$|GILBERT, P. E. AND W. R. MARTIN: The {{effects of}} {{morphine}} and nalorphine-like {{drugs in the}} nondependent, morphine-dependent and cyclazocine-dependent chronic spinal dog. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then. 198 : 66 - 82, 1976. A series of morphine-like and nalorphine-like drugs were studied in the nondependent, morphine-dependent and cyclazocine-dependent chronic spinal dog. In the nondepend-ent dog, three profiles of activity were found which could be utilized to distinguish between morphine, WIN 35, 197 - 2 and cyclazocine. <b>Propiram,</b> a prototypic partial agonist of the morphine type, produced morphine-like effects in nondependent dogs and both precipitated and suppressed abstinence in morphine-dependent dogs. WIN 35, 197 - 2, a strong agonist in the guinea-pig ileum which {{has been shown to}} be resistant to antagonism by naloxone, neither precipitated nor suppressed morphine abstinence but suppressed cyclazocine abstinence. In the nondependent dog, it depressed the flexor reflex but not skin twitch reflex. Cyclazocine altered reflex activity much like WIN 35, 197 - 2 but produced tachycardia, tachypnea, mydniasis and canine delirum...|$|E
