5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> {{some of the}} LM's {{systems to}} {{conserve}} battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, {{the third and final}} moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{introduced}} a hybrid sleep feature, which saves {{the contents of}} memory to hard disk but instead of <b>powering</b> <b>down,</b> enters sleep mode. If the power is lost, the computer can resume as if hibernated.|$|E
25|$|With {{a mixture}} of locally {{produced}} and syndicated programming, KEMO-TV remained on the air for three years to the day, <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> its transmitter at midnight on March 31, 1971, to avoid paying the following month's PG electricity bill. Leon Crosby bought it later that year and it returned to the air in 1972 with an eclectic type of programming—featuring shows such as Solesvida and Amapola Presents Show co-hosted by Amapola and Ness Aquino, to name a few. KEMO offered Japanese live-action programs and cartoons dubbed into English including Speed Racer, Ultraman, 8 Man, Prince Planet, Johnny Cypher in Dimension Zero and The King Kong Show.|$|E

2500|$|Hibernation (or suspend to disk) in {{computing}} is <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> {{a computer}} while retaining its state. Upon hibernation, the computer saves {{the contents of}} its random access memory (RAM) to a hard disk or other non-volatile storage. Upon resumption, the computer is exactly {{as it was before}} entering hibernation.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, using a {{screensaver}} with a {{flat panel}} or LCD screen instead of <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> the screen can actually reduce the lifetime of the display, since the fluorescent backlight remains lit and ages faster than it would if the screen were turned off completely. As fluorescent tubes age they grow progressively dimmer, {{and they can be}} expensive or difficult to replace. A typical LCD screen loses about 50% of its brightness during a normal product lifetime, if left on continuously. (In most cases, the tube {{is an integral part of}} the LCD and the entire assembly needs to be replaced.) ...|$|E
50|$|Modules—If {{additional}} {{power savings}} are needed, {{the system will}} <b>power</b> <b>down</b> modules in descending order, starting with the highest numbered slot. Slots containing supervisor engines or Switch Fabric Modules are bypassed and are not <b>powered</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{was also}} some {{controversy}} among viewers about the <b>power</b> <b>down</b> of Steel Soldier, who many viewers felt was <b>powered</b> <b>down</b> to even out {{the number of}} girls, seeing as his track record had been {{much better than the}} two other superheroes up for powerdown, H2O Man and Gold Starlet.|$|R
50|$|Another {{potential}} {{application is}} to extend battery life by analyzing phone usage and <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> {{all or part}} of its capabilities without affecting the user experience.|$|E
5000|$|The Triple X had novel touch-sensitive [...] "soft" [...] power switch. When {{switching}} off, this {{commanded the}} operating system to shut down gracefully before <b>powering</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fencing is the {{isolation}} of a failed node {{so that it does}} not cause disruption to a computer cluster. As its name suggests, STONITH fences failed nodes by resetting or <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> the failed node.|$|E
50|$|The ATR core is {{designed}} to be as flexible as possible for research needs. It can be brought online and <b>powered</b> <b>down</b> safely as often as necessary to change experiments or perform maintenance. The reactor is also <b>powered</b> <b>down</b> automatically in the event of abnormal experimental conditions or power failure.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{intended}} application, the highest available fill power {{may not be}} necessary. A high fill power will provide more insulating ability for a given weight of down. The warmth of a down comforter depends {{not only on the}} fill power, but also on the quantity of fill. So the difference between a comforter with 550 fill <b>power</b> <b>down</b> and a comforter with 700 fill <b>power</b> <b>down</b> is that the 700 fill <b>power</b> <b>down</b> comforter will be lighter for the same warmth rating. High fill powers are most important for weight sensitive applications such as backpacking.|$|R

50|$|The cosmonauts began <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> {{the station}} on 7 February and they {{returned}} to Earth in the Soyuz capsule two days later. They safely landed near Tselinograd in a snowstorm with winds of 72 km/h and wore gravity suits to ease the effects of re-adaptation.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the engine}} is turned off, the rear wheels {{straighten}} up. They change back to {{the angle of the}} front wheels when {{the engine is}} restarted. This is caused by the 4WS control unit <b>powering</b> <b>down,</b> and the fail-safe system overriding the rear rack.|$|E
50|$|Peripherals include counter/timers, {{power-on}} reset generators, {{voltage regulators}} and advanced interrupt controller. This enhances the real time {{performance of the}} processor. A power management controller keeps power consumption to a minimum by <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> unused peripherals and interfaces, and enabling the processor {{to be put in}} standby mode.|$|E

50|$|The terms {{hot plug}} and cold plug {{can be taken}} to mean two {{different}} things, depending on the context. In a more generic context, hot plug is the ability to add or remove hardware without <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> the system, while cold plug is the inability to do so. In the context of comparing certain hot-pluggable devices, however, hot plug {{can be taken to}} mean the ability of the system to autonomously detect the addition or removal of hardware as it occurs, while cold plug can be taken to mean the ability to add or remove devices without <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> or rebooting the system, but the inability of the system to detect these changes, in which case the system operator would have to tell the system software that the change has occurred.|$|E
50|$|OIR is {{a feature}} of the 6500 which allows hot {{swapping}} most line cards without first <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> the chassis. The advantage of this is that one may perform an in-service upgrade. However, before attempting this, {{it is important to understand}} the process of OIR and how it may still require a reload.|$|E
50|$|STEEM Power {{cannot be}} {{transferred}} or traded directly, but the account owner {{can choose to}} withdraw liquid STEEM in weekly payments {{at a rate of}} up to 1/13th of the account's total STEEM Power.
