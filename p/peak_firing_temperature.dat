40|$|ABSTRACT: The screen-printing {{technology}} {{provides a}} low cost high-throughput approach to good contacts for silicon solar cells. However, currently screen-printed contacts are formed {{at the expense}} of slight performance and fill factor loss. The front grid contact is particularly important and requires low contact resistance, high shunt resistance, and low junction recombination for high fill factor. Often contacts are fired in the moderate to high temperature range (750 - 800 oC) to achieve low series resistance. However, high temperature firing can lead to junction shunting and recombination, which degrades fill factor. Moreover shallow or higher sheet resistance emitters (50 - 100 Ω/sq) are desirable for high performance, which makes devices even more vulnerable to high temperature firing. Therefore, in this study, we modify the paste composition by adding some dopants and additives to lower the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> for good ohmic contacts. This also reduces the wafer bowing and enhances SiN-induced defect hydrogenation in multicrystalline silicon substrates. The results show that increasing the additives concentration lowered the optimum firing temperature from 780 to 720 oC. In addition, the ideality factor is reduced significantly at the lower firing temperature. Thus additives used in this study were able to lower the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> and increase the fill factor without hurting the series resistance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{industrial}} process of silicon solar cells is mainly {{based on the}} aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) performed by the conventional screen printing and firing in a belt furnace. The goal {{of this paper is}} to present the analysis of the influence of the amount of the Al paste on the electrical parameters and on the minority carrier diffusion length. The silicon solar cells were processed in p-type Czochralski solar grade wafers. The amount of Al paste deposited to form the BSF, denominated of Al paste surface density, was ranged from 2. 8 mg/cm 2 to 8. 8 mg/cm 2. The <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> for each amount of Al paste was optimized and the depth of the Al-BSF was estimated. The best results were found for the Al paste surface density of 3. 5 mg/cm 2 and the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> of 840 °C, resulting in the efficiency of the solar cells of (15. 0 ± 0. 1) %. In this case, the depth of the Al-BSF was (5 ± 1) μm. Taking into account the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> obtained for each Al paste surface density, we observed that the short-circuit current increased up to the average Al paste amount of 3. 5 mg/cm 2. On the other hand, the fill factor decreased with the increasing of the Al paste surface density. The open circuit voltage was slightly affected by the Al paste amount. The minority carrier lifetime rose from 30 μs to 120 μs after the phosphorus diffusion. A strong improvement in the minority carrier diffusion length was observed after the firing process and depends on the Al paste amount. The measured average values were 500 μm, 1280 μm and 780 μm for the Al paste surface density of about 2. 8 mg/cm 2, 3. 5 mg/cm 2 and 8. 8 mg/cm 2, respectively...|$|E

Hence, a detailed study of their magnetic properties has been undertaken. Typical domain structures and zones have been observed by MFM at resolutions of about 0. 2 mu m (static mode) and 50 nm (dynamic mode).

X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in combination with thermogravimetry were used to analyse the phases formed before and after firing.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we {{investigate}} metal spike formation of screen-printed Ag/Al pastes during contact firing in an infrared belt furnace and its influence {{on the characteristics of}} n-type bi-facial silicon solar cells. The boron emitters are formed in a co-diffusion step using boron doped PECVD layers. It is demonstrated that the formation of Ag/Al spikes results in strong FF and VOC losses limiting the solar cell efficiency. This can mainly be attributed to an increased saturation current density of the second diode which is strongly increasing with increasing set <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature.</b> A detailed scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that this j 02 increase can be attributed to an increasing area density and depth of the Ag/Al spikes for increasing peak firing temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The size effect, {{namely the}} change of sheet resistance, R, as a {{function}} of resistor length, has been investigated in layers whose conductive phase evoves from Pb-rich (Ru-deficient pyrochlores) to Pb 2 Ru 2 O 6. 5 and finally to RuO 2 by increasing the firing temperature. It is found that Bi diffusion from the terminations is responsible for lower sheet resistance values in shorter resistors whatever the conductive phase is. On the contrary, Ag diffusion is responsible for lower sheet resistance values in shorte resistors only in the case of ruthenate conductive grains while the reverse is observed in RuO 2 -based layers. Size effect can be suppressed with Pt/Au-based terminations provided that Bi is contained and with Au-metallorganic-based contact provided that the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> is not too high...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of microstructure and electrical properties of silver-based thick-film metallizations of silicon solar cells prepared by infrared firing processes has been investigated. The {{performance of the}} cells are shown {{to be dependent on}} several dynamical and diffusive phenomena. In particular, the sintering of silver grains, silver diffusion into the glass, and the flow of glass at the metal/silicon interface strongly affect important characteristics of the cells such as sheet and contact resistivities and the adhesion of fingers and bus bars. The existance of an optimum value of the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> is observed and explained in terms of competitive phenomena occurring at the metal/silicon interface.

30|$|We fit a {{suite of}} {{generalized}} linear models that predicted mean <b>peak</b> <b>fire</b> <b>temperature,</b> mean heat duration, and mean heat dose {{as a function of}} fuel loads and weather parameters. In addition, we examined the potential effect of scale of the burns in the suite of possible models in which scale was a categorical predictor (0 = small-scale burns; 1 = large-scale burns). We expected that wind speed could potentially have a non-linear effect on both response variables, in which temperature and heat dose could decline either when winds are too low or too high, so we considered first-and second-order parameters for wind speed in the suite of possible models. The second order parameter was (observed windspeed — mean windspeed) 2, in which mean windspeed averaged across all burn trials was 4.06 m sec− 2. With a total of six potential model parameters (fuel load, air temperature, wind speed, [wind speed — 4.06] 2, relative humidity, and scale of burn) we fit all of the 64 different possible models.|$|R
40|$|Resilience of {{structural}} systems after hazardous events {{is a crucial}} concern of building design. An abundance of {{research has focused on}} hazards such as seismic and fire separately. This project conducted a multi-hazard study on steel buildings considering both seismic and fire damage. A literature review of the behavior of steel-framed buildings due to fires after earthquakes, known as post-earthquake fires (PEF), is offered. The new PEF methodology, delivered in this study, starts with creating a three dimensional (3 D) model of the examined steel building using the finite element method software, ABAQUS. Next, varying intensities of seismic and fire hazards were applied to the building models. Incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) were conducted to examine the progression of damage as peak ground accelerations increase. Similarly, incremental fire analyses (IFA) involved scaling the <b>peak</b> <b>fire</b> <b>temperature</b> and recording the vertical story deflection. Three primary failure modes were observed: compartment failure, column failure and bay failure. Preliminary results show that gravity columns are the most vulnerable component within the structure, regardless of seismic damage. Recommendations for improving building resilience are provided for future examination...|$|R
40|$|Most energy {{studies on}} the {{traditional}} ceramic manufacturing process focus on the firing stage {{because this is the}} process stage that consumes the greatest amount of thermal energy. At present in Europe, using typical technologies, about 50 % of the energy input in the firing stage is still lost through the kiln stacks. A key issue in energy studies is the accurate determination of the energy efficiency of the process, an issue that may become crucial in coming years to enable the energy management of different facilities and products to be compared. To reliably determine energy efficiency, accurate determination is required of the energy needed for the necessary physico-chemical transformations to develop in the material in the firing stage. This energy is also the only strictly unrecoverable energy, as the energy contained in other streams could, potentially at least, be partly recoverable. The present study was undertaken to develop an analytical methodology for estimating the heat of reaction of seven different traditional ceramic products, involving a broad spectrum of compositions, with <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures</b> ranging from 850 oC to 1200 oC. The following industrial ceramic compositions were studied: four ceramic tile compositions (red-body stoneware tile, porcelain tile, red-body earthenware wall tile, and white-body earthenware wall tile); two structural ceramics compositions (white brick and roof tile), and a porcelain tableware composition. To estimate the energy involved in the physico-chemical reactions in the firing stage, an analytical methodology was developed, based on the mineralogy data of the unfired body composition and on the enthalpy of formation of the minerals in the fired tiles. The methodology was validated by comparing the results with experimental data. This study was funded by the Valencian Institute of Business Competitiveness (IVACE) in the Competitiveness Improvement Programme through project IMAMCA/ 2014...|$|R

40|$|Using an in-situ contact {{resistance}} measurement silver pastes containing glass and aluminum additions for p- and n-type cells were investigated during rapid thermal process (RTP) firing. The glass viscosity, i. e. {{the formation of}} a liquid phase having a viscosity between 104 Pa•s and 105 Pa•s, is the crucial point for opening of the antireflection coating, regardless of the kind of wafer or aluminum addition. The maximum efficiency is obtained in an optimum between the competing effects silver precipitation and emitter corrosion and can be precisely time-resolved observed by an in-situ {{contact resistance}} measurement. The <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> determines the intensity of the interface reaction whereas the temperature related glass viscosity is crucial important for the reaction duration and acts as kinetic switch. In comparison to common pastes for p-type cells, in pastes with alumina additions for n-type cells the glass phase rearranges and depletes at the interface due to thermodynamic reasons. The rearrangement of the glass phase attenuates the reduction of silver in the interface layer and controls the solar cell contacting...|$|E
40|$|Lead Oxide and Iron based {{composite}} resistors {{of constant}} diameter (0. 6 cm) and varying lengths ranging from 0. 37 to 1. 17 cm were fabricated. The resistors were fabricated {{by the use}} of a moulder with the application of an average pressure of 1. 5 × 106 Nm- 2. The research is aimed at fabrication and study of the electrical properties of cermets resistor, with particular interest in electrical resistance as a function of Temperature Coefficient of Resistance, (TCR), length, varying composition and firing temperature. The electrical properties measured showed that the electrical resistance varied with iron content and also increased non- linearly with the length of the resistors. The <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> and firing time were found to have considerable effect on the resistance of the resistors. The resistance values fall with increasing firing temperature. All the resistors have negative TCRs with some of the resistors having TCR as low as- 3579. 4 ± 14. 5 ppm/OC. These results are comparable with those of thermistors. Resistors of low resistance values were obtained and this largely depended on the composition of the materials used...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, tougher {{competition}} and stiffer government policies {{have forced the}} automotive industry into a race for safer, cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles at low cost. As a consequence, exhaust systems should resist to increased working temperatures. This trend towards higher <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures</b> is mainly intended to decrease fuel-consumption and exhaust gas emissions. Thus, the demands on mechanical and oxidation properties at high temperature of the alloys increase, and a better understanding is needed to improve these properties. This thesis concerns the high temperature corrosion of cast heat-resistant irons and steels, intended for exhaust manifolds and turbocharger housings, in dry air {{as well as in}} synthetic diesel and petrol exhaust gases. The examined alloys were two ductile irons, a SiMo (Fe 3. 9 Si 0. 6 Mo 3 C) and a Ni-Resist (Fe 32 Ni 5. 3 Si 1. 8 Cr 2. 1 C), and two cast heat-resistant stainless steels, one ferritic (Fe 18 Cr 1. 4 Nb 2. 1 Mn 0. 32 C) and one austenitic (Fe 20 Cr 9 Ni 1. 9 Nb 2. 7 W 0. 5 C). Primarily, coupons were oxidised for 50 h at 650 °C- 1050 °C. The effect of LCF on the oxidation process was also studied. Detailed analyses of the oxide scales, by means of XRD, SEM/EDX, and AES, were done to characterise the oxides growth. Models, based on thermodynamics and kinetics, were proposed for the oxidation of these alloys. Both cast irons developed a thick and porous outer Fe-oxide that nucleated preferentially at the former graphite nodules. The inner oxide on SiMo consisted of Fe-Si-oxide and (Fe,Si,Cr) oxides in an unoxidised (Ni,Fe) matrix for Ni-Resist. Both alloys failed in forming a continuous protective oxide layer at 650 °C or 750 °C within 50 h due to slow diffusion processes. At 850 ºC and above, interfacial SiO 2 was formed. However, decarburisation, and for Ni-Resist enhanced evaporation of Cr species, led to accelerated oxidation rates and fundamental differences in the oxide structure. The oxidation behaviours of the two cast stainless steels were strongly related to the microstructures. Interdendritic non-Cr carbides initiated thick oxides. The ferritic cast steel exhibited an interesting combination of (Mn,Cr) spinel, an intermediate Cr 2 O 3 layer and an interfacial SiO 2 film. The scale remained adherent and protective at all temperatures in all gases. Water vapour-induced Cr-evaporation was reduced, plausibly by the outer (Mn,Cr) spinel. Segregation of Cr during casting accelerated the formation of the Fe oxide nodules in the centre of the dendrites in the austenitic alloy. The alloy was very sensitive to water vapour and susceptible to catastrophic oxidation at 1050 °C in petrol gases. Low cycle fatigue promoted the nucleation of pits and nodules. Cracking and re-healing of the oxides accelerated the Si- or Cr-depletions leading to faster oxidation...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the emission-adsorption phenomena of fluorine compounds in various ceramic tile body compositions with different fluorine and calcium contents, processed by fast firing cycles in an electric laboratory batch kiln and in continuous fast-cycle industrial combustion kilns (roller kilns). In the roller kilns, fluorine emission was monitored by analysing the fluorine content in both solid and gas samples throughout the kilns. It {{was found that}} fluorine emission during firing in air atmosphere in the laboratory batch kiln began at temperatures above 800  °C and increased progressively up to <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature.</b> In the roller kilns, however, the emissions started at lower temperatures and decreased in certain kiln zones. This decrease indicates that there are regions in these kilns in which fluorine is adsorbed rather than emitted by the material being processed. A fluorine adsorption process is thus shown {{to occur in the}} preheating stage in the roller kilns, despite the rapid heating rate. However, encouraging this adsorption process in order to foster the formation of crystalline phases is ineffective in abating fluorine emissions when ceramic tiles are fired at peak temperatures exceeding 1100  °C. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Interest in {{ferromagnetic}} thick films {{stems from}} their magnetoresistive properties which open {{new opportunities for}} achieving reliable and cheap contactless physical sensors, In previous work we have studied the properties of different classes of ferromagnetic metal-based thick films, either prepared from commercial Ni-based pastes, or from prototype NiCo-based pastes, including those prepared with NiCo powders obtained with a polyol process. The latter {{has been found to}} give comparatively better magnetoresistive and magnetic responses; nevertheless the information on the real microstructure of the films was incomplete, especially with regard to the surface composition and contamination. In this paper results of an investigation aimed at clarifying these features and their evolution with the firing conditions are reported. The study included analyses of powders and films with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Results show the evolution of sintering and grain growth with the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> and give evidence of residual contamination of carbonaceous residues on the films together with an extensive surface oxidation, although the firing process was carried out in nitrogen flow.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} quartz particle size in raw material composition customarily used for the manufacture of porous single-fired wall tile bodies {{on the characteristics of}} the green tiles and on the thermal and mechanical properties of the fired tiles. Quartz particle size was varied, while the quantity and particle size of the other raw materials were kept constant. Tile compacts were formed by uniaxial pressing and fired at different peak temperatures. The resulting fired microstructure was then characterised and tile thermal and mechanical properties were determined. Microcrack formation around quartz particles leads to hysteresis of the coefficient of thermal expansion during heating and cooling. The studied mechanical and thermal properties are shown to be a function of the magnitude of the hysteresis and porosity. This relationship is independent of the operating variables (pressing pressure, operating temperature, and quartz particle size) used. The results obtained confirm that the green and fired properties of porous single-fired wall tiles may be considerably enhanced, while holding low shrinkage and high porosity, compatible with low moisture expansion, by reducing quartz particle size and appropriately adjusting the pressing pressure and <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature.</b> This should enable thin and/or large-sized porous wall tiles to be manufactured, without (immediate or delayed) curvatures, and with a higher breaking load than that required by the standards. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermoelectric microgenerator consists of sixteen thermocouples {{made on a}} 34. 2 × 27. 5 × 0. 25 mm 3 alumina substrate. One of thermocouple arms was made of magnetron-sputtered constantan (Cu-Ni alloy), the second was a Ag-based screen-printed film.

The low range of <b>fire</b> <b>temperatures</b> experienced during these low-intensity burns may have prevented detecting distinct patterns in vegetation following burns.|$|R

The shape of pore was complicated depending on the grain size and <b>firing</b> <b>temperature,</b> and pores {{were found to have}} a fractal nature. While the fractal dimension increased with increasing <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> for small grains, it decreased with increasing <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> for large grains. The fractal dimension of each MgO grain size tends to converge at a lower <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> which is close to the temperature at which the MgAl_ 2 O_ 4 -Mg_ 2 TiO_ 4 solid solution is formed. Specimens with small grains were found to shrink on firing, but the expansion was observed for large grained specimens. These phenomena were explained by the densification and molar volume of MgAl_ 2 O_ 4 -Mg_ 2 TiO_ 4 solid solution and CaTiO_ 3 formed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the role of forming gas anneal on the fill factor of a small area cell and {{efficiency}} loss due to scaling the cell area. Solar cells that are under-fired and those fired at the optimum peak firing cycle showed very marginal response to forming gas anneal. Forming gas anneal is most effective for over-fired cells. The high temperature for the over-fired cells is believed to enhance Ag crystallites growth and the formation of a thick glass layer between the Ag front grid and silicon material. The forming gas anneal aids in reducing the glass to its metal, increase the conductivity of the glass and decrease the contact resistance. Solar cells with four different areas (4 -cm 2, 49 -cm 2, 100 -cm 2 and 156 -cm 2) that were fired at the optimized <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> showed excellent fill factors without the forming gas anneal treatment. The fill factor was not a strong function of the area even though individually the n-factor and series resistance varied due to edge recombination. The efficiency and short circuit current density showed a quadratic relation with the cell area. The short circuit current density showed a difference of 3. 2 mA/cm 2 between the 4 -cm 2 and 156 -cm 2 cells. The short circuit current density decreased with area due to shading, diffusion length and back surface recombination velocity or Leff, front surface recombination velocity, and area loss due to edge isolation. Improved understanding of these effects coupled with grid design and process optimization can bridge the gap between the small and large area cells...|$|E

40|$|A nonisothermal {{constant}} {{heating rate}} {{study of the}} microstructure development in RuO(, 2) -lead borosilicate glass-alumina substrate thick film resistor system was performed. Formalisms for describing the kinetics of the various microstructure development processes under constant heating rate processing conditions were developed. The effect of glass-substrate interaction was accounted for, throughout the entire resistor processing cycle. ^ The glass sintering stages were evaluated by correlating the quantitative microscopy data with the theoretical predictions. At low volume fractions of the conductive, glass particles sinter together forming clusters or islands. The glass island size distribution observations were utilized to evaluate the glass sintering kinetics. ^ The rearrangement of the conductive due to the phenomenon of Brownian motion during liquid phase sintering was addressed. The Brownian motion collision time and the liquid phase sintering kinetics of the conductive were evaluated as functions of materials properties and processing conditions such as the conductive particle size and volume fraction, the constant heating and cooling rate, the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> <b>temperature,</b> and hold time at the peak temperature. ^ The formation of the chain-like, highly connected, skeletal microstructure of the thick film resistors was explained {{on the basis of}} the kinetics of conductive rearrangement process and the liquid phase sintering of the conductive. ^ The RuO(, 2) ring size distributions were studied and the effect of the RuO(, 2) particle size and volume fraction and the glass island formation on these distributions is discussed. The effect of high volume fraction of the conductive on the thickness of the conductive rings and hence on the continuous change in the resistivity (blending curve) is discussed. ^ Based on above observations and analyses, a new modified percolation model for the blending curve is proposed. This model is based on only two parameters and can explain the observed changes in room temperature resistivity with: (a) processing for constant resistor ink chemistry and (b) resistor ink chemistry for constant processing. ^ The analyses presented in this work bring out the complexities involved in the thick film resistor system and shed light on the factors that need to be considered during resistor modeling. Such analyses show promise of converting the thick film technology from an 2 ̆ 7 art 2 ̆ 7 to a 2 ̆ 7 science 2 ̆ 7. ...|$|E
