40|$|Hibernation in the Arctic ground Squirrel (AGS) is a regulated, {{adaptive}} {{response to}} arctic environmental conditions. Problem statement: Regional brain Blood Flow (rCBF) {{has been observed}} to increase dramatically during arousal in hibernators. However, the real time dynamic change in <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 during arousal has not been studied, we hypothesized that <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 is Interdependent of Tbrain and a key component in the arousal process. Approach: Simultaneous in vivo measurements of <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 and brain temperature (T brain) in conjunction with oxygen consumption (V 02) were conducted in the striatum of non-sedated, non-anesthetized Arctic ground squirrels during spontaneous arousal from hibernation. Results: A dramatic fluctuation of brain tissue oxygen partial pressure (<b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2) {{is associated with the}} complex phenomena of spontaneous arousal. In this study, we observed that: (1) a <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 elevation precedes changes in T brain and V 02; (2) <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 changes do not correlate with changes in V 02 during arousal and (3), endogenous O 2 shift from O 2 enriched blood to brain in hibernating AGS induces an arousal with the pharmaceutical chemical, efaproxiral (RSR- 13). Conclusion: The four turning points of <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 appearing at different T brain during arousal suggest that changes in <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 are Tbrain interdependent and support the concept that arousal from hibernation is complex process invoking different feedbacks...|$|R

40|$|During {{the use of}} {{a number}} of mistblowers for the orchard and {{vineyard}} protection, the overgear-box, located between the <b>p.</b> <b>t.</b> <b>o.</b> and the centrifugal fan, was damaged. To solve the problem we carried-out a dynamic analysis of initial no steady-state by integrating the differential equation of the impeller motion. By the obtained equations, a numerical experimentation was carried-out. It showed the gearing of a power greater than design power of the overgear box, due to impeller inertia. This result explains the overgear box damages and gave the no steady-state condition time (1, 8 s), to get the rated velocity of the impeller. Finally a torque limiter assembling, between the <b>p.</b> <b>t.</b> <b>o.</b> and the overgear box, was proposed.

40|$|Arctic Ground Squirrels (AGS) are classic hibernators {{known for}} their {{tolerance}} to hypoxia. &# 13; AGS have been studied {{as a model of}} hypoxia with potential as a medical research model. Problem&# 13; statement: Their unique resistance to the stressors of low oxygen led us to hypothesize that AGS&# 13; might also be adaptable to hyperoxia. Approach: This study examined the physiological pattern&# 13; associated with hyperoxia in response to brain tissue oxygen partial pressure (<b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2), brain temperature&# 13; (T brain), global oxygen consumption (V O 2) and respiratory frequency (f R) using non-sedated and nonanesthetized&# 13; Arctic Ground Squirrels (AGS) and rats. Results: We found that 1) 100 % inspired&# 13; oxygen (F i O 2) increased the baseline values of brain <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 significantly in both summer euthermic AGS&# 13; (24. 4 ± 3. 6 - 87. 3 ± 3. 6 mmHg, n= 6) and in rats (18. 2 ± 5. 2 - 73. 3 ± 5. 2 mmHg, n = 3); <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 was&# 13; significantly higher in AGS than in rats during hyperoxic exposure; 2) hyperoxic exposure had no&# 13; effect on brain temperature in either AGS or rats, with the brain temperatures maintaining constancy&# 13; before, during and after 100 % O 2 exposure; 3) systemic metabolic rates increased significantly during&# 13; hyperoxic exposure in both euthermic AGS and rats; moreover, V O 2 were significantly lower in AGS&# 13; than in rats during hyperoxic exposure; 4) the respiratory rates for rats were maintained before, during&# 13; and after 100 % O 2 exposure, while the respiratory responding patterns to hyperoxic exposure changed&# 13; after exposure in AGS. AGS f R was significantly lower after hyperoxic exposure than before the&# 13; exposure. Conclusion: These results suggest that hyperoxic ventilation induced <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 and V O 2 differences&# 13; between AGS and rats and led to altered respiratory patterns between these species. AGS and the rat&# 13; serves as an excellent comparative model for hypoxic and hyperoxic stress studies of the brain...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} in two parts. The first part {{consists}} of chapters 1 - 4 {{and the second}} part is chapter 5. In the first part we consider the idea of approximating pieces of orbits by a single orbit. There are many examples of such properties (approximation property (A. P.) see chapter one, definitions 1. 2, 1. 4), (Specification property (S. P.),[24]), (pseudo orbit tracing property (<b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.)</b> [25] and definition 4. 1). In chapter one, we show that (A. P.) for a homeomorphism (flow) is equivalent to topological transitivity and density of periodic points and how this property (A. P.) is invariant under topological conjugacy. In theorem 1 we prove that an expansive homeomorphism which is topologically mixing and has <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> also has the S. P. In chapter two, theorem 2, we prove that the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> for flows is invariant under topological conjugacy with preserved orientation (velocity changes). Also we prove in theorem 3 that the suspension flow [2] for a homeomorphism T:X → X has <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> if and only if <b>T</b> has the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> In chapter three, we prove that an expansive flow which has the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> is topologically stable (Theorem 4).

The instantaneous blindness results from the anaesthetic agent being carried into the central artery of the retina through an a n a s <b>t</b> <b>o</b> m o s i s of the ophthalmic and middle meningeal arteries via the recurrent meningeal branch of the lacrimal artery.

This paper examines {{the reactions of}} some English-speaking Socialists to {{the publication of the}} Encyclical, based on an analysis of the leading Socialist newspapers and journals, and the writings of Hyndman, Blatchford and Henry George. Socialists took the Encyclical seriously, fearing its effect on English and Irish Catholic workers. They criticised the Pope's wholesale condemnation of Socialism, and his failure to distinguish between it and Communism; they believed that he was confused about the question of private property, and that his ideal picture of the small, peasant proprietor was totally irrelevant in modern industrialised societies like England. They contrasted the true religion of the poor preached by Jesus with the support which modern religion gave to capitalism and the rich.

Assessment was achieved through public opinion polls, BBC audience research, and the government's own Home Intelligence reports. Censorship was less severe on the press and books than on the radio, where every word broadcast was subject to censorship on grounds of both security and opinion.

The Moluccan soldiers which for a long time had occupied a privi- liged position in the colonial army were hesitant to enter the army of the new Indonesian state after Indonesia became independent in 1949. Hesitation turned into refusal after an Independent Moluccan republic was proclaimed in 1950. A large majority of the Moluccan soldiers was sympathetic towards this new state. In order to solve the ensuing impasse it was decided to temporarily (<b>p.</b> <b>t.</b> <b>o.)</b> transpost the Moluccan soldiers to the Netherlands. Eventually, the temporary nature of their stay lasts up until now, the Moluccan community in the Netherlands being a centre of the independence movement of the Moluccas. Manuhutu Wim.

This article traces {{the origin of}} an Etruscan bronze piglet in the Archaeological Museum at Florence (Inv. 531). According to {{documents}} in Florence and Siena, Valentino Tordini found the piglet in February 1787. He reported his find to his parish priest, Girolamo Benucci, and news soon reached Anton Lorenzo Minucci, Potesta of S. Gimignano. Minucci notified Abbot Felice Fontana in Florence who passed the information on to Giuseppe Bencivenni gia Pelli. Director of the R. Galleria. As a result, Bencivenni gia Pelli made a recommendation to Luigi di Schmidweiller, financial advisor of the Grand Duke, Pietro Leopoldo I De Lorena, to grant a reward to the finder of the piglet and to place it in the (<b>p.</b> <b>t.</b> <b>o.)</b> R. Galleria. The Grand Duke approved the award and the piglet arrived in the R. Galleria on March 7. 1787. She was subsequently moved to her present location in the Archaeological Museum.

Though the cahiers de doléances of 1789 have frequently been used by historians for assessments of general "public opinion" in France {{on the eve of the}} Revolution, this article explores the possible use of these documents for the study of regional differences in French attitudes. Of the various kinds of cahiers, it seems likely that the " general " cahiers of the Third Estate were relatively more homogeneous in their composition, representing above all the views and agendas of the urban commoner notables. As a test case, these cahiers are used to analyze attitudes towards religion in the various regions of the kingdom. The analysis reveals some surprisingly cohesive and coherent patterns of regional dif- (<b>p.</b> <b>t.</b> <b>o.)</b> ferences, strengthening the validity of the method and suggesting the existence of a tripartite division in religious attitudes prior to the Revolution.
