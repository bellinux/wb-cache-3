Of course we do not mean the poisonous swamp-sumac, but that which grows along the fences and on the edges of the woods. Of late years the leaves of this bush have been greatly in demand for tanning purposes, and, in some States, especially in Virginia, sumac gathering has become a very important branch of industry, particularly with the negroes; many of whom, during the sumac season, prefer gathering these leaves to doing any other kind of work. The sumac-bush is quite low, and the leaves are easily stripped off.

Such a situation induces specialists (marketing specialists, managers, managers of companies) to search for new unconventional and non-standard approaches of moving of commodities and services, in particular, directly in the <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> Foremost, we mean marketing technologies used for designing of consumers’ behavior. Specialists say that for successful moving of commodities it is necessary to call to the emotional, subconscious sphere. The role of marketing is taken to communication with a consumer directly in the <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> where there is the possibility to provide the most complete immersion of a consumer in the world of brand and to stimulate spontaneous purchases. The task of marketing consists in forming of so-called indoor-environment that is the atmosphere in the <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> Foremost, we mean visual (color), voice (audiomarketing) and aromatic (aromamarketing) design inside a building. The essence of such technologies consists in the influence on man’s subconsciousness and in the creation of manipulation mechanism of management of consumer’s actions and behavior by complex influence on 5 organs of man’s feeling such as sight, hearing, sense of smell, touch, taste. The article generalizes the existent experience of the use of psycho-emotional methods <b>of</b> stimulation <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> used to influence on consumer’s behavior. The authors describe the basic methods of psyho-emotional influence such as color, audiomarketing (or voice design) and aromamarketing.

The auctioneer was surrounded by perhaps a score of lookers-on--big fellows for the most part, of the true Western build, long in the leg, broad in the shoulder, and adorned (to a plain man's taste) with needless finery. A jaunty, ostentatious comradeship prevailed. Bets were flying, and nicknames. [...] "The boys" [...] (as they would have called themselves) were very boyish; and it was plain they were here in mirth, and not on business. Behind, and certainly in strong contrast to these gentlemen, I could detect the figure of my friend Captain Trent, come (as I could very well imagine that a captain would) to hear {{the last of his}} old vessel. Since yesterday he had rigged himself anew in ready-made black clothes, not very aptly fitted; the upper left-hand pocket showing a corner of silk handkerchief, the lower, on the other side, bulging with papers. Pinkerton had just given this man a high character. Certainly he seemed to have been very frank, and I looked at him again to trace (if possible) that virtue in his face. It was red and broad and flustered and (I thought) false. The whole man looked sick with some unknown anxiety: and as he stood there, unconscious of my observation, he tore at his nails, scowled on the floor, or glanced suddenly, sharply, and fearfully at passers-by. I was still gazing at the man in a kind of fascination, when the sale began.|$|E
40|$|In modern society, music penetrates {{most of our}} {{everyday}} activities, and so one is not surprised {{that it has become}} commonplace, and even expected by consumers, in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> Contemporary shops are no longer merely points <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> They have become a sort of medium between clients, on one hand, and vendors and producers, on the other. Audiomarketing is a term used to define a modern marketing tool that uses music to create the unique atmosphere <b>of</b> a particular <b>place</b> and to influence consumer in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> To explain the audiomarketing phenomenon, a review of selected studies concerning the problem of emotional responses to music has been presented. These findings are supported by a review of some investigations indicating that music can have a strong impact on consumer behaviour (e. g. music and the speed of customer activity, music and time perception, the effects <b>of</b> music on <b>sales,</b> etc.). The presented examples of experimental research provide excellent proof that it is worth introducing suitably chosen music into a space where people buy and consume. This is due above all to the fact that present-day society, overwhelmed by vociferous messages, prefers emotional arguments, and music can act as an excellent tool for communicating with consumers on an emotional level...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Law, Chief of Patna, being {{examined}} {{on the effect}} of that monopoly, delivered his opinion, that with regard to the Company's trade the monopoly was advantageous, but as sovereigns of the country they must be losers by it. These two capacities in the Company are found in perpetual contradiction. But much doubt may arise whether this monopoly will be found advantageous to the Company either in the one capacity or the other. The gross commodity monopolized for sale in London is procured from the revenues in Bengal; the certain is given for the hazardous. The loss of interest on the advances, sometimes the loss of the principal,--the expense of carriage from Patna to Calcutta,--the various loadings and unloadings, and insurance (which, though borne by the Company, is still insurance),--the engagement for the Ordnance, limited in price, and irregular in payment,--the charge of agency and management, through all its gradations and successions,--when all these are taken into consideration, it may be found that the gain of the Company as traders will be far from compensating their loss as sovereigns. A body like the East India Company can scarcely, in any circumstance, hope to carry on the details of such a business, from its commencement to its conclusion, with any degree of success. In the subjoined estimate of profit and loss, the value of the commodity is stated at its invoice price at Calcutta. But this affords no just estimate of the whole effect of a dealing, where the Company's charge commences in the first rudiments of the manufacture, and not at the purchase at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and valuation: for they [there?] may be heavy losses on the value at which the saltpetre is estimated, when, shipped off on their account, without any appearance in the account; and the inquiries of your Committee to find the charges on the saltpetre previous to the shipping have been fruitless.|$|E

Foi poss?vel identificar, ainda, os fatores de qualidade, utilizados pelos propriet?rios e gestores, que possuem import?ncia muito grande e definem a produ??o e venda de um adorno deste tipo.

The data were treated statistically. For the quantitative and qualitative variables it was applied descriptive statistical analysis with the calculation of the frequencies: absolute, relative and cumulative relative. Crossing data were performed in order to obtain greater accuracy of information. In the users descriptive analysis, the following crosses were made: of age by gender; gender by schooling; gender by family income; frequency of biojewels purchase by family income; <b>place</b> <b>of</b> ring acquisition by family income; gender by ring numbering; gender by ring interest and gender by ring characteristics. In the owners and managers descriptive analysis, crosses were performed: of gender by schooling; <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> by tucum? species used in the rings production; <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> by stores specialty; <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> by source <b>of</b> tucum? seed; stores characteristics by <b>places</b> <b>of</b> sale; ring exclusivity by <b>places</b> <b>of</b> sale; ring numbering characteristic by <b>places</b> <b>of</b> sale; rings warranty expiration by <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> by price <b>of</b> biojewels rings.

Basketry is the other traditional craft, mostly woven from willow branches and wicker for household use. The commercialization of these baskets began after the railroad was constructed through here in the early 20th century, with baskets going to Mexico City. Later the train was substituted by buses. The space that baskets would normally take on a transport led to a system of semi construction in the town, with final assembly taking place in the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> The most traditional baskets are still made of willow, but other materials have been adapted such as synthetic, rattan, fabric and more.
