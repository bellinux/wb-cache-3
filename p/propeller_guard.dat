50|$|The United States Navy {{cleared the}} USS Edson on April 24, 2012, {{to become a}} part of the Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum. It took years for the museum to be {{approved}} to obtain a retired destroyer but Mike Kegly, President of the Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum, did not give up and continued to be persistent on being in touch with the Naval Offices. Since the ship was given approval to be a part of the museum, the museum had 50 days to come pick up the destroyer because it was the new owners' responsibility to obtain the ship after its release. The museum was forced to wait in order to obtain a quote on how much it would cost them to get two tug boats to aid in the delivery of the USS Edson from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to the museum located in Bangor Township. The USS Edson was towed more than 2000 mi from a shipping yard located in Philadelphia to its new more permanent home as a museum in Bay City. However, there was one major issue that faced the museum before they could take destroyer from its home in Philadelphia and that was with the boat's <b>propeller</b> <b>guards.</b> The <b>propeller</b> <b>guards</b> are featured on every ship to protect tug boats from running into the ships' propellers. This concern about the propellers became a problem for the USS Edson when it was passing through the locks near Canada because the Canadian Authorities were concerned that the guards could damage the locks as the ship passed through. After a long discussion and explanation on why the <b>propeller</b> <b>guards</b> had to stay Canadian Authorities cleared the destroyer to continue on with its voyage. Its permanent location within Bay City is at the Independence Park Boat Launch right next to the Independence Bridge located in Bangor Township.|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the next}} seven months, Tusk {{received}} extensive modifications to improve her submerged performance characteristics. Four [...] "greater capacity" [...] batteries replaced her old larger ones. Her hull became more streamlined—the anchors were recessed into the hull and the <b>propeller</b> <b>guards</b> were removed—to improve her overall hydrodynamic design for underwater operations. Her sail was streamlined and enlarged to house the snorkel, a device added {{to allow her to}} operate on diesel power at periscope depth and to recharge her batteries while running submerged. All of these changes helped to convert Tusk from simply a submersible surface ship into a truer submarine. They increased her submerged range; and, though she lost about two knots in surface speed, her submerged speed increased from just under 10 kn to about 15 kn.|$|R

40|$|Propeller blade {{injuries}} {{to the chest}} are uncommon but can result in devastating injuries. We describe {{a case of a}} 44 year-old male scuba diver who was dragged by sea currents into the propeller of a speedboat. He suffered extensive chest wall trauma but narrowly escaped damage to major organs and vessels. He was admitted directly to the operating theatre. There was significant loss of bone from the manubrium, costal cartilages, overlying skin and muscle which were stripped off in 3 horizontal bands. During reconstruction the bony fragments were anchored to the nearest stable sternal or costal cartilage entities using steel wires, to achieve stability. The overlying muscle and skin were sutured directly to its opposite edge in layers and in an interdigitating fashion following the shape of the propeller blade lacerations. The patient remained intubated for 3 days in ITU and was transported back to his home country. He required a small skin graft to one area of necrosis but eventually made a full recovery with only his scars as a reminder of his accident. There have been other cases of propeller injuries in Malta but this is unique in being a severe injury to the chest, in which the patient made a full recovery. This report highlights the importance of legislation in preventing propeller injuries by restricting swimmer zones and introducing <b>propeller</b> <b>guards</b> or jet drive systems...|$|R

Also, unlike most other Hubsan models, the H111 has no pre-designed <b>propeller</b> <b>guard,</b> which means the propellers are more exposed and likely to be damaged in a crash.|$|E

40|$|Collisions with {{vessels are}} a {{well-documented}} conservation problem for some populations of large whales (LW) in the Northern Hemisphere. Less {{attention has been}} given to incidents in the Southern Hemisphere or to small cetaceans (SC) worldwide, therefore an experimental database was compiled (N= 256; 119 LW, 137 SC) to allow a rapid assessment. Confirmed collision records were identified for 25 species (7 LW, 18 SC) and unconfirmed but probable records for 10 other species (2 LW, 8 SC). Among LW, ship-caused mortality and traumatic injuries seem to affect primarily southern right (56 reported cases), humpback (15) and Bryde’s whales (13), but also sperm (8), blue (5), sei (4) and fin whales (2) are involved, and probably Antarctic minke and dwarf minke whales. Southern right whale populations off South Africa and off eastern South America (Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina) suffer significant mortality. Incidence and potential population impact vary widely among the 26 small cetacean species for which collision records exist. Vessel strikes in at least two populations each of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Xiamen and Hong Kong/Pearl River, possibly western Taiwan), Irrawaddy dolphin (Mahakam River, Chilika Lagoon, possibly Laos) and finless porpoise (Yangtze River, Hong Kong) may directly compromise long-term survival. Annual vessel-caused mortality (min. 2. 9 % of population) for Irrawaddy dolphins in the Mahakam River may not be sustainable. The quasi-extinction of the baiji warns for a potential similar fate for the Yangtze River finless porpoise and Ganges river dolphin. Two calves of the endangered Hector’s dolphin are known killed by boats. All highly impacted species have a neritic, estuarine or fluviatile habitat, areas where vessel traffic is concentrated. Species that may receive a moderate impact from collisions but which may be sustainable at species level (because many strikes are nonlethal), include common bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, short-finned pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Almost 2 % of common bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Guayaquil showed propeller-inflicted injuries and scars. <b>Propeller</b> <b>guards</b> should be made compulsory for all boat-based cetacean tourism, as habituation to boat traffic seems a contributing factor in accidents. Low impact occurs in 15 small cetacean species with only few reported vessel strikes. However, vast underreporting is thought to be the norm and {{there is a need for}} a global, standardised database...|$|R
40|$|We {{compiled}} {{and reviewed}} 248 cases of reported vessel collisions with small cetaceans worldwide and with large cetaceans in the Southern Hemisphere. Difficulties were encountered with {{the comparison of}} highly variable data in terms of quality (evidence), sources, detail and degree of authentication. It is recommended that wide agreement be reached on a minimum dataset template. We propose 25 standardized parameters, including an essential ‘probability tag’ (confirmed, probable, possible and indeterminate) that categorizes likelihood of vessel strike as evaluated by the original observer(s). Since the time-consuming process of fact-checking and standardizing is ongoing, any elaborate quantitative analysis is premature. Among baleen whales in the Southern Hemisphere, ship collisions have definitely accounted for deaths of southern right, blue, sei, fin, Bryde’s and humpback whales. In South Africa, an estimated 20 % of mortality in Eubalaena australis is due to vessel strikes (Best et al., 2001). Accumulating evidence suggests the problem to be severe also in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, but small samples impede estimation of incidence. Odontocetes regularly affected include sperm whale, killer whale and common bottlenose dolphin. At least {{one or a few}} vessel strikes are documented for 19 species of small cetaceans (several for the first time) : Kogia breviceps, Orcinus orca, Globicephala melas, G. macrorhynchus, Tursiops truncatus, Sousa chinensis, Orcaella brevirostris, Cephalorhynchus hectori, C. commersonii, Lagenorhynchus australis, Stenella frontalis, Neophocaena phocaenoides, Phocoena spinipinnis, Phocoena phocoena, Lipotes vexillifer, Platanista gangetica, Ziphius cavirostris, Berardius arnuxii and Mesoplodon grayi. Three species with suspected involvement in accidents include Sousa plumbea, Mesoplodon hectori and M. bowdoini. For some 11 small cetacean species the effect of collisions on populations is thought to be insignificant. Among estuarine species, at least two populations of each S. chinensis (Xiamen and Hong Kong/Pearl River) and O. brevirostris (Mahakam River and Chilika Lagoon) are significantly impacted. Mahakam population mortality is definitely not sustainable (2. 9 % minimum annual mortality). For L. vexillifer of the Yangtze river and P. gangetica, because of extremely low population numbers, even a very few mortalities may reduce likelihood of future survival. In Hong Kong’s N. phocaenoides, 9. 4 % of carcasses showed blunt traumatic injury consistent with boat collision. Two calves C. hectori were killed by boats near Banks Peninsula in 1999, a major concern considering its endangered status. Around 2 % of T. truncatus in the Gulf of Guayaquil showed scars and mutilations of dorsal fins, caused by at least partly by propellers. Boat based dolphin-watching, such as in Chile and Costa Rica may adversely affect local T. truncatus populations. Overall, considering the high incidence of injuries and mortality caused by propellers, a much wider use of <b>propeller</b> <b>guards</b> is advised...|$|R
40|$|The master thesis work {{involved}} the design {{implementation of a}} duct fanned shielding for Quadrotors. This included the investigation of various settings for duct shielding and to identify the best possible option to safe <b>guard</b> <b>propellers</b> of the quadrotor. In addition, the work focused on improving the aerodynamic efficiency, reducing the mass of flight {{and the use of}} quadrotors in the arctic region. The first goal was to understand and predict the necessary ways to improve the thrust with minimal increase in the mass of the quadrotor. The second goal was to check the durability of the duct. In the elementary models, the duct was modelled as a rigid mass and preliminary tests were conducted using diverse software. Problems, were found in the core areas which had to be solved, independent of {{the size and shape of}} quadrotor. Initially before designing the shielding, preliminary research was incorporated for understanding different aspects of the quadrotor. This report is one such procedure, which focuses on different types of quadrotors, construction styles, market analysis, customer satisfaction, designing and simulation and manufacturing processes. A study of the ducted principle culminates in the development of some simple structures and analysis which may prove useful in practice. Some comparisons between the conceptual models: rectangular concept of connection, aerodynamic concept with 45 deg of connection, aerodynamic concept with 60 deg of connection and cylindrical concept of connection have been made in order to access their strengths and highlight their various shortcomings. The development of a final duct model for quadrotor shielding is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on thrust improvement (especially design features). A limited study on manufacturing approach has been conducted in order to gain some insight into the production equipment and to follow the evolution of the product. Future work in this area is indicated although the product is only for research purpose...|$|R

Suddenly, she rammed Wintle on her starboard side. Her anchor ripped open Wintle's starboard side from the lower platform deck to the main deck at frame 40. Dempsey's anchor also broke Wintle's degaussing coil and severed her return steam line.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 One of {{the unique}} {{problems}} associated with salmon gillnet fishing is of preventing the fouling of the boat's propeller in the net and associated fishing gear. Presently, {{the solution to this}} problem has been the addition of a basket type <b>propeller</b> <b>guard</b> which may produce a drag increase of 50 percent on small planing boats. Recognizing the need for a greater understanding of the interrelationship of boat drag and engine power to the effect of propeller selection and <b>propeller</b> <b>guard</b> design, this study analytically models planing boat power performance including the experimentally determined effects of nozzle type <b>propeller</b> <b>guard</b> design. The model predicts the drag forces acting on a prismatic planing hull and existing data on marine propeller performance is incorporated in the model such that the propeller shaft speed and shaft power for a particular boat propeller combination can be predicted. The model will also optimize propeller diameter. Three variations of nozzle type propeller guards were tested on a 16 ft. planing boat. The guards were a commercially produced outboard motor propeller weed guard, a short (1 /D = 0. 275) flow accelerating nozzle and the nozzle equipped with prerotation vanes. Computer modeling the effect of the three nozzle guards on the performance of a hypothetical 11500 lb. planing boat with a 265 Hp engine predicted that the top speed of the boat (with an optimum diameter propeller) would be 34. 6 knots, with the weed guard 25. 5 knots (a speed loss of 26 percent), with the flow accelerating nozzle 32. 3 knots (seven percent loss) and the nozzle with vanes 27. 4 knots (21 percent loss). The validity of the model is demonstrated by a comparison of the predicted values of propeller shaft speed and boat top speed, with an open propeller and the weed guard, to the actual values observed in operation of the 16 ft. test boat. Shaft speed predictions were within five percent and boat top speed predictions were within about ten percent of actual observations...|$|E
40|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} (Caretta caretta) {{can be found}} worldwide, inhabiting {{tropical}} and subtropical coastal waters. The loggerhead was classified as an endangered species and placed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List in 1996 (IUCN 2006). The problem of sea turtle mortality {{as a result of}} collisions with vessels is of increasing concern, especially in the southeastern United States, where increased development along the coasts results in increased recreational boat traffic. In the United States, the percentage of strandings that were attributed to vessel strikes has increased from approximately 10 % in the 1980 's to a record high of 20. 5 % in 2004 (NMFS 2007). This report presents results from field experiments designed to investigate the ways in which loggerhead sea turtles are injured in boat collisions, and the effectiveness of several mitigation options for reducing the risk of fatal interactions. In order to conduct these field experiments, a synthetic sea turtle carapace was designed and built that approximated the structural behavior of a biological sea turtle carapace. Hodges (2008) quantified the material strength properties of loggerhead sea turtle carapaces. From these results, it was determined that the target parameter for simulating tensile strength in a synthetic carapace should be force per unit width of sample. Hodges designed and constructed an artificial carapace made of composite material for use in controlled experiments. Modifications were made to the design proposed by Hodges (2008) to facilitate rapid construction. Several designs were tested using the force per unit width as the target strength parameter and compared to the strength of the biological carapace. Tests on the design ultimately adopted showed a force per unit width 17. 6 % stronger than the biological carapace. The composite material being stronger than the biological carapace means the testing will result in conservative reports of damage. Once the design and construction methods were finalized, approximately 60 artificial carapaces were fabricated for field testing. A frame, weighting scheme and buoyancy unit were designed and fabricated so that each test carapace floated at proper draft and had realistic specific gravity and weight. Field testing procedures were designed to investigate the influence of a) boat speed, b) animal position in the water column, and c) vessel propulsion system on the severity of vessel collisions on turtles. All experiments were done with small (< 6 m in length) vessels. Boat/sea turtle collisions were simulated by placing a test specimen (a synthetic carapace attached to a test frame) in the water column and striking it with the vessel. The speeds considered were idle (7 km/h), sub-planing (14 km/h), and planing (40 km/hr). The two animal positions in the water column were 1) at the water surface and 2) at "prop depth" (depth {{to the center of the}} propeller hub on the standard outboard motor). Five propulsion options were tested: 1) a standard outboard motor, 2) a standard outboard motor with Hydroshield® <b>propeller</b> <b>guard</b> 3) a standard outboard motor with Prop Buddy® <b>propeller</b> <b>guard,</b> 4) a jet outboard motor and 5) a jet-propelled personal watercraft, often referred to generically as a "jet ski". The experiments typically included five trials per test configuration. Catastrophic (presumably fatal) damage was defined to occur when any damage penetrated the carapace. Small wounds (< 4 cm in length) along the sides or rear of the artificial carapace, where the shell and bone extend beyond the edge of the body cavity, were not classified as catastrophic This definition was used to classify the effectiveness of the various mitigation options. Results indicate that reducing the speed of the vessel reduces the odds of severe damage to the animals. Of all of the tests performed with the standard outboard motor (including tests with propeller guards installed), 25 % of those performed at idle speed resulted in catastrophic damage, compared to 100 % for planing speed tests. The two tested propeller guards both modified the type of damage to the animal when compared to similar tests with the standard motor configuration, but they only slightly reduced the risk of catastrophic damage. At idle speed, with <b>propeller</b> <b>guard</b> installed, 10 % of the tests resulted in catastrophic damage. The corresponding number for the standard motor was 40 %. At planing speed, 100 % of the tests resulted in catastrophic damage, with or without the <b>propeller</b> <b>guard.</b> No catastrophic injuries were observed during testing of both jet propulsion systems (jet outboard and jet ski) at any speed or depth in the water column. Both feature a much smaller draft than the standard outboard, which results in little chance of striking an animal below the surface. And both the jet outboard and the jet-powered watercraft feature water intakes that are relatively smooth and appeared to slide across the animal with minimal damage to the carapace when the model animal was floating on the surface. The experiments described here involved a limited range of hull configurations; results may be different for hulls or propulsion systems drastically different than those tested here. But the results obtained indicate that equipment, in the form of the boat's propulsion system, and the mode in which it is used both play a role in defining the risk of boats to turtles in the field.
