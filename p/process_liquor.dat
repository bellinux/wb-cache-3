40|$|Ferrous iron {{oxidation}} and sulphur oxidation {{are two of}} {{the main}} metabolic functions in acidophilic microorganisms present in bioleaching environments. Metals recovery from sulphide ores is based on oxidation of an insoluble metal sulphide to a water-soluble and leachable metal sulphate. Biological oxidation reactions produce oxidising agents such as ferric ions (Fe 3 +) and protons, after which the metal is leached chemically. The activity of iron- and sulphur-oxidisers is affected by several microbiological, physicochemical, mineral, and processing parameters. In this thesis, several bioheap leach liquors originating from a mine site (Talvivaara Mining Company Plc, Sotkamo, Finland) were examined. The aim was to study the <b>process</b> <b>liquors</b> that were inhibiting biooxidation processes, and explore the microbiological and physicochemical factors responsible for their impaired growth conditions for the indigenous microorganisms. The indigenous microorganisms present in leach liquors were enriched by supplementing the cultures with nutrients and either ferrous iron (Fe 2 +; enrichment of iron-oxidisers) or elemental sulphur (S 0; enrichment of sulphur-oxidisers). The enrichment cultures were then used as inoculants in shake flask experiments (100 mL, 150 rpm, pH 1. 7, 27 °C) performed to study Fe 2 + resistance, aluminium (Al 3 +) toxicity, and nutrient availability in the leaching environment. Different <b>process</b> <b>liquors</b> (PL 1 - PL 6) were also compared in terms of their bacterial community composition and growth conditions for the microorganisms. Incubation of the <b>process</b> <b>liquors</b> (95 % v/v) with iron- or sulphur-oxidising microorganisms (5 % v/v) showed that PL 4 limited both oxidation mechanisms more than other liquors. This was the case even though the indigenous bacterial community in PL 4 was diverse, containing iron-oxidisers (Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum), sulphur-oxidisers (Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans), and bacteria capable of both metabolic functions (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidiferrobacter thiooxydans, Sulfobacillus acidophilus). A dilution series of PL 4 in mineral salts medium (MSM) demonstrated that 100 % (v/v) of the liquor had a very low iron oxidation rate (27 mg/L/h), whereas addition of 4 % (v/v) of MSM and 1 % (v/v) of TES (trace elements solution) distinctly increased the oxidation activity (to 156 mg/L/h). It was concluded that PL 4 was either lacking essential nutrients, or contained inhibiting components. Compared to other <b>process</b> <b>liquors,</b> it was found that PL 4 contained the highest concentrations of several liquor components and in addition, nutrient concentrations in all the <b>process</b> <b>liquors</b> were largely unknown. Thus, further examination was required. Inoculated PL 4 was incubated with nutrients, iron-oxidising microorganisms, and increasing Fe 2 + concentrations (5, 8, 12, and 16 g/L) in order to study its Fe 2 + tolerance. High Fe 2 + content in the culture did not lengthen the oxidation lag phase and increasing iron concentrations even enhanced oxidation rates, demonstrating that the iron-oxidising microorganisms in PL 4 were well adapted to high Fe 2 + concentrations. This result was expected, as some of the other <b>process</b> <b>liquors</b> with effective oxidation activities had a distinctly higher Fe 2 + content than in PL 4. The results of a similar aluminium toxicity experiment with different Al 3 + concentrations (3, 6, 9, and 12 g/L) revealed that increasing Al 3 + concentrations slightly lengthened the lag phase and decreased iron oxidation rates. However, as the iron oxidation rate in a culture containing 12 g/L of Al 3 + (almost double the concentration of PL 4) remained quite high (119 mg/L/h), it was concluded that aluminium inhibition was not responsible for the impaired growth conditions in PL 4. Incubation of non-inoculated PL 4 (50 % v/v) with MSM (49 % v/v) and TES (1 % v/v) resulted in a high iron oxidation rate (175 mg/L/h). However, without MSM or TES the oxidation rate was significantly lower (18 mg/L/h), suggesting that nutrient deficiency was inhibiting the activity of bioleaching microorganisms. Iron oxidation in PL 4 supplemented with sodium (Na), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), or selenium (Se), or with a combination of some of these nutrients, was very slow with oxidation rates in the range of 11 - 17 mg/L/h. However, addition of 3900 mg/L of nitrogen (N; a concentration present in 49 % v/v of MSM) resulted in a distinctly higher oxidation activity, with an iron oxidation rate of 154 mg/L/h. Total organic and inorganic N determination performed for PL 4 showed that the liquor’s N content was under the detection limit (1 mg/L). It was concluded that the iron oxidation activity in PL 4 was N limited. As previously shown in the dilution series, PL 4 supplemented with 4 % (v/v) of MSM had a high iron oxidation activity, indicating that PL 4 required 319 mg/L or less of N. This thesis work demonstrated that nitrogen supplementation to PL 4 would increase iron oxidation rates and leaching efficiencies in bioheaps. In future studies, the N concentration required by the indigenous microorganisms in PL 4 should be examined. Nutrient deficiency rather than high ion concentration was demonstrated to be the limiting factor for microbial activity. The limiting concentrations {{of some of the most}} high-content anions and cations in the prosess liquors, such as that of sulphate (SO 42 -), remain to be determined...|$|R

The kinetics of this reaction were investigated as a function of aluminate concentration, stirring, temperature and lime charge.

Sodium succinate was found to undergo CuO-catalyzed WO at 165 degreesC in Bayer liquor via a co-oxidation mechanism. Sodium malonate was identified as a compound capable of co-oxidizing sodium succinate under Bayer-like (highly alkaline) conditions.

Given that Bayer <b>process</b> <b>liquor</b> is typically deficient in nitrogen (N), there is external supplementation of N in current full-scale biological treatment processes. This study, {{for the first time}} examines oxalate degradation under N deficient conditions in a comparative study using two parallel biofilm-reactors, one N-supplemented and the other under N-deficient conditions. Oxalate degradation rates and oxygen uptake rates (OUR) were determined at different bulk water dissolve oxygen (DO) set-points. RESULTS The results revealed that oxalate removal rates (33 – 111 mg/h. g biomass) linearly correlate with OUR (0 – 70 mg O 2 /h. g biomass) in the N-supplemented reactor. However, in the N-deficient reactor, a linear increase of oxalate removal was recorded only with DO upto ≤ 3 mg/L. Surprisingly, anaerobic oxalate removal was evident even in the presence of DO (up to 8 mg/L) in both reactors. Further elucidation revealed formate, acetate and methane by-products during anaerobic oxalate removal in both reactors. CONCLUSION This study revealed the feasibility of aerobic oxalate oxidation and fermentation under alkaline and N-deficient conditions.

In order to optimise the process, a detailed knowledge of factors influencing gibbsite solubility is required, a problem that is confounded by the presence of liquor impurities. In this paper, the use of the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) polynomial neural network for developing a gibbsite equilibrium solubility model for Bayer <b>process</b> <b>liquors</b> is discussed.

The project was included by FETC as a Phase I project in its Mega-PRDA program. Phase I of this project focused on three research areas. These areas in order of priority were: (1) Catalytic oxidation of vapor-phase elemental mercury; (2) Enhanced particulate-phase HAPs removal by electrostatic charging of liquid droplets; and (3) Enhanced mercury removal by addition of additives to FGD <b>process</b> <b>liquor.</b> Mercury can exist in two forms in utility flue gas [...] as elemental mercury and as oxidized mercury (predominant form believed to be HgCl{sub 2 }). Previous test results have shown that wet scrubbers effectively remove the oxidized mercury from the gas but are ineffective in removing elemental mercury. Recent improvements in mercury speciation techniques confirm this finding. Catalytic oxidation of vapor-phase elemental mercury is of interest in cases where a wet scrubber exists or is planned for SO{sub 2 } control. If a low-cost process could be developed to oxidize all of the elemental mercury in the flue gas, then the maximum achievable mercury removal across the existing or planned wet scrubber would increase. Other approaches for improving control of HAPs included a method for improving particulate removal across the FGD process and the use of additives to increase mercury solubility.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} focused on several {{problems}} relating to the growth and fouling of crystal mass in industrial environments, due to leakage of salt solutions or <b>process</b> <b>liquor.</b> The work has direct application to the nuclear industry, where the size and morphology of material deposits heavily impact on their associated criticality risk. An absence of clear methods and techniques to either predict or non-invasively monitor the growth of these crystalline deposits proves problematic for industrial specialists. Therefore {{the main part of}} the thesis focused on the development and implementation of models such that the growth behaviour of crystalline formations could be evaluated and quantified for varying physical parameters. This was accomplished through both the adaptation of previous geological models, and the development of a coupled multi-physics model such that fluid flow, heat transfer and crystallisation mechanisms could be considered. The models were validated against an experimental dataset provided by the National Nuclear Laboratory, and results were shown to be in good agreement. Through parametric studies it was determined that the characteristic shape of the formation was heavily determined by the initial solution concentration, flow velocity, temperature and the rate of evaporation. A method for the non-invasive monitoring of the deposits was also investigated through the solution of a geometric inverse problem governed by the transient two-dimensional heat equation. A meshless numerical method, namely the method of fundamental solutions was used as a direct solver in a complicated highly non-linear constrained minimisation.

The work described in this paper was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of this precipitation reaction about which surprisingly little is known. In {{the first part of the}} study, the composition of calcium oxide disks after reacting with sodium carbonate solutions was examined by XRD and TGA. TGA results show that the amount of calcium carbonate formed on the disks increases with sodium carbonate concentration but the amount of calcium hydroxide reaches a minimum at a solution concentration of about 0. 05 M carbonate and then increases at higher carbonate concentrations. The kinetics of the formation of calcium carbonate were also followed using HPLC to monitor the change in bulk carbonate concentration due to the reaction of powdered lime in sodium carbonate solutions. The effect of the agitation speed and temperature on the reaction rate indicates that the formation of calcium carbonate is a diffusion-controlled process. To account for these findings it is suggested that at concentrations above 0. 05 M carbonate a more porous heterogeneous CaCO 3 –Ca(OH) 2 layer appears owing to direct attack on the surface by carbonate before a layer of calcium hydroxide can form. Scanning electron micrographs of disks after reaction in carbonate solutions support this suggestion. The second part of this study deals with the dissolution of lime in the presence of sodium carbonate. The concentration of Ca 2 + from dissolution of calcium hydroxide disks was determined by AAS. It was found that the dissolution process is slowed by the formation of calcium carbonate, and is diffusion controlled. The reaction of powdered calcium oxide in the sodium carbonate solution was followed by calorimetry. It was found that the relationship between the extent of dissolution and the carbonate concentration is similar to that obtained by TGA for the formation of calcium carbonate, suggesting the same mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Nickel matte is {{a nickel}} sulfide {{concentrate}} produced by smelting. It consists mainly of two components: a nickel-copper alloy and heazlewoodite (Ni 3 S 2); but also contains varying amounts of djurleite, Cu 1. 96 S. There are several hydrometallurgical routes for processing nickel matte. The most recent of these involves an oxidative leach in acid chloride or sulfate solution. Nickel is subsequently recovered fiom the leach solution by electrowinning or by hydrogen reduction. In the work {{described in this}} thesis, {{various aspects of the}} acid leaching of nickel matte are investigated using mostly electrochemical methods. The first section concerns the use of copper(II) as an oxidant for the alloy component of nickel matte. In this cementation reaction, nickel goes into solution while copper is deposited on the dissolving metal swf 8 ce. The same reaction is important in removing traces of copper present in the nickel solution. Here nickel powder is added to the <b>process</b> <b>liquor.</b> A survey of the literature pertaining to the cementation of copper by nickel shows that there is considerable dispute as to the conditions under which cementation takes place. Evans' diagrams for the cementation reaction were constructed by superimposing the polarisation curves for the oxidation of nickel and the reduction of copper. It was found that cementation occurred provided that the two polarisation curves intersected in the region of active nickel dissolution. Outside this region, a copper deposit could not be seen. The second part of the thesis presents some investigations into the electrochemistry of nickel sulfides and nickel matte, and compares both chloride and sulfate media. Oxidation and dissolution rates of nickel matte powders using copper(I 1) as an oxidant were also carried out. Dissolution was chemically controlled and so the rate was very dependent upon temperature and solution potential. Displacement of copper(II) from solution to form copper sulfide was also found to be important. In addition to the above studies, which relate directly to the oxidative leaching of nickel matte, an investigation of the oxidation of HzS to sulfur in acidic solution was carried out. Sulfer deposition was found to be strongly dependent on substrate and pH. Under some conditions, two types of sulfur were deposited, with the more crystalline sulfer being reduced at the more negative potential...|$|E

However, in most mills, including those in New Zealand, black liquor viscosity is not routinely measured. Four batches of black liquors having solids concentrations ranging between 47 % and 70 % and different residual alkali (RA) contents were obtained from Carter Holt Harvey Pulp and Paper (CHHP&P), Kinleith mill, New Zealand. Weak black liquor samples were obtained by diluting the concentrated samples with deionised water. The viscosities of the samples at solids concentrations ranging from 0 to 70 % were measured using open-cup rotational viscometers at temperatures ranging from 0 to 115 oC and shear rates between 10 and 2000 s- 1. The effect of post-pulping <b>process,</b> <b>liquor</b> heat treatment (LHT) on the liquors’ viscosities was investigated in an autoclave at a temperature >= 180 oC for at least 15 mins. The samples exhibit both Newtonian and non-Newtonian behaviours depending on temperature and solids concentration; the onsets of these behaviours are liquor-dependent. In conformity with the literature data, at high solids concentrations (> 50 %) and low temperatures, they exhibit shear-thinning behaviour with or without thixotropy but the shear-thinning/thixotropic characteristics disappear at high temperatures (>= 80 oC). Generally, when the apparent viscosities of the liquors are 50 %, viscosity decreases with increasing RA content of the liquor. This shows that the RA content of black liquor can be manipulated to control the viscosity of high-solids black liquors. The LHT process had negligible effect on the low-solids liquor viscosity but led to a significant and permanent reduction of the high-solids liquor viscosity by a factor of at least 6. Therefore, the incorporation of a LHT process into an existing kraft recovery process can help to obtain the benefits of high-solids liquor firing without a concern for the attending rheological problems. A variety of the existing and proposed viscosity models using the traditional regression modelling tools and an artificial neural network (ANN) paradigm were obtained under different constraints. Hitherto, the existing models rely on the traditional regression tools and they were mostly applicable to limited ranges of process conditions. On the one hand, composition-dependent models were obtained as a direct function of solids concentration and temperature, or solids concentration, temperature and shear rate; the relationships between these variables and the liquor viscosity are straight forward. The ANN-based models developed in this work were found to be superior to the traditional models in terms of accuracy, generalization capability and their applicability {{to a wide range of}} process conditions. If the parameters of the resulting ANN models can be successfully correlated with the liquor composition, the models would be suitable for online application. Unfortunately, black liquor viscosity depends on its composition in a complex manner; the direct correlation of its model parameters with the liquor composition is not yet a straight forward issue. On the other hand, for the first time in the Australasia, the limitations of the composition-dependent models were addressed using centrifugal pump performance parameters, which are easy to measure online. A variety of centrifugal pump-based models were developed based on the estimated data obtained via the Hydraulic Institute viscosity correction method. This is opposed to the traditional approaches, which depend largely on actual experimental data that could be difficult and expensive to obtain. The resulting age-independent centrifugal pump-based model was implemented online as a black liquor viscosity soft sensor at the number 5 recovery boiler at the CHHP&P, Kinleith mill, New Zealand where its performance was evaluated. The results confirm its ability to effectively account for variations in the liquor composition. Furthermore, it was able to give robust viscosity estimates in the presence of the changing pump’s operating point. Therefore, it is concluded that this study opens a new and an effective way for kraft black liquor viscosity sensor development...|$|E

40|$|A {{new system}} has been {{developed}} for removal of chloride contamination from kraft <b>process</b> <b>liquors.</b> The compact, skid-mounted system which utilizes ion exchange columns only 24 inches in height, is shown {{to be capable of}} removing 90 - 99 % of the chloride {{from a wide variety of}} sources including dissolved ESP catch, oxidized white liquor, spent bleach scrubber liquors, spent ion exchange demineralizer regenerants and caustic soda makeup. By removing chloride contamination, these liquors can be recycled to kraft recovery without causing a chloride buildup. By lowering the chloride content in kraft liquors, the sticky temperature of recovery boiler deposits can be significantly increased, which should lead to reduced pluggage and boiler down-time. Selectivity of the ion exchanger for chloride is extremely high and recovery of other chemicals such as sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide is demonstrated to be typically 92 - 98 %. Regeneration of sodium chloride from the resin is achieved with only water (ie. no chemicals), so that operating costs are negligable...|$|R
40|$|Cementation {{or metal}} {{displacement}} reactions such as Cu 2 + + Fe → Cu + Fe 2 + {{are among the}} oldest known hydrometallurgical reactions. They are still used in the recovery of some metals and in the purification of <b>process</b> <b>liquors</b> and waste water streams. However, they are often {{more complex than the}} stoichiometric reaction would suggest because they involve the simultaneous deposition of one metal onto a second which is dissolving. For example, sometimes a cementation will not take place, even though it is thermodynamically favoured. On other occasions, a cementation reaction will start but come to a halt as the depositing metal blankets the reacting surface. On yet other occasions, side reactions, catalyzed by the deposit, can be important. In this paper, the electrochemical basis of cementation reactions is described. The conditions for each of the complications encountered in these reactions are described and illustrated by examples drawn from a number of hydrometallurgical processes. The cementation reaction between activated carbon and gold thiosulfate is also briefly described, this reaction being unusual in that no dissolution of the carbon occurs...|$|R
