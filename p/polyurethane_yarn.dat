40|$|This paper studies a {{flexible}} fabric strain sensor from PPy-coated fabrics prepared by a {{chemical vapor deposition}} method under low temperature, placing an emphasis on mechanisms of its strain sensing behavior. In situ tensile tests in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were conducted for PPy-coated electrically conducting yarns, which were prepared by the same procedure as that for the PPy-coated fabrics, enabling it possible to observe in situ the phenomena that occurred on the fiber surface during fabric deformation. The investigation revealed that the PPy-coated nylon/polyurethane fabrics exhibited a high strain sensitivity of over 400 and very large workable strain range greater than 50 %, which mainly attributes to the high conductivity and crack-opening and crack-closing mechanisms of PPy-coated <b>polyurethane</b> <b>yarn,</b> {{as well as the}} excellent properties of knitted fabric structure.

Several prototypes of linear and bifurcated prostheses have been fabricated from polyester and <b>polyurethane</b> <b>yarns.</b> The main biomechanical properties, including deformation of wall of woven tubular implant in radial direction have been improved. In this case, the elastic deformation of a new synthetic prosthesis is close to a natural blood vessel. However, the geometric shape of the segment of the bifurcation has been improved.

Various scientists suggest {{a variety of}} methods and technologies of manufacture of artificial prostheses. Innovative designs of woven implants are actively being developed. The main task {{of this study is to}} create new design options for elastic structure of woven hollow tube and to produce vascular implants to ensure the best incorporation of the synthetic implant into total vascular system of the body. Structure of these implants composed of several type textile filaments and special composition of impregnated biomaterials. Implant is manufactured by woven method as a woven hollow tube using special weaves. In the process of weaving were used polyester and <b>polyurethane</b> <b>yarns.</b> Innovative woven product has the necessary biomechanical properties: tensile strength; circumferentially and longitudial elastic deformation; modulus of elasticity. This woven tube is further processed, including impregnation with a solution of biologically compounds. Solutions with various viscosity and structure were used and different proportions were studied in the course of the previous experiment. Natural elastic membrane was formed on the porous wall of the implant and in the space between the fibers. As a result woven frame and special impregnation created a composite matrix. Such impregnation ensures zero hydro permeability of the wall of the woven prosthesis. This factor is especially important during the first hours and days after implantation. In such circumstances, the blood does not leak through the wall and significantly reduces the risk of hemorrhage. Such impregnation of implant also provides better biocompatibility with natural body tissues and the successful integration into the vascular circulatory system. Natural biological tissues grow into the walls of the implant. Neointima is formed on the inner wall into the lumen of the implant. Composite structure of woven implant provides the normal long-term process of hemodynamics. A positive result was confirmed by physical and histological tests...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of this {{research}} work woven synthetic prosthesis reinforced with natural silk yarns was designed and manufactured. Biomechanical properties of surgical natural silk were studied during designing {{of the structure of the}} walls of the prosthesis. The experiment gave good data of elasticity and strain properties in a process of laboratory testing of samples of natural fibers. The previous practical experience was also used, for example, various vascular prostheses made from <b>polyurethane</b> complex <b>yarns</b> and polyester monofilaments. As a result, the authors of the scientific work proposed a combined wall structure of vascular prosthesis, consisting of polyester, polyurethane, and natural silk surgical yarns. After the implantation of the synthetic prosthesis reinforced with natural silk yarns, these natural silk yarns completely dissolve in the body for several years. Living tissue is gradually growing into the walls of synthetic prosthesis, replacing dissolved natural silk yarns.

The innovative structure of blood vessel prosthesis combined with such parameters can provide a long-term normal hemodynamics...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the possibility of applying natural silk yarn for composite structure of woven bio-resistant blood vessel prosthesis, which has good anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties. During the initial phase of research, the modern world experience of practical application of natural silk in surgical practice has been considered. The second phase of theoretical research has been devoted to the further study of modern science and practical experience of laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical application of natural silk fibres in different areas of cardiac surgery, including designing, manufacturing and implantation of vascular prostheses of various fibrous structure and geometric designs. In the process of implementation of the practical part of this scientific work, the authors propose an innovative woven tubular structure, consisting of three different types of warp and weft yarns: polyester, polyurethane and natural silk. Natural silk yarns needed for this purpose are made of silk fibroin fibres Bombyx mori. In the laboratory, the authors of the article have studied the mechanical and deformation properties of natural silk yarns needed to manufacture innovative implants of the blood vessels. The properties of <b>polyurethane</b> and polyester <b>yarns</b> were examined before, in the previous studies.
