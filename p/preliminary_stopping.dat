40|$|This thesis aims {{to explain}} {{the outcome of the}} WTO dispute on cotton {{subsidies}} between Brazil and US by analysing possible factors for the change in US policy vis-à-vis Brazil in the case. Brazil challenged US cotton subsidies through WTO dispute settlement in 2002, and the process has been running since, with a <b>preliminary</b> <b>stop</b> in June 2010. The WTO dispute settlement body issued two sets of recommendations in the case: One in 2005, after the first treatment of the case, and one in 2008 after the second. This essay attempts to explain why US changed their policy from after the first to after the second report. The essay concludes that the Brazilian threat of cross-retaliation was necessary for the change of US policy. However, more factors contributed to the outcome. The situation of the US economy, particularly {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis, enhanced the effect of the sanctions significantly. The cross-retaliation threat thus opened up a window of opportunity. The changed bilateral power relationship between US and Brazil was an important factor, as Brazil became a relatively more powerful actor. The role of the domestic ratification procedures in US played in, particularly in explaining why Brazil accepted the lack of full US compliance. Also, the relative strength of different US lobbies changed the US domestic coalition after the Brazilian cross-retaliation threat, weakening the US bargaining position...|$|R

500|$|Population {{frequencies}} of common APOA5 alleles exhibit large interethnic differences. For example, {{there are about}} 15% of carriers of the -1131C allele among Caucasians, but the frequency could reach even between 40% and 50% among Asians. In contrast, the Trp19 allele is very rare in the Asian population (less than 1% of carriers) but is common in Caucasians (about 15% of carriers). Vice versa, important SNP (rs2075291, G553T, Gly185˃Cys) with a population frequency of about 5% has been detected among Asians, but it is extremely rare among Caucasians. Sporadic publications refer to some other common polymorphisms, e.g. Val153˃Met (rs3135507, G457A) and also suggest significant sex-dependent associations with plasma lipids.

50|$|Within the APOA5 gene, {{a couple}} of {{important}} SNPs with a widely confirmed effect on plasma TG levels as well as rare mutations have been described. In Caucasians, the common variants are inherited mostly in three haplotypes, which are characterised by two SNPs, namely rs662799 (T-1131˃C; in almost complete LD with A-3˃G, where the minor allele is associated with about 50% lower gene expression) and rs3135506 (Ser19˃Trp; C56˃G; alters the signal peptide and influences APOA5 secretion into plasma).

40|$|Presentation to 23 rd Nordic Symposium on Tourism and Hospitality Research, Copenhagen Business School, 1 - 4 October 2014 The role of {{entrepreneurs}} as innovators and agents {{of change in}} tourism is still a neglected topic within the emergent research agenda of tourism innovation studies. The process of innovation has often {{been referred to as}} a "black box" and the studies of tourism innovation have mainly focused attention on the input (knowledge, capital etc.) and output of the process (nature and types of innovation, impact on performance etc.). This paper focuses on the entrepreneur, the key actor in the innovation process which is conceived as different stages of a journey that begins from idea generation and ends with its implementation, with varying degrees of success or failure. Tourism researchers have demonstrated the considerable diversity amongst tourism entrepreneurs, but that research has focused more on their motivations and resources than their role in innovation. One especially neglected strand {{of entrepreneurs}}hip is those who are new-to-tourism. Consequently, this study has two aims. First, it explores the characteristics and motivations of a sample of mainly new- to- tourism entrepreneurs. What motivates these entrepreneurs to invest in tourism and what distinctive knowledge and experiences to they bring to tourism innovation?. It also emphasizes the relational nature of innovation, for innovation is not the outcome of heroic individualism, but is a social and interactive process involving individuals with diverse talents and skills. Second, the study also aims to understand the complexity of the innovation process or journey, the barriers encountered at different stages, and how these are overcome. The two-step research method is based on a sample of entrepreneurs participating in a public programme in Spain, the Emprendetur Programme, which provides subsidized loans to fund entrepreneurs with innovative tourism projects. First, the <b>preliminary</b> <b>stop</b> is to identify the entrepreneurs' professional profiles and careers, using business networks such as LinkedIn, with data being corroborated by the entrepreneurs themselves through Skype video interviews. Secondly, semi structured interviews will provide opportunities for the entrepreneurs to narrate the stories of their innovation journeys, and reconstruct the challenges encountered at each decisive stage, and how these were overcome. Innovation has become a policy mantra in recent years, but the process of implementation is populated by diverse groups of entrepreneurs who marshal varied resources in order to overcome a range of internal and external barriers. This study identifies key features of the distinctive non-linear innovation journeys of the enigmatic group of new-to-tourism entrepreneurs. These demonstrate not only the importance of their distinctive human capital, but also how this is valorized through complex interactions with other individuals and agencies with complementary resources, which collectively constitute an innovation ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|There is {{controversy}} on {{the preferred}} {{mode of delivery}} (vaginal delivery (VD) versus caesarean section (CS)) in preterm breech delivery in relation to neonatal outcome. While CS {{is supposed to be}} safer for the fetus, arguments against CS can be the increased risk of maternal morbidity, risks for future pregnancies, and costs. Moreover, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome occurs more frequently after CS compared to VD. In the past, several RCTs have been started on this subject, but they were all <b>preliminary</b> and <b>stopped</b> due to recruitment difficulties. As the Cochrane review of these RCT's reported on 116 women only, knowledge on the effectiveness of CS and VD can at present only be obtained from non-randomized studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized studies that assessed the association between mode of delivery and neonatal mortality in women with preterm breech presentation. We searched Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane library for articles comparing neonatal mortality after VD versus CS in preterm breech presentation (gestational age 25 (+ 0) till 36 (+ 6) weeks). Seven studies, involving a total of 3557 women, met the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. The weighted risk of neonatal mortality was 3. 8 % in the CS group and 11. 5 % in the VD group (pooled RR 0. 63 (95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 81)).

In response, Warner Bros. claimed that any delay in the film's release would result in huge financial costs and argued that there was no legal precedent for the case, saying that the use of a permanent tattoo on a human's face could not be controlled.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which federal moral rights law protects authorized graffiti and aerosol art against destruction, {{in the context of the}} controversy over the destruction of 5 Pointz. 5 Pointz, a sprawling complex of warehouse buildings in Queens, was a Mecca for aerosol art. The buildings’ owners ordered the demolition of 5 Pointz after the November 2013 order by New York federal district judge Frederic Block denying the artists a <b>preliminary</b> injunction to <b>stop</b> destruction under the federal moral rights statute, the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA). This paper argues that Judge Block erred in finding that the transient nature of the aerosol art at 5 Pointz precluded injunctive relief under VARA. Judge Block failed to adequately take into account both the statute’s preservationist rationale and the non-economic nature of moral rights. Money damages will not always adequately compensate artists for the destruction of aerosol artworks like those at 5 Pointz. The paper describes the creation of the aerosol art at 5 Pointz and the moral rights litigation over its destruction, which remains ongoing at time of writing. It shows that VARA was enacted for the purpose of preserving art because of its social and cultural value. It contends that aerosol art such as that at 5 Pointz is not barred from protection under VARA as site-specific art. However, VARA only protects art that has achieved significant social and cultural value in that it has “recognized stature. ” Aerosol art can, as Judge Block correctly recognized, achieve such recognized stature. However, Judge Block erred in finding that the transient nature of the 5 Pointz aerosol art disentitled it to preliminary injunctive relief. This approach failed to recognize the difference between traditional economic copyright rights and VARA’s non-economic moral rights. VARA’s Building Exception provides for a way to resolve the conflict between preserving artwork on buildings and private ownership rights in those buildings. The transient nature of the art is not a factor under the Building Exception. Where artwork cannot be removed from a building without damaging it, as is arguably the case for the 5 Pointz art, the artist has a moral right against destruction of art of “recognized stature” unless he has entered into a waiver agreement with the building’s owner. While VARA may sit uncomfortably with private property rights, judges need to respect the balance between moral rights of artists and the rights of building owners set out in the Building Exception...|$|R
40|$|Data mining is {{the process}} of {{discovering}} useful patterns from datasets using intelligent techniques to help users make certain decisions. A typical data mining task is classification, which involves predicting a target variable known as the class in previously unseen data based on models learnt from an input dataset. Covering is a well-known classification approach that derives models with If-Then rules. Covering methods, such as PRISM, have a competitive predictive performance to other classical classification techniques such as greedy, decision tree and associative classification. Therefore, Covering models are appropriate decision-making tools and users favour them carrying out decisions. Despite the use of Covering approach in data processing for different classification applications, it is also acknowledged that this approach suffers from the noticeable drawback of inducing massive numbers of rules making the resulting model large and unmanageable by users. This issue is attributed to the way Covering techniques induce the rules as they keep adding items to the rule’s body, despite the limited data coverage (number of training instances that the rule classifies), until the rule becomes with zero error. This excessive learning overfits the training dataset and also limits the applicability of Covering models in decision making, because managers normally prefer a summarised set of knowledge that they are able to control and comprehend rather a high maintenance models. In practice, there should be a trade-off between the number of rules offered by a classification model and its predictive performance. Another issue associated with the Covering models is the overlapping of training data among the rules, which happens when a rule’s classified data are discarded during the rule discovery phase. Unfortunately, the impact of a rule’s removed data on other potential rules is not considered by this approach. However, When removing training data linked with a rule, both frequency and rank of other rules’ items which have appeared in the removed data are updated. The impacted rules should maintain their true rank and frequency in a dynamic manner during the rule discovery phase rather just keeping the initial computed frequency from the original input dataset. In response to the aforementioned issues, a new dynamic learning technique based on Covering and rule induction, that we call Enhanced Dynamic Rule Induction (eDRI), is developed. eDRI has been implemented in Java and it has been embedded in WEKA machine learning tool. The developed algorithm incrementally discovers the rules using primarily frequency and rule strength thresholds. These thresholds in practice limit the search space for both items as well as potential rules by discarding any with insufficient data representation as early as possible resulting in an efficient training phase. More importantly, eDRI substantially cuts down the number of training examples scans by continuously updating potential rules’ frequency and strength parameters in a dynamic manner whenever a rule gets inserted into the classifier. In particular, and for each derived rule, eDRI adjusts on the fly the remaining potential rules’ items frequencies as well as ranks specifically for those that appeared within the deleted training instances of the derived rule. This gives a more realistic model with minimal rules redundancy, and makes the process of rule induction efficient and dynamic and not static. Moreover, the proposed technique minimises the classifier’s number of rules at <b>preliminary</b> stages by <b>stopping</b> learning when any rule does not meet the rule’s strength threshold therefore minimising overfitting and ensuring a manageable classifier. Lastly, eDRI prediction procedure not only priorities using the best ranked rule for class forecasting of test data but also restricts the use of the default class rule thus reduces the number of misclassifications. The aforementioned improvements guarantee classification models with smaller size that do not overfit the training dataset, while maintaining their predictive performance. The eDRI derived models particularly benefit greatly users taking key business decisions since they can provide a rich knowledge base to support their decision making. This is because these models’ predictive accuracies are high, easy to understand, and controllable as well as robust, i. e. flexible to be amended without drastic change. eDRI applicability has been evaluated on the hard problem of phishing detection. Phishing normally involves creating a fake well-designed website that has identical similarity to an existing business trustful website aiming to trick users and illegally obtain their credentials such as login information in order to access their financial assets. The experimental results against large phishing datasets revealed that eDRI is highly useful as an anti-phishing tool since it derived manageable size models when compared with other traditional techniques without hindering the classification performance. Further evaluation results using other several classification datasets from different domains obtained from University of California Data Repository have corroborated eDRI’s competitive performance with respect to accuracy, number of knowledge representation, training time and items space reduction. This makes the proposed technique not only efficient in inducing rules but also effective...|$|R
