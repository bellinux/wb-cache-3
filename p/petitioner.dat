In 2013, <b>petitioners</b> became unable to make their mortgage payments and contacted PNC for hardship assistance. PNC failed to send a hardship assistance package to <b>petitioners.</b> Despite that failure, PNC later notified <b>petitioners</b> that their request for hardship assistance was denied “because PNC did not receive a completed hardship assistance package” from <b>petitioners</b> and recorded a notice of default. In November 2013, <b>petitioners</b> submitted a loan modification agreement to PNC; in December 2013, PNC confirmed that it had received a complete package. Despite that pending loan modification, PNC recorded a notice of trustee’s sale of the property in January 2014. <b>Petitioners</b> immediately called PNC and were told that their loan modification had been denied due to missing documents...|$|R

5000|$|In ancient {{imperial}} times, <b>petitioners</b> {{were called}} [...] "people with grievances" [...] (yuānmín). <b>Petitioners</b> who needed justice {{would come to}} the yamen of the County magistrate or high official and beat a drum to voice their grievances. As such, every official court was supposed to be equipped with a drum for this sole purpose. Sometimes <b>petitioners</b> would throw their bodies in front of a sedan chair of the high official.

5|$|Counsel for the <b>petitioner</b> {{discussed}} {{at great length}} from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court. The <b>petitioner,</b> Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to be considered for the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on 29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.|$|E

The tax commissioner, however, determined that <b>petitioners</b> had an unqualified right to payment as of the delivery of the wheat in August 1944, and should be considered to have realized gains on the sale in the year 1944. <b>Petitioners</b> appealed this decision.|$|R
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI.

Petitions may also be filed on the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work (which sends inspection teams throughout the country).

5|$|On December 29, 2014, Bank Markazi filed a {{petition}} for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting the Court {{to consider the}} question: Does §8772 violate {{the separation of powers}} by purporting to change the law for, and directing a particular result in, a single pending case? The certiorari petition was circulated to the Justices for their conference on April 3, 2015, after a brief by the respondents (Peterson) opposing certiorari and a reply brief from the <b>petitioner</b> (Bank Markazi) were filed in March. Following the April 3rd conference, the Court called for the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the federal government, which was filed on August 19. In May and June, the Supreme Court meets only to issue orders and opinions and does not hear oral arguments until the next term begins.

5|$|Once the Earl Marshal has {{approved}} the petition he will issue his Warrant to the King of Arms, {{this will allow}} them to proceed with the granting of the arms.

These will include allusions and references to the applicant's life and achievements. The design of any new coat of arms must abide by all the rules of heraldry as well as being entirely original and distinct from all previous arms recorded at the College's archives.

5000|$|<b>Petitioners</b> were subpoenaed {{to appear}} before a United States grand jury in the Central District of California on February 4, 1971.

Prior to the scheduled appearances, the government applied to the District Court for an order directing <b>petitioners</b> to answer questions and produce evidence {{before the grand jury}} under a grant of immunity conferred pursuant to [...] <b>Petitioners</b> opposed issuance of the order, contending primarily that the scope of the immunity provided by the statute was not coextensive with the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination and so was not sufficient to supplant the privilege and compel their testimony. The District Court rejected ordered <b>petitioners</b> {{to appear before}} the grand jury and answer its questions, under the grant of immunity.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Petitioners</b> protest {{abortion}} clinics run by Respondents. The <b>Petitioners</b> picketed and demonstrated where the public street gives {{access to the}} clinic. The <b>Petitioners</b> have been permanently enjoined by a Florida court from blocking or interfering with public access to the clinic and from physically abusing persons entering or leaving the clinic. Six months later, the Respondents sought to broaden the injunction, complaining that the <b>Petitioners</b> still impede potential patients. The trial court then issued a broader injunction, for which the <b>Petitioners</b> challenge {{as a violation of}} their First Amendment constitutional rights. The Amendment injunction prohibits the <b>Petitioners</b> from entering the premises of the Respondents, blocking or impeding access to the Respondents’ premises, from picketing and demonstrating or entering a portion of public right of way or private property within 36 feet of the property line of the Clinic, from causing excess noise from 7:30 am to noon Monday thru Saturday when procedures and recovery periods occur, from physically approaching or causing noise within 300 feet of any of the Respondents’ employees homes, from harassing anyone trying to gain access Respondents’ clinic, from displaying certain objectionable images and from inciting others to commit any of these prohibited acts. Upon appeal the Florida Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the injunction, causing the <b>Petitioners</b> to appeal.|$|R

5|$|Clan MacAulay dates, with certainty, to the 16th century. The clan {{was engaged}} in several feuds with {{neighbouring}} clans. However, the clan's fortunes declined in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the decline and fall of Clan MacAulay, which ended {{with the death of}} Aulay MacAulay in the mid-18th century, the clan became dormant. With the revival of interest in Scottish clans in the 20th century a movement was organised to revive Clan MacAulay. The modern organisation strove to unite the three unrelated groups of MacAulays, and all who bore the surname MacAulay, under one clan and chief. In 2002, the clan appointed a potential chief of Clan MacAulay, but his petition for formal recognition was denied by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The Lord Lyon ruled that the <b>petitioner</b> did not meet two criteria: anyone without a blood link to a past chief must be Clan Commander for ten years before being considered for recognition, and that the chiefship in question was of the MacAulays of Ardincaple and not of all MacAulays. To date, Clan MacAulay does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, and therefore can be considered an Armigerous clan.|$|E

While anonymous signatures address some privacy concerns for online <b>petitioners,</b> they often fail to identify <b>petitioners</b> as numerically distinct and socially relevant persons, Since anonymous signatures often fail to personally identify online <b>petitioners,</b> they often fail to provide sufficient reason for targeted political authorities to review and respond to their grievances. To recover the personal rhetoric of the online petition in a way that strikes a balance between the publicity and privacy concerns of <b>petitioners,</b> we should reformat online petitions as pseudonymous social networks of personal testimony between <b>petitioners</b> and targeted political authorities.
