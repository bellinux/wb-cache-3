5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed to take their place. Part of these old horse trails are still in use and known as <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Road</b> and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Road</b> meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, {{this version}} of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 {{traveled}} on <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Road</b> in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north {{from the corner of}} Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met back up with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however later in the year the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route. By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|M-34 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with M-99 {{just west of}} Osseo. M-99 approaches Osseo from the west along Hudson Road and where M-99 turns south along <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Road,</b> M-34 continues east along Hudson Road. The highway turns to the southeast {{to the south of}} Osseo near Deer Lake and continues towards Pittsford. Hudson Road runs through a mix of forests and local farms. The trunkline passes to the south of the main business district in Pittsford. East of town, the highway turns east and intersects US Highway 127 (US127) at the Hillsdale–Lenawee county line in Hudson. The trunkline continues eastward through the city of Hudson as Main Street. On the eastern edge of town, it becomes Carleton Road and passes through more farmland. Just south of Clayton, M-34 has a junction with the northern terminus of M-156, a connector highway that runs south into Ohio and US20.|$|E

5|$|SR15 {{ends at the}} Michigan {{state line}} just north of Pioneer, Ohio, where it becomes M-99. The roadway travels northward from the state line on <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Road,</b> through mostly {{agricultural}} areas of Hillsdale County before reaching a junction with M-34 just west of Osseo. The trunkline turns westward on Hudson Road, which curves to the north around Baw Beese Lake just southeast of Hillsdale. M-99 passes through Hillsdale on a northwest course on Broad Street and Carlton Road, passing {{just a few blocks}} to the west of Hillsdale College. After leaving town, the road bends to the north as Olds Street as it runs parallel to the St. Joseph River to Jonesville. In that community, M-99 intersects US12. The two highways run concurrently through Jonesville for less than half a mile (0.8km) before M-99 returns to its northwesterly course. It leaves the town toward Litchfield continuing parallel to the river.|$|E

500|$|With the {{establishment}} of settlements and population came the attendant need for education, health, fire and police protection and an urgent need to improve methods of travel. The North-West Territories established departments, which did not last long, and were soon replaced by a rural administrative system called local improvement districts (LID). Local improvement districts were very large, and with the early dirt trails for roads, and {{a limited number of}} automobiles, the area was found much too large to administer. The LID soon gave way to the rural municipality (RM) system of rural civic administration and encompassed on average nine townships, three by three in area, which were each [...] square, and with some modifications is still the rural administration in use today.

500|$|The highway meets US10 near Sears after {{crossing}} the Pere Marquette State Trail. M-66 crosses the Muskegon River near a separate 9 Mile Road in Osceola County. It meets both M-115 and M-61 (16 Mile Road) south of Marion. The highway continues north and crosses the Great Lakes Central Railroad {{for the first}} time in Marion, before entering Missaukee County. [...] The trunkline then turns westward on Stoney Corners Road toward McBain through farm land. In town it runs along Maple Street and then runs north toward Lake City on Morey Road. South of the Lake City, M-55 runs concurrently with M-66 by Missaukee Golf Course and into town along the eastern shore of Lake Missaukee. North of town, M-55 splits off to the east on Houghton Lake Road, and M-66 continues north to an intersection with the eastern terminus of M-42 in a rural forest. M-66 leaves Morey Road and follows <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Road</b> to the county line.|$|E

A rural municipality (R.M.) was an elected governing system providing essential services such as police, fire, health, education and infrastructure services for rural residents. For example, L.I.D. 64 was the precursor of Brock No. 64 in the district of Assiniboia, North West Territories. Historically, community residents could pay taxes or supply a couple days per quarter section labour constructing roads, bridges, and fireguards instead of paying taxes. This civic government with its elected officials attended to the maintenance and construction of the early <b>pioneer</b> <b>road.</b> Two horse then eight horse scrapers maintained these early dirt roads.|$|E

With time, the track from <b>Pioneer</b> Cemetery <b>Road</b> was lost and a new access gained running south from now McLeod Road.

5|$|Under {{the newly}} formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English {{initiatives}} combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy {{paved the way for}} the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and <b>pioneering</b> <b>road,</b> rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain.
