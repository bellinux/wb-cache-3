40|$|Background. Malnutrition in hospitalized {{children}} can be prevented if children with risk of malnutrition are identified. Every hospital is recommended to have a standard nutritional <b>screening</b> <b>tool.</b> Numerous simple <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> have been developed, namely Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS), <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP), and <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> for Risk on Nutritional Status and Growth (STRONG-kids).

Our study aims {{to determine the best}} <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> compared to Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA), an assessment tool which is more complex as our gold standard. Methods. This diagnostic study involved 116 patients aged 1 – 15 years. Three <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> and SGNA were examined to each subject. Statistical analysis was used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) by results from <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> divided into low and moderate-high risk of malnutrition compared to results from SGNA divided into no and moderate-severe malnutrition.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} an alternate approach for {{the calculation of}} sensitivity and specificity when analyzing the accuracy of <b>screening</b> <b>tools,</b> {{which can be used}} when standard calculations may be inappropriate. Sensitivity (ER denoting event rate) is the number of events correctly predicted, divided {{by the total number of}} events. Specificity is the amount of time that study participants are predicted to be event negative, divided by the total amount of participant observed time. Variance estimates for these statistics are constructed by bootstrap resampling, taking into account event dependence. Methods: Standard and alternate approaches for calculating sensitivity and specificity were applied to hospital falls risk <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> data. In this application, the outcome of interest was a recurrent event, there were multiple applications of the <b>screening</b> <b>tool,</b> delays in <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> completion, and patients 2 ̆ 7 follow-up durations were unequal. Results: Application of sensitivity and specificity to this data not only provided a clearer description of the <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> 2 ̆ 7 s overall accuracy, but also allowed examination of accuracy over time, accuracy in predicting specific event numbers, and evaluation of the added value that <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> reapplications may have.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the quick-and-easy undernutrition <b>screening</b> <b>tools,</b> ie, Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire and Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool,</b> in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with respect to their accuracy in detecting undernutrition measured by a low-fat free mass index (FFMI; calculated as kg/m(2)), and secondly, to assess their association with postoperative adverse outcomes. Between February 2008 and December 2009, a single-center observational cohort study was performed (n= 325). A low FFMI was set at ≤ 14. 6 in women and ≤ 16. 7 in men measured using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. To compare the accuracy of the Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire in detecting low FFMI sensitivity, specificity, and other accuracy test characteristics were calculated. The associations between the Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire and adverse outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression analyses with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) presented. Sensitivity and receiver operator characteristic-based area under the curve to detect low FFMI were 59 % and 19 %, and 0. 71 (95 % CI: 0. 60 to 0. 82) and 0. 56 (95 % CI: 0. 44 to 0. 68) for the Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire, respectively. Accuracy of the Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> improved when age and sex were added to the nutritional screening process (sensitivity 74 %, area under the curve: 0. 72 [95 % CI: 0. 62 to 0. 82]). This modified version of the Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool,</b> but not the original Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> or Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire, was associated with prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay (odds ratio: 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 3 to 3. 4; odds ratio: 1. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 0 to 2. 7).

Methods Reviews of the literature and national and local datasets were used to identify the types of <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> available for different age groups, the origins of age-related criteria, {{and the value of}} tool selection procedures based on predicting clinical outcomes. Results Nutrition screening can be undertaken in fetuses, children, and adults over narrow or wide age ranges, for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, with or without nutritional interventions. Certain tools can establish malnutrition risk without using any nutritional criteria, whereas others can do so only with nutritional criteria. The incorporation of age and age-specific body mass index criteria into adult <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> can influence the prevalence and age distribution of malnutrition, but no justification is usually provided for their use. In several circumstances, age alone can predict mortality and length of hospital stay much better than <b>screening</b> <b>tools.</b> We identified various methodologic problems in nutrition <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> selection.

40|$|Body dysmorphic {{disorder}} (BDD) is {{a well-established}} psychiatric disorder {{characterized by a}} marked, distressing, and impairing preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance.

There are other versions of the MAST <b>screening</b> <b>tool,</b> all of which can be self-administered or via interview with someone who is trained in the tool being used. All of the MAST <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> are scored on a point scale system.As stated on the Project Cork website [...] there are 25 questions to the [...] "MAST" [...] <b>screening</b> <b>tool.</b> The benefits and shortcomings are closely tied to this <b>screening</b> <b>tool.</b> The length of the <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> makes administering it inconvenient in many busy primary health care settings along with emergency room settings. As well the tool mainly focuses on the patient’s problems throughout their lifetime rather than the problems the patient is currently showing signs of. The questions throughout the <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> operate in the past tense, which means that it is less likely to detect any problems with alcohol in its early stages according to Buddy, T. The extended questioning is a benefit in a sense that you accomplish a bit of the assessment section when conducting the screening; furthermore, allowing the individual who is conducting the screening to achieve better communication and rapport with the client. The MAST-G <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> is directed towards screening geriatric clients. With the MAST-G tool there is a set of 24 questions rather than the previous 25 questions as in the [...] "MAST" [...] tool. There has always been an underlying question as to the sensitivity and reliability when questioning geriatric clients. [...] The Brief MAST tool is much shorter than the previous and contains only 10 questions. There is also the Short-MAST tool similar to the brief; however, it contains 13 questions. The final version is the Short-MAST-G tool, which is the short geriatric <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> containing only 10 questions, according to.Which tool to use is predicted by the screener who is a trained individual, wherein there is no one specific <b>tool</b> for such <b>screening</b> and is basically conducted on a trial and error basis.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} commonly applied nutrition <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> and measures and to consider the potential costs of undiagnosed malnutrition in a case-based reimbursement funding environment. Design A diagnostic accuracy study to compare a variety of nutrition screening techniques against primary, secondary, and comparative measures of nutritional status. Setting Public metropolitan hospital orthogeriatric unit. Participants Individuals with acute hip fracture admitted to the orthogeriatric unit; 150 prospective, consecutively admitted individuals were considered, with eight exclusions, yielding a sample size of 142 participants. Measurements Screens included the Mini Nutritional Assessment - Short Form, Malnutrition <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool,</b> Malnutrition Universal <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool,</b> Nutrition Risk <b>Screen</b> 2002, anthropometric measures, and albumin. Malnutrition was diagnosed using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Edition, Australian Modification (ICD- 10 -AM) criteria. Healthcare coders costed malnutrition-related diagnostic related groups and cost-weight changes for individual participants. Results Malnutrition prevalence was 48 %. <b>Screening</b> <b>tools</b> had only slight to moderate agreement with ICD- 10 -AM diagnosis of malnutrition, {{and none of the}} <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> tested met the a priori requirement of 80 % sensitivity and 60 % specificity. The estimated cost effect of poor <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> sensitivity on a 16 -bed hip fracture unit ranged from AUS 46, 506 to AUS 228, 896 per year. Conclusion Poor <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> sensitivity leads to undiagnosed malnutrition; tools that are quick and easy to apply are not without cost. Routine nutrition assessment should replace nutrition risk screening in hip fracture settings with a high prevalence of malnutrition reliant on case-mix funding. Further pragmatic studies are urgently required to determine whether findings apply to other elderly inpatient populations with endemic malnutrition, comorbidities, and cognitive impairment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{malnutrition}} <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> {{have been}} advocated {{for use in}} pediatric inpatients. Objective: We evaluated how 3 popular pediatric nutrition <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> [i. e., the Pediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS), the <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics (STAMP), and the <b>Screening</b> <b>Tool</b> for Risk of Impaired Nutritional Status and Growth (STRONG(KIDS)) ] compared with and were related to anthropometric measures, body composition, and clinical variables in patients who were admitted to tertiary hospitals across Europe. Design: The 3 <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> were applied in 2567 inpatients at 14 hospitals across 12 European countries. The classification of patients into different nutritional risk groups was compared between tools and related to anthropometric measures and clinical variables [e. g., length of hospital stay (LOS) and infection rates]. Results: A similar rate of completion of the <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> for each tool was achieved (PYMS: 86 %;. STAMP: 84 %; and STRONG(KIDS) : 81 %). Risk classification differed markedly by tool, with an overall agreement of 41 % between tools. Children categorized as high risk (PYMS: 25 %; STAMP: 23 %; and STRONG(KIDS) : 10 %) had a longer LOS than that of children at low risk (1. 4, 1. 4, and 1. 8 d longer, respectively; P < 0. 001). In high-risk patients identified with the PYMS, 22 % of them had low (Conclusions: The identification and classification of malnutrition risk varied across the pediatric tools used. A considerable portion of children with subnormal anthropometric measures were not identified {{with all of the}} tools. The data obtained do not allow recommending the use of any of these <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> for clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Kate Beaton, Karen Grimmer International Centre for Allied Health Evidence, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia Background: Screening {{for risk}} of {{functional}} {{decline in the}} elderly is increasingly important in ambulatory health care settings, to ensure that appropriate services are provided {{to reduce the risk}} of downstream decline. These <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> should have sound psychometric properties and clinical utility. Design: An updated systematic literature review for (1) new <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> published since the last review, conducted in 2007 and published in 2008, and (2) recent research into psychometric properties of the five tools identified in the previous review. Methods: A comprehensive review of multiple databases using the search terms from the Sutton et al review was conducted. The reference lists of included articles were hand-searched for additional articles, and the literature was evaluated with the appropriate critical appraisal <b>tool.</b> Included <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> should be designed for, or applicable to, hospital emergency departments. Results: Two relevant new tools were identified (the Simplified PROFUNCTION index and Brief Risk Identification for Geriatric Health Tool). Six additional papers testing psychometric properties of four of the five previously reported <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> were also found. Conclusion: Seven relevant <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> are available with similar validity and reliability estimates. They consider similar constructs and have convincing evidence of applicability to a range of older populations, or different cultures. Identification of Seniors at Risk, is the most frequently reported <b>screening</b> <b>tool.</b> The wider unanswered question is how, why, and where these functional decline <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> are used; how valid the findings are on ill, stressed, older people in emergency departments; and how the findings are acted upon in terms of community intervention to slow functional decline.
