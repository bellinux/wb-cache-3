40|$|Many {{children}} with diabetes require small doses of insulin administered with syringes or <b>pen-injector</b> devices (at the Booth Hall Paediatric Diabetic Clinic, 20 % of children aged 0 - 5 years receive 1 - 2 U insulin doses). To determine how accurately and reproducibly small doses are delivered, 1, 2, 5, and 10 U doses of soluble insulin (100 U/ml) were dispensed in random order 15 times from five new NovoPens (1. 5 ml), five BD-Pens (1. 5 ml), and by five nurses using 30 U syringes. Each dose was weighed, and intended and actual doses compared. The two pen-injectors delivered less insulin than syringes, differences being {{inversely proportional to}} dose. For 1 U (mean (SD)) : 0. 89 (0. 04) U (NovoPen), 0. 92 (0. 03) U (BD-Pen), 1. 23 (0. 09) U (syringe); and for 10 U: 9. 8 (0. 1) U (NovoPen), 9. 9 (0. 1) U (BD-Pen), 10. 1 (0. 1) U (syringe). The accuracy (percentage errors) of the pen-injectors was similar and more accurate than syringes delivering 1, 2, and 5 U of insulin. Errors for 1 U: 11 (4) % (NovoPen), 8 (3) % (BD-Pen), 23 (9) % (syringe). The reproducibility (coefficient of variation) of actual doses was similar (< 7 %) for all three devices, which were equally consistent at underdosing (pen-injectors) or overdosing (syringes) insulin. All three devices, especially syringes, are unacceptably inaccurate when delivering 1 U doses of insulin. Patients on low doses need to be educated that their dose may alter when they transfer from one device to another. ...|$|E

Such devices are used for the subcutaneous delivery of biopharmaceuticals, primarily for self-administration by the patient. The {{study was conducted with}} a broad user population, defined to represent user characteristics across a range of indications. The goals of the study were to confirm that the pen could be used without recurring patterns of use errors leading to hazardous situations, to evaluate the comprehension of the instructions for use (IFU), and to determine if training is necessary. In the study, a total of 36 participants in six groups (health care providers, caregivers, adolescents, diabetics with retinopathy, diabetics with neuropathy, and patients with arthritis) each read the IFU, prepared the device, and performed two simulated injections into an injection pad. Any use errors, near misses, or deviations from the IFU procedure were recorded. The overall success rate (injection completed by the participant without need for assistance) was 94 % for the first and 100 % for the second injection. Ninety-two percent of the participants reported that they felt confident using the device, 100 % found the IFU helpful, and 75 % found the device positively comfortable to use. Overall, a total average of 3. 35 deviations and errors per user and injection were recorded (there were no near misses). Subtracting the errors without any potential for negative consequences for the injection or the user (trivial deviations), as well as those related to attaching and removing the pen needle (independent of the design of the pen itself), led to an average of 1. 31 potentially relevant deviations per user and injection. It was concluded that the pen injector together with the IFU could be safely and efficiently used by all user groups without any training, and thus that the device and IFU in their current form are well suited for use in a range of specific applications.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess {{accuracy}} of Omnican (R) insulin pen needles (29 G and 30 G) by measuring the weight of insulin delivered in each of 10 depressions of the plunger comparing these using other <b>pen-injectors</b> (Humapen (R) and Novopen (R) for each gauge. We found that the needle-to-needle variation {{was not statistically significant}} when the needles were used to dispense insulin using either of the insulin pens (Humapen (R) and Novopen (R). HumaPen (R) insulin pen was found to deliver the insulin closer to set target volume using either gauge (29 G and 30 G) of the Omnican (R) needles in some of the insulin ranges used in this study...|$|R
