The same circumstance of distance renders the noxious effects of an evil system in any community less pernicious. But there are situations where this difficulty does not occur, and in which, therefore, those duties are obligatory and these rights are to be asserted. It has ever been the method of public jurists to draw {{a great part of}} the analogies on which they form the law of nations from the principles of law which prevail in civil community. Civil laws are not all of them merely positive. Those which are rather conclusions of legal reason than matters of statutable provision belong to universal equity, and are universally applicable. Almost the whole prætorian law is such. There is a law of neighborhood which does not leave a man perfect master on his own ground. When a neighbor sees a new erection, in the nature of a nuisance, set up at his door, he has a right to represent it to the judge, who, on his part, has a right to order the work to be stayed, or, if established, to be removed. On this head the <b>parent</b> <b>law</b> is express and clear, and has made many wise provisions, which, without destroying, regulate and restrain the right of ownership by the right of vicinage. No innovation is permitted that may redound, even secondarily, to the prejudice of a neighbor. The whole doctrine of that important head of prætorian law, [...] "De novi operis nunciatione," [...] is founded on the principle, that no new use should be made of a man's private liberty of operating upon his private property, from whence a detriment may be justly apprehended by his neighbor. This law of denunciation is prospective. It is to anticipate what is called damnum infectum or damnum nondum factum, that is, a damage justly apprehended, but not actually done. Even before it is clearly known whether the innovation be damageable or not, the judge is competent to issue a prohibition to innovate until the point can be determined. This prompt interference is grounded on principles favorable to both parties. It is preventive of mischief difficult to be repaired, and of ill blood difficult to be softened. The rule of law, therefore, which comes before the evil is amongst the very best parts of equity, and justifies the promptness of the remedy; because, as it is well observed, [...] "Res damni infecti celeritatem desiderat, et periculosa est dilatio." [...] This right of denunciation does not hold, when things continue, however inconveniently to the neighborhood, according to the ancient mode. For there is a sort of presumption against novelty, drawn out of a deep consideration of human nature and human affairs; and the maxim of jurisprudence is well laid down, [...] "Vetustas pro lege semper habetur." ...|$|E
6000|$|This violent {{breach in}} the {{community}} of Europe we must conclude to have been made (even if they had not expressly declared it over and over again) either to force mankind into an adoption of their system, or to live in perpetual enmity with a community the most potent we have ever known. Can any person imagine, that, in offering to mankind this desperate alternative, there is no indication of a hostile mind, because men in possession of the ruling authority are supposed to have a right to act without coercion in their own territories. As to the right of men to act anywhere according to their pleasure, without any moral tie, no such right exists. Men are never in a state of TOTAL independence of each other. It is not the condition of our nature: nor is it conceivable how any man can pursue a considerable course of action without its having some effect upon others; or, of course, without producing some degree of responsibility for his conduct. The SITUATIONS in which men relatively stand produce the rules and principles of that responsibility, and afford directions to prudence in exacting it. Distance of place does not extinguish the duties or the rights of men; but it often renders their exercise impracticable. The same circumstance of distance renders the noxious effects of an evil system in any community less pernicious.

[...] In the 2010 report it was noted that: [...] "delays in processing and enforcement often go on for weeks or months years, Swiss courts often treat Convention cases as custody decisions, invoking the child's “best interests” {{as a reason for}} denying return, and performing merits-based custody assessments, Swiss courts - up to and including Switzerland's highest court, often show bias toward the abducting parent, especially when the taking parent is the mother". High-level Swiss officials have defended this practice citing the “special relationship” between mothers and young children as influencing its decision to uphold the lower court's denial of the left-behind parent's application for return of an abducted child to the United States. The report also observed that Swiss authorities are reluctant to actively enforce orders granting return to the United States or access to the child by the left-behind <b>parent.</b> <b>Law</b> enforcement has made only cursory efforts to locate taking parent and abducted children.|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} a tension has {{existed between the}} law of the European Union {{governing}} motor vehicle insurance and the UK’s transposition, interpretation and application of its national law. Cases including Delaney v Pickett & Tradewise [2011] EWCA Civ 1532 and EUI v Bristol Alliance Partnership[2012] EWCA Civ 1267 have demonstrated the UK’s misunderstanding of its legal obligations in this area and has led to the award of damages to affected individuals against the UK. On 5 December 2016 the Court of Appeal issued its judgment in the case Sahin v Havard and Riverstone Insurance (UK) Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 1202. The Court was tasked to apply provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to a victim of an unauthorised driver in a claim against the policyholder and the insurer. It is argued here that the Court has misunderstood and misapplied the EU <b>parent</b> <b>law</b> in its application of national law. The case may ultimately be determined by the Supreme Court but it is a ruling of sufficient significance in its lack of adherence to EU law and, given the notoriety of cases demonstrating the inconsistencies of the Court of Appeal’s decisions in motor vehicle insurance law, it is worrying that these judgments seemingly have been ignored. The ruling also has important implications for the consequences that Brexit will have on motor vehicle insurance. This is particularly if, as is expected, the UK pursues a ‘hard Brexit’ without access to the single market and the need to comply with the free movement principles through which the motor vehicle insurance directives are based. The UK would therefore be freed of the compatibility issues demonstrated in Sahin, but this will likely leave third party victims in a weaker position...|$|E
40|$|This article {{calls for}} a {{rethinking}} of the modern boundaries between the regulation of spousal relations and the regulation of parenthood, including joint parenthood. My main argument is that important legal rules that are currently {{at the core of}} spousal law possess a dramatic influence on children’s lives. Thus, I will critique the current legal regulation that limits the influence of {{the best interests of the}} child principle to the regime of law that is currently classified as <b>parent</b> <b>law</b> but almost completely ignores its application in regimes currently classified as spousal law. Apart from the theoretical discussion concerning the ideal law, we shall also discuss the current positive law (state laws and international laws, especially the Convention on the Rights of the Child). In this context we will criticize legal arrangements that limit the influence of the best interest of the child principle to the traditional territory of parenthood law. Nonetheless, in the spirit of Dworkin’s aspiration to present the existing law in its best light, I will also try to suggest interpretations of the existing law that allow us to overcome the current dichotomy between spousal law and parenthood law. In this context, a unique attention dedicates to the phrase actions concerning children, which define in which law 2 ̆ 7 s area the best interest of the child should be a primary consideration. We oppose the current rigid dichotomy between children – parent 2 ̆ 7 s law which considered to be actions concerning children in which the best interest of the child is the primary, if not the only consideration, to spousal law which is not considered actions concerning children and therefore the interest of the child, is almost neglected. We suggest replacing this rigid distinction with flexible formulation, which tries to identify the best interest of the child in different aspect of life and to balance this interest with the interests of other parties of the family...|$|E

5000|$|Once {{the shared}} <b>parenting</b> <b>laws</b> were in place, {{there was a}} {{significant}} push by women's groups in association with other interested parties, suggesting that Australia's shared <b>parenting</b> <b>laws</b> put children at risk because it marginalised family violence. Specifically it was alleged that [...] "the legislation had moved away from protecting the rights of women and children to acceding to men’s demand for increased time with their children." [...] In 2009 the government commissioned a report into the shared <b>parenting</b> <b>laws,</b> justified as being a response to the murder of a four-year-old Melbourne girl Darcey Freeman, who was thrown to her death from the West Gate Bridge by her father. Her father Arthur Freeman had obtained shared custody with his daughter through the family court. The story of Arthur Freeman was well but falsely publicised {{as an example of the}} danger that separated fathers posed to their children, despite the fact that separated mothers are twice as likely to murder their children as separated fathers. According to the Victorian Coroner between 2000 and 2010, 44% of parent child homicide victims where killed by their mother alone, and 3% by the mother and father together.For instance seven months prior to Arthur Freeman's actions Gabriela Garcia jumped off the same bridge with her 22-month-old son Oliver strapped to her chest to prevent Oliver's father from having contact with his son.In addition the Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation of the 2006 Family Law Reforms, involving analysis of 27,000 parents stated that [...] "the 2006changes have improved the way in which the system is identifying and responding tofamilies where there are concerns about family violence, child abuse and dysfunctional behaviours.In particular, systematic attempts to screen such families in the family relationshipservices sector and in some parts of the legal sector appear to have improved identificationof such issues." ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the new family laws in Australia have created a tension between the good pre-separation mother citizen and the good post-separation mother citizen. With the {{emphasis}} on shared parenting, post-separation mothers must now sacrifice {{time with their children}} in favour of the fathers. This tends to obscure the past care work of mothers and to valorise fathers. Using a linguistic ploy, I reveal the identities and lived realities of the citizens of the modern family by examining their ?hoods' (their passive state or condition) and their ?ships' (their more active duties and tasks). These include their motherhood and fatherhood, their mothership and ?fathership'. The introduction of Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) heralded a more contemporary family law in Australia, and seemed to recognise some aspects of mothers' citizenship by valuing ?wifeship' and ?mothership'. However, this was followed by the rise of fathers' rights groups and a number of transformations of <b>parenting</b> <b>laws,</b> with the most recent significant reforms occurring in 2006. After analysing two recent relocation cases, I argue that current <b>parenting</b> <b>laws</b> tend to ignore the complex realities of mothers' lives. I suggest that the concept of parental ?investment', relational theories and the theory of intimate citizenship may provide useful frameworks for reconceptualising some factors relevant to parenting decisions.
