40|$|Graduation date: 1991 This {{experiment}} {{is concerned with}} sampling submicrometer particles in near sonic and supersonic flows. The study employed a high volume condensation aerosol generator to produce stearic acid particles having a geometric mean diameter of 0. 8 μm and a geometric standard deviation of 1. 28. The aerosol was diluted with dry air and accelerated to Mach 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 26, or 1. 47 through a flow nozzle. Aerosol mass concentrations were determined using a small <b>bore</b> <b>probe</b> in the jet and by a large <b>bore</b> <b>probe</b> sampling isokinetically upstream of the jet nozzle. The results of both samples were compared to compute the sampling error associated with the high speed jet sample. The mass of stearic acid collected on polycarbonate membrane filters was determined by gravimetric and chromatographic methods. Studies at Mach 0. 8 with four sampling probes having inlet wall to bore area ratios ranging from 3. 8 to 0. 28 demonstrated that probe wall thickness effects are not significant when the sample is extracted isokinetically. Subisokinetic experiments using a knife edged probe showed relative errors of 124 ± 12...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper by}} Movileanu et al. (2001) {{in this issue}} of The Journal {{describes}} a test of the applicability of the substituted-cysteine-accessibility method (SCAM; Akabas et al., 1992; Akabas et al., 1994) to the problem of locating the narrowest region of a channel lumen. Movileanu et al. (2001) use unusually large sulfhydryldirected reagents to <b>probe</b> the wide <b>bore</b> channel formed by Staphylococcal �-hemolysin. The structure of the membrane-associated form of this protein has been solved to high resolution (Song et al., 1996). It is a mushroom-shaped heptameric complex that inserts in the membrane of a susceptible cell with the wide cap on the extracellular side, or on the cis side of an artificial planar lipid membrane, and with the stem traversing the bilayer (see Figure 1 in Movileanu et al., 2001) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demand for the}} reliability assessment of railways components, especially for high speed trains applications, leads to a new definition of safety factor that can be determined by a “defect tolerant” approach and by the evaluation of “safe life” inspection intervals {{as a function of}} materials characteristics, propagation models and NDT inspections. The present paper deals with the definition of inspection intervals of railways axles, considering the special application of a typical alloyed steel grade for high speed trains, hollow axles and a specially developed UT in service inspection device. Initially, the POD curve of an innovative <b>bore</b> <b>probe,</b> developed basing on Lucchini specifications, has been derived by means of dedicated experimental UT measurements and the CIVA® 8. 1 software.

40|$|De methode van bodemluchtbemonstering en -analyse is gebruikt om na te gaan of een vastgestelde verhoogde concentratie tetrachlooretheen in de buitenlucht veroorzaakt wordt door uitdamping van deze verbinding uit de bodem van een boorslibdepot en/of een voormalige huisvuilstortplaats. Een bodemsonde wordt in de grond gebracht, waarna via een capillaire buis lucht uit de bodem wordt aangezogen. Deze lucht is met een draagbare gaschromatograaf met fotoionisatiedetector geanalyseerd op tetrachlooretheen. Gezien de lage concentraties tetrachlooretheen die in de bodemlucht zijn gemeten, is het onwaarschijnlijk dat de concentratieverhoging van deze {{component}} in de buitenlucht wordt veroorzaakt door uitdamping ervan uit de bodem.

40|$|A new {{scientific}} approach {{for the assessment}} of safe life in service inspection intervals now takes into account both fracture mechanics parameters, in service loadings and NDT reliability. The driving application has been the increasing demand for the reliability assessment of railways components, especially for high speed trains applications. This leads to a new definition of safety factor that can be determined by a “defect tolerant” approach and by the evaluation of “safe life” inspection intervals as a function of materials characteristics, propagation models and NDT inspections. The present paper deals with the influence on inspection intervals of railways axles given by different POD curves of different NDT techniques. Initially, the POD curve of an innovative <b>bore</b> <b>probe</b> has been derived by means of dedicated experimental UT measurements and the CIVA® 8. 1 software. This curve has then been exploited together with the crack propagation behaviour of the reference material in order to define inspection intervals of high speed railway axles. The results have been compared to more traditional end scan UT techniques. This approach is suitable for all kinds of rotors employed in power generation fields, aeronautics and navy fields...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis {{leads to}} bone loss and {{structural}} deterioration, which {{increase the risk}} of fractures. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the three-dimensional (3 D) bone mass distributions of the distal tibia in normal, osteopenic, and osteoporotic conditions. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) of the 33  % of the distal tibia and local dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were applied to 53 intact, fresh-frozen tibiae. The HR-pQCTs were graded to assign local T-scores and merged into three equally sized average normal, osteopenic, and osteoporotic surface models. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was determined using categorized T-scores, volumetric visualization, and virtual <b>bore</b> <b>probes</b> at the dia-, meta-, and epiphyseal sites (T-DIA, T-META, and T-EPI). We observed a distinct 3 D bone mass distribution that was gradually uninfluenced by T-score categories. T-DIA was characterized by the lowest bone mass located in the medullary cavity and a wide homogenous cortex containing the maximum vBMD. The T-META showed decreased cortical thickness and maximal vBMD. At the T-EPI, the relatively low vBMD of the mostly trabecular bone was similar to the maximal cortical vBMD in this sub-region. Four trabecular regions of low bone mass were identified in the recesses. The bone content gradually decreased at all sites, whereas the pattern of bone mass distribution remained essentially unchanged, with the exception of disproportionate losses at T-DIA, T-META, and T-EPI that consistently showed increased endocortical, intracortical, and trabecular bone loss. Extra information can be obtained from the specific pattern of bone mass distribution, potential disproportionate bone losses, and method used...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackground/ObjectiveSpatial {{knowledge}} of the anatomy of the proximal humerus is critical for effective treatment, particularly in patients affected by fragility fractures. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) imaging with medical image processing techniques enable three dimensional (3 D) analysis of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of bones of different sizes and shapes. MethodsTo elucidate the bony anatomy and to create 3 D reference data, we conducted a computerized HR-pQCT-based study in intact postmortem samples of the proximal humerus to highlight the anatomy with particular emphasis on the size, shape, and bone stock distribution pattern. Fifty-eight defrozen intact humerus samples from 28 female and 30 male donors, who were aged 61 – 98 years old (mean age ± standard deviation, 80. 6  ±  9 years), were scanned in the proximal third using the extended standard HR-pQCT protocol. A 3 D statistical bone and averaged bone density models with low, middle, and high total vBMDs were computed. We examined the 3 D patterns of size and shape variations using principal component analysis, and the vBMD distributions and variabilities using volume-rendering and virtual <b>bore</b> <b>probing.</b> ResultsThe computer models revealed a highly variable bony anatomy in which size was the predominant variation in the first principal component (PC). In the second PC, we observed notable variabilities {{in the shape of}} the head and shaft inclination. A distinct 3 D pattern of bone stock distribution was detected in which the lowest vBMD values were identified in the medullary cavity, middle values were identified in the central zone, and the highest values were identified in the cortex and humeral head—particularly in the subarticular zones. In the presence of bone loss, the vBMD values were ubiquitously decreased, but the pattern of 3 D bone stock distribution was maintained. ConclusionThe new anatomical 3 D data that we acquired will improve the understanding of the normal bony anatomy of the proximal humerus. The extended HR-pQCT protocol and computer models may be used for other skeletal sites and used as 3 D reference models that can be applied to systematically improve implant design and anchorage...|$|R
40|$|Profile {{waviness}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes for scrapped parts in precision bore grinding. Although efforts have been made to reduce its occurrence, the problem has not been eliminated completely. In production, the identification of a few scrapped parts in a lot of several thousands often requires expensive manual processes. Grinding machines used to produce these parts are usually equipped with measurement gage heads having tactile probes. Until now, these in-process gages have been used to measure only the average diameter of the part. This research focused on the use of these tactile <b>probes</b> to measure <b>bore</b> waviness in precision-ground parts. The first objective was to develop a post-process machine that performs automated measurement of the bore profile and is capable of detecting waviness. The machine was built using the same measurement system and the same roll-shoe centerless fixture as the grinding machines used for the production of the parts. The machine was designed and set up such that disturbances of the measurement are minimized. It was shown that the machine reaches accuracies close to those obtained by manually operated roundness machines. The cycle time is approximately 4 seconds per part compared to several minutes for manually operated roundness machines. As a second objective, the possibility of measuring waviness directly in the grinding machine was evaluated. Feasible design modifications to reduce the effect of disturbances are very limited in grinding machines, since interference with the grinding process must be avoided. Therefore, analytical methods were developed to reduce these effects and partly restore the original profile. The main disturbances that were addressed are errors due to irregular sampling of the profile, to the frequency response behavior of the gage heads, and to motion of the workpiece center relative to the gage heads. The post-process machine was used as a development and test platform for the analytical methods. To further verify these methods, tests were also conducted in an industrial grinding machine. Ph. D.
