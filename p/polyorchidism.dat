50|$|<b>Polyorchidism</b> is {{generally}} diagnosed via an ultrasound {{examination of the}} testicles. However, the diagnosis of <b>polyorchidism</b> should include histological confirmation. The most common form is triorchidism, or tritestes, where three testicles are present. The condition is usually asymptomatic. A man who has <b>polyorchidism</b> {{is known as a}} polyorchid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyorchidism</b> {{can also}} occur in {{conjunction}} with infertility, inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, epididymitis, hydrocele testis and varicocele. However, {{it is not clear}} whether <b>polyorchidism</b> causes or aggravates these conditions, or whether the existence of these conditions leads sufferers to seek medical attention and thus become diagnosed with a previously undetected supernumerary testicle.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>polyorchidism</b> is very uncommon, {{there is}} no {{standard}} treatment for the condition.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Polyorchidism</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Blasius in 16701 during a routine autopsy. We report {{a child with}} unilateral <b>polyorchidism</b> and a contralateral absent testis, a combination not reported previously. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 2 -year-old boy was referred to the outpatient clinic with an impalpable left testis. At laparoscopy, the left vas deferens and testicular vessels ended blindly proximal to a closed internal ring. No gonadal tissue was identified. On the right side, a single vas deferens and testicular vessels were seen entering the internal ring as normal. The {{right side of the}} scrotum was explored and two testes were identified within a single tunica vaginalis. DISCUSSION: <b>Polyorchidism</b> is rare with a literature search identifying approximately 230 reported cases. Whilst prenatal testicular torsion is increasing being recognized and treated as a surgical emergency, 9 prenatal testicular torsion in association with <b>polyorchidism</b> has not been previously reported. CONCLUSION: We describe a unique case of a 2 -year-old boy with right-sided <b>polyorchidism</b> and an absent left testis associated with a blind ending vas deferens and testicular vessels, presumed secondary to intrauterine testicular torsion...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polyorchidism</b> is a {{very rare}} {{genitourinary}} anomaly defined {{with the presence of}} more than two testicles. <b>Polyorchidism</b> is associated up to 40 % with undescended testicles. The present report is about an incidentally detected triorchidism case with unilateral, one atrophic undescended double testicles. A 4 -year-old child, diagnosed with undescended left testicle revealed during orchiopexy <b>polyorchidism</b> with distinct epididymis and vas deferens. Whereas one of the testicles was in regular size; the other two were atrophic. Orchiectomy was conducted on the atrophic testicle and orchiopexy to the regular size testicle. The atrophic testicle excised was referred histopathological analysis and was diagnosed as atrophic testis. The patient discharged on the first postoperative day, was considered as normal during postoperative evaluation made on the third postoperative day. <b>Polyorchidism</b> is a rare genitourinary abnormality, and its management is still controversial.

40|$|Background. <b>Polyorchidism,</b> {{alternatively}} supernumerary testes (SNT), is {{a condition}} where an individual is born with more than two testicles. This congenital anomaly is quite rare and the literature has described various presentations. Questions/Purposes. To our knowledge, this presentation of <b>polyorchidism</b> {{has yet to be}} described in the literature. The goal of this case study is to add to the pediatric, general, and urologic surgery’s body of knowledge of the subject matter. Case Study. A nine-month-old boy was admitted for an impalpable right testis and phimosis. At the time of surgical exploration, there appeared to be polyorchid testis on the right-hand side, with three masses that potentially appeared to be undescended testes. Discussion. Proponents of a conservative approach argue that infertility is common in patients with <b>polyorchidism</b> and, by preserving a potentially functional SNT, there may be improved spermatogenesis. When performing definitive surgical treatment, meticulous intra-abdominal and intrainguinal exploration must be undertaken. Orchiopexy should be performed to reduce the chances of torsion, malignancy, and infertility. Conclusion. Our case is important to the literature as it is the first known case of <b>polyorchidism</b> with 3 SNT on the right side, located intra-abdominally, and in a patient less than 1 year of age...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polyorchidism</b> {{is a rare}} anomaly where early {{segmentation}} in the gonadal ridge {{can lead}} to the development of three or less commonly four testes in one individual.

40|$|Leung 5 {{created a}} four-group {{anatomical}} classification of <b>polyorchidism</b> based on testis embryology. Group one consists of <b>polyorchidism</b> with no vas deferens or epididymis in the supernumerary testis. Group two includes the testes that share these two mentioned structures with the ipsilateral testicle. The third is formed by testes {{with their own}} epididymis and sharing the vas deferens. Finally, group four corresponds to supernumerary testes with their own annexes. 5 Anatomical and functional classification proposed by Singer et  al. 6 divides <b>polyorchidism</b> into two groups: group  I, {{in which there is}} reproductive functionality, given that the tubules linking to the epididymis and vas are permeable. And group II, with infertile patients. In turn, both groups have two subgroups based on whether there is a scrotal location of the testis (IA, IIA) or an ectopic location (IB, IIB). 6 Triorchidism is the numeric alteration most frequently found, as well as left laterality (60 %) and the scrotal location (70 %).

40|$|<b>Polyorchidism</b> is {{an anomaly}} {{characterized}} {{by more than}} two gonads; triorchidism {{is the most common}} variant. Its management is controversial, mostly when surgical treatment is occasional. CB, 14 year-old, came to the hospital due to right-sided testicular torsion. During surgery, testis was rotated and the contralateral testis, which presented as an anatomically continuum with a gonadic structure similar to the other testes but with a smaller diameter, was fixed. We performed biopsy on both left testes and decided to preserve the supernumerary one. Following the anatomic and functional classification of <b>polyorchidism</b> by Singer, preservation is justified {{on the grounds of the}} presence of a supernumerary testis that drains into the epididymis of the normal testis, merging into one single deferent duct (Singer Type 1). At biopsy, both testes had a valid spermatogenic asset. The diagnostic follow-up at 6 and 12 months did not show any pathological alteration. Diagnosis of <b>polyorchidism</b> is occasional. Its treatment varies depending on the site, dimension, and anatomy of the drainage system of the supernumerary testis. If the supernumerary testis is preserved, a standardized diagnostic follow-up is recommended...|$|E

40|$|<b>Polyorchidism</b> {{is a rare}} anomaly with {{approximately}} 70 cases reported in literature. The exact explanation {{for the production of}} <b>polyorchidism</b> is not known, although several theories have been proposed, including anomalous appropriation of cells, initial longitudinal duplication of the genital ridge and transverse division of the genital ridge, either through some local accident of development of peritoneal bands. A functional classification based upon the embryogenic development is provided. Type I: the supernumerary testis lacks an epididymis and vas. The split-off part of the primordial gonad does not communicate with the mesonephric tubules from which the epididymis develops. Type II: the supernumerary testis is linked to the regular testis by a common epididymis and shares a common vas with it. The division of the genital ridge occurs in the region where the primordial gonads are attached to the mesonephric ducts, although the latter are not divided (incomplete division). Type III: the supernumerary testis has its own epididymis but shares the vas with the regular testis. This variant results from a complete transverse division of the genital ridge. In the majority of the reported cases, the patients are asymptomatic and have painless groin or testicular masses. Approximately 50...|$|E
