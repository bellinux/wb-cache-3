5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} Western countries, the U.S. is {{becoming}} less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. <b>Polls</b> <b>show</b> that overall American confidence in organized religion {{has been declining}} since {{the mid to late}} 1980s, and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time. Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.|$|E

25|$|When {{the race}} began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7% in January and February. By May, his lead was just 2% and summer <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> a varying number of trends: Daschle or Thune led by {{no more than}} 2%, but some <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> a tie. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2-5% while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49-49 among likely voters. Some <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> either Thune or Daschle leading by {{extremely}} slim margins.|$|R
50|$|By October 1997, an A C Nielsen-McNair <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> that 27% of Queensland {{voters would}} vote for PHONP, and a {{national}} <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> that the party could win up to 12 Senate seats.|$|R

25|$|<b>Polls</b> <b>show</b> {{that if the}} two-state {{solution}} were taken off the table, a strong majority of Americans would favor a one-state solution in which Jews and Arabs would have equal citizenship and rights. Most Americans also view democracy as more important than Israel's Jewishness.|$|E

25|$|To {{encourage}} {{investment in}} wind power, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity {{within their own}} or an adjoining municipality. While this could involve purchasing a turbine outright, more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines. By 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country. Opinion <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> that this direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines, with some 86% of Danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{independent}} polls had shown Shays defeating or in dead heat {{with the top}} Democratic contenders in the general election, while those same <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> McMahon losing handily {{to each of the}} top Democratic contenders. The Shays campaign asserted the former Congressman showed more electability than McMahon, due to her loss in an open Senate seat contest in 2010 by a large margin despite spending $50 million of her own money, also citing her high unfavorable numbers among state voters, and the weak fundraising numbers of the McMahon campaign.|$|E
25|$|As {{official}} {{religious statistics}} are forbidden in France, {{there are no}} official figures about religious practices in Brittany. However, successive <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> that the region {{tends to be more}} and more nonreligious. Catholic religion has started to decline after the Second World War, during the urbanisation of Brittany. A poll conducted in 2006 showed that Morbihan was the only département to have a strong Catholic population, around 70% of its inhabitants belonging to that religion. Loire-Atlantique and Côtes-d'Armor were among the least Catholic French départements, with only 50% of Catholics, while Ille-et-Vilaine and Finistère were at around 65%. Other religions are almost non-existent, apart from Islam which gathers between 1 and 3% of the inhabitants in Ille-et-Vilaine and Loire-Atlantique.|$|E

50|$|The first {{opinion poll}} {{released}} after the first-round, published by El Mercurio-Opina on December 18, had Bachelet with 42.8%, Piñera with 37.5% and 19.7% undecided. Later opinion <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> similar results, {{except for one}} <b>poll</b> <b>showing</b> Piñera above Bachelet by 1%. The <b>polls</b> released <b>showed</b> on average that Bachelet maintained an advantage over Piñera above 5%, but {{with a large number}} of voters (18%) still undecided or that would not declare a preference. If this last percentage was removed from the vote, then Bachelet, the <b>polls</b> <b>showed,</b> would have won the presidency by a margin above 7%, which was accurate with the final results of the election.|$|R
50|$|Gramm {{previously}} ran for President {{earlier in}} the year, but lost to fellow U.S. Senator Bob Dole in the Republican presidential primary. Gramm was the heavy favorite.

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, rites of {{marriage}} for same-sex couples without legal recognition became increasingly common. The first law providing for marriage {{of people of}} the same sex in modern times was enacted in 2001 in the Netherlands. , same-sex marriage is legally recognized (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay.

25|$|Polls {{consistently}} show {{a marked}} contrast between support for domestic partnerships and same-sex marriage. In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> {{an increase in}} support for same-sex marriage, but few polls {{suggest that there is}} any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. However, a recent 2012 poll showed vast increase in support of same sex marriage with 59% of Californians supporting same sex marriage and 80% supporting legal recognition of same sex couples. The 2012 poll found {{for the first time a}} majority support for same-sex marriage when non-marriage domestic partnerships were presented as an option.|$|E

United States, and Uruguay, as well as 4 states of Mexico (Mexico City, Quintana Roo, Chihuahua and Coahuila) permit same-sex marriages. Both Israel and Malta recognizes same-sex marriages abroad - but does not allow same-sex marriages to be performed within its borders. In 21 countries worldwide and in several US Counties and/or Cities, a same-sex couple can be legally partnered in a civil union, domestic partnership or registered partnership. Couples in these unions or partnerships are afforded rights and obligations similar to, but not identical to, those of a married couple.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{breakaway}} parties, {{such as the}} Anatolia Party, the Democratic Progress Party and the Nation and Justice Party {{were formed}} by former MPs of the CHP and AKP. In the end, only the Anatolia Party fielded candidates for election. The AKP, CHP and MHP all held leadership elections in the lead-up to the election, with Ahmet Davutoğlu elected unopposed as the AKP leader during the party's first extraordinary congress in August 2014. The MHP's long-time leader Devlet Bahçeli was re-elected unopposed during the 2015 MHP Extraordinary Congress, with his rivals unable to gain enough signatures to contest the leadership election. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected as CHP leader during the party's 2014 Extraordinary Convention, defeating his rival Muharrem İnce. The HDP has a co-presidential system, where one male and one female leader are elected. The party's chairman and chairwoman are Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ. Many opposition commentators and opinion <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> that the public largely regard President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the AKP's founder who constitutionally must remain neutral as President, as the de facto leader of the AKP. Of the 20 parties contesting the election, only two party leaders were women. These were Emine Ülker Tarhan of the Anatolia Party and Özlem Şen Abay of the Communist Party.|$|E
500|$|The FairTax {{statutory}} rate, {{unlike most}} U.S. state-level sales taxes, is presented on a tax base {{that includes the}} amount of FairTax paid. For example, a final after-tax price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Although no such requirement {{is included in the}} text of the legislation, Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price, not added on at checkout—an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total. The legislation requires the receipt to display the tax as 23% of the total. Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income and employment tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). The plan's opponents call the semantics deceptive. FactCheck called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate. [...] Bruce Bartlett stated that <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate, and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes. [...] Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23% and the FairTax is 30% as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{emerged as}} a {{possible}} candidate to replace Barack Obama, who, after being elected President of the United States on November 4, 2008, officially resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate effective November 16. [...] The class 3 Illinois Senate seat was up for re-election in 2010. [...] Other contenders included Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky, Tammy Duckworth, Emil Jones Jr., Kwame Raoul, Dan Hynes, and Lisa Madigan, while other sources also mentioned Luis Gutierrez and Melissa Bean. One early name mentioned, Valerie Jarrett, withdrew her name from consideration and both Davis and Duckworth noted {{that they had not}} been contacted by the governor's office by the time Obama announced his resignation on November 13, 2008. In a radio interview on the subject, Jackson cited his record on federal funding for his district, loyalty to Obama and diligence in voting in the U.S. House. At the time, Obama was the only black U.S. Senator, and black leaders pressured Blagojevich to appoint a black successor. The Chicago Defender and Southtown Star both endorsed Jackson, who noted that public opinion <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> him as the favorite. The selection was coming {{at a time when the}} Governor's public approval ratings were at an all-time low, which added to the pressure for him to make a selection that would be good for his own political perception, and it was believed that Jackson's constituency was one that the Governor might need to appease. [...] Although Obama and Duckworth laid a wreath together on Veterans Day, Obama did not endorse a successor. [...] However, in an internal report filed by Obama legal advisor Greg Craig, [...] "Obama authorized Emanuel to pass on the names of four people he considered to be highly qualified to take over his seat – Illinois Comptroller Dan Hynes, Illinois Veterans’ Affairs Director Tammy Duckworth, Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr." ...|$|E
