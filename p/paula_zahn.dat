25|$|Dr. Putney {{was interviewed}} on CNN Live Saturday by {{correspondent}} <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> on May 29, 2004, in Washington, D.C., {{at the site}} of the World War II Memorial, which had just opened.|$|E
25|$|The primetime {{show that}} aired in the {{timeslot}} preceding Larry King Live, <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> Now, which debuted in 2003, was never very popular. It competed against Fox News Channel's The O'Reilly Factor, which {{had grown to}} become the highest-rated cable news program. The program lasted for four years before being cancelled on August 2, 2007.|$|E
25|$|Sean Murtagh, CNN vice {{president}} for finance and administration, was the first network employee {{on the air in}} New York City. Coincidentally, <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn,</b> who assisted in the coverage, began working as a CNN reporter on the day that the attacks occurred (Zahn mentioned this fact on a 2005 episode of Jeopardy!, in which she appeared as a guest clue presenter).|$|E
25|$|Reportedly, CNN signed Chetry {{within an}} hour of her release from the Fox News Channel. On February 16, 2007, Chetry began work as a CNN anchor and correspondent. That very day she served as a co-host on American Morning in the morning, and {{anchored}} Anderson Cooper 360 that evening. She went on to substitute as an anchor for <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> Now and CNN Newsroom.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 and 2001, CNN hired many {{key people}} such as Anderson Cooper, Aaron Brown, <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> and (rehired) Lou Dobbs. The {{leadership}} of the network also changed. Kaplan left CNN in 2000, and moreover Tom Johnson retired as head of CNN in 2001 after 10 years. Following his retirement, new management and increased competition from Fox News Channel led to the network's gradual decline during the decade.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the pardon}} by President Bill Clinton of several convicted {{members of the}} New Square Hassidic community, Greenwald was interviewed by several media outlets {{regarding}} his opinion and even {{his role in the}} affair. The fact that Greenwald had ties to the New Square community, was a former business associate of Marc Rich, another person pardoned by Clinton {{at the end of his}} term and had been questioned by the FBI during its investigation into the pardons, made his opinions regarding the incident highly sought after by media outlets. On March 12, 2001, on The Edge, <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> conducted a 10-minute interview with Greenwald. He also appeared on The O'Reilly Factor on October 10, 2002, when he was cross examined by host Bill O'Reilly for several minutes regarding the affair. In both interviews, Greenwald conceded that the New Square community probably voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in her race against Rick Lazio for U.S. Senate in 2000 with some expectation that some consideration be given to pardoning the members of the New Square community. However, he steadfastly maintained that there had been no quid pro quo or agreement to exchange votes for a pardon.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Edwards {{was part}} of a panel that {{appeared}} on CNN's <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson. The purpose was to discuss racial segregation in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share [...] "the same values and traditions and heroes," [...] and that [...] "forced integration" [...] was a [...] "march toward totalitarianism." [...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and if you think that is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis." [...] Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> Now in 2009, during which he said: [...] "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} {{featured}} in a 1999 episode of Cold Case Files on A entitled [...] "Bodies in the Bay," [...] which also focused on {{the evidence in the}} case. In 1995, Oba Chandler, some members of his family, and Hal Rogers appeared in an episode of the Maury Povich Show featuring the case. Chandler appeared via satellite link. Chandler's case {{was featured in}} a full-hour episode of Crime Stories. The case was shown on an episode of Forensic Files entitled [...] "Water Logged" [...] in December 2010.

2500|$|Cooper left The Mole {{after its}} [...] {{to return to}} {{broadcast}} news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, [...] "Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news." [...] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.|$|E
2500|$|After many {{inflammatory}} {{comments about}} the defendants, Nancy Grace's show covered the dismissal of charges {{on the day of}} the announcement, but with a substitute host. Undaunted by the lack of DNA evidence, CNN's <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> insisted that [...] "the DA would not be proceeding with this case if he didn't believe that this alleged victim had been raped." [...] She also demanded explanations [...] "How, then, sir , do you explain the woman's injuries ... particularly some of the internal injuries?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 3, 2007, the GNAA {{successfully}} {{managed to}} convince CNN reporter <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> that [...] "one in three Americans" [...] {{believe that the}} September 11, 2001 terror attacks were carried out by Israeli agents. CNN subsequently ran a story erroneously reporting this, involving a round-table discussion regarding antisemitism and {{an interview with the}} father of a Jewish 9/11 victim. The GNAA-owned website said that [...] "over 4,000" [...] Jews were absent from work at the World Trade Center on 9/11.|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, 2006, Cable News Network's (CNN) <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> Now program {{featured}} a segment on [...] "whether {{the crisis in}} the Middle East is actually a prelude {{to the end of the}} world". In an interview Falwell claimed, [...] "I believe in the premillennial, pre-tribulational coming of Christ for all of his church, and to summarize that, your first poll, do you believe Jesus' coming the second time will be in the future, I would vote yes with the 59 percent and with Billy Graham and most evangelicals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many years later, {{when asked}} in a {{television}} interview by CNN correspondent <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> what [...] "the whole world [...] understand about women's efforts" [...] in World War II, Dr. Putney replied: [...] "They should understand [...] [...] [...] that we were a mighty support force for the male armed forces. [...] I've got to say male because many of us did all of the tasks, all of the [...] [...] [...] military occupational specialties, as a man, except carry a gun." [...] Interviewed on another occasion, she said: [...] "It is my thesis that military integration made {{the basis for the}} emergence and the expansion of the black middle class." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trudeau {{has been}} interviewed by CNN's <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn,</b> Matt Lauer of NBC's Today Show, and Harry Smith of CBS's The Early Show. Trudeau {{was also the}} subject of investigative reports done by Inside Edition, ABC's 20/20 and Dateline NBC. [...] The 20/20 segment {{highlighted}} a Nightline interview with Jake Tapper in which Trudeau misrepresented the money {{he was forced to}} pay to the government, the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges, and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by Tapper. Trudeau was interviewed by Jacques Peretti for the fourth episode of the series The Men Who Made Us Thin on BBC2.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, {{during an}} {{interview}} on <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> NOW, Sharpton said that his views on Mormonism {{were based on the}} [...] "Mormon Church's traditionally racist views regarding blacks" [...] and its interpretation of the so-called [...] "Curse of Ham." [...] On May 10, Sharpton called two apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and apologized to them for his remarks and asked to meet with them. A spokesman for the Church confirmed that Sharpton had called and said that [...] "we appreciate it very much, Rev. Sharpton's call, and we consider the matter closed." [...] He also apologized to [...] "any member of the Mormon church" [...] who was offended by his comments. Later that month, Sharpton went to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he met with Elder M. Russell Ballard, a leader of the Church, and Elder Robert C. Oaks of the Church's Presidency of the Seventy.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the longer}} version, the {{documentary}} {{began as a}} 10-minute film. [...] "I {{was told by the}} doctors that my son would probably never walk or talk. Today's he's a high school freshman enrolled in regular classes, who wants {{to go to college and}} become a filmmaker," [...] Keri Bowers said of her son. Cross told the Daily News of Los Angeles: [...] "I want people to leave my film feeling uplifted and having a better understanding of what it's like to live in our world." [...] The feature-length version of the film includes interviews with family members and friends of children with autism. Cross said work on the documentary was difficult: [...] "It was long, and it was tedious. I swear on my grave that I'm not doing another documentary. It took two years to finish." [...] During the film's production, Cross and Bowers appeared on a program hosted by <b>Paula</b> <b>Zahn</b> on CNN to discuss their work.|$|E
