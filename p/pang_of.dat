500|$|In 1992, American magician and David Copperfield {{producer}} Chris Kenner published Totally Out of Control, {{a successful}} instructional book explaining magic effects with playing cards and other household objects. Among the many sleights featured was a two-handed card flourish on page 125 called [...] "The Five Faces of Sybil". Using all fingers, Sybil {{ends with the}} deck divided into five distinct packets. Kenner himself describes Sybil in his book as [...] "a quick cut flourish to demonstrate skill and dexterity". The flourish spawned a cycle of two-handed cut creations and formed the cornerstone {{of what is now}} known as cardistry. Journalist Kevin <b>Pang</b> <b>of</b> Vanity Fair magazine noted that [...] "every cardist can deftly perform Sybil the way guitarists can run through a blues progression".|$|E
500|$|Cardistry is a {{portmanteau}} {{of cards}} and artistry. [...] The art form of card flourishing, {{commonly referred to}} as cardistry, grew out of simple flourishes used in close-up magic by magicians in the 1990s to early 2000s. Chris Kenner's notable two-handed Sybil cut from his 1992 publication Totally Out of Control has carried great influence and gave birth to a series of advanced flourishes which today represents the foundation of the performance art. Sleight of hand pioneers Dan and Dave popularized cardistry on the world stage with their instructional DVD releases from 2004 and 2007. Journalist Kevin <b>Pang</b> <b>of</b> Vanity Fair characterized the art of card flourishing as, [...] "It's yo-yo tricks performed by cardsharps with the street cred of a Parkour video. There's a name for it: cardistry." ...|$|E
500|$|Not One Less [...] {{portrays the}} mass media as a locus of power: Wei discovers that only someone with money or {{connections}} can gain access to a television station, but once someone is on camera she or he becomes part of an [...] "invisible media hegemony" [...] {{with the power to}} [...] "manipulate social behavior", catching people's attention where paper advertisements could not and moving cityfolk to donate money to a country school. The power of television within the film's story, according to Laikwan <b>Pang</b> <b>of</b> the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reflects its prominent place in Chinese society of the late 1990s, when domestic cinema was floundering but television was developing quickly; Pang argues that television-watching forms a [...] "collective consciousness" [...] for Chinese citizens, and that the way television unifies people in Not One Less is an illustration of this.|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare's {{account of}} the battle was mostly based on chroniclers Edward Hall's and Raphael Holinshed's {{dramatic}} versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar Thomas More, whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king. [...] The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama. Margaret of Anjou died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in Henry VI. [...] Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham. [...] Richard is portrayed as suffering a <b>pang</b> <b>of</b> conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts {{that he will be}} evil, if such needed to retain his crown.|$|E
500|$|The Telegraphs Nigel Farndale {{praised the}} film's {{balanced}} {{view of the}} director: [...] "ven though he was portrayed in this exquisite drama as a manipulative, vindictive martinet, the portrait was not unsympathetic." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon echoed this view, praising Jones's Hitchcock and writing that the actor [...] "managed to give [...] touches of humanity, too. There are moments when you feel a real <b>pang</b> <b>of</b> sympathy for Hitchcock, although admittedly they don't last long". [...] "liding gracefully through it all (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her." [...] In The Telegraph, Clive James said [...] " [...] better choice [...] {{could not have been}} made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was...Toby Jones, quite believably looked stunned". John Doyle of Canada's The Globe and Mail was less impressed with the actors' performances. Of Miller (whom he described as [...] "good but not great") he wrote, [...] "She doesn't have the iciness that Hedren had in her youth and she struggles to convey Hedren's enormous strength of character as a woman unwilling to let Hitchcock have his way". Doyle was equally critical of Jones, describing him as someone who [...] "seems to be imitating Hitchcock rather than inhabiting the role".|$|E

Silas feels a <b>pang</b> <b>of</b> guilt and tries to redeem himself by taking Texas to hospital." [...] The actress added that even though Silas has let her off this time, he could strike again.|$|E

2500|$|WrestleMania 33 {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Matt Geradi and Kevin <b>Pang</b> <b>of</b> The A.V. Club co-reviewed WrestleMania. Pang criticized the event for being [...] "long and exhausting to watch at home", with [...] "nothing that would win match-of-the-year in a 2017 poll" [...] and [...] "minimum" [...] surprises. Geradi {{felt that the}} event exceeded his expectations and [...] "the storytelling was on point all night", {{but it was a}} [...] "tremendously front-loaded show". Yet Geradi and Pang agreed that everything [...] "didn't matter" [...] as WrestleMania [...] "was about one story—the end of The Undertaker"; both reviewers agreed that the main event was [...] "sad", with Pang also describing it as [...] "ugly". Although [...] "Shawn Michaels' sympathy and expressiveness" [...] made Ric Flair's retirement at WrestleMania [...] "moving and memorable", Geradi chided Reigns for having [...] "barely mustered an ounce of anything other than disbelief and exasperation" [...] as it [...] "was business as usual for The Big Dog". For the other matches, Pang wrote that Aries–Neville fulfilled expectations as the [...] "best technical match" [...] with an [...] "especially killer" [...] finish, while Gerardi described Jericho–Owens as [...] "really solidly worked with some clever, unique spots, and the in-ring story with all the counters was great stuff".|$|E

[...] In 1932 Rasputin, My Father was published. In January 1933 she {{performed}} in Cirque d'hiver with a pony act. In December 1934 Maria was in London. In 1935 she found work in the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, based in Peru, Indiana. The circus toured America and Maria acted one season as a lion tamer, billing herself as [...] "the daughter of the famous mad monk whose feats in Russia astonished the world." [...] She was mauled by a bear in May 1935 [...] but stayed with the circus until it reached Miami, Florida, where she quit before it ceased operations. In 1938 her two daughters were denied entry to the USA. Maria was ordered {{to leave the country}} within 90 days, but then, in March 1940, she married Gregory Bernadsky, a childhood chum and former White Russian Army officer, in Miami. In 1946 they divorced and she became a U.S. citizen. In 1947 the youngest of her daughters married in Paris Gideon Walrave Boissevain (1897-1985), ministre plénipotentiaire in Greece, Chile, Israel and the Dutch ambassador to Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} the {{supporters}} of the counter-protests have voiced suspicions regarding the purported involvement (including the alleged offering of remuneration) of influential US-based activists and think tanks in providing impetus for the demonstrations, though this remains a fringe view among scholars. Similar conspiracy theories have been espoused by figures like Biser Milanov (who did not self-identify as a counter-protester, but was believed to fit this description by protest activists), who made a statement at the Council of Ministers in August 2013, in which he affirmed that his [...] "National Liberty" [...] movement would only support the government if it took adequate measures against [...] "paid protesters", entailing granting them permission to create [...] "volunteer patrols" [...] who would operate together with police officers and apprehend [...] "all protest organizers who are driven {{by a desire to}} promote George Soros' interests in Bulgaria". Rapper Mihail Mihaylov, who has been described in the media as [...] "one of the faces of the counter-protests", has in a similar fashion expressed dismay at the alleged meddling of outside agents in Bulgarian affairs and in addition to that criticized the Borisov Government for its supposed authoritarian tendencies, thus subscribing to the argument that GERB was bound to be the beneficiary of any anti-government protests. According to research conducted by the Sofia Open Society Institute covering the months of June and July, only 7.4% of respondents cited the concern that GERB could return to the helm of the country as being among their reasons for refusing to participate in a protest. Journalist Petar Volgin, who has been noted for his anti-protest philosophy in contrast to other media anchors, echoed some of the sentiments of the conspiracy theorists, maintaining that the spontaneity of the protests only persisted until about their fifth day, after which they were taken over by a collection of interested [...] "political engineers" [...] – right-wing activists, GERB affiliates and [...] "tipping point" [...] circles with close connections to selected oligarchs. Columnists associated with the Ataka party compare the protests to the Otpor! movement as well as the various colour revolutions that are also purported to have been sponsored by pro-US activists and NGOs that are claimed to promote undesirable political correctness norms in Eastern European countries. Thus, foreign agents were deemed capable of exerting an influence of the momentum and intensity of the protests, with one of the speculations being that the government's decision to implicitly give the green light regarding the construction of a 7th unit of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (to be commissioned to American company Westinghouse), placated the pro-American NGOs in Bulgaria and brought about a dwindling in the protest waves. During the protests and following their cessation, Volen Siderov has referred to them as [...] "an attempt to pull off a Bulgarian Maidan". He has also alleged that Oresharski had a <b>pang</b> <b>of</b> conscience and decided to resign after refusing to accede to American demands (with the insistence to abandon South Stream being the only one to be made public) put forth during a meeting with John McCain in June 2014, which included (amongst others) providing the United States with a carte blanche to use Bulgarian military airports for the purpose of military and logistical actions in light of the Ukrainian crisis as well as sending Bulgarian troops to fight against the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. It has been alleged that parties such as BSP encouraged their supporters to flood Internet forums with anti-protest messages (attempting to divert discussions in the direction of conspiracy theories).|$|E
