40|$|The red <b>alga,</b> <b>Eucheuma</b> spinosum from South Bangka Waters {{was shown}} to contain {{antioxidant}} activity. Natural antioxidants from algae are known {{to play an important}} role against various diseases and aging processes. The study objective was to investigate phytochemical screenings and antioxidant activity of ethanol fractions of Euchema spinosum from South Bangka waters. Antioxidant activities of fresh algae (FA), dry algae (DA), and algae product (AP) were determined with DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) assay. Extraction was conducted using 70 % ethanol in acidic environment for 24 hours. Then, the extract was evaporated using rotary evaporator. Dry extract was fractionated with ethanol-n-hexane (2 : 3) and the ethanol fraction was dried. The phytochemical screenings showed that all fractions had flavonoid, alkaloid and triterpenoid compounds. The most potent antioxidant activity was found in the ethanol fraction of AP with IC 50 value of 333. 66 μg/mL, FA 418. 32 μg/mL and DA 472. 14 μg/mL. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the ethanol fraction of algae product can be used as an antioxidant source...|$|R
40|$|Studies on biosorption and {{desorption}} of Cr(III) on <b>algae</b> (<b>Eucheuma</b> spinosum) adsorbent {{have been}} carried out. These studies included determination of biosorbent acidity, optimum pH, contact time of biosorption, isoterm and biosorption capacity, and mechanisms of interaction between Cr(III) and algae (E. spinosum) biosorben. Mechanisms of interaction were evaluated by sequential desorption of Cr(III) on algae biosorben by using aquadest, 1 M HCl and 0. 05 M Na 2 EDTA. The result showed that the total acidity of algae biosorbent was 4. 15 ± 0. 33 mmol/g, the optimum pH was 3, and the optimum contact time was 20 min. Biosorption capacity of algae (E. spinosum) toward chromium (III) was 57. 33 mg/g. The highest desorption of Cr(III) achieved when 1 M HCl was used, i. e. 51, 01 %, wheareas desorptions using aquadest and 0. 05 M Na 2 EDTA were relatively low, i. e. 2. 07 % and 2. 38 % respectively. This result indicates that the main interaction mechanism of Cr(III) on algae was electrostatic attraction.   Keywords : Biosorption, Cr(III), Eucheuma Spinosu...|$|R
40|$|Lectin {{sensitivity}} of the recent pandemic influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 - 2009) was screened for 12 lectins with various carbohydrate specificity by a neutral red dye uptake assay with MDCK cells. Among them, a high mannose (HM) -binding anti-HIV lectin, ESA- 2 from the red <b>alga</b> <b>Eucheuma</b> serra, showed the highest inhibition against infection with an EC 50 of 12. 4 nM. Moreover, ESA- 2 exhibited {{a wide range of}} antiviral spectrum against various influenza strains with EC 50 s of pico molar to low nanomolar levels. Besides ESA- 2, HM-binding plant lectin ConA, fucose-binding lectins such as fungal AOL from Aspergillus oryzae and AAL from Aleuria aurantia were active against H 1 N 1 - 2009, but the potency of inhibition was of less magnitude compared with ESA- 2. Direct interaction between ESA- 2 and a viral envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), was demonstrated by ELISA assay. This interaction was effectively suppressed by glycoproteins bearing HM-glycans, indicating that ESA- 2 binds to the HA of influenza virus through HM-glycans. Upon treatment with ESA- 2, no viral antigens were detected in the host cells, indicating that ESA- 2 inhibited the initial steps of virus entry into the cells. ESA- 2 would thus be useful as a novel microbicide to prevent penetration of viruses such as HIV and influenza viruses to the host cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduced}} <b>alga</b> <b>Eucheuma</b> striatum Schmitz was studied regarding its spread, control, {{and ecology}} in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Its distribution in Kaneohe Bay during May 1976 was {{nearly the same}} as when it was originally planted 2 yr earlier. It lacked the ability to disperse over shallow depressions both in the reef and in deep water, {{and it did not}} colonize neighboring reefs without the help of man. Depth was the single most important physical factor limiting its dispersal. A total fresh weight standing crop of from 21 to 24 metric ton s of E. striatum was recorded on a 500 -m-long section of reef edge from December 1976 to June 1977. When protected from grazing its growth rate was about 5. 0 percent/day. Data support the conclusion that the population on the reef edge was maintained only by a steady influx of thallus fragments that escaped from enclosed experimental plantings on the reef flat. When the experimental plantings were removed the population could not maintain itself and soon disappeared. Eucheuma striatum did not compete with native algal macrophytes and appeared to be the basis of a community richer in animal species than adjacent reefs. It provided 10 - 20 tons/me of food for grazing fish, shelter, and a substratum for numerous invertebrates. Eucheuma striatum did not attach to corals, but it did cause their death by shading...|$|R
40|$|Toxic {{effects of}} {{triphenyltin}} (TPT) on the marine <b>alga</b> <b>Eucheuma</b> denticulatum obtained from Nain Island, North Sulawesi, Indonesia {{have been examined}} in laboratory condition. The algal samples were first acclimated in laboratory prepared seawater for three days. The algae were then divided into 12 culture chambers for treatments with different concentrations of TPT between 5 - 30 μgl^ with 5 μgl^ interval, and in another container for control. After two-week experimentation, some samples of algae were obtained from each chamber for histopathological examination. The aniline blue stained tissue of alga E. denticulatum showed that at all TPT concentration tested, the cortex had morphological changes, even almost disappeared at higher concentration (> 20 μgl^). The medullary cells of alga exposed to 5 - 15 μgl^ have been decreasing in size compared to those in control. Cell walls of some medullary cells have damaged at 20 μgl^ and totally lysed in all cells of alga exposed to 25 and 30 μgl^. The pattern of zonatedly dividing tetrasporangium had not occurred anymore in alga exposed to TPT even at the lowest tested concentration (5 μgl^) and had totally damaged in higher concentrations, {{such as that of}} 20 μgl^. The tetraspores in tetrasporangium seem to be fused or shrinkage, no more dividing process occurred as in control. Therefore, reproductive cells of alga is more sensitive than somatic cells, indicating that no further development of alga will occur in aquatic environment contaminated even with unlethal TPT levels...|$|R
40|$|Marine algae {{have become}} {{essential}} ingredients for {{the manufacture of}} many food products, textiles, cosmetics and other goods. They offer interesting opportunities for ACP coastal communities, {{some of which have}} already moved into seaweed farming. Stimulated by strong demand from the manufacturing industry, especially the food and textile sectors, seaweed farming is developing rapidly in coastal communities around the world. While harvests of wild seaweed have remained stable at around 1 million t for the past 30 years, global output of farmed seaweed has increased eightfold in the same period. According to FAO figures, production levels of fresh seaweed had already exceeded 8. 5 mt by 2003. And experts predict that this steady growth is set to continue. There are several thousand known species of marine macroalgae, classified according to their green, red or brown colour. But only a few dozen are used, and these are becoming increasingly sought after. Much in demand are the red seaweed varieties Chondrus, Eucheuma, Gelidium and Gracilaria and the brown ones Laminaria and Macrocystis. Brown seaweed (5. 6 mt in 2003) is the most commonly farmed type, with production easily outstripping that of red seaweed (2. 8 mt) whose output, nevertheless, rose by 75 % between 1993 and 2003. By contrast, farming of green seaweed, or sea lettuce, is undergoing a sharp decline, with production down to 7, 167 t in 2003, compared with 91, 169 t in 1993. Remarkable properties A wide variety of industrial sectors rely on phycocolloids or hydrocolloids seaweed extracts which act as vital thickening, gelling and stabilising agents. Alginic acid, derived from brown seaweed and able to retain up to 140 times its own volume of water, is crucial to the food and textile industries. The gelling properties of agars, extracted from red seaweed, are essential to all sorts of industrial preparations such as jams and sauces. Carrageenans, which are also derived from red seaweed, are mainly used in the manufacture of milk-based desserts. Harmless and low in fat, all of these substances are also increasingly used in the manufacture of health foods. The food and textile sectors alone absorb an average of 80 % of global production of these extracts, and demand is continuing to grow. Since the harvesting of wild seaweed can no longer fulfil the demand, a number of coastal countries of the South have ventured into seaweed farming, sometimes encouraged by manufacturers who are keen to secure a reliable source. In Africa and the Pacific Islands, seaweed farms mainly produce <b>Eucheuma</b> <b>algae.</b> Labour intensive, but requiring little investment, seaweed farming is well suited to small-scale production. The technique involves fixing cuttings on lengths of twine stretched between stakes, or on nets. After 6 weeks, the seaweed is ready for harvesting. Dried in the sun, and protected from the sand, it can keep for up to 2 years. The example of Kiribati, the world s 15 th biggest producer of red seaweed (3, 900 t), shows that seaweed farming could well become a profitable activity for coastal communities in the Pacific, replacing copra, which is running out of momentum. Eucheuma produced in Kiribati is shipped to Norway for treatment. Thanks to the excellent quality of the product they offer, fishers from the atolls who have switched to seaweed farming have been able to command guaranteed prices from the manufacturing industries. Their shift has had a positive effect on fish stocks and the coastal environment. Vanuatu is also seeking to set up seaweed farms, as are Fiji and Tonga. In other ACP regions, South Africa is the only country with a significant output of brown algae (30, 000 t), while Tanzania leads the field in terms of red seaweed production (115, 000 t), followed by South Africa and Madagascar, with, respectively, 2, 000 and 1, 700 t. According to FAO, there are also good prospects for countries such as Mozambique, Namibia and Senegal. Coastal ACP countries are currently limited to supplying the raw material. But can they make the transition and begin extracting and marketing these highly sought after marine vegetable derivatives on their own account? According to the experts, extraction would require a level of investment that is beyond the means of most countries of the South. What is more, this is a highly concentrated sector there are only a handful of factories worldwide, and all of them are located in industrialised countries, with the exception of Zanzibar in Tanzania (see Spore 102, page 8). Sea vegetables Farming seaweed as a food product is another avenue worth exploring. Rich in minerals (iodine, calcium) and in vitamins (A, C and E), seaweed have been eaten by Asian communities for centuries. Certain ACP countries such as Namibia and Tonga are starting to farmMarine algae have become essential ingredients for the manufacture of many food products, textiles, cosmetics and other goods [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{harvesting}} of macrophyte algae (seaweeds) is {{well established}} and on a world-wide scale more than 180, 000 tonnes dry weight of algae such as the phaeophytes Laminaria, Undaria,Sargassum and Macrocystis, the red <b>algae</b> <b>Eucheuma,</b> Gracilaria and Porphyra, and the green algae Ulva, Monostroma and Caulerpa are harvested annually. Much of this algal biomass comes from farmed rather than wild species. The red and brown algae {{are the source of}} the phycocolloids agar, alginate, agarose and carrageenan which are of fundamental importance to the development of biotechnology; i. e. for the culture of microorganisms (agar), for the separation of biomolecules (alginate and agarose) and for the production of food products (agar, carrageenan, alginate). The successful large-scale cultivation of these algae requires, amongst other things, the ability to select fast growing and disease resistant strains which produce large quantities of the desired phycocolloid. To this purpose classical plant breeding programs are being carried out, however these are slow and the production of superior cultivars takes much time and effort (Van der Meer 1988). In recent years there has therefore been much interest in developing protoplast and tissue culture systems which would allow more rapid selection and propagation of suitable cell lines, the possibility of producing hybrids by cell fusion and new strains by genetic engineering (Polne-Fuller and Gibor 1987 b, Le Gallet al. 1990). Work in our laboratory has concentrated mainly on the brown algal genera Ecklonia and Cystophora. Ecklonia was chosen because it is easily obtained and is a potential source of alginate, and Cystophora, a genus endemic to Australia and New Zealand, because previous studies indicated that this genus appears to be a good source of tocopherols and tocotrienols (Gregson et al. 1977, Kazlauskas et al. 1981, unpubl. results). The tocopherols are of interest and also provide a convenient model {{for the study of the}} production of secondary metabolites in algal tissue culture. In this paper we describe some of our findings on the tissue culture of these species and on their tocopherol content...|$|R
