40|$|This paper {{examines}} Aboriginal {{governance in}} Australia in the 1890 s, {{at a time}} when the mission station was the main instrument used to manage certain categories of Aboriginal person. The paper compares these arrangements with aspects of current practices of the Howard conservative government that deploys techniques such as ‘Shared Responsibility Agreements’ in order to govern Aboriginal communities. These forms of governance are compared and contrasted in terms of their attachment to liberalism, understood as a distinct form of <b>political</b> <b>reason</b> that is concerned with the practical implications of the belief that members of the population are endowed with, or capable of acquiring, a capacity for autonomous, self-directing activity. Finally, the paper draws connections between liberal and neo-liberal <b>political</b> <b>reason</b> on the one hand, and Aboriginal peoples’ historical relations with the criminal justice system...|$|R

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For <b>political</b> <b>reasons</b> the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E

5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for <b>political</b> <b>reasons</b> is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E

Cẩn ordered the police to arrest 1,200 people for <b>political</b> <b>reasons</b> in the week leading up to the vote. In Hội An, some people were killed in election day violence.|$|E

During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for the missile, possibly because of <b>political</b> <b>reasons,</b> the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead.

5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for <b>political</b> <b>reasons,</b> the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
