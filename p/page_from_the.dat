Travelling to the Behavioral Sciences Unit, Black learns that serial killer Ephraim Fabricant (Alex Diakun) has escaped {{from a hospital}} while donating a kidney to his sister.

5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E

5|$|By 1940, the {{collections}} {{at the library}} had increased to total of about 130,000 and 1,400 serials. Included in {{the collections}} were a variety of rare items, such as a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1642 printing of the Polychronicon, a 1628 book of poems written in Latin, and a 1769 bible printed by John Baskerville, among others. At that time the building was open from 7:50 am until 10 pm on weekdays, and 2 pm to 5 pm on Sundays. Construction on the new wing of the library started in 1940 and was designed by John V. Bennes, the same architect who designed the original structure. He also designed a matching wing {{for the other side}} as well, but that wing was never added.|$|E

The commentary is heavily ironic, with the headline reading Ce que disent les cubes... (What the cubes say...).|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} Siegel's death, the Los Angeles Herald-Express carried a {{photograph}} on its front <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> morgue of Siegel's bare right foot with a toe tag. Although Siegel's murder occurred in Beverly Hills, his death thrust Las Vegas {{into the national}} spotlight as photographs of his lifeless body were published in newspapers throughout the country.

25|$|Twenty one of {{her crew}} of 56 were {{reported}} to be missing following the incident. Four other people {{were reported to have}} been killed.

Captain Banks signalled to abandon ship when he saw the line go, and dived overboard, swimming under the flames until he lost consciousness, and was rescued by members of the Haganah. Empire Cross was scrapped in 1952.|$|E

25|$|The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both {{influenced}} Breaking Dawn. Meyer {{decided that}} Alice would write her instruction to Bella on a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Merchant of Venice {{to give a}} clue that the final confrontation {{at the end of}} the book would be a mental one—not a physical battle—like the one {{at the end of the}} play. It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice. Originally it was the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë that Alice tore a page from, but Jane Eyre had nothing to do with the story, so Meyer changed it.|$|E
25|$|President Menem {{had already}} privatized the state telecom concern and {{national}} airlines (the once-premier airline in Latin America, Aerolíneas Argentinas, which was later almost {{run into the}} ground). The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more privatizations than ever. Going on to total over 200 state enterprises, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly YPF, several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000km (6000mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. A panoply of provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Chile pension system privatization, the mandatory National Pension System was opened to choice through the authorization of private pension schemes.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, Alexis Nour was residing in neutral Romania, active within the Viața Românească circle from his new home in Iași. Like other {{members of this group}} (and primarily its founder Stere), he campaigned in favor of rapprochement with the Central Powers, recommending a war on Russia for the recovery of Bessarabia. Nour thought further than his colleagues, speculating about an alliance of interests between Romanians and Ruthenians (Ukrainians). His essay Problema româno-ruteană. O pagină din marea restaurare a națiunilor ("The Romanian-Ruthenian Issue. A <b>Page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Great Restoration of Nations"), published by Viața Românească in its October–November–December 1914 issue, inaugurated a series of such pieces, which talked about Ukraine's emancipation, the Bessarabian union, and, unusually in this context, the incorporation of Transnistria into Romania (with a new frontier on the Southern Bug).|$|E
