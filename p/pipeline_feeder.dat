2500|$|A {{network of}} {{gathering}} and <b>feeder</b> <b>pipelines</b> collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: Edmonton, Alberta and Hardisty, Alberta.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to investigate the}} hypothesis that the utilization of coal pipeline technology can promote the development of Appalachian coal resources. The necessity of developing Appalachian coal is based on the assumptions that: (1) Coal is the nation 2 ̆ 7 s primary medium-term energy source; and (2) Eastern coal resources of the Appalachian and Midwestern regions constitute a significant supply source. Coal pipeline technology offers potential for the resolution of a major impediment to coal development in the Appalachian region: the transportation constraints of handling the rapid expansion of coal production. Specifically, the integration of the coal pipeline into existing transportation networks may serve to upgrade the region 2 ̆ 7 s transportation capabilities, thereby facilitating the movement of coal to market places. This could enable many Appalachian coal resources, heretofore unavailable, to become available reserves. ^ Investigation of this hypothesis entailed: (1) construction of a site-selection methodology which was applied towards the identification of those sites most suitable for coal mining; (2) development of a cost comparison methodology for alternative modes of short haul coal transport (Rail, Truck, Pneumatic Pipeline, and Slurry Pipeline); and (3) application of the costing methodology to mine sites selected for a comparative cost analysis of alternative transport modes. ^ The most important contribution of this research was the creation of an analytical tool, with which a comparative cost analysis of short-haul coal transport modes could be made. This cost comparison methodology was tested in sixty-six hypothetical scenarios and thirty-eight site-specific scenarios. Given the assumptions of the hypothetical scenarios and the characteristics of the Appalachian region examined in the site-specific cases, results of this analysis indicated that the employment of the coal <b>pipeline</b> as a <b>feeder</b> mode could enable significant cost reductions in the short-haul transport of coal. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{success of}} {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) in {{reducing}} CO 2 emissions {{on a large}} scale will depend on effectively deploying CCS infrastructure. Key decisions will include where to build new capture-ready power plants or retrofit existing facilities, how to construct an integrated and robust CO 2 pipeline network, and which geologic reservoirs offer the best and safest storage potential. Critically, the capture, transportation, and storage components are highly interdependent and must be considered simultaneously. In previous work, we have developed and applied a CCS system optimization model that simultaneously optimizes the investments in, and operation of, the source capture facilities, the pipeline network, and the geologic sinks. The simCCS model combines GIS and operations research techniques to optimize seven sets of decisions simultaneously: source capture investment; source capture amounts; pipeline network configuration; pipeline diameters; routing of CO 2 amounts through the pipeline; sink injection investment; and sink injection amounts. In choosing the corridors for the pipelines, the model considers geographic factors such as steep topography, protected lands, urban areas, and rivers and roads. SimCCS develops a fully integrated and networked CO 2 pipeline network in which pipelines can merge and branch to create trunk lines that reduce the overall network length and tak advantage of cost savings through economies of scale and high capacity utilization. In this paper, we demonstrate the cost savings of using a model like simCCS to optimize simultaneously the seven key CCS decisions. Using a case study of the Midwest USA consisting of eight coal-fired power plants and seven depleted oil fields as potential sources and sinks, we use simCCS to optimize a networked CCS infrastructure system with trunk and <b>feeder</b> <b>pipelines.</b> We then compare those results to constrained runs of simCCS in which the pipeline branching capability is restricted to allow only direct pipelines between single sources and single sinks. For small amounts of CO 2 captured, the optimal networks are the same, {{but as soon as the}} system requires more than one source and sink, the advantages of networking the pipelines begin to emerge. For systems involving more than one source and sink, total costs average 6. 5 % lower for networked systems than for direct systems, based on savings of 2 % on source costs, 34 % on transport costs, and 22 % on sink costs. The source and sink savings are generated in the model by connecting the less expensive sources and sinks to the pipeline network. The total length of pipelines for the networked system is on average 43 % lower, and pipeline capacity utilization is 12 % higher. This analysis helps to demonstrate why comprehensive infrastructure modeling is important to the financial success of CCS...|$|R
