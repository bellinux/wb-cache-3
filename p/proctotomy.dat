40|$|Background: Gaining peritoneal access with {{subsequent}} safe closure {{is a prerequisite}} for natural orifice translumenal surgery (NOTES). We explored the possibility of transanal endoscopic operation (TEO) device to perform transrectal peritoneoscopy in a pig model. OBJECTIVE: Performing transrectal peritoneoscopy with TEO device in pig model. Methods: Two pigs were used for transrectal peritoneoscopy. A 40 -mm rectoscope was inserted via the anus after the induction of general anesthesia. <b>Proctotomy</b> was then created with diathermy and the endoscope was passed through the pararectal space into the peritoneal cavity. <b>Proctotomy</b> was closed with absorbable suture after completion of peritoneoscopy. Results: Completion of the procedures was achieved in 2 pigs. Both pigs survived for more than 30 days. Necropsy revealed completely healed rectum with no evidence of leakage or abscess formation. Adhesions around the colostomy site were minimal. Conclusions: In conclusion, incorporation of TEO system is safe and useful in animal model for creation and closure of <b>proctotomy</b> for natural orifice translumenal surgery in transrectal access, further experiment should be performed to validate the possibility of application in human. Potential complications need to be addressed and well documented. Copyright Â© 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|One hundred one {{patients}} with villous adenoma or invasive {{carcinoma of the}} distal rectum treated with local excision or coloanal anastomosis were studied. Twenty-three (45 %) of the 51 {{patients with}} villous adenomas had transanal excision, another 23 (45 %) had a posterior <b>proctotomy,</b> and five (10 %) had a coloanal anastomosis. Only two patients with a villous adenoma developed a recurrence requiring repeat local excision. Fifteen (30 %) of the 50 patients with invasive cancer were treated by transanal excision. All had tumors confined to the submucosa or superficial muscularis. Eighteen (85 %) of 21 patients having posterior <b>proctotomy</b> also had tumors with similar depth of invasion. Six (43 %) of the 14 patients having coloanal anastomosis had Dukes' B tumors, six (43 %) were Dukes' C, and another two (14 %) underwent palliative resection. The overall actuarial 5 -year survival was 77 %. Only four patients treated by transanal excision or posterior <b>proctotomy</b> died of metastatic disease. In the coloanal group, two of 12 patients undergoing curative resection died of recurrent cancer, and another has a pelvic recurrence. Villous adenomas of the distal rectum and selected carcinomas may be treated with local excision and coloanal anastomosis with preservation of sphincter function with good results...|$|E
