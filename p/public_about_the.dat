5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, {{one of the authors}} of the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E
5|$|By the 1910s, {{the use of}} breaker boys was {{dropping}} because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of compulsory education laws. The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of {{the efforts of the}} National Child Labor Committee, sociologist and photographer Lewis Hine, and the National Consumers League, all of whom educated the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of national child labor laws.|$|E

5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same issue.|$|E
5|$|Umbricht's {{death from}} {{melanoma}} helped alert the general <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> disease. Former Los Angeles Rams linebacker Jack Pardee credited Umbricht's battle with melanoma for saving {{his life in}} 1965. Pardee, a Pro Bowl linebacker, had been ignoring a mole on his armpit. After hearing of Umbricht's battle with cancer, and that his mole was similar to Umbricht's, {{he went to the}} team doctor, who diagnosed him with melanoma. Although Pardee's melanoma had also spread throughout his body, he made a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day prior}} to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11.5 points. Despite that advantage, Tech head coach Frank Beamer warned his team and the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies' chances of winning. Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while Beamer had coached for 16 years. The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time}} since 1999. Ticket sales {{prior to the}} game were sluggish, as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold. In addition, local media coverage of the game was very sparse.|$|E
5|$|Reveton {{initially}} began spreading {{in various}} European countries in early 2012. Variants were localized with templates branded with the logos of different law enforcement organizations {{based on the}} user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of {{organizations such as the}} Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit. Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music, which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. In a statement warning the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> malware, the Metropolitan Police clarified that they would never lock a computer {{in such a way as}} part of an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Since Catarina was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it, the damage was quite severe. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. Three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to $350 million (2004 USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took {{the view that the}} search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
