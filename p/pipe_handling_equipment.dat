This trial occurred between 26 December and 30 December 1942, the 30 mile length being laid across the Bristol Channel, in rough weather, and the shore ends being connected at Swansea and Ilfracombe.

50|$|In late 1943, Pyke {{submitted}} to Mountbatten a memorandum, nearly fifty pages long, explaining his ideas {{for a solution}} to the problem of unloading stores from ships where no proper port facilities are available and few roads inland. This circumstance was common in the Pacific war theatre and fundamental to the 1943 decision to invade France by landing on the beaches of Normandy, with no harbours and a 24-foot tide. Pyke's idea was to use pipes of the type that were used to transport fuel from ship to shore, to move sealed containers that would contain any type of sufficiently small material objects. Pyke suggested that 4 or 6 in <b>pipes</b> would <b>handle</b> smaller <b>equipment</b> and larger objects could be passed through two-foot pipes. Furthermore, there was no reason why the pipes should stop at the shore, they could be extended inland as required. Bernal gave a cautious endorsement to the idea, adding that it would require a great deal of investigation. Pyke's idea was similar to the cleaning brushes that are sometimes forced along pipes by the pressure of the fluid and to the pipeline pigs which today are used for cleaning and telemetry.|$|R

40|$|A key {{task in the}} {{material}} handling system design process is the selection and configuration of equipment for material transport and storage in a facility. Material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection is a complex, tedious task, and there are few tools other than checklists to assist engineers {{in the selection of}} appropriate, cost-effective material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> This paper describes the development of an intelligent material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system called material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection advisor (MHESA). The MHESA is composed of three modules: (1) a database to store equipment types with their specifications; (2) a knowledge-based expert system for assisting material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection; and (3) an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to choose the most favorable equipment type. The concept proposed in this paper can automate the design of a material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system, and provides artificial intelligence in the decision-making process. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Rack and pinion {{technology}} {{has been with us}} in various applications for decades. The method is well known for long durability and high efficiency. Experience on using rack and pinion technology in the drilling industry dates back to the mid 80 ’s, when it was used mainly for <b>pipe</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and other relatively slow moving machines. With the forming of Engineering and Drilling Machinery (EDM) in 1997, significant advances and refinements to the technology contributed to several patent applications which later have been granted internationally. During the late 90 ’s EDM was engaged in several projects in-volving equipment for workover and snubbing operations in the North Sea area. At that time such operations were dangerous to people and surroundings, often consisting of suit-able or not so suitable equipment stacked {{on top of each other}} without a consistent design and consideration to HSE and optimal functionality. To improve the situation, EDM de-signed [9], a workover machine utilizing rack and pinion technology allowing faster and simpler rig up and rig down, lower weight and higher safety level. The main value, how-ever, was that the rig could easily shift from drilling, workover into snubbing and underbalanced operations, without modifications to the rig, such as use of temporary wires...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{drilling}} operations in Arctic regions is growing significantly {{due to an}} increasing need for oil and gas. The harsh environment in Arctic regions requires safe and acceptable working conditions. In order to still have an acceptable working environment and protection for drilling and <b>pipe</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{it is important to}} make improvements in design of upcoming drilling rigs. One of the items that needed to be developed is the derrick/drill tower, which today is mainly constructed as a structural framework and has limited working areas where crews can work without exposure to the weather and winds. A low structural weight of a derrick is desired in order to achieve improved and sustained stability conditions. The objectives with the present study is to propose a weight-optimized stressed skin derrick and compare the design with a covered conventional truss derrick with respect to weight and strength. Aker MH has provided data about a conventional truss derrick which was used as a reference derrick for input of loads, dimensions and weights in order to design a new derrick. To ensure enough structural strength against yielding and buckling, structural analyses were carried out by using a finite element analysis based on 3 D beam theory. Numerical optimization of outer plating thickness, stiffeners and stringer dimensions were performed by using the numerical computation software Matlab. After the optimization against buckling and yielding, a final weight of 465 mT was achieved. This weight can be compared to a covered conventional truss derrick which is estimated to 590 mT. The reduction of weight is 21 % compared to a covered conventional truss derrick. The vertical centre of gravity of the new derrick design was reduced by 1. 5 m. By introducing radius in the corner of a stressed skin derrick, the wind forces acting on the derrick were decreased significantly and this provides sustained stability for a drilling unit. Due to lower weight in the new design, the manufacturing costs were reduced by 4. 2 MNOK. The obtained weight of the stressed skin derrick is less than the covered conventional truss derrick. In order to use the proposed design in the future, a further study should be carried out. To ensure that the designs are safe enough for commercial usage, a fatigue analysis needs to be carried out in order to achieve the final design...|$|E

In order to still have an acceptable working environment and protection of the drilling and <b>pipe</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> it is necessary to make improvements of upcoming drilling rigs. One of the items needed to be developed is the derrick/drill tower, which nowadays is a framework structure with only a limited protection against the severe weather conditions. A low weight of the derrick is desired in order to achieve improved stability conditions of the rig and hence be able to obtain a higher deck load capacity. The objectives with the current work were to propose a weight-optimized basic design of a stressed skin derrick and to compare it to a covered conventional truss derrick with respect to weight and strength. Aker MH has provided data about a conventional truss derrick which was used as a reference derrick for input of loads, dimensions and weights. In order to ensure enough structural strength, structural analyses have been carried out using FEM. The optimization software, LSOPT, has been used to weight-optimize the outer plating of the structure against yielding. The buckling strength of the plates and stiffeners was checked analytically and modifications were done to fulfill the buckling criteria. A limited buckling check of some stringers was also carried out to study the influence of the stringer weights. After the optimization against yielding, a structural weight of 619 mT was achieved and with the adjustments made for the buckling stability of plates and stiffeners a weight was obtained at 641 mT. The initially chosen stringers were shown to be significantly heavier than necessary and with the limited check and modifications of the stringers a final weight of 550 mT was achieved. The weight of a covered conventional truss derrick is estimated to 590 mT. The obtained weight of the stressed skin derrick is less than the covered conventional truss derrick. Further weight reduction potential exists if optimizations of stiffeners and stringers against the buckling criteria are carried out. The main conclusion of the work is that further developments of the stressed skin derrick should be of interest to carry out in order to have the possibility of using it in the future...|$|E

40|$|Container {{terminals}} mainly {{include three}} types of <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> i. e.; quay cranes (QCs), internal trucks (ITs) and yard cranes (YCs). Due to high cost of the <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> container terminals can hardly purchase additional <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Therefore, the reasonable scheduling of these <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> especially coordinated scheduling of the {{three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{plays an important role in}} the service level and energy-saving of container terminal. This paper addresses the problem of integrated QC scheduling, IT scheduling and YC scheduling. Firstly, this problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model (MIP), where the objective is to minimize the total departure delay of all vessels and the total transportation energy consumption of all tasks. Furthermore, an integrated simulation-based optimization method is developed for solving the problem, where the simulation is designed for evaluation and optimization algorithm is designed for searching solution space. The optimization algorithm integrates genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, where the GA is used for global search and the PSO is used for local search. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can coordinate the scheduling of {{the three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and can realize the optimal trade-off between time-saving and energy-saving...|$|R
