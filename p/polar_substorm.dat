30|$|The word “substorm” first {{appeared}} {{in a review of}} magnetic storms by Chapman (1962). “Thus his polar storms I call polar substorms, and denote them and their currents by DP.” The association of polar substorms, and the justification of {{the use of the term}} substorm, was further developed in three papers (Akasofu et al. 1963; Akasofu and Chapman 1963 a, b). The development of the aurora in association with the <b>polar</b> <b>substorm</b> was described by Akasofu (1964) and named the auroral substorm.

40|$|The {{absolute}} {{intensity of}} geomagnetically trapped protons {{in the energy}} ranges from 0. 52 to 4. 0 MeV and from 0. 90 to 1. 8 MeV has been measured with the solid-state proton detector on the satellite Injun 4 for the period from Mar. 1 to May 31, 1965. A study of the temporal variations of these fluxes associated with the Apr. 17, 1965, magnetic storm shows a general redistribution of these protons for L greater than 2. 5. The effect of the sudden commencement was a general depression in the intensities and a hardening of the energy spectra, although the intensities recovered to their prestorm level during the initial phase. The major redistribution was apparently initiated by the <b>polar</b> <b>substorm.</b> During the recovery phase, a secondary peak developed in the intensity profile at L of about 3. 5 for 0. 52 -MeV protons that had no counterpart at this energy at the equator.

40|$|Comprehensive {{studies of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>substorm</b> {{phenomena}} could be accomplished by expanding the observation network horizontally by setting arrays of unmanned observatories and vertically by use of balloons, sounding rockets and scientific satellites. For example of the research coordination between ground-based observatories and sounding rockets, 15 examples of the electron number density profile measured by rockets at Syowa Station in Antarctica are compared with the ground-based observation data. It seems that the auroral ionization by soft precipitating auroral electrons of exp (-E/ 2 keV) in energy spectrum takes place only within auroral arcs, whereas the D-region ionization by hard electrons (> 30 keV) is not localized within the auroral arcs.

With {{the aid of the}} quick-scan auroral photometer data of more than 300 clear night hours recorded at Syowa Station, Antarctica (geomagnetic lat. 69. 6 °S, long. 77. 1 °E), the following problems are studied: (1) space and time variation of auroral displays, (2) magnetic field variations associated with the space-time auroral displays, (3) relationships among auroras, magnetic field disturbance, magnetic pulsations, VLF hiss, VLF chorus and GNA during the course of substorms. Various kinds of morphological evidence obtained through the above investigations show that a <b>polar</b> <b>substorm</b> consists of the breakup phase and the post-breakup phase. The breakup phase is characterized by a sudden intensification of auroral arc(s) or band(s) and a rapid poleward movement of the intensified aurora(s) with speed of about 1 km/s (Breakup type aurora). The post-breakup phase is defined as diffused auroras or rays which still remain after the intense breakup type aurora(s) have passed away polewards (Post-breakup type aurora). Generally, the post-breakup aurora(s) move towards the equator side. A breakup type aurora is accompanied by a sharp pulsative geomagnetic disturbance (Breakup magnetic disturbance), while a post-breakup type aurora by a gradual negative bay-shape disturbance (Post-breakup magnetic disturbance). It seems that the sharp pulsative disturbance moves polewards together with the moving breakup aurora, while the gradual negative bay stays with the associated post-breakup aurora(s). Thus, the auroral electrojet can also be classified into AEJ- 1, which is an intense and narrow electrojet moving together with the breakup aurora, and AEJ- 2, which is a comparatively broad and weak electrojet associated with the post-breakup aurora(s). The auroral breakup phase is accompanied not only by a sharp pulsative geomagnetic disturbance but also by VLF hiss emissions, ULF emissions of PiB type and a sharp CNA phenomenon, while the post-breakup aurora is accompanied by a gradual geo-magnetic bay, a gradual, weak CNA, VLF chorus emissions and ULF emissions of PiC type. With reference to 2 ̆ 7 the space-time variations in auroras associated with geomagnetic perturbations at Syowa Station, an overall physical picture of dynamic auroral behaviors over the entire polar region is given, as a conclusion...|$|E

40|$|The {{techniques}} are reviewed for measuring ionospheric electron content, {{the most important}} parameter {{in the study of}} transionospheric propagation. Data collected since 1964 have yielded a synoptic description of the behavior of the electron content in midlatitudes.

Construction of such prognostication schemes was stimulated by current efforts to create accurate satellite borne navigation systems. Gravity waves propagating in the thermosphere leave a signature in the electron content records. Studies of such records have allowed the identification of the position of the gravity wave source, and its radiation pattern.

Statistical distribution of substorm onset locations in the southern and northern hemispheres for different clock angles enables us to validate the IMF clock angle control.

40|$|Summary. It is {{now well}} {{accepted}} that magnetic field perturbations associ-ated with <b>polar</b> magnetic <b>substorms</b> can be modelled by a three-dimensional equivalent current loop involving an electrojet segment in the high-latitude ionosphere {{linked to the}} outer magnetosphere by currents flowing parallel to magnetic lines of force.

The technique is developed using the Biot-Savart Law and analytical expressions for the three components (H, D, 2) of the magnetic perturbation at the Earth’s surface are developed. Assuming the Earth to be represented by an infinitely conducting sphere covered by a perfect insulator to some arbitrary depth, the time independent induction problem is treated and analytical expressions for H, D, and 2 corrected for Earth induction are developed. The modelling technique is applied to three substorm events and the results provide an accurate and comprehensive indicator of the character and spatial extent of the inducing current system associated with magnetospheric substorms. ...|$|R

40|$|Observations of polarization, {{incident}} {{angle and}} arriving direction of auroral hiss {{were carried out}} at Syowa Station {{during the period of}} 1967 to 1970. The present paper consists of two parts. In Part I, we describe the equipment used for the measurement of polarization, incident and azimuthal angles and show the obtained results. The direction finding (DE) system used is based on the analysis of Lissajous 2 ̆ 7 figures of electric and magnetic fields displayed on cathode ray tubes. The individual polarization of the received signal is also measured. Moreover, auroral hiss is decomposed into right-and left-handed polarized components, and these two components are continuously recorded. From the discussion of the observed results, it is found that auroral hiss has propagated downward in the azimuthal direction from a not so broad range around the magnetic meridian plane and its incident angle is also not so large. Additionally, in most cases, auroral hiss is known to consist of wave components downcoming from multiple directions in the azimuthal and incident planes. The DF system used was found to be effective in a few cases of isolated and sharp auroral hiss. However, this system should be re-examined because it is, strictly speaking, useful only for monochromatic waves, while the auroral hiss seems to have a noise-like nature. Therefore, a new DF system applying the correlation method is being planned to study, with more accuracy, the azimuthal and incident angles of noisy signals such as auroral hiss. The polarization of auroral hiss received on the ground seems to be almost right-handed circular, at VLF and LF, which is theoretically confirmed by the full wave calculation of the polarization using the realistic model of the auroral ionosphere. On the other hand, the observed polarization of ELF hiss is slightly right-handed circular, which can be reasonably accepted, taking into consideration the result of the full, wave calculation. In Part II, the morphological characteristics of auroral hiss are discussed in comparison with those of low-latitude hiss using the VLF data observed at Syowa Station and at Moshiri in Japan. Auroral hiss, considered to be a manifestation of <b>polar</b> <b>substorms,</b> is a local phenomenon and its frequency extends from a few kHz to more than 100 kHz. Low-latitude hiss, however, is closely correlated with worldwide geomagnetic storms and it is a narrow band VLF phenomenon. Together with other differences between them, it is concluded that auroral hiss is completely different from low-latitude hiss. Although the morphological features of auroral hiss have been well known, a complete understanding of its generation mechanism has not yet been obtained. There are unsolved problems such as about two orders shortening of the calculated intensity below the observations and the existence of the threshold low-energy electron flux below which VLF hiss is not observed. These facts may suggest that a coherent plasma instability mechanism is partially involved in the generation of auroral hiss. Therefore, the investigation of the coherency of auroral hiss being planned by us may give {{a better understanding of the}} generation processes of auroral hiss...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{studies of}} magnetospheric substorms are {{necessarily}} statistical {{since there are}} few properly instrumented satellites in space at any one time. To carry out these studies, one selects an ensemble of similar substorms, determines an origin for substorm time, and per-forms an ensemble average to eliminate noise. Similarity between different substorms can be determined from contour maps of midlatitude magnetic perturbations {{as a function of}} longi-tude and universal time. The origin of substorm time can also be determined from midlatitude perturbations and is usually taken as the beginning of the positive bay near midnight. Use of these techniques has led to a phenomenological model of magnetospheric substorms that includes a growth phase. The controversy over the existence of the growth phase is at least partially a consequence of differing definitions of the origin of substorm time. Use of auroral zone magnetograms often gives an earlier onset than midlatitude magnetograms. However, midlatitude onsets do appear to order satellite data systematically. In this paper we illustrate the discrepancy between these two onset times and show how midlatitude onsets order satellite data in agreement with the growth phase model. Three events of increasing complexity are considered. Each has been previously reported in the literature and later criticized. We specu-late that a <b>polar</b> magnetic <b>substorm</b> begins when a pair of X- and O-type neutral lines form on closed field lines within the plasma sheet.

The objective was a {{detailed study of}} the North American Central Plains (NACP) conductive body earlier discovered striking northward from the Black Hills roughly along longitude 104 " W in the United States. Source fields were provided by <b>polar</b> magnetic <b>substorms</b> and by other events with incident fields more uniform over the array. Northward mapping of the conductor was carried to within 90 km of the exposed Canadian Shield of north central Saskat-chewan. Between latitudes 43 " N and 48 " N maximum depth estimates place the conductor within the lithosphere; the currents probably flow at smaller depths, i. e. within the crust. At the Shield edge the axis of the conductor {{is parallel to the}} strike of fold belts and fault zones in metamor-phic rocks, including mylonites, characteristic of intense grinding and crushing. Graphitic conductors are known in many fracture zones. The conductivity anomaly links these structural elements in the Churchill Province Shield to the metamorphic belt mapped by Lidiak in the South Dakota basement, and to the Black Hills. South of the Black Hills the conductor turns southwest to the northern end of the Southern Rockies. There is evidence which suggests, but does not demonstrate, a conductive link there between the mantle conductor under the Southern Rockies and the NACP crustal conductor. It is postulated that the linear crustal structure may be a major continental fracture zone now mapped over a total length of 1800 km, of which 300 km is exposed in the Shield.

40|$|The OGO- 6 {{electric}} field measurements {{make it clear}} that the general pattern of high latitude {{electric field}}s in magnetic time-invariant latitude coordinates is not highly variable and that when unusual variations, or field distributions, occur they are relatively isolated in time and spatial extent. Thus, electric field changes on a global scale cannot, in general, be evoked as a direct cause of <b>substorms.</b> <b>Polar</b> traverses along the 18 (h) to 6 (h) magnetic time meridian show that the sum of potential drops across the evening auroral belt and morning auroral belt approximately equals the potential drop across the polar cap. The integrated polar cap potential drop ranges from 20 to 100 keV and values in the center of this range are most common under conditions of moderate magnetic disturbance. Roughly near 18 (h) magnetic local time, a latitudinally narrow strip at the transition between auroral belt and polar cap fields exhibits unusually large field fluctuations immediately following the sudden onset of a negative bay at later magnetic local times.

40|$|As the Polar {{spacecraft}} apogee precessed through the magnetic equator in 2001, <b>Polar</b> encountered numerous <b>substorm</b> {{events in the}} region between geosynchronous orbit and 10 RE geocentric distance; {{most of them in}} the plasma sheet boundary layers. Of these, a small number was recorded near the neutral sheet in the evening sector. Polar/Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment provides a unique perspective on the lowest-energy ion plasma, showing that these events exhibited a damped wavelike character, initiated by a burst of radially outward flow transverse to the local magnetic field at approximately 80 km/s. They then exhibit strongly damped cycles of inward/outward flow with a period of several minutes. After one or two cycles, they culminated in a hot plasma electron and ion injection, quite similar to those observed at geosynchronous orbit. Cold plasmaspheric plasmas comprise the outward flow cycles, while the inward flow cycles contain counterstreaming field-parallel polar wind-like flows. The observed wavelike structure, preceding the arrival of an earthward moving substorm injection front, suggests an outward displacement driven by the inward motion at local times closer to midnight, that is, a "snowplow" effect. The damped in/out flows are consistent with interchange oscillations driven by the arrival at the observed local time by an injection originating at greater radius and local time...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of auroral and <b>polar</b> {{magnetic}} <b>substorm</b> studies, {{the relationship between the}} solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo (the DD dynamo) current and the substorm dynamo (the UL dynamo) current is studied. The characteristics of both the DD and UL currents reveal why auroral substorms consist of the three distinct phases after the input power ε is increased above 10 18 erg s − 1. (a) The growth phase; the magnetosphere can accumulate magnetic energy for auroral substorms, when the ionosphere cannot dissipate the power before the expansion phase. (b) The expansion phase; the magnetosphere releases the accumulated magnetic energy during the growth phase in a pulse-like manner in a few hours, because it tries to stabilize itself when the accumulated energy reaches to about 10 23 erg s − 1. (c) The recovery phase; the magnetosphere becomes an ordinary dissipative system after the expansion phase, because the ionosphere becomes capable of dissipating the power with the rate of 10 18 ~ 10 19 erg s − 1. On {{the basis of}} the above conclusion, it is suggested that the magnetosphere accomplishes the pulse-like release process (resulting in spectacular auroral activities) by producing plasma instabilities in the current sheet, thus reducing the current. The resulting contraction of the magnetic field lines (expending the accumulated magnetic energy), together with break down of the "frozen-in" field condition at distances of less than 10 R E, establishes the substorm dynamo that generates an earthward electric field (Lui and Kamide, 2003; Akasofu, 2011). It is this electric field which manifests as the expansion phase. A recent satellite observation at a distance of as close as 8. 1 R E by Lui (2011) seems to support strongly the occurrence of the chain of processes suggested in the above. It is hoped that although the concept presented here is very crude, it will serve in providing one way of studying the three phases of auroral substorms. In turn, a better understanding of auroral substorms will also be useful in studying the magnetosphere, because various auroral activities can be the visible guide for this endeavor...|$|R
40|$|The {{area of the}} <b>polar</b> cap during <b>substorms</b> {{has been}} {{measured}} using images from the Polar Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) for different interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. Changes in the poleward boundary of auroral luminosity have been analyzed in relation to substorm phase and IMF orientation. Reconnection models of flux transport into the polar cap during the substorm growth phase, and loss from the polar cap during the expansion phase, provide a framework by which these UVI observations can be analyzed. By comparison of the observations with the model predictions we can determine to what extent these models accurately predict the polar cap dynamics, and also where anomalous behavior calls for {{a new understanding of}} the dynamics beyond what these models provide. It was found that the polar cap boundary near noon and midnight usually shifted down in latitude by 1 - 2 degrees and 3 - 4 degrees respectively, increasing the area of the polar cap during the substorm growth phase as predicted. However, this growth phase phenomenon also unexpectedly occurs independently of the IMF Bz component, as shown for a substorm on January 9, 1997. The polar cap area also increased due to motion of the dawn and dusk aurora to lower latitudes, although the latitudinal shifts were asymmetric, not always concurrent, and continued well into the substorm expansion phase. The polar cap area decreased immediately following the expansion phase due to the poleward motion of the aurora on the nightside, consistent with the model prediction. What is not explained by the models is that the poleward auroral boundary in the nightside region sometimes reached very high latitudes (greater than 80 degrees MLat) greatly decreasing the polar cap area, independent of the magnitude of the substorm...|$|R

Syrjäsuo and E. F. Donovan, pp. 81 - 86. It is available from [URL] only entryThe coupled nature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system makes measurements of ionospheric convection, such as those provided by the SuperDARN HF radars, extremely useful in diagnosing magnetospheric dynamics. Flux Transfer Events (FTEs) at the dayside magnetopause, for example, are well-resolved in ionospheric flow data as Pulsed Ionospheric Flows (PIFs). Similarly, Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs) associated with the earthward transport of flux in the tail have a discernable flow signature in the nightside ionosphere. The large-scale convection associated with magnetospheric substorms is also readily identifiable in ionosphere flow data. During the growth phase, for example, the expansion of the polar cap due to enhanced open flux production is evidenced in the equatorward motion of radar backscatter. On the nightside, fast equatorward flows emanating from the <b>polar</b> cap after <b>substorm</b> onset, followed by a poleward contraction of the flow reversal boundary, provide evidence for tail reconnection and the closure of open flux. The complex electrodynamics associated with substorms, however, ensures immense variety {{in the nature of the}} flow signatures which are observed. Some studies, for example, have reported a reduction in the nightside flows at the time of substorm onset, possibly resulting from enhancements in auroral conductivity associated with substorm energetic particle precipitation which imposes a limit on the size of the local electric field. Enhanced electric field phenomena such as Substorm-Associated Radar Auroral Surges (SARAS) and Auroral Westward Flow Channels (AWFC) provide additional constraints on the global substorm picture. This paper provides an overview of these and other important convection signatures associated with substorms and briefly discuss how future developments of SuperDARN can further enhance our understanding of substorm physics...|$|R
