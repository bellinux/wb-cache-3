50|$|From a human {{resources}} viewpoint, the <b>payroll</b> <b>department</b> is critical because employees {{are sensitive to}} payroll errors and irregularities: Good employee morale requires payroll to be paid timely and accurately. The primary mission of the <b>payroll</b> <b>department</b> {{is to ensure that}} all employees are paid accurately and timely with the correct withholdings and deductions, and that the withholdings and deductions are remitted in a timely manner. This includes salary payments, tax withholdings, and deductions from paychecks.|$|E

5000|$|Carver and Walker both believe Disney {{has more}} {{evidence}} {{than it has}} shown, particularly security footage of the area by the pool, and is covering up knowledge of what happened {{out of fear of}} adverse publicity. [...] "If there's a video that shows your daughter going overboard," [...] Carver told Ronson, [...] "that's the end of the story. There's no way someone can go off a ship and it not be recorded." [...] Melissa told Ronson it was implausible that there was no footage since the pool is close to a number of other important offices, such as human resources and the <b>payroll</b> <b>department,</b> where money and sensitive documents were kept. She believed any coverup by Disney may have been as much about protecting themselves from charges of negligence, since the pool is just below the ship's bridge and would thus be the portion of the ship where a fall would most likely be seen by someone in a position to start a rescue. [...] "If it was 6 am and they were doing their job and watching the front, someone must have seen her go over," [...] she told Ronson. [...] "Or if they didn't, they're covering up why they didn't." ...|$|E

5000|$|Endicott was a {{community}} planned by E-J and incorporated in 1906. It {{was named after}} Henry B. Endicott (one of the grade schools was named Henry B,) who owned the business that became E-J. Lestershire was renamed Johnson City, New York in honor of George F. All of the tanneries {{and the vast majority}} of the shoe factories were located in Endicott with a few satellite locations in Johnson City and Binghamton. The Johnsons lived in Endicott and George F's mansion was donated to the Village after his death and became the public library. Most of the jobs were classified as [...] "piece work." [...] Racks of shoes moved though the factories with [...] "coupons" [...] attached to each rack. When the worker completed his/her operation on the rack of shoes, he or she removed the appropriate coupon which was worth a few pennies. At the end of the week the worker turned in his coupons from which the <b>payroll</b> <b>department</b> calculated pay. The work was hard and the pay was low, but the extensive benefits were offsets. The windows in the factories were painted so workers wouldn't be distracted by the outside. The company needed a large labor pool and initiated a recruitment program aimed at southern Italy and the Slavic countries and so Endicott became a small town with a rich ethnic mix. Many of the sons and daughters of these immigrants graduated from Union-Endicott High School and went on to become teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and successful business people. Very few went to work in the factories.|$|E

The <b>Payroll</b> <b>Department</b> {{joined a}} Global Service Center {{becoming}} responsible for processes from 10 countries within the Americas. The interrelated critical processes were handled independently, not only generating ineffective and inefficient services, but communication gaps as well. Applied Research {{was done in}} four phases: Phase 1, the project management capabilities were exposed. In Phase 2, the set of critical processes to be addressed {{with a focus on}} small projects were identified. For Phase 3, a methodological guide was created to carry out the projects based on the PMBOK ® and PRINCE 2 ™. Finally in Phase 4, an implementation plan was defined for the proposed guide. The capabilities analysis, in Project Management, shows that the department leaders have the most hours of approved courses in a year and Payroll has led 35 projects. 17 critical processes were identified to be addressed with six small projects using the proposed methodological guide that promotes a culture of standardization and proactive behavior. The solution can be extended to other regions of Asia and Europe.

40|$|In inter-connected systems, {{where several}} {{computers}} share information with each other, problems may arise when inappropriate information starts to flow through. For example, {{let us consider}} a simple scenario of a university composed of three departments: payroll, financial aid, and academic services. We know that the <b>payroll</b> <b>department</b> deals with sensitive information, such as social security numbers, dates of birth, amounts of wages, etc. The financial aid department may use information that payroll owns. Similarly, the academic department communicates with the financial aid department. An intruder might {{take advantage of this}} network connectivity and create an inappropriate flow of information across the network, leading to the so-called Cascade Vulnerability Problem (CVP). ^ Several approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. Among them, the approach of Bistarelli et al. [9, 13] is of particular interest, as they express a solution of the problem using Constraint Programming, more specifically, soft constraints. This approach not only enables the detection of vulnerable paths in a network, but also eliminates the links in the network that provoke the security leakage. ^ This paranoid approach to network connectivity, although trivial to compute, is impractical because it neither considers the organizational value nor risk of each individual network link. When either is quantified and overall limitations are specified, CVP can be reduced to a constraint optimization problem. ^ In our proposed approach, we apply and implement the approach of Bistarelli et al., using soft constraints to model, detect and solve the cascade vulnerability problem, but we extend it by using the minimum weighted hitting set approximation algorithm to deal with the connection values. This way, we are able not only to detect the CVP, but also to make the least expensive cuts in the networks connections. ...|$|E

SARAs are legal entities, {{such as a}} service or a department, which are required to prepare accrual records that may diverge from a treasury''s cash accounting records. Their records reflect revenues generated; budget funds for generating the revenues; and material programs administered for other agencies.
