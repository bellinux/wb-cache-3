50|$|The similar Maru-ni, {{which were}} used by the Imperial Japanese Army, were {{equipped}} with two depth charges, and were not actually suicide boats, as {{the idea was to}} drop the depth charges and then turn around before the explosion took place. Although the chances of boat and crew surviving the wave from the explosion might seem slim, a small number of crewmen successfully escaped. The depth charges used were known as the Experimental Manufacture Use 120 kg Depth Charge, and were armed by a delayed-action <b>pull</b> <b>igniter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In World War II, combat {{engineers}} used satchel {{charges to}} demolish heavy stationary targets such as rails, obstacles, blockhouses, bunkers, caves, and bridges. The World War II-era United States Army M37 Demolition Kit contained eight blocks of high explosive, with 2 priming assemblies, in a canvas {{bag with a}} shoulder strap. Part or all of this charge could be placed against a structure or slung into an opening. It was usually detonated with a <b>pull</b> <b>igniter.</b> When used as an anti-tank weapon, charges were sufficient to severely damage the tracks. 4 kg charges were enough to destroy medium tanks.|$|E
50|$|To load, insert {{one or more}} powder {{increments}} in the muzzle. Place {{the stick}} of the stick bomb in the tube. Then, to aim, adjust the graduated range slide to the desired distance. This regulates {{the length of the}} stick extending into the barrel of the mortar. The greater the distance the stick extends into the barrel, the greater the range. The principle involved is similar to that employed in adjusting the range of the Type 89 50 mm grenade discharger. To traverse, loosen the two wing nuts that secure the bipod, and swing the bipod feet around the area in front of the base plate. Finally, to arm explosive charge, insert the two friction-type <b>pull</b> <b>igniters</b> in the holes provided in the base.|$|R
50|$|The Type 98 50 mm mortar fires a {{formidable}} stick bomb weighing nearly 10 pounds and containing an explosive charge of approximately 7 pounds of picric acid in rectangular blocks. The {{body of the}} bomb, made of sheet metal (three-sixteenths of an inch thick), is rectangular in shape 4 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 6 1/2 inches) and is painted black. A hardwood stick 21 inches long and 1.91 inches in diameter fits into a socket {{in the base of}} the body, and is held in place by nails or screws. The bottom end of the stick is covered with a metal cap. Two friction-type <b>pull</b> <b>igniters,</b> with black-powder delay trains giving a delay interval of approximately 7 seconds, fit into holes in the base of the charge.|$|R
5000|$|The M116/A1 is not {{technically}} a stun grenade, but {{is in fact}} a hand grenade simulator, designed to create a realistic but not dangerous grenade-like effect for exercises. The M116 series is usually fitted with a <b>pull</b> string <b>igniter</b> and fuze assembly. An improvised stun grenade was created from the M116 series by US Navy SEALs, by replacing this fuze with an M201 series igniting fuze. This new weapon was nicknamed the [...] "Flash-Crash". There are certain dangers from using the M116-based Flash-Crash however, mainly the metal body, from which potentially dangerous fragments may break when employing the device in hostage rescue situations.|$|R
50|$|To be used, the {{friction}} wire {{had to be}} <b>pulled</b> from the <b>igniter,</b> starting the delay train at the last possible moment. To do this, a piece of leather {{was attached to the}} igniter with a snap hook; pulling this removed the wire so the grenade could be thrown. A man with average strength could throw this grenade about 15 m.|$|R
50|$|The Hafthohlladung (lit. {{adhesive}} hollow charge) {{was primarily}} used by Wehrmacht tank killer squads. Designed with three magnets at the base, {{each with a}} pair of poles creating a strong magnetic field across their gap, an infantryman could attach it to an enemy's tank no matter the angle of the surface. As the blast axis should be flush and perpendicular to the plane of the armour at the point of placement, and armed by <b>pulling</b> the <b>igniter</b> on the rear of the mine, the degree of a tank's sloped armour would be irrelevant for the device's penetration. However this required direct placement made use of the device very dangerous, as that infantryman would be highly vulnerable to enemy fire.|$|R
