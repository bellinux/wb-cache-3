40|$|The large {{variety of}} {{photovoltaic}} (PV) technologies today {{available on the}} market makes the characterization of the spectral content of the used light sources a key parameter for calibration and energy yield estimation of PV devices. The use of pulsed, artificial light sources is spread worldwide but these <b>solar</b> <b>simulators</b> have the disadvantage of producing light beams with a spectral content rather different from the Air Mass 1. 5 global (AM 1. 5 g) standard spectrum, thus requiring a careful correction of the spectral mismatch between actual and standard spectral conditions.

40|$|The {{long term}} outdoor {{performance}} of silicon based thin film modules (a-Si and Hybrid) {{placed on the}} same rack is studied {{over a number of}} years in order to develop a common time-invariant energy rating method. It is found to be more difficult to accurately predict the performance of the thin film modules mainly due to degradation and annealing effects.

40|$|Bifacial PV modules {{have shown}} the {{potential}} to increase the performance of traditional photovoltaic module architectures using relatively conventional silicon manufacturing techniques. Bifacial modules can produce additional energy from the rear surface of the module, collecting not only light incident on the front surface but also sunlight scattered or reflected from the ground or environment onto the rear surface. To assess their performance and quality, PV modules are characterized using international standards to rate the modules in terms of output power and efficiency. However, at present, no specific standards exist for bifacial modules. Furthermore, these modules are often characterized by a high efficiency and an increased capacitance and the measurement with standard <b>pulsed</b> <b>solar</b> <b>simulators</b> may be affected by strong measurement artefacts resulting in increased or reduced maximum power. This work presents the indoor characterisation of bifacial c-Si PV modules under varying irradiance levels using different methods such as a single-sweep flash simulator, the so-called multi-flash (MF) method and a steady state sun simulator for the accurate measurement of the module parameters. The effect of different rear surface coverings, from matt black painted wood to gloss white card and the differences among the characterisation method are also investigated. JRC.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Accuracy and {{reliability}} in {{the determination of}} series resistance RS of PV devices is an important issue, not only in industrial production environment, because of the parasitic and power consuming nature of this intrinsic parameter, but also in measurement and test laboratories, due to its influence during the translation of measured IV curves to reporting conditions. This work follows standard IEC 60891 ed. 2 (2009) for {{the determination of the}} internal series resistance and focuses on the repeatability of the result and its uncertainty. The latter is studied in particular considering a possible variation of device temperature during the I-V measurements for the RS determination. An analytical expression is derived for quantifying the additional apparent series resistance ∆RS due to temperature variation. Experimental results confirm the derived expression. Although the standard IEC 60891 ed. 2 (2009) states that a constant device temperature is required during the I-V curve measurements, it sets the limits for stability within ± 2 °C. Here it is found that this would lead to a deviation ∆RS, which is comparable to RS itself. However, if the temperature variation is limited to ± 0. 1 °C, which is achievable on <b>pulsed</b> <b>solar</b> <b>simulators,</b> the deviation of RS is limited to ± 5 %. The repeatability of RS was found to be typically better than 5 %. Conservatively, simply adding the two components, the overall combined expanded uncertainty (k= 2) for the determination of RS is found to be ± 10 %. It is recommended to revise IEC 60891 ed. 2 concerning the device temperature during determination of RS. JRC. F. 7 -Renewables and Energy Efficienc...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{quantify}} spectral {{effects on the}} electric parameters of multi-junction solar cells is presented. The method is based on measuring the short circuit current {{of at least two}} monitor cells. Ideally these monitor cells have the same spectral responses as the subcells in the investigated multi-junction solar cell. In contrast to the subcells, the current of the individual monitor cells can be measured separately. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the spectral impact on the current mismatch of the multi-junction solar cell. A spectrometric evaluation method is then applied. The method has been tested experimentally with three concentrator modules using III-V triple-junction solar cells. These modules were measured outdoors for several months under variable solar spectral conditions. In parallel, the IV curves of the modules and the current of two component cells were measured. A spectral parameter Z was derived from the monitor cell current signals, which was correlated to the short circuit current and the fill factor of the modules. A linear correlation was found between Z and the normalized short circuit Current of the concentrator modules. Translation equations were derived from the linear correlation. These enable the calculation of a module's short circuit current under any spectral conditions. In particular, the short circuit currents of the modules were derived for direct normal irradiance of 850 W/m(2) and spectral conditions corresponding to the AM 1. 5 d low AOD spectrum. This is an important step towards comparing the performance of modules which show strong spectral sensitivity. Future rating methods can benefit from the presented simple method for quantifying spectral impacts oil multi-junction solar cells. Furthermore. the method can be of interest for tuning the spectrum of <b>pulsed</b> <b>solar</b> <b>simulators...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{calibration}} procedure and {{good laboratory practice}} {{on the use of}} a commercial fast spectroradiometer for the measurements of the emission spectrum of a <b>pulsed</b> <b>solar</b> <b>simulator</b> is presented. Quantitative assessment of spectroradiometer calibration and spectra measurement uncertainties, together with their influence on the calculation of photovoltaic (PV) modules performance are also presented. A commercial fast spectroradiometer was used for solar simulator spectra measurements. The first part of the experimental work consisted in the instrument calibration by means of a FEL type standard lamp. The spectroradiometer was then used for emission spectrum measurements of a class A simulator (according to IEC 60904 - 9, Ed 2. 0 (2007) standard) by Spectrolab, with 1. 5 ms flash duration. A sensitivity analysis was performed, varying spectroradiometer delay time (since flash start), integration time and angular tilt. The behaviour of fast spectroradiometer was also investigated, in particular focusing at NIR wavelength region (800 1100 nm). Finally, the measured spectral irradiance distribution of the flasher was used for spectral mismatch correction factor calculations, according to IEC 60904 - 7, Ed 3. 0 (2008). The I-V curves used for these calculations were derived from indoor measurements on polycrystalline silicon and thin film CIGS photovoltaic modules at STC conditions (1000 W/m 2, AM 1. 5 and 25 °C). Calibration tests showed how much spectroradiometers can be influenced by a non optimal orientation toward the lamp source: a dedicated mechanical set-up for the device is therefore needed, for a reproducible angular tilt. Spectra measurements on the <b>pulsed</b> <b>solar</b> <b>simulator</b> show a good reproducibility. Furthermore, data analysis on polycrystalline silicon module IV curves at STC suggests that emission spectrum of pulsed simulator can significantly influence the calculation of module electrical parameters. On the basis of all these results, a calibration routine of pulsed solar simulators emission is proposed by implementing periodical spectrum check using fast spectroradiometers. JRC.
