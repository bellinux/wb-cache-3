5|$|In 1861, Bradley {{became a}} <b>page</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky House of Representatives. He studied law under his father, one of Kentucky's leading {{criminal}} defense lawyers. Although Kentucky law required that anyone taking the bar examination {{be at least}} twenty-one years old, Bradley was allowed by a special provision of the state legislature to take it at age eighteen. This arrangement was contingent on Bradley's being judged competent by two circuit judges. Despite having no college education, Bradley passed the exam and was licensed in 1865, joining his father's firm in Lancaster. He later received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Kentucky University (now Transylvania University).|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Orion and Oenopion also varies. One source refers to Merope as {{the wife of}} Oenopion and not his {{daughter}}. Another refers to Merope {{as the daughter of}} Minos and not of Oenopion. The longest version (a <b>page</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman Cornelius Gallus to make into Latin verse. It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called Aëro or Leiro. Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Every runic {{inscription}} {{is shown}} with its ID code {{that is used}} in scholarly literature {{to refer to the}} inscription, and it is only obligatory to give the first two parts of it. The first part is one or two letters that represent the area where the runic inscription appears, e.g. U for Uppland, Sö for Södermanland and DR for Denmark. The second part represents the order in which the inscription is presented in official national publications (e.g. Sveriges runinskrifter). Thus U 73 means that the runestone was the 73rd runic inscription in Uppland that was documented in Sveriges runinskrifter. If the inscription was documented later than the official publication, it is listed according to the publication where it was first described, e.g. Sö Fv1954;20, where Sö represents Södermanland, Fv stands for the annual publication Fornvännen, 1954 is the year of the issue of Fornvännen and 20 is the <b>page</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publication.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per <b>page</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E
