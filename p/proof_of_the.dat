5|$|Actual <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope {{to study the}} Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations {{for developing the}} axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well-ordering theorem. Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized {{for a variety of}} reasons. His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{his most}} notable {{contribution}} to functional analysis was the 1927 <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Banach–Steinhaus theorem, given along with Stefan Banach, {{which is now}} one of the fundamental tools in this branch of mathematics.|$|E

5|$|Subdivision rules {{can easily}} be {{generalized}} to other dimensions. For instance, barycentric subdivision is used in all dimensions. Also, binary subdivision can be generalized to other dimensions (where hypercubes get divided by every midplane), as in the <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heine–Borel theorem.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close {{cooperation}} between uncle and nephew {{in the last}} years of Bolesław the Pious' life is in the events that taken place in mid-1278 (probably in August): Bolesław, using the weakeness of the Margraviate of Brandenburg during the fight between Ottokar II and Rudolph I, in only eight days attacked Neumark and advanced until Myślibórz, where his troops defeated Margrave Otto V the Long.|$|E
5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.|$|E

5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, he sat {{as one of}} the senator-judges in the {{impeachment}} trial of his ally, President Joseph Estrada.

Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001, leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency.|$|E

5|$|The Protocol of Corfu {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by Northern Epirote {{and human rights}} organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania.

5|$|The {{location}} of the battle is confirmed in the Township (Exterior) Notes of U.S. Deputy Surveyor John H. Mullet. The range line (between Roxbury (Section 19 of T9N, R7E) and Mazomanie (Section 24 of T9N, R6E) was surveyed on October 23, 1832, just {{three months after the}} battle.

5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E

In October 1996, Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board (now the Classification Board).

5|$|The dozen {{fans who}} worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior {{localization}} experience. Thousands of hours were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1,000 pages of scripted dialogue. They built their own tools for the work. The final version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch. The patch was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first week. A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional-quality player's guide was released alongside the translation.
