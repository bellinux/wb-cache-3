5|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{a history}} of alpine {{glaciation}} that is most obvious in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, <b>perennial</b> snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes.

30|$|Divergence of annual-perennial {{life history}} traits has been {{centered}} on reproductive systems and longevity. Annuals produce more abundant seeds than <b>perennials</b> before the plants die. In contrast, <b>perennials</b> preferentially propagate vegetatively. O. meridionalis grows {{during the rainy}} season and dies in the dry season after shedding seeds. This life history trait is {{the same as that of}} the annual form of O. rufipogon. <b>Perennials</b> are also found in Australia in and around relatively large ponds where water is available continuously throughout the seasons. Sometimes annuals and <b>perennials</b> grow together in the rainy season, usually until around late April. Later, only the <b>perennials</b> remain and propagate vegetatively.|$|R
5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} {{more natural}} and less formal-looking plantings of hardy <b>perennials,</b> shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He railed against standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of <b>perennials</b> and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy <b>perennials</b> and native plants; and large plantings of <b>perennials</b> in natural-looking drifts.|$|R

40|$|The thesis called Assortments of <b>perennials</b> used {{on rural}} gardens in the Pilsen region deals with using <b>perennials</b> in villages of Pilsen Region- Pilsen- North and Tachov with {{focusing}} on rural gardens and partly on public green containing <b>perennials</b> in planting. From {{the total number}} of 149 villages in observed regions about 103 villages were chosen and visited. The thesis also focuses on characteristic of these plants. The rural gardens are analysed, too. It deals with recommendation for using suitable <b>perennials</b> in given station and their next use in gardens and other places. The thesis also focuses on some parts of Pilsen Region, concretely on districts of Pilsen- North and Tachov. The observation of these districts took place from June to September in 2015. It describes these districts from the viewpoint of climate, it means the average year temperature, rainfall and the altitude of both districts. It concretely mentions chosen villages from the districts of North Pilsen and Tachov and defines villages in which was the green focused on timber species and grassy areas and villages where these areas were completed by floral decoration, especially by <b>perennials.</b> It was found that in small villages were used 16, in middle villages 39 and in large villages 32 sorts of <b>perennials.</b> The largest number of sorts of <b>perennials</b> is used in middle villages (600 - 2000 inhabitants). In small villages (under the number of 600 inhabitants) <b>perennials</b> are planted mainly in the gardens of family houses and are missing in public places. Among the most often planted <b>perennials</b> in the districts of North Pilsen and Tachov belong Aster dumosus, Bergenia crassifolia, Hemerocallis sp., Hosta sp., Iris sp., Phlox paniculata, Sedum spectabile, Sedum spurium, Yucca sp. and others...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the assesment of development extensive perennial´s beds created in Dendrological garden Pruhonice in 2014. Those <b>perennials</b> are determined for shady and part shady conditions. In the literary part are the theoretically described general characteristics of <b>perennials</b> and simultaneously natural sites of their occurrance. Attention is focused mainly on shady and part shady stations and extensive planting <b>perennials.</b> The main practical part of this thesis monitors and evaluates various mixtures extensit <b>perennials,</b> used on 26 flower beds in the Dermatological garden in Pruhonice. Attention is focused mainly on shady and part shady stations. Obsearvation {{took place during the}} year of 2015. We were evaluating the vitality and the aestetic appleal of the flower beds. The flower beds were evaluated from April to December in 12 prescribed terms. The main parameters were total score, colour and structure of flower beds. Based on these parameters that were evaluated, the best mixture were of Český venkov I. Part of the thesis is also comparing <b>perennials</b> beds from various locations; Dermatological garden in Pruhonice and <b>perennials</b> nursery in Hlavenec. In Hlavenec the best evaluated mixture was Schattenglanz against Český venkov I from Pruhonice. Detailed photo documentation from observation is recorded in attachment...|$|R

5|$|Anchored by {{defensive}} stalwart Russell, {{the tough}} Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by <b>perennial</b> rebounding champion Russell, who then either {{passed it on}} to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy slam dunk or layup. Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later succeeded in by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied <b>perennial</b> scoring and rebounding champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.|$|E
