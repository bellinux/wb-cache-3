The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest {{should not be allowed}} to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after the charges against him were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake on the part of the Company's chief Factors.|$|E
25|$|Israel's net {{international}} migration balance {{and the total}} immigration between 1948 and 1994 was 80 per cent, pointing to a missing share, i.e., a ratio of immigrants to emigrants, of 20 percent. Historically, Israel's long term migration retention ratio of 80 per cent {{is much higher than}} other countries' receiving large masses of immigration such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. Sergio DellaPergola attributes Israel's comparatively high migration retention to two related factors. The family transfer character of Aliyah, that is the relocation of entire households, including women, children and elderly members, implies abandonment of the place of origin. The second factor was the impossibility of return to countries where <b>perceived</b> <b>discrimination</b> or actual persecutions were among the main motivating factors for leaving.|$|E

Self-report survey data were collected from 354 emerging adults from one public university in Southern California. The results indicate <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> is positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and rumination, and negatively related to ethnic identity. It was also found that in one of three models, ethnic identity lessens the impact of <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> on depression, but did not buffer the relationship between <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and a different measure or depression or anxiety. Rumination served as a full or partial mediator between <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and both depression and anxiety. Thus, emerging adults are more susceptible to symptoms of negative mental health when they experience <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and/or ruminate about their negative experiences. The findings suggest that (1) even subtle experiences of <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> can be deleterious to mental health, (2) ethnic identity can buffer the impact of <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> on levels depression, and (3) rumination partially explains the relationship between <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and depression and anxiety. Practitioners should examine the role of <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> in their clients experiencing depression and anxiety, and may find it useful to focus on coping with <b>perceived</b> ethnic <b>discrimination</b> by discouraging rumination and encouraging ethnic identity...|$|R

Comparing rates of <b>perceived</b> <b>discrimination</b> among African American and White individuals, researchers have found large differences in reports of discrimination: 30.9% of Whites reported experiencing [...] "major discrimination" [...] throughout their lives compared to 48.9% of African Americans.

We used multivariate logistic regression (overall and stratified by race/ethnicity) to examine the associations of sociodemographic factors and mental health problems with <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination.</b> RESULTS: Fifteen percent of children reported <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination,</b> with 80 % reporting that discrimination occurred at school.

An association between <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and depressive symptoms was found for Black, Hispanic, and other children but not for White children.

In addition, we examined social support and sense of coherence as moderators of the association between <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and psychological well-being. Our results showed that, on average, adult international adoptees <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> occasionally. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated a significant association between <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and psychological distress and sleeping problems. Additionally, a significant 2 -way interaction of <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and social support indicated that the availability of social support may moderate the association between <b>perceived</b> racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> and psychological distress such that adoptees {{with high levels of}} social support may be protected from the harmful effects of discrimination.

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} indicates that perceptions of personal discriminated has negative psychological consequences (Pascoe 2 ̆ 6 Smart Richman, 2009). Although existing studies vary {{in a number of}} important ways, one common thread is the assumption that the psychological costs of <b>perceived</b> personal <b>discrimination</b> stem from absolute perceptions. Relative deprivation theory (e. g., Pettigrew, 1967), however, suggests that the psychological costs of <b>perceived</b> personal <b>discrimination</b> may be dependent upon subjective social comparisons. In particular, <b>perceiving</b> personal <b>discrimination</b> may be most psychologically costly to individuals who believe that they experience a higher level of discrimination than other members of their group (i. e., <b>perceived</b> relative <b>discrimination).</b> The three cross-sectional studies reported in this dissertation support this argument. Using an indirect approach to assessing <b>perceived</b> relative <b>discrimination,</b> in Study 1 I showed that <b>perceived</b> personal <b>discrimination</b> was negatively associated with self-esteem and was positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among Latino adults, but that these associations were strongest for participants who believed that other Latinos experienced low levels of discrimination. In Study 2, using a direct measure of <b>perceived</b> relative <b>discrimination,</b> I showed that perceptions of relative discrimination were negatively associated with self-esteem and were positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among Latino adults. These associations remained significant after accounting for perceptions of personal discrimination. In Study 3 I replicated these results with a sample of adult women. In addition, the results of Studies 2 and 3 suggest that <b>perceived</b> relative <b>discrimination</b> may be psychologically costly because it reduces individuals 2 ̆ 7 feelings of competence. The results of my studies indicate that scholars should give greater attention to perceptions of relative discrimination in their efforts to understand the psychological costs associated with perceptions that one has been personally discriminated against. My results also draw attention to feelings of competence as a potential psychological process through which perceptions of relative discrimination are associated with negative psychological outcomes. ...|$|R

RESULTS: Results of path modeling indicated that perceptions of ethnic discrimination were positively related to depression symptomatology, and this relationship was moderated and partially mediated by mastery.
