Most greenhouse gases are assigned a GWP by the UNFCCC, but ozone is not, and a literature search has generated no GWP estimates for it. Even a 2016 authoritative estimate listed its GWP as ‘NA’. 1 This lack of GWP might be due to ozone’s secondary status. It might also be due to ozone’s low persistence at ground level.

Marked as Iraqi aircraft, Axis aircraft under Fliegerführer Irak landed in Syria, en route to the Kingdom of Iraq during the Anglo-Iraqi War. The Germans also requested permission from the Vichy authorities to use Syrian railways to send armaments to Iraqi nationalists in Mosul. General Archibald Percival Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Command, was reluctant to intervene in Syria, despite government prodding, because of the situation in the Western Desert, the imminent German attack on Crete and doubts about Free French pretensions.|$|R

50|$|Economic {{conditions}} in the West Bank and Gaza, where economic activity was governed by the <b>Paris</b> Economic <b>Protocol</b> of April 1994 between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, deteriorated in the early 1990s. Real per capita GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36.1% between 1992 and 1996 owing to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and robust population growth. The downturn in economic activity was due to extensive corruption in the newly governing Palestinian Authority, and to Israeli closure policies in response to security incidents in Israel, which disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships. The most serious effect was the emergence of chronic unemployment. Average unemployment rates in the 1980s were generally under 5%; by the mid-1990s this level had risen to over 20%. After 1997, Israel's use of comprehensive closures decreased and new policies were implemented. In October 1999, Israel permitted {{the opening of a}} safe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in accordance with the 1995 Interim Agreement.

Experimental results are found in good agreement with verified Monte Carlo calculations, even for distances less than 3 mm from the source.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The <b>Paris</b> <b>Protocol</b> on Economic Relations between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (1995) established the main features of the Palestinian economic policy framework and the economic policy instruments available to Palestinian decision makers upon the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA). As a result, the <b>Paris</b> <b>Protocol</b> has shaped the growth pattern of the occupied Palestinian territory (OPT), polarizing the economic structure around the service sectors and further concentrating trade on one main trading partner (Israel). It has also served to increase the Palestinian economy's vulnerability by aggravating deep-seated structural weaknesses arising from occupation. Intensified movement restrictions by Israel in the OPT since September 2000 have further aggravated the Palestinian economy’s weakness and contributed to a prolonged economic crisis.
