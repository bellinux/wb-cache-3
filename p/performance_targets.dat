25|$|The {{stripping}} {{concept was}} such a major advance that competitors such as Snamprogetti—now Saipem—(Italy), the former Montedison (Italy), Toyo Engineering Corporation (Japan), and Urea Casale (Switzerland) all developed versions of it. Today, effectively all new urea plants use the principle, and many total recycle urea plants have converted to a stripping process. No one has proposed a radical alternative to the approach. The main thrust of technological development today, in response to industry demands for ever larger individual plants, is directed at re-configuring and re-orientating major items in the plant to reduce size and overall height of the plant, and at meeting challenging environmental <b>performance</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{there are}} no {{quantitative}} <b>performance</b> <b>targets</b> for rainwater tanks, such as size of tank or targeted reductions in potable water demand, in policies or guidelines. The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be {{designed to provide a}} reliable source of water to supplement mains water supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is reduced), cost, available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards. An advised suitable configuration may include a water filter or first flush diversion, a mains water top-up supply (dual supply system), maintenance drain, a pump (pressure system), and an on-site retention provision.|$|E
