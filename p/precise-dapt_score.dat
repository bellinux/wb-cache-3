40|$|BACKGROUND Dual {{antiplatelet}} therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P 2 Y 12 inhibitor prevents ischaemic events after coronary stenting, but increases bleeding. Guidelines support weighting bleeding risk {{before the}} selection of treatment duration, but no standardised tool exists for this purpose. METHODS A total of 14   963 patients treated with DAPT after coronary stenting-largely consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel and without indication to oral anticoagulation-were pooled at a single-patient level from eight multicentre randomised clinical trials with independent adjudication of events. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified predictors of out-of-hospital Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor bleeding stratified by trial, and developed a numerical bleeding risk score. The predictive performance of the novel score was assessed in the derivation cohort and validated in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial (n= 8595) and BernPCI registry (n= 6172). The novel score was assessed within patients randomised to different DAPT durations (n= 10   081) to identify the effect on bleeding and ischaemia of a long (12 - 24 months) or short (3 - 6 months) treatment in relation to baseline bleeding risk. FINDINGS The <b>PRECISE-DAPT</b> <b>score</b> (age, creatinine clearance, haemoglobin, white-blood-cell count, and previous spontaneous bleeding) showed a c-index for out-of-hospital TIMI major or minor bleeding of 0 · 73 (95...|$|E
