Methods: We recruited 20 medical and pharmaceutical direc-tors from national and regional plans {{who are involved in}} phar-maceutical and therapeutics committees to participate in the study. We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with the <b>payers</b> and asked them to rate the usefulness of CER study types across various disease states andmarket conditions.

Results: Our findings indicate that <b>payers</b> are interested in a broad range of CER study types, are unsatisfied with the current state of CER, and would like to partner with research groups to develop research and treatment guidelines to better leverage CER. <b>Payers</b> value CER less so in oncology than in other disease states because of limitations in their ability to manage oncology therapies.

40|$|Abstract: Defined by Baker and Wurgler (2004 a), {{dividend}} premium {{is the difference}} between the average market-to-book ratio of dividend <b>payers</b> and non-payers. We study what {{dividend premium}} is by examining two explanations, agency explanation and signaling explanation. Using U. S. industrial firms from 1962 to 2004, we find evidence consistent with the agency theory that dividend premium is higher when the need to mitigate the agency problem is greater. In particular, dividend premium is positively related to the difference in cash holdings {{at the beginning of the}} year between dividend <b>payers</b> and nonpayers, and is negatively related to the difference in future profitability between dividend <b>payers</b> and nonpayers. In other words, investors value dividend <b>payers</b> with a higher premium when dividend <b>payers</b> have more cash and fewer profitable future investment projects than nonpayers. 1...|$|R
