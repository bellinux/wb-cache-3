500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} on the Sega Meganet service is mixed, praising the early initiative to develop online gaming for video consoles, but criticizing its implementation via use of telephone lines and issues with Sega's lack of developers for the service. [...] Adam Redsell of IGN commented on the basic features of the service, and despite noting that Meganet received only a few games, stated [...] "hat's <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> impressive for 1990".

500|$|Alasdair Wilkins {{writing for}} The A.V. Club {{described}} the crossover as [...] "one big 90-minute movie," [...] {{and found it}} is only when the viewer is well into the broadcast that it becomes clear that there are two storylines from separate shows. Wilkins found [...] "Legends Of Today" [...] and [...] "Legends Of Yesterday" [...] charming feeling they [...] "operate on a more epic scale" [...] than either show's typical episode. Oliver's paternity storyline felt creaky to Wilkins, and he noted the episodes again strained [...] "to set up the latest spin-off". Despite these faults, he found [...] "the overall effect of this crossover two-parter ... <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> impressive," [...] and the [...] "team-up story ... grand enough to be {{more than the sum of}} its parts".|$|E

This <b>pretty</b> <b>damning</b> judgement, shared by Arthur Hugh Clough (in his hexameter poem Amours de Voyage), may account both for the popularity of Byron's verse during his life-time and {{for the kind of}} posthumous fragmentation of the work into the “ma [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a short space of time on a low budget. In a 2015 interview, bassist Billy Gould reflected [...] "There are probably things {{we could have done}} better, {{but at the same time}} I think that the performances were <b>pretty</b> <b>damned</b> good. And that had to do with us keeping focused and needing to work within those budget restrictions. We rehearsed quite a lot before we went in to record, so we were ready." ...|$|R
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell {{said the}} episode [...] "was <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> funny, but I'm {{predisposed}} to Butters in general {{as well as}} the wide world of pimping." [...] Wired writer Chris Kohler said the topical and timely jokes in [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch", such as the satire on ACORN, were a strong example of what kept South Park funny and relevant. Not all reviews were positive. Sean O'Neal, also of The A.V. Club, gave the episode a C grade, and said [...] "It was basically one note held for the run of the ep, in service of a simple little story without many surprises." [...] O'Neal said the subplot involving the police was [...] "similarly repetitious", but he liked how the two plots came together to resolve each other.|$|E
500|$|... "Promos" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Tim McAuliffe, his first writing credit for the series. It was directed by former series writer, director, and co-showrunner Jennifer Celotta, her third such credit for the series. The episode features Philadelphia Phillies star Ryan Howard playing himself. This marks the second time a major sports star has played themselves for the season, as former Philadelphia 76ers star Julius Erving portrayed himself in the episode [...] "Lice". Robinson later said that Ryan [...] "killed it" [...] and that [...] "He's <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> funny in real life, which doesn't always translate to TV". He also joked that Howard is [...] "definitely a better actor than John Krasinski. Without a doubt." [...] The titular promos are composed of stock footage from The Office, primarily from early seasons of the series. They feature the departed characters Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak).|$|E
500|$|Due to its impact, South Park {{made the}} cover of Rolling Stone in February 1998, and of Newsweek in March 1998. It was {{discussed}} in five different New York Times articles in 1998. Franck Rich of The New York Times mentions the show's [...] "ability to engage political topics with far more success than other (more obviously political) shows" [...] and considered that the show [...] "is hilariously candid about faith, family and death as well" [...] and [...] "is neither politically correct nor incorrect; it's on a different, post-ideological comic map altogether." [...] In 2002, Jeremy Conrad of IGN wrote in a DVD review that it is rare when a television season is [...] "perfect", but [...] "the first season of South Park comes <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> close" [...] and that [...] "almost every single episode in this three-disc set is a classic and each is still funny as hell even after so many viewings over the years." ...|$|E

If I had made some grievous error, they would have been down on my head right away, but it didn't happen. That said to me that I was <b>pretty</b> <b>damned</b> accurate.

500|$|The {{rough edge}} of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some but an {{attraction}} to others. Joyce Carol Oates wrote: [...] "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, {{the effect was}} dramatic and electrifying." [...] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate {{as well as his}} lover. Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.

500|$|Deborah Solomon, in The New York Times Magazine, {{asserted}} that MOBA's success reflects {{a trend in}} modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of abstraction and modern art in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that [...] "the American public ... think of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [...] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests." [...] Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as Norman Rockwell or Gustave Moreau, according to Solomon. [...] Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area art councils, stated in 1995, [...] "I go {{to a lot of}} openings, and sometimes they're <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> stuffy." [...] Not only does the Museum of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with Kool-Aid, Fluffernutters and cheese puffs.|$|E
500|$|Marvel later {{released}} an comic book adaptation of The Stand, {{which began in}} September 2008 and ran for thirty issues. Writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa described Flagg as [...] "The man of nightmares. Or, put another way, our nightmares given human (more or less) form. The {{dark side of the}} American Dream...King's 'Walkin' Dude' may not be the Devil, himself, as Mother Abagail says, but he comes <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> close..." [...] Initially, artist Mike Perkins said he felt [...] "Flagg needed to be designed less as a man—more as a force of nature. His hair will obscure his features, his face will be almost always in heavy shadow. This is the creature lurking under your bed, in your wardrobe, in your nightmares. Slightly familiar but wholly terrifying". Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa later commented on the original idea of hiding Flagg's face: [...] "...the further into the book and the adaptation you go, the less feasible that becomes. Stephen spends so much time [...] describing 's features and smiles, you need to show those things".|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. What are you talking about? It was so dumb." ...|$|E
5000|$|Online journal Freaky Trigger states: [...] "While {{the lyrics}} are usually <b>pretty</b> <b>damned</b> literary, {{at their most}} extreme, they’re {{divorced}} from any kind of meaning in the straightforward sense." [...] While suggesting that [...] "the line between the sung word and mere sound become criss-crossed and blurred {{again and again and}} again ... where the word becomes subservient to sound, which is only six or so steps on the road to sound-for-the-sake-of-sound", and reflecting on the image of [...] "Brian jammin' with Sun Ra and John Cage", the journal concludes that it was a style of music which could be simply classified as doo-wop, a genre that the group had already familiarized themselves in for years.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to Singapore {{having failed}} to locate the {{targeted}} Japanese convoy, Philips altered course in response to reports of Japanese landings at Kuantan. At that point, Force Z came under attack from land-based Japanese bombers and torpedo bombers. 453 Squadron were not dispatched in support until a radio request for air cover was sent by the commander of Repulse {{an hour after the}} Japanese attack began. They arrived over the battlefield just as HMS Prince of Wales sank; Repulse had been sunk 50 minutes earlier. Vigors later commented, [...] "I reckon this must have been the last battle in which the Navy reckoned they could get along without the RAF. A <b>pretty</b> <b>damned</b> costly way of learning." ...|$|R
5000|$|Give Up was {{generally}} well received by music critics. It holds {{a score of}} 79 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Matt LeMay of Pitchfork Media called the album [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>damned</b> strong record, and one with enough transcendent moments to forgive it its few substandard tracks and ungodly lyrical blunders". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Ben Gibbard radiates claustrophobia, so the shut-in synth-pop of this side project fits him like a leotard", calling Give Up [...] "the near-perfect pop record that's eluded his main group." [...] The Village Voices Robert Christgau praised its [...] "staying power" [...] and felt that [...] "Gibbard's delicate voice matches the subtle electro arrangements far more precisely than it does the folky guitars of his real group".|$|R
500|$|The episode premiered to near {{universal}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave it 9.6/10, {{and thought}} it was [...] "one of the most balanced and well-executed episodes of the series, Fringe fans get action, suspense, emotion, and best of all, some revelations!... This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off.

Night Springs is a fictional television show in Alan Wake, and is the setting of said show. On 10 November, a short teaser trailer was unveiled. During {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the first screenshot, Remedy employees made a number of comments on the official Alan Wake community forums about the new game. It was shared that the new title is [...] "structured like a full release complete with a <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> impressive storyline that expands the originals in some interesting ways." [...] Although no specifics were revealed, Remedy responded to fans who were worried that being an Xbox Live Arcade game meant that the amount of content in the game would be too small. Remedy claimed that there will definitely be enough [...] "value for money" [...] for the players of the game, and that fans [...] "will be blown away by the proportion of things pretty soon".|$|E
500|$|PC Zone {{stated that}} [...] "the taste {{left in the}} mouth is a bitter one", noting that [...] "Opposing Force is a few {{excellent}} ideas strung together by pedestrian Half-Life padding", but concluded that [...] "it was still a good weekend's worth of entertainment". Eurogamer stated that Opposing Force still had similar problems to other expansion packs, commenting that [...] "χ amount of new content has been created {{and it is going}} to be cut into the old content in a linear way to make it look like an all new game", but noted that [...] "fortunately though the new stuff in Opposing Force... is <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> good". Although praising the level design as the game's strongest point, the reviewer felt that [...] "towards the end of the game... they were running out of development time". Reviewing for IGN, Vincent Lopez stated that the game [...] "does a fantastic job of making you remember exactly why you enjoyed the original so much", but criticized this as the biggest drawback, commenting that [...] "you may find yourself wishing for a more original experience", but concluded that [...] "for good, and bad: it's good to be back".|$|E
5000|$|Gabrielle Moss of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} premiere a 4.8 out of 5, saying [...] "The new season of Community is, thus far, brutally funny and also <b>pretty</b> <b>damned</b> brutal - from Jeff Winger's failure as a {{legitimate}} lawyer, to everyone's similarly bleak post-Greendale trajectories (Relaxarex!). ... The show has always pulled no punches about the bleakness of the gang's lives (and life in general), but the darkness was especially notable, ... {{with only a few}} dim sources of real hope.

[...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10, signaling generally positive reviews, saying [...] "I’m elated to say that “Repilot” is just the beginning of even better things to come for a show that has been able to successfully rebound in a way few others could pull off." ...|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} a mixed response from critics. The Boston Heralds Mark A. Perigard disliked the episode {{and gave it}} a D rating. Perigard thought {{the first half of the}} episode was reasonable, but Stabler and Benson became incompetent and [...] "disregard basic police procedure to service an inane plot." [...] Perigard added that Williams needed to be restrained by a decent plot and director, but instead he [...] "hurtles off the rails" [...] towards the end. David Kronke from the Los Angeles Daily News thought anyone could have played the part of Merritt Rook, and that Williams spent the episode channelling his character from One Hour Photo (2002). Kronke also noted that [...] "some <b>pretty</b> <b>damning</b> evidence seems to be overlooked at Rooks trial" [...] and believed that Stabler and Benson gave up too easily at the end.|$|R
5000|$|... "It's <b>pretty</b> <b>damning.</b> There's {{no point}} putting {{something}} to air only (for Cousins) to be deregistered for life two minutes after {{it goes to}} air."

Titled Such is Life, it is named after bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly's alleged last words, which Cousins got tattooed across his torso in 2007. Cousins is featured taking elicit drugs, speaking candidly about his addiction and saying that he hopes his story will ultimately help to save lives.

It hurts my {{feelings}} but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. The blog post drew substantial media attention; Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, but in the end it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego." [...] Carlos Mencia, host of the Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia, was also spoofed in [...] "Fishsticks". He is portrayed as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write, which is a reference to accusations other comedians have made that Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people.

500|$|Supporters of {{the series}} assert {{that it is a}} worthy {{interpretation}} of the book and that most of the changes were necessary. Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee, who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person, and Boyens once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarize the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, [...] "Sure, it's not really The Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> cool movie." [...] Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the films serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of Arda (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming the whole story of The Lord of the Rings was probably impossible. This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of [...] "faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone." ...|$|E

[...] Michael N of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a grade of B. Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "the overall story arc was less than what we had anticipated from this critical favorite making its post-writers-strike return, the episode was still <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> funny."

Zach Conner from Time magazine commented, [...] "It's {{a relief}} to say that Evita is <b>pretty</b> <b>damn</b> fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has {{more than just a}} bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes."

She released three singles from the Evita soundtrack album, including [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997) and [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, Madonna gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: [...] "Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year.
