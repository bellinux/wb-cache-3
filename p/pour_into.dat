5|$|Clark {{was just}} {{thirty years old}} when the Revolutionary War ended, but his {{greatest}} military achievements were already behind him. After Clark's victories in the Illinois country, settlers continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> Kentucky and live illegally on Indian land north of the Ohio River. From 1784 to 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia's war veterans, surveying lands granted to them for their service in the war. The position brought Clark a small income, but he devoted very little time to the enterprise.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{breaches}} in flood defenses around Ise Bay, seawater continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> inundated areas after Vera's passage, slowing down repair efforts. One breach spanning 150km (93mi) across required 5,000personnel, 32,000sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted {{until the end of}} December1959. Due to losses sustained by the pearl industry as {{a result of}} the typhoon, Japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15million, causing Japanese pearl costs to hike up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's pearl industry were expected to persist for two to three years.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{returns to}} the {{survivors}} on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah, and Reyes give chase, heading up a river in the fixed boat to the monastery, with Lara arriving {{just in time to}} see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to some of Stormguards, who kill him. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in her signature dual-wielding style. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> Sam. Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms.|$|E

5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. Valves and vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the bilges. To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it back out into the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
5|$|Pius II {{continued}} to support Skanderbeg, {{but did not}} provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg's military skill and his soldiers' aptitude for battle were enough {{to hold back the}} Turkish armies. However, the pope still considered Skanderbeg's assistance essential for his plans for an anti-Ottoman crusade. In 1459, after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia, Ottoman envoys appealed for a three-year armistice between Skanderbeg's Albania and the Ottoman Empire. The sultan's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope's crusade as he believed the crusade's only hope for success was Skanderbeg. In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion, Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal but he had to get the pope's approval. Pius did not allow such an agreement and began to doubt Skanderbeg's loyalty. As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans, Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> Albania. In order to regain the pope's trust, Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace. Skanderbeg, nevertheless, was disappointed by Rome's response and he responded by not participating in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade. The Council ended in failure, signifying that Skanderbeg would receive no help from the West. He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged, something which Rome soon allowed.|$|E

25|$|These {{assumptions}} doomed {{the organizing}} drive. The AFL did {{not account for}} the hardening anti-union attitudes of U.S. Steel executives and plant managers, and the federation had no real plan to counterbalance the vast financial resources the company would <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> anti-union espionage, strikebreaking and union avoidance measures. When the AFL did organize a local union, the federation's patronizing attitudes and management style alienated workers and left the local union powerless.|$|E

25|$|In 1980 {{half of all}} the {{industrial}} jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles. This caused serious air pollution in Mexico City and water pollution problems, as well as subsidence due to overextraction of groundwater. Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation.|$|E
25|$|Explosive {{growth in}} the {{population}} of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to 8,831,079. Under relentless growth, Mexico City had lost its charm by the 1970s, when the government could barely keep up with services. Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution. Villagers from the countryside who continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.|$|E

25|$|The fate of Galicia {{was settled}} by the Peace of Riga on March 18, 1921, {{attributing}} Galicia to the Second Polish Republic. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainians, it was internationally recognized with significant French support on May 15, 1923. The French support for Polish rule of ethnically Ukrainian eastern Galicia and its oil {{resources in the}} Borysław-Drohobycz basin were rewarded by Warsaw allowing significant French investment to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> the Polish oil industry. The Poles had convinced the French that since less than 25% of the ethnic Ukrainians were literate before the Great War and Ukrainians were novices in governing themselves, only the Poles, not the Ukrainians, {{would be able to}} administer eastern Galicia and its precious oil assests.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April, {{the number}} of {{refugees}} in the city totaled 15,000, {{the greater part of}} the refugees those fleeing from the countryside as they began to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> city. The Armenians in the city at this time reached 30,000 residents, and 15,000 refugees in an area of roughly one square kilometer of the Armenian Quarter and suburb of Aigestan. Djevdet allowed Armenian survivors from the villages to enter the city through his lines. It is stated that this strategy was aimed to subdue the defenders with more ease. After easily fighting off the initial assaults, Armenian forces had great problems with their supply of ammunition. Armenians employed all sorts of devices to draw the fire of the enemy and waste their ammunition in turn. Their bullet and cartridge manufacturing reached 2,000 a day. The defenders also improvised mortars and barricades, and reportedly made use of anything they could find.|$|E
