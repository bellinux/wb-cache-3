50|$|Come morning, {{a parcel}} {{delivery}} driver drops things {{off at the}} house. He agrees to give Tim and Allie a ride into town. Tim has a bad feeling about the driver so he takes off with Allie in the abandoned police vehicle instead. They get to the main road. The child in the outbuilding then kills Helen and psychokinetically causes Tim and Allie to have a car accident, in which Tim dies. The <b>parcel</b> <b>driver</b> approaches the accident and brings Allie back to the farmhouse {{where a group of}} children and their mothers greet her. In a trance, she sits next to the little child in the outbuilding and begins to sing to him. The child is then seen playing with a doll, then drops it on the floor, which causes the cop's corpse to fall from the sky onto the ground.|$|E

50|$|The Darlington rail {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 28 June 1928 when a parcels train and an excursion train collided head on at Darlington Bank Top station. The accident {{was caused by}} the <b>parcels</b> train <b>driver</b> passing a signal at danger, due to misunderstanding the signalling layout in an unfamiliar part of the station. This accident resulted in the deaths of 25 people and the serious injury of 45 people.|$|R
40|$|Crowdsourced {{shipping}} {{can result}} in significant economic and social benefits. For a shipping company, it has a potential cost advantage and creates opportunities for faster deliveries. For the society, it can provide desirable results by reducing congestion and air pollution. Despite the great potential, crowdsourced shipping is not well studied. With the aim of using the spare capacities along the existing transportation flows of the crowd to deliver small-to-medium freight volumes, this paper defines the multi-driver multi-parcel matching problem and proposes a general ILP formulation, which incorporates drivers’ maximum detour, capacity limits, and the option of transferring <b>parcels</b> between <b>drivers.</b> Due to the high computational complexity, we develop two heuristics to solve the problem. The numerical study shows that crowdsourced shipping can be an economic viable and sustainable option, depending on the spatial characteristics of the network and drivers’ schedules. Furthermore, the added benefits increase with {{an increasing number of}} participating <b>drivers</b> and <b>parcels...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first in}} his family to go to college, Tolman {{received}} a Bachelor's Degree in Economics from Amherst College and a Juris Doctorate from Boston College Law School. Between college and law school, Tolman worked as a United <b>Parcel</b> Service <b>driver</b> and as a substitute teacher in the Watertown Public Schools. [...] He {{was elected to the}} Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1990 and the Massachusetts Senate in 1994. As a lawmaker, Tolman worked on tightening campaign finance laws and ethics statutes and was a leader in the 1990s movement to curb tobacco use and oppose the political influence of the cigarette industry. During his time in the Court, Tolman became known for his criticism of the Big Dig and his conflicts with House Speaker Thomas Finneran. [...] In 1998, Tolman ran for lieutenant governor as the running mate of Democratic nominee Scott Harshbarger. Though Harshbarger lost to Republican Paul Cellucci, Tolman was cited as an asset to his campaign.|$|R
50|$|Ronald Lee Haskell, Jr. (born August 26, 1980) was {{identified}} by police {{as the sole}} suspect in the shooting. He was raised in Escondido, California, and also lived in Eagle River, a community in Anchorage, Alaska, until 2004. In Alaska, he attended Chugiak High School, graduating in 1999. He had been voted as the class clown and king for both prom and homecoming. He worked as a <b>parcel</b> delivery <b>driver</b> for an independent service that had a contract with FedEx, but he stopped working for the company in January, according to a spokesperson. He married Melannie Kaye Lyon on March 15, 2002, in Orange County, California. He moved to Logan, Utah, where he lived from July 2006 to November 2013, mostly with his then-wife. Melannie Lyon later divorced him on February 14, 2014, and moved to Houston {{with the help of}} her sister, Katie Stay, who was one of the victims. Previously, the Stays were familiar with the Haskells, since both families belonged to a tight-knit Mormon community in southern California.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Growth in {{e-commerce}} has led {{to increasing}} use of light goods vehicles for parcel deliveries in urban areas. This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, {{as well as the}} duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile <b>parcel</b> delivery <b>driver,</b> highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62 % of the total vehicle round time and 40 % of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{research}} in the field of supply chain management specifically the parcel delivery industry has been focused {{on the development of the}} LAST MILE of a parcel delivery process. Little or no effort has been invested to research about the cause(s) of the huge returns of packages (send – agains) daily by <b>parcel</b> delivery <b>drivers</b> in the supply chain management industry. Even leading courier firms in the industry has paid lipped service to this problem but continued to focus their attention and resources on the minimization of operational cost and increased profit maximization. This research study ventures to delve into the reasons and causes to the aforementioned problem of how do parcel (package) delivery firms deal or can curtail the increasing volume of high send – agains (returns) daily in their respective hubs [...] Data collected in the field from 10 different service providers (drivers) resulted in findings like, most customers are not at home during a delivery; delivery drivers not having access codes to residential (apartment) buildings and not having work telephone among other factors that have been unearth that cause’s huge send –agains. The poor flow of communication (i. e. delivery date and time) between the courier companies and customers also have an adverse effect on parcel delivery. The causality of huge returns that affect and hinders a successful parcel delivery are discussed in-depth in this research. At the climax of {{the research}}, suggested remedies and recommendations are provided to ensure that customers receives their packages at the first delivery attempt and hence decreasing send –agains...|$|R
5000|$|Through his {{previous}} {{experience as a}} <b>parcel</b> post truck <b>driver,</b> Williams had become proficient {{in the operation of}} motor vehicles. It was {{at this point in the}} history of the Department, horses were being replaced by two-wheel Christie tractors, thus motorizing both steamers and aerial trucks. An 84-hour work week came into being, a system that was to remain practically unchanged until 1939 when the three-platoon eight-hour plan was adopted. The shortage of firemen who possessed the mechanical ability to operate the new gasoline-driven tractors led to Williams being asked to take the apparatus out of quarters and then back it in. He executed the maneuver so expertly he was assigned as the apparatus driver. This assignment caused much resentment against Williams among the members of Engine 55. It prompted Assistant Chief of Department Patty Walsh to comment that [...] "Of all the men in this Department, he (The Captain) had to pick that man to drive the apparatus!" [...] Tradition dictated that the Motor Pump Operators should be the senior most experienced members of a Fire Company; the fact that Wesley Williams had little seniority, coupled with the fact that he was black, was not offset by the fact that he was the best qualified to operate the apparatus.|$|R
