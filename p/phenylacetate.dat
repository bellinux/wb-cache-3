25|$|The enzyme {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase normally converts {{the amino}} acid phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine. If this reaction {{does not take}} place, phenylalanine accumulates and tyrosine is deficient. Excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through the minor route, a transaminase pathway with glutamate. Metabolites include <b>phenylacetate,</b> phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. Elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood and detection of phenylketones in the urine is diagnostic, however most patients are diagnosed via newborn screening.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{child is}} not {{diagnosed}} during the routine newborn screening test (typically performed 2–7 days after birth, using samples drawn by neonatal heel prick), and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. Toxic levels of phenylalanine (and insufficient levels of tyrosine) can interfere with infant development in ways which have permanent effects. The disease may present clinically with seizures, [...] hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a [...] "musty odor" [...] to the baby's sweat and urine (due to <b>phenylacetate,</b> a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone).

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} an analytical method for the determination of phenol and methylphenols (cresols) in water, especially in leachates. This experimental research was necessary because a standardized method was not available for these compounds in water. A special concept was developed whereby the free phenols were extracted from the water using SPE-columns, followed by on-column derivatisation of the free phenols with acetylchoride in hexane (5 % v/v) using sodiumhydroxide powder and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen stofsulfaat as fase-transfer-catalist, and desorption of the <b>phenylacetates</b> with hexane. Analysis of the <b>phenylacetates</b> was preformed with GC-FID of GC-MS. Advantages are the fast and easy to automate method with an unique combination of on-column extraction and derivatisation, which avoids the need of a solvent phase switch. The method validation showed the following characteristics: no concentration dependence was found over a concentration range of 25 ug/l to 25 mg/l with a limited breakthroug, only 12 % for phenol at a level of 25 mg/l. The longterm reproducibility for phenol, cresols and dimethylphenols was around 80 % {{with a standard deviation of}} 2 to 6 % for all matrices. The limit of determination was around 1 ug/l using GC-FID analysis. Analysis of dimethylphenols can be performed with this method as well, or they can be used as internal standards. The stability of the components is 7 days at 4 degrees C and can be increased by conservation at pH 2 of pH 12. Application of GC-MS improves the limit of determination to 0. 1 ug/l for phenol and o-and m-cresol, for p-cresol this is 0. 3 ug/l...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Molecular-sieve zeolites, Nafion membranes, low-density {{polyethylene}} films, and mixed surfactant vesicles {{have been used}} as microreactors to carry out organic photochemi-cal reactions. The photo-cycloadditions of diaryl compounds with long flexible chains included in NaY zeolite or {{low-density polyethylene}} films yield intramolecular photocy-clomers to the exclusion of intermolecular products. The photosensitized oxidation of alkenes included in pentasil zeolites or Nafion membranes or vesicles can be directed selec-tively toward either the singlet oxygen-mediated or the superoxide radical anion-mediated products by controlling the status and location of the substrate and sensitizer molecules in the reaction media. The photo-Fries rearrangement of phenyl <b>phenylacetates</b> included within NaY and pentasil zeolites or Nafion membranes gives either ortho-hydroxyphenones or decarbonylation products depending on the size/shape of the microreactors and the substrate molecules.

40|$|Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans grew with formate as the {{electron}} donor and 3 -chloro- 4 -hydroxyphenylac-etate (3 -Cl- 4 -OHPA) as {{the electron}} acceptor, yielding YX/formate, YX/ 2 e 2, and YX/ATP ranging from 3. 2 to 11. 3 g of biomass (dry weight) /mol, thus indicating that energy was conserved through reductive dechlorination. Pyruvate was utilized as the electron donor and acceptor, yielding stoichiometric amounts of acetate and lactate, respectively, and a YX/reduced acceptor of 13. 0 g of biomass (dry weight) /mol. The supplementation of pyruvate-containing medium with additional electron acceptors, such as 3 -Cl- 4 -OHPA, nitrate, fumarate, or sulfite, caused pyruvate {{to be replaced}} as the electron acceptor and nearly doubled the YX/ATP (YX/acetate formed). A comparison of the yields for 3 -Cl- 4 -OHPA with those for other traditional electron acceptors indicates that the dehalogenation reaction {{led to the formation}} of similar amounts of energy equivalents. The various electron acceptors were used concomitantly with 3 -Cl- 4 -OHPA in nonacclimated cultures, but the utilization rates and amounts utilized differed.

40|$|A {{substrate}} structure rule {{to predict}} the enantioselectivity of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) towards $ alpha$-substituted carboxylic acids is proposed. Lipase from Candida rugosa resolved methyl $ alpha$-substituted <b>phenylacetates</b> - 5. These substrates were examined to understand the influence of steric and the electronic nature of the substituents at the chiral center on the enantioselectivity. Crude CRL was partially enantioselective towards substrates - 3, and highly selective towards and, E $>$ 100. Partial purification of crude CRL by 2 -propanol extraction and separation by an ion exchange chromatography, dramatically improved the enantioselectivity towards - 3, E $>$ 100. One main lipase fraction, F$ sb{ rm C}$ was obtained with 58 fold purification and 62 % yield. This improvement in enantioselectivity was achieved with a simple dialysis against deionized water or 50 % 2 -propanol extraction. Lauric acid (10 mM), partially reversed {{the increase in the}} enantioselectivity. The absolute configuration of the favored enantiomer for crude and partially purified lipase preparations, was S. Other lipases with opposite stereoselectivities were not identified. Based on literature and our results, it is believed that the size of the substituents at the stereogenic carbon center can account for the enantioselectivity of CRL catalyzed hydrolysis. The opposite configuration is not preferred when the electronic nature of the medium size substituent is varied. The rule can predict the selectivity data for partially purified CRL preparations. We believe that the accuracy of the rule can be improved if more examples of partially purified CRL reactions are examined...|$|R

50|$|Sodium phenylbutyrate {{administration}} was discovered {{to lead to}} an alternative nitrogen disposal pathway by Dr. Saul Brusilow, Mark Batshaw and colleagues at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in the early 1980s, due to some serendipitous discoveries. They had studied ketoacid therapy for another inborn error of metabolism, citrullinemia, in the late 1970s and they noticed that arginine treatment led to an increase of nitrogen in the urine and a drop in ammonia in the blood. The researchers spoke to Norman Radin about this finding, and he remembered a 1914 article on using sodium benzoate to reduce urea excretion. Another 1919 article had used sodium <b>phenylacetate,</b> and so the researchers treated 5 patients with hyperammonemia with benzoate and <b>phenylacetate</b> and published a report in Science. In 1982 and 1984, the researchers published on using benzoate and arginine for urea cycle disorders in the NEJM.
