60|$|Black Christy found, however, that {{a life of}} virtuous toil grew {{distinctly}} monotonous, and one morning, when Mattawa Tom's vigilance was slack, he departed {{in search}} of diversion in the settlement of Red Pine, which lay beyond the range. He found congenial society there, and, unfortunately for himself, went on with a boon companion next morning to a larger settlement beside the railroad track. He intended to complete the orgie there, and then to return to camp. Accordingly it happened that, when afternoon was drawing towards a close, he sat under the veranda of a rickety wooden saloon, hurling drowsy encouragement at the freighter who was loading rock-boring tools into a big wagon. He wondered how far his remaining dollar would go towards assuaging a thirst which steadily increased, and two men, who leaned against the wagon, chuckled as they watched him. The hands {{of one of the}} men were busy about the brass cap which decorated the hub of the wheel, but neither Black nor the teamster noticed this fact. Black had seen one of the men before, for the two had loafed about the district, ostensibly <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals,</b> and had twice visited Thurston's camp.|$|E

60|$|Having quarreled {{with his}} {{relatives}} and declined any favors from them, {{he had come}} to Canada with only a few pounds and had promptly set about earning a living with his hands. When {{he had been in the}} country several years, a friend of the family had, however, sent him a small sum, and the young man had made judicious use of the money. The lot he bought outside a wooden town doubled in value, and the share he took in a new orchard paid him well; but he had held aloof from the cities, and his only recklessness had been his prospecting journeys into the wilderness. <b>Prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> is at once an art and a gamble. Skill, acquired by long experience or instinctive--and there are men who seem to possess the latter--counts for much, but chance plays a leading part. Provisions, tents and packhorses are expensive, and though a placer mine may be worked by two partners, a reef or lode can be disposed of only to men with means sufficient to develop it. Even in this delicate matter, in which he had had keen wits against him, Vane had held his own; but there was one side of life with which he was practically unacquainted.|$|E
50|$|Stuart {{returned}} to his trade as a private surveyor, spending {{more and more time}} in remote areas, and moving to Port Lincoln for several years before moving again to the northern Flinders Ranges where he worked for the wealthy pastoralists William Finke, James Chambers, and John Chambers, exploring, <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals,</b> and surveying pastoral leases.|$|E
50|$|The True Discourse {{included}} the First Frobisher Voyage, in which Best did not participate, {{as well as}} the other two (1577 and 1578) as an eye-witness. It appeared in the explorationn collection of Richard Hakluyt. Later, in reprinting the material, Hakluyt removed some passages, in particular one suggesting that the aim of the exploration was <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals,</b> rather than the North-West Passage.|$|E
50|$|In Tooele County, {{perhaps the}} only non-Mormon {{majority}} in the territory existed. These residents, mostly transitory miners, congregated in Utah after US Army General Patrick Edward Connor encouraged his men to <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals,</b> which they discovered west of Salt Lake City in 1864.|$|R

50|$|Located {{within the}} Central Mineral Belt (of Labrador) {{the area has}} been <b>prospected</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> since the 1920s, with a current focus on copper-gold and uranium deposits. The region is mostly {{uninhabited}} and access to Snegamook Lake is by floatplane or helicopter (out of Goose Bay, Labrador). Some manage to travel by canoe or dogsled.|$|R
50|$|Until the {{building}} of the tunnel, no deep <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> had been carried out. The discovery of coal and iron led to George Stephenson moving to Tapton House, near Chesterfield. With a group of others, he bought a tract of land north of the tunnel and set up a company, George Stephenson and Co., later renamed the Clay Cross Company.|$|E
50|$|Arthur Harper {{was born}} in County Antrim, present-day Northern Ireland, in 1835. He was educated in local schools, and survived the potato-famine years of the late 1840s. At the age of 20, he left Ireland for California, drawn to {{prospecting}} and mining. He searched for gold, but gained mostly experience in prospecting. In the 1860s, {{he moved on to}} British Columbia. His <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> was mostly devoted to the search for gold.|$|E
50|$|Not long afterwards, {{research}} {{stations were}} {{set up by the}} French state which planted oil-palm plantations, built mills to extract the oil, mechanized the production of peanuts, experimented with growing Urena lobata, planted sugarcane and built a sugar refinery, mechanized rice production, and grew citrus, bananas and pineapples. Other enterprises included <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals,</b> a tree nursery for limba was established and a herd of about 2,000 N'Dama cattle was built up.|$|E

50|$|All rights {{granted by}} the Minister are {{personal}} rights. In Meepo v Kotze, the court indicated that the rights come into existence once the Minister, as representative of the custodian state, agrees to grant the applicant a right to <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> on specified land for a specified period. Prospecting rights, mining rights, exploration rights and production rights become limited real rights upon registration.|$|R
5000|$|Wali Wunungmurra, {{one of the}} 12 signatories to the petitions, {{describes}} the background to the petitions as follows:"In the late 1950s Yolngu became aware of people <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> {{in the area of}} the Gove Peninsula, and shortly after, discovered that mining leases had been taken out over a considerable area of our traditional land. Our response, in 1963, was to send a petition framed by painted bark to the Commonwealth Government demanding that our rights be recognised." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hand-held clinometers {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{surveying}} and measurement tasks. In land surveying and mapping, a clinometer can provide a rapid measurement of the slope of a geographic feature, or used for cave survey. In <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals,</b> clinometers are used to measure the strike and dip of geologic formations. In forestry, tree height measurement can be done with a clinometer using standardized methods. Major artillery guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} day, the Secretary of State cabled the Governor of Mauritius as follows: As already stated in {{paragraph}} 6 of my despatch No. 423, the Chagos Archipelago will remain under British sovereignty. The islands {{are required for}} defence facilities {{and there is no}} intention of permitting <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> or oils on or near them. The points set out in your paragraph 1 should not therefore arise but I shall nevertheless give them further consideration in view of your request.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{exports of}} {{nonmetals}} increased by 25% {{and accounted for}} 38% of all export earnings, previously 35%. The Zambian government has recently been granting licenses to international resource companies to <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> such as nickel, tin, copper and uranium.It is hoped that nickel will take over from copper as the country's top metallic export. In 2009, Zambia has been badly hit by the world economic crisis.|$|R
5|$|In 1847, Mormon {{farmers from}} the Salt Lake area {{became the first}} people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region. In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City, Utah areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses. They <b>prospected</b> <b>for</b> <b>mineral</b> deposits, and {{diverted}} Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area Kolob—in Mormon scripture, the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.|$|R
5000|$|Swinhoe Peak (...) is a peak, 845 m, {{standing}} between Hamberg Glacier and Hestesletten {{on the north}} side of South Georgia. The peak was mapped by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1901-04, under Nordenskjold. It was surveyed by the South Georgia Survey in the period 1951-57. Named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) for Ernest Swinhoe, Manager of the South Georgia Exploration Co., who visited South Georgia in 1905 to <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> and to consider the establishment of an experimental sheep ranch.|$|R
50|$|By {{manipulating}} imagery data {{values and}} positions, {{it is possible}} to see features that would not normally be visible and to locate geo-positions of features that would otherwise be graphical. The level of brightness, or reflectance of light from the surfaces in the image can be helpful with vegetation analysis, <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> etc. Other usage examples include linear feature extraction, generation of processing work flows (spatial models in Imagine), import/export of data {{for a wide variety of}} formats, orthorectification, mosaicking of imagery, stereo and automatic feature extraction of map data from imagery.|$|E
50|$|Denker {{was born}} in Brunswick, near Bremen, Germany, on October 17, 1840, a farmer's son. He began working in a shop in Brunswick, but in 1857 he sailed for New York City, where he again found {{employment}} in a store, then beginning a small business of his own. In 1863 he voyaged to San Francisco via the Panama Isthmus, soon <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> in Arizona and New Mexico. He entered Los Angeles afterward, penniless, but found employment as a clerk in a hotel first named the Lafayette, then the Cosmopolitan and finally the St. Elmo Hotel. At {{that time it was}} owned by Kohl, Dockwiler and Fluhe, but later it became the property of Hammel and Denker.|$|E
50|$|As a {{child he}} lived in Low Fell, Gateshead and {{attended}} the Gateshead Higher Grade School (later Gateshead Grammar School). At 17, he enrolled to study physics at the Royal College of Science (now Imperial College London), but took a course in geology {{in his second year}} which settled his future, against the advice of his tutors. Surviving on a scholarship of £60/year was difficult and on graduating he took a job <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> in Mozambique. After six months, with no discoveries, he became so ill with malaria that a notice of his death was posted home. However he recovered enough to catch the boat home and became a demonstrator at Imperial College.|$|E
40|$|The 20 th International Geological Congress (IGC), held in Mexico in 1956, {{took place}} at a crucial time as the demand for raw {{materials}} increased significantly after the Second World War. The search <b>for</b> <b>mineral</b> resources provided a stimulus {{for the development of}} geology and its applied branches, geophysics, geochemistry, etc. Also, the foundations were being laid for a new global geological model, plate tectonics, which burst onto the scene in the sixties. The Congress had the largest attendance up to that time. Many of its sessions focused on <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>mineral</b> deposits and drilling for oil and gas...|$|R

50|$|Both telluric and magnetotelluric {{methods are}} used for {{exploring}} the structure beneath the Earth's surface (such as in industrial <b>prospecting).</b> <b>For</b> <b>mineral</b> exploration the targets are any subsurface structure with a distinguishable resistance in comparison to its surroundings. Uses include geothermal exploration, mining exploration, petroleum exploration, mapping of fault zones, ground water exploration and monitoring, investigation of magma chambers, and investigation of boundaries of tectonic plates. Earth batteries tap a useful low voltage current from Telluric currents, and were used for telegraph systems {{as far back as}} the 1840s.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{problems}} in laying the glass-reinforced piping, which caused the original January 1999 target completion date to be missed. A revised target date of June 2000 was also missed, with further delays caused by {{failures of the}} pipeline and pumping station equipment. These caused cost increases from the original estimate of P1,200 million to around P1,500 million.Since opening, NSC-1 has had ongoing reliability problems.In April 2012 {{a man who was}} <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> entered the pipeline corridor and caused the pipe to burst, sending a stream of about [...] a second pouring into the surrounding land to form a deep crater.Water supplies in the region were cut off until repairs could be made.|$|E

5000|$|Granites {{and fine}} grained porphyries are the {{geological}} formations {{recorded in the}} mountain, which are very much jointed. From the geological map of the mountain {{it is noted that}} granite formations are massive and crystalline which has generated distinctive topographic features. The crest and the pinnacles are of granite rock with double system of jointing. Feldspar crystals are seen at the margin of these massive formations. The granites are coarse crystalline normally porphyritic, and basically with geological formations of quartz, microcline and biotite. Local glaciation has been recorded on the mountain. There is also a belt of limestone inferred as belonging to the Kigluaik series. White limestone formations are inferred as intrusives and its formations on the western side of the mountain dip away from granite. While driving a 418 ft long adit from an elevation of 1700 ft into the Cape Mountain, close to the peak, for <b>prospecting</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals,</b> biotite granite formation of the hill revealed cassiterite-bearing quartz of the Late Cretaceous period.

50|$|Minimax {{theory has}} been {{extended}} to decisions {{where there is no}} other player, but where the consequences of decisions depend on unknown facts. For example, deciding to <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minerals</b> entails a cost which will be wasted if the minerals are not present, but will bring major rewards if they are. One approach is to treat this as a game against nature (see move by nature), and using a similar mindset as Murphy's law or resistentialism, take an approach which minimizes the maximum expected loss, using the same techniques as in the two-person zero-sum games.|$|R
