Historical and IgE results have suggested these two species or <b>perhaps</b> <b>another</b> species were responsible for all recorded deaths.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier who suddenly appeared out of a large anthill. Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that <b>perhaps</b> <b>another</b> 20 were also killed.|$|E

5|$|Australians {{were not}} always {{successful}} however, suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war. On 12 June 1901, the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at Wilmansrust, near Middleburg after poor security allowed a force of 150 Boers to surprise them. On 30 October 1901, Victorians of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill, although 60 Boers were also killed in the engagement. Meanwhile, at Onverwacht on 4 January 1902, the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen lost 13 killed and 17 wounded. Ultimately the Boers were defeated, and the war ended on 31 May 1902. In all 16,175 Australians served in South Africa, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>another</b> 10,000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units; casualties included 251 killed in action, 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action, while a further 735 were wounded. Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Between December 1941 and March 1942, over 300 P-40 Kittyhawks, 100 P-400 and 90 P-39 Airacobras {{had been}} sent to Australia; of these, around 125 had been lost to enemy action in the Dutch East Indies campaign, 75 had been {{transferred}} to the RAAF, 74 were under or awaiting repair and <b>perhaps</b> <b>another</b> 100 had yet to be completely assembled. On 18 March, 33 P-39s, 92 P-40s and 52 P-400s were on hand. While there were three USAAF pursuit groups in Australia, the 8th, 35th and 49th, Wurtsmith's was the only one considered combat ready. Of the 102 pilots in his group, only Wurtsmith, with 4,800 hours of pursuit time, and his executive officer, Major Donald R. Hutchinson, with 2,600 hours, were veteran pilots. Five others had more than 600 hours and nine had about 15 hours. The remaining 89 pilots had no pursuit time at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1071 William {{defeated}} the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed {{by his own}} men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar were hiding. Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom, and imprisoned. In 1072 William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to peace by signing the Treaty of Abernethy, and Malcolm probably gave up his son Duncan as a hostage for the peace. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>another</b> stipulation of the treaty was the expulsion of Edgar the Ætheling from Malcolm's court. William then {{turned his attention to}} the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by Fulk le Rechin, the Count of Anjou. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk's forces, completing the campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William's power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the Ætheling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister Bertha to the king of France, Philip I, who was opposed to Norman power.|$|E

5|$|Robert was Lord Chancellor {{from spring}} 1140 to summer 1154, serving King Stephen of England. It {{is not known}} exactly when Stephen {{appointed}} Robert chancellor nor why Stephen choose him for the office. The historian Richard Sherman speculated that Stephen appointed Robert as a favour to Walter de Gant, perhaps because of Walter's presence at the Battle of Cowton Moor in 1138. Three charters which date from March 1140 to January 1141 and {{are supposed to be}} witnessed by Robert all have difficulties with either the dating or whether the signature attributed to Robert is actually Robert, so exact dating of his term of office isn't possible from charter evidence. For a brief period in 1141, Stephen's rival Empress Matilda also appointed two chancellors– William de Vere and William fitzGilbert– but they did not interrupt Robert's term of service. Robert was with Stephen at Caistor during the middle of 1143, where he was a witness on charters. Throughout his approximately 14 years as chancellor, Robert only witnessed 20 charters certainly and <b>perhaps</b> <b>another</b> 13 that are not securely attributed to Robert. Stephen's two previous chancellors, Roger le Poer and Philip de Harcourt, had a much higher rate of attesting charters– 62 in 3.5 years for Roger and 12 in 9 months for Philip. Even Baldric, Robert's subordinate and holder of the office of keeper of the royal seal, attested 17 charters during Stephen's reign. Various reasons have been put forward for why Robert attested at a lower rate than the earlier chancellors, including indifference to his office, deputising the duties to another clerk, or difficulty in following the itinerant court due to age. Robert's last secure appearance as chancellor as a witness to a charter is one dated to the summer of 1154 at Lincoln.|$|E
