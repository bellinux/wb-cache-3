40|$|Examination of {{the events}} during {{infection}} of cells by RNA phages reveals phemomena that are surprisingly complex for a virus that has only enough information to code {{for three to four}} pro-teins. The coat protein is synthesized at a rapid rate through most of the infectious cycle making it the predominant product. In contrast, he RNA synthetase is made at early times but not at late times (Vifiuela et al., 1967 a; Nathans et al., 1969). Since the RNA genome is itself messenger, the RNA phages present a unique opportunity to study translation of a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger.</b> As first shown by Nathans et al.

40|$|Clustering of {{functionally}} related {{genes in}} operons allows for coregulated gene expression in prokaryotes. This is advantageous when {{equal amounts of}} gene products are required. Production of protein complexes with an uneven stoichiometry, however, requires tuning mechanisms to generate subunits in appropriate relative quantities. Using comparative genomic analysis, we show that differential translation is a key determinant of modulated expression of genes clustered in operons and that codon bias generally {{is the best in}} silico indicator of unequal protein production. Variable ribosome density profiles of polycistronic transcripts correlate strongly with differential translation patterns. In addition, we provide experimental evidence that de novo initiation of translation can occur at intercistronic sites, allowing for differential translation of any gene irrespective of its position on a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger.</b> Thus, modulation of translation efficiency appears to be a universal mode of control in bacteria and archaea that allows for differential production of operon-encoded protein...|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli dnaX gene encodes {{both the}} tau and gamma {{subunits}} of DNA polymerase III. This gene is located immediately downstream of the adenine salvage gene apt and upstream of orf 12 -recR, htpG, and adk. The last three {{are involved in}} recombination, heat shock, and nucleotide biosynthesis, respectively. apt, dnaX, and orf 12 -recR all have separate promoters, and the first two are expressed predominantly from those separate promoters. However, use of an RNase E temperature-sensitive mutant allowed the detection of lesser amounts of <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messengers</b> extending from both the apt and dnaX promoters through htpG. Interestingly, transcription of the weak dnaX promoter is stimulated 4 - to 10 -fold by a sequence contained entirely within the dnaX reading frame. This region has been localized; at least {{a portion of the}} sequence (and perhaps the entire sequence) is located within a 31 -bp region downstream of the dnaX promoter...|$|R
40|$|When T 4 infects Escherichia coli in {{the absence}} of protein synthesis, rho-mediated {{termination}} takes place on early polycistronic transcription units. During the early period of development, the appearance of delayed early transcripts becomes insensitive to the inhibition of protein synthesis. In the absence of the T 4 gene product mot, an inducer for the middle mode of transcription, only the early <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messengers</b> are synthesized. In mot- -infected cells, the synthesis of the distal transcripts still becomes completely insensitive to the polar effect of chloramphenicol. This happens because potential rho-sensitive termination sites are not used in these cells. In this respect, overcoming polarity induced by chloramphenicol can be called a process of antitermination. The mot-independent antitermination can be studied by addition of chloramphenicol during infections with mot- bacteriophage. The effect is stable; it allows a constant percentage of rho-sensitive termination sites in the cell to be traversed by RNA polymerase for at least 10 min at 42 degrees C. By examining six different transcription units on the T 4 genome, we find that each transcription unit has a cis-acting component (or components) which determines when its rho-sensitive termination site stops functioning. In extreme cases, rho acts with 100 % efficiency in some transcription units, whereas it is almost inactive in others...|$|R
40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in developmental biology, and the sequencing and annotation of genomes, key questions regarding the organisation of cells into embryos remain. One possibility is that uncharacterised genes having nonstandard coding arrangements and functions could provide some of the answers. Here we present the characterisation of tarsal-less (tal), {{a new type of}} noncanonical gene that had been previously classified as a putative noncoding RNA. We show that tal controls gene expression and tissue folding in Drosophila, thus acting as a link between patterning and morphogenesis. tal function is mediated by several 33 -nucleotide–long open reading frames (ORFs), which are translated into 11 -amino-acid–long peptides. These are the shortest functional ORFs described to date, and therefore tal defines two novel paradigms in eukaryotic coding genes: the existence of short, unprocessed peptides with key biological functions, and their arrangement in <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messengers.</b> Our discovery of tal-related short ORFs in other species defines an ancient and noncanonical gene family in metazoans that represents a new class of eukaryotic genes. Our results open a new avenue for the annotation and functional analysis of genes and sequenced genomes, in which thousands of short ORFs are still uncharacterised.

40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) in Lactococcus lactis {{is due to}} {{the expression}} of the membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter LmrCD. In the absence of drugs, the transcriptional regulator LmrR prevents expression of the ImrCD operon by binding to its operator site. Through an autoregulatory mechanism LmrR also suppresses its own expression. Although the ImrR and ImrCD genes have their own promoters, primer extension analysis showed the presence of a long transcript spanning the entire ImrR ImrCD cluster, in addition to various shorter transcripts harbouring the ImrCD genes only. 'In-gel' Cu-phenanthroline footprinting analysis indicated an extensive interaction between LmrR and the ImrR promoter/operator region. Atomic force microscopy imaging of the binding of LmrR to the control region of ImrR DNA showed severe deformations indicative of DNA wrapping and looping, while LmrR binding to a fragment containing the ImrCD control region induced DNA bending. The results further suggest a drug-dependent regulation mechanism in which the ImrCD genes are co-transcribed with ImrR as a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger.</b> This leads to an LmrR-mediated regulation of ImrCD expression that is exerted from two different locations and by distinct regulatory mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|In Qβ RNA, {{sequestering}} {{the coat}} gene ribosome binding site in a putatively strong hairpin stem structure eliminated synthesis of coat protein and activated protein synthesis from the much weaker maturation gene initiation site, located 1300 nucleotides upstream. As {{the stability of}} a hairpin stem comprising the coat gene Shine–Dalgarno site was incrementally increased, there was a corresponding increase in translation of maturation protein. The effect of the downstream coat gene ribosome binding sequence on maturation gene expression appeared to have occurred only in cis and did not require an AUG start codon or initiation of coat protein synthesis. In all cases, no structural reorganization was predicted to occur within Qβ RNA. Our results suggest that protein synthesis from a relatively weak translational initiation site is greatly influenced by {{the presence or absence}} of a stronger ribosome binding site located elsewhere on the same RNA molecule. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which multiple ribosome binding sites compete in cis for translational initiations as a means of regulating protein synthesis on a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA...|$|E
40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the effects of}} inhibitors of protein synthesis on the metabolism of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins of HeLa S- 3 cells. L- 1 -tosylamido- 2 -phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, a potent inhibitor of polypeptide chain initiation, was shown to preferentially inhibit the synthesis of cytoplasmic proteins and of histones at concentrations that permit continued amino acid incorporation into nuclear non-histone proteins. Comparisons of the molecular weight distributions of newly synthesized proteins in the presence and absence of L- 1 -tosylamido- 2 -phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone have revealed striking differences between nuclear anc cytoplasmic protein fractions. Differential effects on the synthesis of cytoplasmic proteins, acid-soluble nuclear proteins, and residual nuclear proteins have also been obtained with the antibiotic, pactamycin, another inhibitor of polypeptide chain initiation. The incorporation of radioactive amino acids into nuclear non-histone proteins shows resistance to inhibition by pactamycin, but is strongly inhibited by agents such as puromycin and cycloheximide which block chain elongation. The possibility that proliferating cells have developed specialized mechanisms for the coordinate synthesis of chromosomal proteins, possibly involving <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> RNAs, is tested and discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSequence {{analysis}} of the five genes (gutRMCBA) downstream from the previously described sorbitol- 6 -P dehydrogenase-encoding Lactobacillus casei gutF gene revealed that they constitute a sorbitol (glucitol) utilization operon. The gutRM genes encode putative regulators while gutCBA encode the EIIC, EIIBC and EIIA proteins of a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sorbitol phosphotransferase system (PTS(Gut)). The gut operon is transcribed as a <b>polycistronic</b> gutFRMCBA <b>messenger,</b> the expression of which is induced by sorbitol and repressed by glucose. gutR encodes a transcriptional regulator with two PTS regulated domains, an EIIB(Gat) and an EIIA(Mtl) domain. Its inactivation abolished gut operon transcription and sorbitol uptake, indicating that it acts as a transcriptional activator. In contrast, cells carrying a gutB mutation expressed the gut operon constitutively, but failed to transport sorbitol, indicating that EIIBC(Gut) negatively regulates GutR. Footprint analysis showed that GutR binds to a 35 bp sequence upstream from the gut promoter. Sequence comparison with the presumed promoter region of gut operons from various firmicutes revealed a GutR consensus motif that includes an inverted repeat. The regulation mechanism of the L. casei gut operon is therefore likely to be operative in other firmicutes.

40|$|The genetic organization, expression, and {{regulation}} of the celB locus of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus were analyzed. This locus includes the celB gene, which codes for an intracellular β-glucosidase, and a divergently orientated gene cluster, adhA-adhB-lamA, which codes for two alcohol dehydrogenases and an extracellular β- 1, 3 -endoglucanase that is transcribed as a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> (the lamA operon).

The in vivo and in vitro transcription initiation sites of both the celB gene and the lamA operon were identified 25 nucleotides downstream of conserved TATA box motifs.

This RNA was fractionated both by sedimentation through sucrose density gradients and electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels {{to measure the}} size and relative amount of each component. Early RNA consisted of six components of molecular weight 0. 75 × 106, 0. 44 × 106, 0. 37 × 106, 0. 25 × 106, 0. 09 × 106, and 0. 04 × 106, accounting for 35 % of the coding capacity of φ 29 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

40|$|Abstract Background Transfer {{of genes}} in utero via the amniotic fluid was shown {{previously}} with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) {{to be highly}} efficient. Expression for over one year was demonstrated using reporter genes. In addition, it was shown previously that transgenes delivered by this method release protein into the general circulation. Given these results experiments were designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that in utero rAAV gene therapy could result in long term physiologic modification. Methods A rAAV recombinant expressing ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf) and green fluorescent (gfp) in a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> was used to treat rat fetuses in utero. CNTF causes weight loss and decreased water consumption as a measurable physiologic effect. GFP was used as a marker of gene expression. Results In utero gene transfer with rAAV carrying human cntf and gfp resulted in long-term gene expression in rat. CNTF-specific physiologic effects of a decrease in weight and water intake were obtained. Expression of the GFP was documented in the treated animals at one year of age. Conclusion Given this data, in utero gene therapy with rAAV into multipotential stem cells resulted in long term systemic physiologic modification of the treated animals by the transgene product. In utero rAAV gene therapy potentially could be used for gene replacement therapy in metabolic disorders. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of {{induction}} of the enzymes of the lactose operon {{was carried out}} under conditions known to affect the kinetics of derepression of the enzymes of the histidine operon. The {{results show that the}} lactose system is similar to the histidine system in its responsiveness to conditions thought to affect the formylating capacity of the cell. This was demonstrated in the following ways: (i) trimethoprim, which is known to reduce the formylating capacity of the cell, gives rise to a relatively long interval between the times of induction of β-galactosidase and transacetylase; (ii) under conditions in which the histidine operon is derepressed, chloramphenicol causes a prolongation of the interval between the times of induction of the two enzymes, and this prolongation is reversed by adenine, methionine, and serine, compounds known to enrich the one-carbon pool of the cell; and (iii) 4 -amino- 5 -imidazolcarboxamide ribonucleoside, a compound which may act as a drain for formyl groups, reverses the effect of the latter compounds. The finding that the interval between the times of induction of the two enzymes is shortened under conditions expected to maintain a relatively high intracellular fo rmylating capacity suggests that under certain conditions translation of the <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> ribonucleic acid of the lactose operon may be initiated at more than one site or may proceed more rapidly from the operator end...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} molecules of bio-logical origin implicated in the control of gene expression is interferon. Discovered in 1957 by Isaacs and Lindenmann, this molecule, a slightly acidic protein with a molecular weight of about 30, 000 (Merigan, 1964), is produced by the cell in response to an appropriate stimulus, usually viral nucleic acid. Interferon can induce in animal cells a state of refractoriness to infection by an enormously broad spectrum of viruses, including both RNA and DNA types. If virus infection is viewed as the introduction i to sus-ceptible cells of a new <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger,</b> the viral genome of RNA viruses and the tran-scribed genome of DNA viruses, then interferon presumably acts on the cell to prevent expression of most or all of the viral genome. Thus, infor-mation concerning the molecular basis of interferon action should provide insight into the basic prob-lems concerned with the expression and control of polycistronic messengers. To date, it is generally accepted that {{there is little or no}} synthesis of viral RNA in interferon-treated cells, that direct inactivation of virions or infectious RNA is not involved, and that virus attachment and engulf-ment, viral uncoating, assembly, and release are not interfered with. However, the precise mech-anism whereby interferon acts to prevent viral replication has not been elucidated (see reviews o...|$|E

PDO members {{are involved in the}} oxidative folding, redox balance and detoxification of peroxides in thermophilic prokaryotes. Ttpdo was cloned and expressed in E. coli and the recombinant purified protein was assayed for the dithiol-reductase activity using insulin as substrate and compared with other PDOs characterized so far. In the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus PDOs work as thiol-reductases constituting a peculiar redox couple with Thioredoxin reductase (SsTr). To get insight into the role of TtPDO, a hybrid redox couple with SsTr, homologous to putative Trs of T. thermophilus, was assayed. The results showed that SsTr was able to reduce TtPDO in a concentration dependent manner with a calculated KM of 34. 72 lM, suggesting the existence of a new redox system also in thermophilic bacteria. In addition, structural characterization of TtPDO by light scattering and circular dichroism revealed the monomeric structure and the high thermostability of the protein. The analysis of the genomic environment suggested a possible clustering of Ttpdo with TTC 0487 and TTC 0488 (tlpA). Accordingly, transcriptional analysis showed that Ttpdo is transcribed as <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger.</b> Primer extension analysis allowed the determination of its 50 end and the identification of the promoter region...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{nucleotide}} sequence of a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA (mRNA) could answer several important questions about its translation. Does either initiation or termination of protein synthesis {{require more than}} a single codon? Are there any {{nucleotide sequence}}s between cistrons, and i'f so, what is their function? Are the sequences near the ends of the RNA molecule translated into protein or do they have some other role? What is the frequency with which different codons are used in vivo? And are there regions in the molecule which have secondary structure? As yet very few sequences from mRNAs are known. This dirth of information results, first, from the difficulty of obtaining most mRNAs in a pure form and, secondly, from the great size of mRNAs: many mRNAs are between 1000 and 10, 000 nucleotides in length while the largest P~NA mole-cules of known sequence, 5 S RNAs, contain 120 nucleotides (Brownlee, Sanger, and Barrell, 1967; Forget and Weissman, 1967). Some of the best characterized mRNAs which can be obtained in a pure form are those isolated from the RNA bacteriophages, such as R 17, f 2, and MS 2 (which are all very closely related) and Qfl (Zinder, 1965). The phage RNAs are single-stranded and probably contain the information to code for only three proteins (Gussin, 1966; Horiuchi, Lodish, and Zinder, 1966). They function as active mRNAs in a cell free system (Nathans, Notani, Schwartz, and Zinder, 1962) and direct the synthesis of at least two (Capecchi 1966) and probably all three of the phage specific proteins (Eggen, Oeschger...|$|E
40|$|The {{double-stranded}} DNA genomes of the crenarchaeal rudiviruses SIRV 1 (32 kb) and SIRV 2 (35 kb) {{were previously}} sequenced. Here we present {{results of the}} analysis of gene expression of these viruses at different time points after infection of the host cell, Sulfolobus islandicus, and of the mapping of transcriptional start sites. Transcription of both genomes starts simultaneously at multiple sites spread over the total length of the genome and from both strands. The earliest time point when viral transcripts could be detected in cells was 30 min after infection. At this time point all the viral genes, except one, were transcribed. Many genes were clustered {{and appeared to be}} transcribed as polycistronic messengers. Although the coat protein-encoding gene was initially also transcribed as a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger,</b> an abundant monocistronic transcript of this gene was detected 2 to 3 h after infection, just before assembly of viral particles. The expression of a single gene, adjacent to the coat protein gene, was upregulated at the late phase of infection, suggesting that it might be involved in specific processing and activation of the coat protein messenger. Start sites of 13 transcripts from the SIRV 1 genome have been mapped by primer extension, and promoter sequences have been identified. Similar to host promoters, these viral promoters all contain potential binding sites for the archaeal transcription factors TATA binding protein and transcription factor B.

40|$|We have {{examined}} histone gene expression {{during the early}} stages of sea urchin embryogenesis. The five histone genes expressed at that time are contained in tandem repetitive segments. It has been suggested that adjacent coding regions and their intervening spacer sequences are transcribed into large <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> ribonucleic acid (RNA) precursors. We have subcloned into pBR 322 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences mapping either in the coding region, the 5 ' spacer, or the 3 ' spacer of the H 2 B histone gene. These clones were used to produce radioiodinated hybridization probes. We measured the steady-state quantity of H 2 B messenger RNA as well as spacer-specific RNA in the total RNA from embryos taken at various stages of development from fertilization to hatching of blastulae (0 to 22 h post-fertilization). Small amounts of RNA hybridizing to both spacer probes could be found. However, we show that these RNAs form mismatched hybrids with the spacer DNA and therefore cannot originate from the spacers present in the histone genes. We conclude that there is no detectable transcription of the spacer regions {{on either side of the}} H 2 B histone gene. The detection limit for RNA complementary to the 5 ' spacer sequence corresponds to a maximum of about three RNA molecules per cell, an amount shown to be far less than the projected steady-state pool size of a putative polycistronic transcript, if such a precursor were to be the obligatory transcript of the histone genes. (This conclusion was derived by using the known rates of production of H 2 B mRNA throughout early development [R. E. Maxson and F. H. Wilt, Dev. Biol., in press].) The physiologically relevant transcript of the histone genes in early development is therefore monocistronic and probably identical to the messenger RNA itself...|$|E

These studies indicate that mutant M 54 but not M 25 can revert by super-suppressor mutations in unlinked genes, thus confirming previous evidence that M 54 contains a nonsense codon. At least three new super suppressors of M 54 have been detected. All four super suppressors (including one previously detected) when combined with M 54 result in high levels of all five of the arom enzymic activities {{in the form of}} arom multienzyme complexes very similar to (but not necessarily identical with) that in wild type (WT). —Evidence has also been obtained that the two non-complementing mutants can yield revertants which appear to result from true back mutations and produce arom aggregates essentially indistinguishable from that of WT. In addition, M 25, but not M 54, when plated on quinic acid yields revertants (secondary mutants) some of which are phenotypically indistinguishable from arom- 2 primary mutants and others of which, although also mapping within the arom- 2 gene, exhibit unusual properties. Genetic evidence indicates that the M 25 secondary mutants are localized within the arom- 2 gene, but that they arise from mutational events more complex than ones resulting in single base pair changes in the M 25 codon. —The recovery of secondary arom- 2 mutants as revertants of non-complementing arom mutants provides strong evidence, independent of earlier recombination data, that non-complementing arom mutants are located within the arom- 2 structural gene of the arom gene cluster. In addition, the occurrence and characteristics of these secondary arom- 2 mutants provide strong evidence, independent of the results with nonsense suppressors, that the arom gene cluster is transcribed, beginning with the arom- 2 gene, as a single <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule which is subsequently translated into the arom multienzyme complex...|$|E
40|$|Fuso{{bacterium}} nucleatum is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes {{the oral}} cavity {{as well as}} other sites in the human body. It is known for its ability to adhere to a large number of different bacterial species and serving as a "bridging" organism. It {{plays an important role in}} the formation and maintenance of mature oral biofilms. At the same time it has been implicated in a number of important oral and systemic diseases and is considered an opportunistic pathogen. Very little is known about the outer membrane proteins of F. nucleatum and the molecular mechanisms of its adhesion. There is a large number of predicted membrane proteins that are expected to localize to either of the two membranes surrounding the cell. A number of lipoproteins are predicted from sequence searches, yet none are currently characterized on a molecular level. We have identified and characterized a novel hypothetical protein in F. nucleatum encoded by the ORF FN 1253. The gene was shown to play a role in interspecies interactions with oral streptococci and was named aid 1 (Adhesion Inducing Determinant 1). Aid 1 is important in modulation of adhesion to oral streptococci, as aberrant expression of the aid 1 gene leads to an uncharacteristic development of the dual species biofilm, which ultimately could lead to changes in the overall multispecies biofilm formation. The functional domains of the protein were also analyzed, and we showed that this small lipoprotein localizes to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane and requires the presence of its signal sequence as well as the anchoring cysteine residue for proper processing and maturation of the final protein product. Aberrant processing of the protein led to rapid turnover inside the cytosol, as the accumulation of the unprocessed protein appeared to be toxic to the cells. Expression of the aid 1 gene and the Aid 1 protein production is tightly regulated, particularly in the presence of oral streptococci. We showed that the gene can be transcribed as two messenger RNA species, and only the longer <b>polycistronic</b> <b>messenger</b> is used for transcription. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of a fusobacterial lipoprotein, and the first hypothetical protein that is implicated in interspecies interactions within the oral cavity.
