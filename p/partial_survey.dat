5|$|Although {{the modern}} county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, {{the history of}} its {{constituent}} settlements goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, {{believed to have been}} an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes. Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth, are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a <b>partial</b> <b>survey</b> was taken, rather than sparsity of population.|$|E
500|$|Some {{local field}} and road names, {{and the name}} of Sale itself, are Anglo-Saxon in origin, which {{indicates}} the town was founded in the 7th or 8th centuries. The Old English salh, from which [...] "Sale" [...] is derived, means [...] "at the sallow tree", and Ashton upon Mersey means [...] "village or farm near the ash trees". Although the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey were not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, that may be because only a <b>partial</b> <b>survey</b> was taken. The first recorded occurrences of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey are in 1199–1216 and 1260 respectively. The settlements were referred to as townships rather than manors, which suggests further evidence of Anglo-Saxon origins as townships were developed by the Saxons.|$|E

500|$|The Domesday Survey of 1086 {{does not}} {{directly}} mention Ashton, perhaps because only a <b>partial</b> <b>survey</b> of the area had been taken. However, {{it is thought that}} St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12thcentury when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12thcentury, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was [...] "one of the finest great houses in the North West" [...] of the 14thcentury. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.|$|E

Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a <b>partial</b> <b>survey</b> was taken, rather than sparsity of population.During the Middle Ages, much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire - an ancient division of the county of Lancashire. Salfordshire encompassed several parishes and townships, some of which, like Rochdale, were important market towns and centres of England's woollen trade. The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic flannel and fustian cloth production, which encouraged a system of cross-regional trade. In the late-18th century, the Industrial Revolution transformed the local domestic system; mechanisation enabled the industrialisation of the region's textile trade, triggering rapid growth in the cotton industry and expansion in ancillary trades. Infrastructure such as rows of terraced housing, factories and roads were constructed to house labour, transport goods, and produce cotton goods on an industrial scale for a global market. The townships in and around Manchester began expanding [...] "at an astonishing rate" [...] {{around the turn of the}} 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in industrial textile production and processing. This population increase resulted in the [...] "vigorous concentric growth" [...] of a conurbation between Manchester and an arc of surrounding mill towns, formed from a steady accretion of houses, factories and transport infrastructure. Places such as Bury, Oldham and Bolton played a central economic role nationally, and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive cotton-producing towns in the world. However, it was Manchester that was the most populous settlement, a major city, the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods, and the natural centre of its region. By 1835 [...] "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world"; and by 1848 urban sprawl had fused the city to its surrounding towns and hinterland to form a single continuous conurbation. In the 1910s, local government reforms to administer this conurbation as a single entity were proposed.|$|E
