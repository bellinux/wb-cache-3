40|$|A {{significant}} portion of the 200, 000 people working in Hong Kong's central business district (CBD) relies on buses as their primary means of transport. During peak hours, nearly a thousand double-decker buses <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tiny area of 150 Â ha. This causes traffic congestion and air pollution. Moreover, given that the flow is uni-directional (into the CBD in the morning and out of the CBD in the afternoon), the occupancy of buses in the CBD is actually low. In this paper, we propose to reduce traffic congestion and to increase bus occupancy by merging bus routes. We describe the peculiar situation of the CBD in Hong Kong and explain the necessary conditions for the possible success of merging routes. Our analysis shows that merging will lead to an overall benefit for all parties, including government, bus operators, and passengers. The actual merging decisions, which routes to merge and at what frequencies buses should run, are determined by a mathematical model. The model also shows quantitatively the benefits of merging routes and the impacts of other factors. The procedure that we follow and the model that we adopt can be applied to other CBD. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, the {{squatting}} movement in Rome has witnessed a steady increase of foreign participants as regular members but a scarce presence among the leadership. Moreover, the incidence of immigrants among squatters is typically not marked in the public self-representation of the movement yet overemphasized and disputed by mainstream media. The essay attempts an interpretation of this peculiar distribution of foreign immigrants among squatters. On the one side, their being foreigners within Italian welfare puts them at risk of higher exclusion; on the other, political leaders in the squats may see the foreigners (as bearers of a shared class condition) as a suitable pool for the wider political aim of squatting, namely the implementation of an alternative urban lifestyle. Furthermore, foreigners may take part into squats just as a self-attained form of social emancipation, since the act of squatting may equal an otherwise inaccessible house possession. Within these apparently contradictory aims, multi-ethnic squats turn into cosmopolitan spaces of identities that accept transcending their specificities to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> common kiln of class identity, between revolutionary proletariat and pity bourgeoisie seeking full social integration...|$|E

Kampung Tunjung area is a paddy field areas that use river water for the irrigation. The suitability of the water for irrigation depends on the water quality itself. The suitability of the water for irrigation depends on the water quality itself. The different quality of the water will cause a different result of the crop production. For {{the analysis of the}} water quality in-situ method the Multi Parameter YSI were used to observe the quality.

Water samples will be collected by using a pail and the water will <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sample bottle with the proper presevation chemicals like nitric acid.
