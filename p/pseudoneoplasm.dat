40|$|Calcifying <b>pseudoneoplasm</b> {{is rarely}} {{encountered}} along the neuraxis, and only few {{cases have been}} reported to involve the spine. Its exact pathogenesis is unknown, and has been regarded as an unusual reactive process which must be differentiated from infection or malignancy. This rare entity carries a good prognosis after surgical resection. We report on the computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted features of calcifying <b>pseudoneoplasm</b> of the spine by describing two patients with involvement of the craniocervical junction, and thoracic spine...|$|E
40|$|Calcifying psuedoneoplasm of {{the spine}} is a rare non-neoplastic lesion of unknown origin. Radiologic and histologic manifesta-tions are very {{variable}} and clinical symptoms include isolated pain, myelopathy, and radiculopathy. Surgical resection is the preferred option of treatment. This report describes three cases of calcifying <b>pseudoneoplasm</b> in the spine. The first case is a 77 -year-old female with pain in both legs. The second case is a 67 -year-old woman who presented as right leg pain. The third case is a 78 -year-old woman with isolated back pain. The involved sites of each of cases were T 12, L 2 - 3, and L 1, respectively. Surgical resection of the involved masses relieved symptoms...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 48 -year-old {{woman with a}} pleural <b>pseudoneoplasm</b> {{requiring}} different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. After initial presentation with increasing dyspnoea, temperature, dry cough, and interscapular pain diagnostic processing showed a large mediastinal mass with marked pleural effusion and high metabolic activity in the 18 F-FDG-PET/CT. Extensive CT-guided biopsy of the tumor reaching from the visceral pleura into the right upper lobe revealed no malignancy, but a marked inflammatory tissue reaction containing foam cells. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy was temporarily successful. However, in the further course the mass relapsed and was resistant to antibiotics and a corticosteroid trial. With the working hypothesis of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor the patient underwent surgical tumor resection, finally confirming the suspected diagnosis. Due to residual disease intravenous immunoglobulins were administered leading to sustained response. This case with a pleural localisation of a large inflammatory pseudotumor with responsiveness to immunomodulation after incomplete resection extends the reported spectrum of thoracopulmonary manifestations of this rare entity...|$|E
40|$|Soft tissue {{tumors in}} {{children}} and adolescents are an important group of neoplasms, <b>pseudoneoplasms,</b> and tumefactive malformations with some distinctive clinicopathologic, genetic, syndromic, and therapeutic implications. In addition to the basic pathologic examination, there is the availability of diagnostic adjuncts in various settings based upon the histopathologic features that facilitate and/or corroborate a diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and an ever-increasing array of new technologies are available to address specific diagnostic questions and even potential therapeutic strategies. This review focuses upon some of the unique aspects of soft tissue tumors in children, including the classification, approach to the diagnosis, grading, clinical and pathologic staging, therapy-related changes, pathogenesis, and risk factors...|$|R
