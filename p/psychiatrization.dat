They will bring such attitude in their adult life, when they will desire social repression and will form docile subjects for society. Michel Foucault, in his systematic study of sexuality, argued that rather than being merely repressed, the desires of the individual are efficiently mobilized and used, to control the individual, alter interpersonal relationships and control the masses. Foucault believed organized religion, through moral prohibitions, and economic powers, through advertising, make use of unconscious sex drives. Dominating desire, they dominate individuals.

50|$|There {{has been}} debate {{as to whether}} gender {{transition}} {{should be included in}} psychology.  “Gender transition processes are classified as mental disorders in diagnostic manuals” Suess also explains how stigmatizes trans people as mentally unwell, and incapable. Communities such as STP (International Campaign Stop Trans Pathologization) argues that it has observed, “structural interrelations between dynamics of <b>psychiatrization,</b> discrimination, and transphobia and on acknowledgement of the negative effects that a psychiatric classification has on the citizenship of people”. Sonny Nordmarken states that, “The idea that trans people are mentally ill is institutionalized in psychiatric texts such as the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and thus also in medical and legal transition routes” Sonny believes that when transgender people are placed in a psychology text, they are stigmatized as mentally ill, and thus increasing microaggressions and discrimination.  A study by Schilt and Wiswall showed that in a workplace environment transitioning trans men were supported in incorporating them more into society; whereas transitions trans women were demoted or fired. In the study microaggressions were noted by employers to transitioning trans women.|$|E

Besides, I show how such interpretation can be detected in four issues related to safety, equality, <b>psychiatrization</b> of human condition, and autonomy. In the conclusions, I defend, ﬁrst, the obligation of physician to inform patients about the important long-term uncertainties around psychopharmacology. Second, I justify the necessity of promote more prolonged monitoring of patients treated with such kind of drugs. Third, I insist in the relevance of increasing research about drugs’ adverse effects extended over a long time. And forth, I bring up the utility of health concept to avoid the subjective stigmatization of cognitive or affective traits, to prevent potential problems of inequality and coercion, and to keep from mental disorders caused by attempts of getting psychical states supposedly optimized...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I provide an {{analysis}} of the implementation of “recovery” as a policy object and commitment in the UK. This can be situated as part of the New Labour government’s (1997 - 2010) reform of the NHS during the 2000 s. Through a textual analysis of policy and legislation from this time I draw out a tension between contemporary ideals of choice and autonomy in healthcare and the specificities of a mental healthcare system in which psychiatrists are legislatively empowered to treat patients without their consent. In the UK, evidence continues to show that the most economically and socially disadvantaged members of British society {{are most likely to be}} detained under the Mental Health Act 2007. This paper provides an intersectional analysis of the ways in which policy, legislation and <b>psychiatrization</b> enact particular subjects as ‘failed’ citizens. Following Tyler (2010; 2013), I argue that these practices of exclusion and detainment are constituent elements of neoliberal state-making, which are discriminatory and unjust...|$|E
40|$|When Thorazine was {{approved}} {{as a drug}} {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia in the mid 1950 s, the psychiatric profession believed they had demonstrated that mental illness was a brain disease, which could be treated with psychotropic medication. Because the medical model had always prevailed over alternative explanations, the discovery of Thorazine was heralded by the proponents of the medical model as putting the nail in the coffin of psychological approaches. Instead, it raised the debate to a qualitatively different level for opponents of the model. China Mills’s Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The <b>Psychiatrization</b> of the Majority World is the latest book to criticize the medical model and its application to the majority world in general and in particular the Global South (India), which has a population of 1. 2 billion people, second largest in the world. The author’s major point is that treatment toward the mentally ill can be defined as “psychiatric imperialism ” (p. 6). Mills believes that treatment of the mentally ill by the psychiatric profession, in collusion with the pharmaceutical industry, is comparable to the imperialism inflicted by European nations with their use of military, economic, and political forces to subjugate its colonies. The author’s unique and critical analysis hinges on a...|$|E

AbstractThe article {{addresses}} {{the connections between}} medicalization and the prosecution of the consumption of substances called narcotics and their effects on the subject- a subject who, at the same time, is entitled to rights. Through the examination of six judicial warrants for compulsory admissions to a "psychiatric colony", the working of the interconnection between legal and psychiatric practices is analyzed. What is also analysed are the effects such interconnection has {{on the construction of}} a broader spectrum of action and intervention, both of the judiciary and the medical practices, beyond the framework of the statutory regulations upon which such admissions are based. From the examined material two main aspects come to light: firstly, the medical and mental-health arguments from which decisions about psychiatric hospital admissions in drug or alcohol abuse cases will be made. Secondly, there is also an indication of the purpose or objective of such hospital admissions. This paper also deals with the processes that Foucault calls "indefinite medicalization « and the real productions that go beyond therapeutic aspects, relating the effects of the former with the workings of the control of subjects through the different diagnoses categories of addicts, be it alcoholics or drug addicts. Keywords: drug, <b>psychiatrization,</b> medicalization, social control. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{positive}} {{association between}} 'mental illness' and poverty {{is one of}} the most well established in psychiatric epidemiology. Yet, there is little conclusive evidence about the nature of this relationship. Generally, explanations revolve around the idea of a vicious cycle, where poverty may cause mental ill health, and mental ill health may lead to poverty. Problematically, much of the literature overlooks the historical, social, political, and cultural trajectories of constructions of both poverty and 'mental illness'. Laudable attempts to explore the social determinants of mental health sometimes take recourse to using and reifying psychiatric diagnostic categories that individualize distress and work to psychiatrically reconfigure 'symptoms' of oppression, poverty, and inequality as 'symptoms' of 'mental illness'. This raises the paradoxical issue that the very tools that are used to research the relationship between poverty and mental health may prevent recognition of the complexity of that relationship. Looking at the mental health-poverty nexus through a lens of <b>psychiatrization</b> (intersecting with medicalization, pathologization, and psychologization), this paper recognizes the need for radically different tools to trace the messiness of the multiple relationships between poverty and distress. It also implies radically different interventions into mental health and poverty that recognize the landscapes in which lived realities of poverty are embedded, the political economy of psychiatric diagnostic and prescribing practices, and ultimately to address the systemic causes of poverty and inequality...|$|E
40|$|Amid {{calls from}} the World Health Organization (WHO) and Global Mental Health to ‘scale up’ {{psychiatric}} treatments, globally, there are other calls (sometimes {{from those who have}} received those treatments), to abolish psychiatric diagnostic systems and to acknowledge the harm caused by some medications. This thesis elaborates a space for these arguments to encounter and to be encountered by each other. This is a thesis about encounters; about psychiatry’s encounters with the global South; about research encounters in India with mental health Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs); and about colonial encounters more generally. Drawing on analysis of interviews and visits to a range of mental health support provision in India, this thesis traces some conceptual and material mechanisms by which psychiatry travels - across borders - into increasing domains of everyday experience, and across geographical borders, into low and middle-income countries. It explores the claims of Global Mental Health, ‘to make mental health for all a reality’, as being particular mechanisms of <b>psychiatrization</b> - ones that may employ similar codifications to those of colonial discourse. Global Mental Health and WHO mental health policy often mobilise psychiatric interventions in response to a ‘crisis’ or an ‘emergency’ in mental health, globally. Yet while this current incitement suggests an abnormal deviation from a normal order, mental illness may also be read as a ‘normal’ reaction to the (dis) order of globalisation. Nevertheless, in making the claim that mental health problems, such as Depression, are a ‘normal’ response to inequitable market relations in the global South, may also be normative, as it glosses over a simultaneous globalisation; that of bio-psychiatric explanations of distress. Thus, while Global Mental Health marks an explicit making political of psychiatry through its conceptualisation of mental health as key to an agenda of international development, it simultaneously disavows psychiatry as political through its universal application of psychiatric technologies. To claim the universality of psychiatric diagnoses is different from making the claim that distress, manifest in myriad forms, is universal. This is because psychiatric frameworks are mediators of that distress, they provide but one way of understanding yet they are often framed as being the ‘truth’, globally. 4 Reading Global Mental Health psychopolitically, then, enables an engagement with the double process through which conditions of inequality and alienation may become internalised –how inequality may come to play on the body, to be made flesh. This move occurs alongside another process that reads the mechanisms by which socio-economic crisis comes to be rearticulated and reconfigured as individual crisis, as mental illness. To read Global Mental Health as a colonial discourse is to trace how particular knowledge is mobilised {{in the creation of a}} space for psychiatric ‘subject peoples’, a global space. This research traces some of these ‘on the ground’, often powerful, techniques of recruiting subjects and fixing them. It also interrogates the knowledge base of Global Mental Health to create a space to read this alongside alternative ways of knowing; specifically psychiatric user/survivor and critical psychiatry critiques. This works to explore how psychiatry encounters difference (both within the global North and South), and to (re) think how Global Mental Health might be encountered differently. This thesis thus explores how the colonial relation is mobilised within psychiatric treatment in order to think through how the violence of colonialism may enable a re-thinking of contemporary forms of psychiatric treatment as being violent, the violence of <b>psychiatrization</b> - violence in the name of ‘treatment’. Using the post-colonial theory of Frantz Fanon, Ashis Nandy and Homi Bhabha, as conceptual tools, alongside research encounters (interviews, ethnographic field work, policy documents) in India, enables exploration of how <b>psychiatrization</b> may allow relationships of domination and resistance to continue after formal colonialism has ended. It also enables engagement with how strategies of resistance to colonialism may be read alongside and used to illuminate resistance to psychiatry – resistance that may be secret, sly, covered up. This research concludes by attending to emerging counter-hegemonic ways of knowing distress, epistemologies of the South, in order to creatively re-think the work of Global Mental Health and psychiatry in countries of the global South. To imagine a global mental health that attends to the heterogeneity and complexity of local, indigenous ways of knowing distress, that rethinks issues of consent – specifically around the use of psychiatric terminology and the provision of non-medical (and non-‘western’) spaces 5 of healing, and that recognises psychiatry as one of many approaches, questioning whether it can, or should, be global. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was to problematize the adolescence's {{production as}} and an object of scientific investigation and social intervention at the field of mental health's in Brazil. With this we seek to seize the lines of force which compose the historical process of construction of the adolescence and of the current scenario of the pathologization and <b>psychiatrization</b> of adolescent's behavior. For this, we (re) construct two major scenarios of Brazilian mental health's history: from 19 th century to the finals of 20 th century, and from the finals of 20 th century to the current century (21 st). The execution of this proposal was supported in a documentation corpus referring to the current proposals of mental health care in Brazil, namely: Development Psychiatry and Psychosocial Attention; this documentation involves laws, ordinances, decrees, manuals, booklets, reports and divulges materials. As an theoretical-methodological reference our inspiration was the archeo-genealogy perspective of Michel Foucault, since license us to do a critical problematization of {{the present and the}} history from an analysis which, without pretensions of affirm essences and universalities, focuses on the historical, political and socials engendered involved in the productions and practices of medicine, psychology, psychiatry and justice about the adolescence. In that way, this dissertation aimed less to presents answer than fortify the questions about the hegemony practices on mental health care in Brazil, and also charges resistance's strategies to the affirmation practices of care and attention to adolescence which consider mental health as a complex social proces...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo analisa criticamente as mudanças observadas no tratamento do sofrimento psíquico na história recente, apontando a contribuição de fatores como: a padronização de sintomas trazida pelas sucessivas edições da série DSM (Manual Diagnóstico e Estatístico de Transtornos Mentais), os resultados de pesquisas na neurociência - que tentam fundamentar o funcionamento psíquico em bases orgânicas - e o grande desenvolvimento dos psico-fármacos, fruto de maciços investimentos financeiros. A ação desse conjunto de fatores teve por efeito a perda da noção de sentido/significado dos sintomas e dos sofrimentos subjetivos, própria da psiquiatria clássica, e a crescente medicalização dos indivíduos na sociedade contemporânea. O texto busca alinhavar como aconteceu a produção de uma nova verdade acerca dos sofrimentos psíquicos e amplia essa análise, evidenciando que os procedimentos de medicalização surgidos no cuidado da população adulta foram estendidos também para as crianças. Revê a evolução do tratamento da criança, marcando a interação da pedagogia e da {{medicina}} na constituição da psiquiatria infantil. Além disso, busca evidenciar os efeitos dessa verdade sobre os sujeitos, identificando a forma como o discurso técnico (especialmente influenciado pelo discurso médico-psicológico) tem tido lugar no mundo contemporâneo e como este tem influenciado a Educação. Trata de ressaltar, como produtos, a banalização da existência, a naturalização do sofrimento e a culpabilização dos indivíduos pelas vicissitudes da vida. Argumenta que a psicologização da escola pode ceder lugar hoje à psiquiatrização do discurso escolar. A articulação saber/verdade/poder é aqui tratada a partir dos textos de Michel Foucault. This study {{offers a}} {{critical analysis of}} the changes observed {{in the treatment of}} psychiatric suffering in recent history, noting the contribution from factors such as: the standardization of symptoms brought by the successive editions of the DSM series (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), the results of researches in neuroscience that attempt to establish the psychic functioning upon organic bases, and the huge development of psychopharmaceuticals as a result of massive financial investments. The combined action of this group of factors had as its effect the loss of the notion of sense/meaning of the symptoms and subjective sufferings, which belongs to classical psychiatry, and the growing medicalization of the individuals in contemporary society. The text seeks to outline a picture of how a new truth about the psychic sufferings was produced, and expands this analysis by showing that the medicalization procedures developed for the treatment of the adult population were extended also to children. It reviews the evolution of the treatment of children, marking the interaction between pedagogy and medicine in the constitution of child psychiatry. In addition to that, the text tries to reveal the effects of this truth upon the subjects, identifying {{the way in which the}} technical discourse (particularly influenced by the medical-psychological discourse) has been given a place in the contemporary world, and how its has influenced education. It underlines, as products of this process, the banalization of existence, the naturalization of suffering, and the blaming of individuals for the accidents of life, and argues that the psychologization of school may nowadays be replaced by the <b>psychiatrization</b> of school discourse. The articulation knowledge/truth/power is investigated here from the texts of Michel Foucault...|$|E
40|$|El objeto de estudio de la tesis {{doctoral}} son los centros de internamiento para menores desamparados y los centros cerrados de justicia juvenil. Estas instituciones, proclaman que la naturaleza y la finalidad de sus intervenciones es educativa. La investigación profundiza en esta reivindicación de “lo educativo” teniendo presente también que, históricamente, varias medidas y tratamientos punitivos se han representado como educativos, reeducativos, terapéuticos. Asimismo, se considera que el referido tratamiento en los centros de menores es trascendido y configurado por los procesos y las necesidades del control social. En este plano la investigación adopta dos estrategias metodológicas básicas: a) Parte del supuesto de que hay una correlación e interacción significativa entre las respuestas institucionales {{en materia}} de protección de menores y de justicia juvenil – diseñadas, cada una, para responder a las necesidades y objetivos propios de su ámbito -, y, a partir de ahí, se pretende analizar el campo como un todo, en un esfuerzo por identificar e interpretar características compartidas, b) El estado actual del tratamiento institucional de los menores se intenta focalizar y diagnosticar bajo el prisma de los conceptos de control, disciplina y castigo. En primer lugar, se buscan los elementos comunes de las instituciones protectoras y de las instituciones penales que permiten afirmar que en ellas rige el modelo de “Pedagogía carcelaria” y que estas instituciones pertenecen a un “continuum carcelario”. Entre los distintos elementos que ponen de manifiesto el dominio de este tipo de pedagogía y que son comunes en el “continuum” de los centros, se ha observado que los fundamentales son la representación y “construcción” institucional de los sujetos internados y reclusos, el sistema conductista de premios y sanciones, las correcciones “educativas”, el régimen y las sanciones disciplinarias, los medios de contención, el frecuente recurso a la psicofarmacología y el ideal médico-pedagógico. En segundo lugar, se pretenden detectar, en los tratamientos estudiados formas, estrategias e instrumentos del control social. En este marco, se observa que el control social opera, mayoritariamente, a través de dos líneas generales: a) la “máscara” educativa y, b) la psiquiatrización de conflicto y el malestar social. La tesis afirma que los centros de protección de menores y de justicia juvenil investigados se inscriben en el espacio del control social institucionalizado realmente punitivo con discurso no punitivo y constituyen espacios de control, castigo y exclusión. The topical {{focus of the}} present study are the centers for abandoned children and minor and youth detention centers in Catalonia (Spain). The particular institutions claim that with reference to minors and young people, their character and purpose is primarily educational. The research investigates the alleged educational character of these institutions, especially when considering that historically several punitive measures and treatments were presented as educational, re-educational and/or therapeutic. The research also investigates how the treatment of minors in relevant institutions is determined and shaped by the needs and processes of social control. The research plan is structured along two basic methodological approaches: a) Assuming that there is a significant interaction and correlation between the institutional responses in i. child protection and ii. juvenile justice systems, both designed to meet the needs and objectives pertaining to their respective field, the target is to analyze the topic as a whole with the aim being to identify and interpret shared characteristics between the fields; b) Reviewing the current status of institutional care of children, the aim is to assess and evaluate its role within the prism of control, discipline and punishment. First, the focus is on assessing the common elements of the protective institutions and penal institutions that allow them to state that governs the model of "carceral pedagogy" and that these institutions belong to a "carceral continuum". Among the various elements that are fundamental in this type of pedagogy and were shown to be common in the ‘continuum’ of institutions are i. the representation and institutional “construction” of the subjects prisoners and interned; ii. the behavioral system of rewards and sanctions; iii. the "educational" corrections iv. the disciplinary regime and sanctions; v. the containment means; vi. the frequent use of psychopharmacology; and vii. the medical-educational ideal. Second, the research aims at detecting strategies and instruments of social control, within the framework of available treatment forms. In this context, it was shown that social control operates mainly through two general lines: a) the educational "mask" and b) the <b>psychiatrization</b> of conflict and social unrest. A major underlying element of the present thesis is that the institutions of child protection and juvenile justice systems under consideration are recorded {{in the context of a}} punitive institutionalized system of social control that is presented within a nonpunitive discourse and constitutes spaces of control, punishment and social exclusion...|$|E
