40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} to show that mice treated with various regimens of 8 -methoxypsoralen followed by exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA) are rendered tumor-susceptible when challenged with short-wave ultraviolet light (UVB) induced regressor tumors. These same tumors are readily rejected when implanted into normal syngeneic animals. Similar observations {{have been made in}} mice treated with subcarcinogenic doses of UVB, where it was shown that the tumor-susceptible state is mediated by suppressor T lymphocytes. These suppressor T-cells may be generated in response to antigens expressed by UVB damaged skin cells. It is now known that suppressor T-cells generated in mice treated with UVB are la-positive and have specificities for cross-reacting tumor antigens shared by all UVB- induced tumors, which have been tested to date. Our data suggest that, like UVB treated mice, treatment of mice with PUVA results in tumor-susceptibility mediated through the generation of Ia+ suppressor cells. Since <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatments</b> appear to generate a suppressor cell response in mice, a possible mechanism by which these treatments act to manage autoimmune type skin diseases, such as vitiligo, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This 5 -year {{prospective}} study of ophthalmologic findings in 1299 patients treated with oral 8 -methoxypsoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) for psoriasis failed {{to demonstrate a}} significant dose-dependent increase {{in the risk of}} developing symptomatic cataracts.

METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with psoriasis about to undergo ultraviolet phototherapy (UVB) or photochemotherapy (PUVA) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two conditions: a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention guided by audiotaped instructions during light treatments, or a control condition consisting of the light treatments alone with no taped instructions. Psoriasis status was assessed in three ways: direct inspection by unblinded clinic nurses; direct inspection by physicians blinded to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s study condition (tape or no-tape); and blinded physician evaluation of photographs of psoriasis lesions. Four sequential indicators of skin status were monitored during the study: a First Response Point, a Turning Point, a Halfway Point, and a Clearing Point.

40|$|Three {{patients}} with atypical courses and manifestations of pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) are presented. The first patient is a 21 -year-old white woman who showed a good response of her PLC lesions {{as well as}} her reactive oligoarthritis to repeated <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatments</b> combined with oral prednisone during 1 year. The effect of the treatment then decreased. The patient developed a low-grade malignant lymphoma of the lung. When the lymphoma of the lung improved after chemotherapy, the PLC eruptions improved, too. The second patient is a 41 -year-old man, whose Hodgkin's disease stage IVa was successfully treated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 1984. In 1987 he showed PLC lesions which responded well to PUVA therapy, later also in combination with etretinate. Until 1988 repeated skin biopsies revealed a non-specific eczematous pattern. In 1989 the recalcitrant PLC eruptions finally revealed a pleomorphic non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the skin with medium-sized cells. The third patient had a PLC for about 9 years when Hodgkin's disease stage Ia was diagnosed. At the beginning the skin biopsy showed an eczematous pattern, but 2 years later, in 1990, skin infiltrations of a large-cell, anaplastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma were seen.

50|$|An {{important}} use of psoralen is in <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatment</b> {{for skin}} {{problems such as}} psoriasis and (to a lesser extent) eczema and vitiligo.

50|$|One {{inaccurate}} {{process for}} repairing psoralen crosslinks appears {{to employ a}} DNA polymerase {{to fill in the}} gap formed in the strand with the two incisions. This process is inaccurate because the complementary un-incised strand still retains a portion of the crosslink and thus cannot serve as an adequate template for accurate repair synthesis. Inaccurate repair synthesis can cause mutation. Psoralen monoadducts in the template DNA strand may also cause inaccurate replication bypass (translesion synthesis) that can lead to mutation. In phage T4, the increase in mutation observed after <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatment</b> was found to reflect translesion synthesis by wild-type DNA polymerase, likely due to imperfect proof reading capability.|$|E
50|$|For psoriasis, UVB {{phototherapy}} {{has been}} shown to be effective. A feature of psoriasis is localized inflammation mediated by the immune system. Ultraviolet radiation is known to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammatory responses. Light therapy for skin conditions like psoriasis usually use NB-UVB (311 nm wavelength) though it may use UV-A (315-400 nm wavelength) or UV-B (280-315 nm wavelength) light waves. UV-A, combined with psoralen, a drug taken orally, is known as <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatment.</b> In UVB phototherapy the exposure time is very short, seconds to minutes depending on intensity of lamps and the person's skin pigment and sensitivity. The time is controlled with a timer that turns off the lamps after the treatment time ends.|$|E

In this study we tried to evaluate a new method of administering PUVA therapy wearing a fabric. AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of PUVA administration with and without wearing clothes in psoriasis. METHOD: We first found the UV transmissibility of plain woven, lightweight cream colored cotton fabric with 30 x 30 threads per square cm. area and calculated its sun protection factor (SPF). A single blind, randomized, comparative, clinical trial was then conducted on 21 patients with psoriasis vulgaris who were treated with bath PUVA. The study group received ultraviolet light while wearing a gown made up of the above cotton fabric and the control group received ultraviolet light without wearing the gown. The study group was given an UV dose higher in proportion to the SPF of the worn fabric so that blockage caused by cloth could be neutralized. The cloth-uncovered areas were covered with a sunscreen. UVA from artificial light source was used for better patient monitoring. RESULTS: After 12 <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatments</b> both the treatments were found to be equally effective, and there were no differences in the side effects. Conclusion: Thus we conclude that PUVA can be given wearing a fabric provided the UV dosage is increased proportional to the SPF of the fabric. The same fabric may be used for PUVASOL therapy...|$|R
40|$|Controversy exists {{whether the}} {{initiating}} events in psoriasis are primarily epidermal or dermal (vascular). To study this point, serial biopsies from 6 patients {{were taken from}} the periphery of individual plaques before, and at 1 to 3 day intervals during, Goeckerman and <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatments.</b> Part of the biopsy was studied by electron microscopy to determine the fine structure of the capillary loops and part was incubated with tritiated thymidine to determine the labeling index (LI) of the basal cells. Normal appearing buttock skin of 11 other psoriatic patients not under treatment was studied by identical methods. In 4 of the 6 treated patients, the capillary loops began to return toward normal 3 to 8 days before the LI began to decrease. Two patients did not show a return toward normal of either capillaries or LI during the period of the experiment. The LI was elevated in the normal appearing buttock skin of 6 of 11 untreated psoriatics. In 4 of the 6, the loops were normal arterial capillaries. We did not observe abnormal (venous) capillaries associated with a normal LI in the other 5 untreated patients. These data support the concept that the initiating factors in psoriasis are in the epidermis, but epidermal hyperplasia cannot occur without vascular proliferation.

40|$|Sunlight and {{psoralen}} and ultraviolet A (PUVA) are {{risk factors}} {{for the development of}} squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and, to a lesser extent, basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy, used for the treatment of psoriasis, might also increase the risk of these tumors. We studied the relation of skin cancer incidence to UVB use among 1380 adult subjects enrolled in a long-term safety trial of PUVA therapy. We used negative binomial regression models to quantify the association between UVB and the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), controlling for known confounders. High UVB exposure (≥ 300 treatments vs < 300 treatments) was associated with a modest but significant increase in SCC (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 03 – 1. 83) and BCC (adjusted IRR= 1. 45, 95 % CI= 1. 07 – 1. 96) risk. Among patients with < 100 <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatments,</b> high UVB exposure was significantly associated with the development of SCC (adjusted IRR= 2. 75, 95 % CI= 1. 11 – 6. 84) and BCC (adjusted IRR= 3. 00, 95 % CI= 1. 30 – 6. 91) on body sites typically exposed to UVB therapy but not on chronically sun-exposed sites typically covered during therapy. For adults with high UVB exposure levels, UVB confers a modest increase in NMSC risk, much less than that observed with PUVA.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a non-Hodgkin's T-cell {{lymphoma}} of {{the skin}} that often begins as limited patches and plaques with slow progression to systemic involvement. Narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B therapy has been proven {{to be an effective}} short-term treatment modality for clearing patch-stage MF. The effect of psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet A (<b>PUVA)</b> in the <b>treatment</b> of patch- and plaque-type MF has also been thoroughly documented. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the efficacy and safety of narrowband UVB and PUVA in patients with early-stage MF. METHODS: We analysed the response to treatment, relapse-free survival and irradiation dose in 114 patients with histologically confirmed early-stage MF (stage IA, IB and IIA). RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were treated with PUVA (83. 3 %) and 19 with narrowband UVB (16. 7 %). With PUVA, 59 patients (62. 1 %) had a complete response (CR), 24 (25. 3 %) had a partial response (PR) and 12 (12. 6 %) had a failed response. Narrowband UVB led to CR in 12 (68. 4 %) patients, PR in 5 (26. 3 %) patients and a failed response in 1 (5. 3 %) patient. There were no differences in terms of time to relapse between patients treated with PUVA and those treated with narrowband UVB (11. 5 vs. 14. 0 months respectively; P = 0. 816). No major adverse reactions were attributed to the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that phototherapy is a safe, effective and well-tolerated, first-line therapy in patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with prolonged disease-free remissions being achieved. It suggests that narrowband UVB is at least as effective as <b>PUVA</b> for <b>treatment</b> of early-stage MF. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The effect of <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatment</b> on cutaneous mast cells in mice was investigated by using giant granules of mast cells from C 57 BL/ 6 -bgJ/bgJ (Chediak-Higashi syndrome) mice as a marker. C 57 BL/ 6 -+/+ mice were lethally irradiated and rescued by bone marrow transplantation from C 57 BL/ 6 -bgJ/bgJ mice.

All publications referring to the US prospective PUVA follow-up study revealed an increased risk of NMSC with the following characteristics: risk most pronounced for squamous cell carcinomas developing even with low exposures and increasing linearly with the number of sessions, tumors occurring also on non-exposed skin including invasive penile tumors, risk persisting after cessation of treatment. An increased risk of basal cell carcinomas was observed in patients receiving more than hundred PUVA sessions. The four prospective European studies selected in our review and most of the pre- 1990 European and US retrospective studies failed to find a link between exposure to PUVA and skin cancer. Only the most recent cohorts, including three large long-term retrospective European studies comparing records with their respective national cancer registries reported on an independent increased risk of NMSC with PUVA, The risk was lower as compared to the US prospective PUVA follow-up study. Six studies assessed the risk of melanoma following PUVA therapy: two of the three US publications coming from the same PUVA prospective follow-up study revealed an increased risk with more than doubled incidence of both invasive and in situ melanoma among patients exposed to at least 200 <b>PUVA</b> <b>treatments</b> compared with patients exposed to lower doses, whereas the three retrospectives European studies, comparing the incidence of melanoma in PUVA users with national cancer registers, did not find any increased risk of melanoma. No increased risk of skin cancer was evidenced in the four studies specifically assessing the potential carcinogenic risk of NB-UVB. CONCLUSION: There is an increased risk of skin cancer following PUVA, shown by both US and European studies. The greater risk measured by the US studies may be at least partly explained by high UVA dose exposure and the lighter phototypes of the treated patients. The lack of prospective studies in psoriasis patients treated with NB-UVB constitutes a barrier to the robust assessment of carcinogenic risk of this phototherapy technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of therapies which are selective for tumor tissues {{is one of}} the most important goals in anticancer research. Within this framework photochemotherapy can be considered a very promising approach. Its therapeutic effectiveness depends on two connected factors: drug and light. The drug (photosensitizer) is able to exert an antiproliferative effect only after interaction with suitable light. Both the photosensitizing drug and light alone are ineffective at doses used for these treatments. Nowadays, photochemotherapy is used in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and cavitary tumors. In the first case the photosensitizer is a psoralen derivative (P) and long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA) is used (PUVA therapy). In the second case, the treatment with porphyrins, porphyrin-based and non porphyrin-based photosensitizers is followed by irradiation with 600 - 1000 nm light (photodynamic therapy, PDT). This review is concerned with <b>PUVA</b> and PDT <b>treatments</b> of cancer. The molecular mechanisms considered accountable for the photochemotherapeutic effects are discussed, the {{development of}} new chemical structures aimed at improving the effectiveness and/or overcoming some undesired side effects will also be reported. Moreover, some clinical applications will be described...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) and photopheresis is not entirely understood. These therapies {{are assumed to be}} immunomodulating partly by gradually decreasing leukocyte viability. We investigated whether this delayed form of cell death was due to apoptosis. Untreated and treated (PUVA exposed) leukocytes obtained from six patients with systemic sclerosis and (untreated) leukocytes from healthy control individuals were studied. Qualitative gel electrophoresis and quantitative in situ nick translation analysis of DNA fragmentation was performed. Apoptosis of the treated cells did occur (gel electrophoresis) after 24 h. At t = 0 h, immediately after exposure to PUVA, {{there was no evidence of}} DNA fragmentation in the treated cells. The percentage of treated cells undergoing apoptosis was 20 - 55 % at t = 24 h (in situ nick translation). The untreated leukocytes of the patients and the healthy individuals showed no distinctive rise in apoptotic cells. Apoptosis of the leukocytes after <b>PUVA</b> or photopheresis <b>treatment</b> might be a {{mechanism of}} action and might explain the therapeutic respons...|$|R
