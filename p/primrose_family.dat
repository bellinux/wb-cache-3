2500|$|The western American {{plant genus}} Clarkia (in the evening <b>primrose</b> <b>family</b> Onagraceae), {{is named after}} him, as are the {{cutthroat}} trout (Oncorhynchus clarki [...] ), and Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), a large passerine bird, in the family Corvidae. [...] All were species which Clark identified during the expedition. Clark's grebe (Aechmophorus clarkii [...] ) was not named for William Clark, but for J.H. Clark who collected the first specimen.|$|E
6000|$|Besides the <b>primrose</b> <b>family,</b> {{many other}} plants of several {{distinct}} natural orders present similar phenomena, {{one or two}} of the most curious of which must be referred to. The beautiful crimson flax (Linum grandiflorum) has also two forms, the styles only differing in length; and in this case Mr. Darwin found by numerous experiments, which have since been repeated and confirmed by other observers, that each form is absolutely sterile with pollen from another plant of its own form, but abundantly fertile when crossed with any plant of the other form. In this case the pollen of the two forms cannot be distinguished under the microscope (whereas that of the two forms of Primula differs in size and shape), yet it has the remarkable property of being absolutely powerless on the stigmas of half the plants of its own species. The crosses between the opposite forms, which are fertile, are termed by Mr. Darwin [...] "legitimate," [...] and those between similar forms, which are sterile, [...] "illegitimate"; and he remarks that we have here, within the limits of the same species, a degree of sterility which rarely occurs except between plants or animals not only of different species but of different genera.|$|E
60|$|In a {{grotesque}} squareness of outline, and impossibility of perspective, {{they are not}} unlike the woodcuts in old books; but they were oil-paintings, and the artist, like the painter of the <b>Primrose</b> <b>family,</b> had not been sparing of his colours. In one, a lady was having a toe amputated--an operation which a saintly personage had sailed into the room, upon a couch, to superintend. In another, a lady was lying in bed, tucked up very tight and prim, and staring with much composure at a tripod, with a slop-basin on it; the usual form of washing-stand, and the only piece of furniture, besides the bedstead, in her chamber. One would never have supposed her to be labouring under any complaint, beyond the inconvenience of being miraculously wide awake, if the painter had not hit upon {{the idea of putting}} all her family on their knees in one corner, with their legs sticking out behind them on the floor, like boot-trees. Above whom, the Virgin, on a kind of blue divan, promised to restore the patient. In another case, a lady was in the very act of being run over, immediately outside the city walls, by a sort of piano-forte van. But the Madonna was there again. Whether the supernatural appearance had startled the horse (a bay griffin), or whether it was invisible to him, I don't know; but he was galloping away, ding dong, without the smallest reverence or compunction. On every picture 'Ex voto' was painted in yellow capitals in the sky.|$|E
50|$|In 1919, <b>Primrose's</b> <b>family</b> {{moved to}} London, {{and he began}} to study violin at the Guildhall School of Music in London on scholarship, where he would later be named Fellow. Primrose {{graduated}} in 1924, having received its highest honor, a gold medal, although he admitted that he skipped some of his classes because the violin did not interest him.|$|R

50|$|Camissoniopsis pallida {{is a low}} growing, yellow-flowered annual {{plant in}} the evening <b>{{primrose}}</b> (Onagraceae) <b>family.</b> It is known by the common names pale primrose or pale yellow suncup. It is native to the desert and scrub habitat of the region where Arizona, California, and Nevada meet. It is a roughly hairy annual herb growing in a low patch on the ground, sometimes producing an erect stem from the basal rosette. The herbage is gray-green to reddish green. The leaves are lance-shaped and up to 3 centimeters long. The nodding inflorescence produces flowers with yellow petals 2 to 13 millimeters long, each with small red markings near the bases. The fruit is a straight to tightly coiled capsule.|$|R

50|$|Its larvae {{feed upon}} various {{plants in the}} olive family (Oleaceae) such as lilacs (Syringa spp.), ashes (Fraxinus spp.), and privet (Ligustrum vulgare). Mature {{caterpillars}} pupate in subterranean chambers when they have finished feeding, and here the pupae stay dormant until the next year. The moth emerges any time from May to August in the South, but is only found from June to July farther north. Adults feed at dusk on deep-throated flowers and have been sighted at honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.), evening <b>primroses</b> (in the <b>family</b> Onagraceae), dogbane (Apocynum spp.), phlox (Phlox spp.), and bouncing bet (Saponaria officinalis).|$|R
6000|$|The {{story is}} that of a certain vicar, or clergyman, Dr. <b>Primrose</b> and his <b>family,</b> who pass through heavy trials and misfortunes. These might crush or embitter an {{ordinary}} man, but they only serve to make the Vicar's love for his children, his trust in God, his tenderness for humanity, shine out more clearly, like star's after a tempest. Mingled with these affecting trials are many droll situations which probably reflect something of the author's personal escapades; for Goldsmith {{was the son of a}} clergyman, and brought himself and his father into his tale. As a novel, that is, a reflection of human life in the form of a story, it contains many weaknesses; but despite its faults of moralizing and sentimentality, the impression which the story leaves is one of [...] "sweetness and light." [...] Swinburne says that, of all novels he had seen rise and fall in three generations, The Vicar of Wakefield alone had retained the same high level in the opinion of its readers.|$|R
60|$|Briefly, The Vicar of Wakefield is {{the story}} of a simple English clergyman, Dr. <b>Primrose,</b> and his <b>family,</b> who pass from {{happiness}} through great tribulation. Misfortunes, which are said never to come singly, appear in this case in flocks; but through poverty, sorrow, imprisonment, and the unspeakable loss of his daughters, the Vicar's faith in God and man emerges triumphant. To the very end he is like one of the old martyrs, who sings Alleluia while the lions roar about him and his children in the arena. Goldsmith's optimism, it must be confessed, is here stretched to the breaking point. The reader is sometimes offered fine Johnsonian phrases where he would naturally expect homely and vigorous language; and he is continually haunted by the suspicion that, even in this best of all possible worlds, the Vicar's clouds of affliction were somewhat too easily converted into showers of blessing; yet he is forced to read on, and at the end he confesses gladly that Goldsmith has succeeded in making a most interesting story out of material that, in other hands, would have developed either a burlesque or a brutal tragedy. Laying aside all romantic passion, intrigue, and adventure, upon which other novelists depended, Goldsmith, in this simple story of common life, has accomplished three noteworthy results: he has made human fatherhood almost a divine thing; he has glorified the moral sentiments which cluster about the family life as the center of civilization; and he has given us, in Dr. Primrose, a striking and enduring figure, which seems more like a personal acquaintance than a character in a book.|$|R
