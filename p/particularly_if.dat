5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E

5|$|Breech-loading guns {{seemed to}} offer {{important}} advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> the gun then {{needed to be}} re-aimed. The Warriors Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.|$|E
5|$|Defences to tracing are possible, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> {{returning}} the property would harm an innocent defendant, where the claimant has made false {{representations that the}} defendant relied on to his detriment, or where the property has been transferred to an innocent third party without anything given to the defendant in return that the claimant could recover in lieu.|$|E

5|$|In {{countries}} like Canada {{it is possible}} that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> no events were observed; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature, or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|TSH {{levels are}} {{considered}} the most sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction. They are however not always accurate, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> the cause of hypothyroidism {{is thought to be}} related to insufficient TRH secretion, in which case it may be low or falsely normal. In such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH levels are measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted.|$|E
5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, {{protruding}} ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the first case report in 1881.|$|E

5|$|Tin(II) chloride, {{also known}} as stannous chloride, is a white {{crystalline}} solid with the formula 2. It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> hot. SnCl2 is widely used as a reducing agent (in acid solution), and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating. Tin(II) chloride {{should not be confused}} with the other chloride of tin; tin(IV) chloride or stannic chloride (SnCl4).|$|E
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> {{it is interesting}} and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> a dentist's or oral surgeon's {{instructions}} are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E
