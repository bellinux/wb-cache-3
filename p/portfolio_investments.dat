5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a {{problematic}} {{period for the}} Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, many of its productions were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s {{to work on their}} licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments</b> increased.|$|E

In addition, we find that an increase in labour input costs reduces both net direct <b>investment</b> and net <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> Further, an increase in fixed capital productivity increases net direct investment. Further, also the results illustrate that subsidies increase both net direct <b>investment</b> and net <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> Moreover, an increase in exports increases both net direct <b>investment</b> and net <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> Policy recommendations are thus proposed that may increase foreign direct investment in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the short term effect of non-residents’ <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> on nominal {{exchange}} rate in Turkey by using Vector Autoregression (VAR) methods. The analyses were performed with data consisting of 361 observations weekly, covering between 14. 01. 2005 and 30. 12. 2011. Two variables are used in the scope of the analyses. The first variable is the non-residents’ <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> and the second variable is nominal exchange rate. At the end of Granger causality analysis, it is seen that non-residents’ <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> is causality of nominal exchange rate. Secondly, impulse-response analysis was performed and seen that nominal exchange rate initial reaction to shock in the non-residents’ <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> is negative and significant statistically.

Whether <b>Portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> is good or not to the development for the Chinese banks or what the <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> conditions are in Chinese land. The researches on this topic are very rare at present. As the Bank of China was established in 1912 {{and it is the}} most glorious bank in Chinese history, being also one of the biggest international banks with a most abundant capital strength which was evaluated by British magazine "Banker". Simultaneously it was also evaluated by the magazine Fortune as one of 500 formidable enterprises in the world. So the research chooses the Bank as the object and hoping through the case study of it, to give a macro-view of the overall Chinese financial field on the topic of <b>investment</b> <b>portfolio.</b> The research will focus on four questions: What are the systematic risks and non-systematic risks for banks in China?

Based on {{quarterly}} {{data for the}} period 1985 to 2012, this study analyses the effect of Foreign <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Investment</b> on {{the growth of the}} South African economy. In order to support the country’s economic growth, South Africa needs foreign capital in the form of foreign capital flows and these include both foreign direct <b>investment</b> and foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> Given the low national savings rate in South Africa, foreign portfolio inflows {{play an important role in}} the sustenance of higher levels of investment and growth. The study employed the Johansen Cointegration technique to analyse the long-run relationship and the Vector Error Correction Model for the short-term interaction between variables. The long-run results illustrated that there is a negative relationship between Gross Domestic Product and foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> However in the short run the results indicate a positive relationship between foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> and gross domestic product. These results are supported by the Granger causality test which shows that foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> Granger causes Gross domestic product. The findings from the study suggest that authorities should take advantage of foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> in the short run.

After controlling for the endogeneity of foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> instability, as well as for firm-, industry-, and country-level characteristics such as GDP growth, as well as the levels of foreign <b>portfolio</b> and direct <b>investment,</b> the author finds that the volatility of foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> is only significantly associated with a decreased ability to issue publicly-traded securities for small firms in years when nations are considered less"creditworthy. "The volatility of foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> only hinders the growth of small firms significantly in periods when nations are deemed less"creditworthy.
