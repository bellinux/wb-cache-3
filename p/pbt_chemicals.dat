30|$|The {{chemicals}} registered under REACH {{include many}} former “existing chemicals” that are structurally (very) similar to acknowledged POPs (persistent organic pollutants) or <b>PBT</b> <b>chemicals</b> (chemicals that are persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic). Accordingly, these “emerging chemicals” share hazardous properties {{such as high}} persistence and bioaccumulation potential with the structurally related POPs and <b>PBT</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Examples are brominated aromatic substances placed on the market as replacements of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs used as flame retardants; one replacement is decabromodiphenyl ethane, see below) and {{a large group of}} poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) placed on the market as replacements of the so-called long-chain PFASs such as PFOA or PFOS that were used, among others, in impregnating agents. These are cases of incremental substitution or regrettable substitution. Environmental chemists and ecotoxicologists need to use their extensive knowledge on legacy POPs and PBT substances in order to demonstrate, as quickly as possible, the environmental and health hazards associated with these “new” chemical products. Otherwise, the problems associated with the hazardous chemicals that have been banned (here: PBDEs, long-chain PFASs) will occur again and will then be perpetuated for many years and decades [8].|$|E

40|$|The {{impact that}} {{microplastics}} have on baleen whales {{is a question}} that remains largely unexplored. This study examined the interaction between free-ranging fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and microplastics by comparing populations living in two semi-enclosed basins, the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California, Mexico). The results indicate that a considerable abundance of microplastics and plastic additives exists in the neustonic samples from Pelagos Sanctuary of the Mediterranean Sea, and that pelagic areas containing high densities of microplastics overlap with whale feeding grounds, suggesting that whales are exposed to microplastics during foraging; this was confirmed by the observation of a temporal increase in toxicological stress in whales.

40|$|Lakes and {{reservoirs}} {{throughout the}} United States provide important sport fisheries and other recreational opportunities. Lake ecosystems also provide critical habitat for aquatic species and support wildlife populations {{that depend on}} aquatic species for food. Lakes and reservoirs occur {{in a variety of}} landscapes (e. g., urban, agricultural, and wilderness), and they can receive contaminants from several sources, including direct discharges into the water, air deposition, and agricultural or urban runoff. A group of contaminants of particular concern are the persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (<b>PBT)</b> <b>chemicals.</b> These contaminants are highly toxic, long-lasting chemicals that enter lakes and reservoirs and accumulate in the fish. They can reach levels that affect the health of people and wildlife that eat fish from these environments.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} sense of urgency among {{scientists}} and environmental policy-makers concerning the need for improving the scientific foundation supporting international regulations for identifying and evaluating persistent,bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) substances and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment. The current national and international regulations define PBTs and POPs in terms of fairly strict criteria that are based {{on the state of the}} science in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. Since then, an evolution in the state of the science has produced new insights into PBT substances and an array of new methods to identify <b>PBT</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The development of regulatory criteria has not kept up with the rapid development in environmental chemistry and toxicology, and as a result, scientists often find themselves in the situation where guidance on PBT and POPs criteria is limited and, in some respects, out of date.

The OECD principles for QSAR model validation have established crucial points for prediction reliability, mainly model reproducibility, external predictivity and applicability domain checking. Particular attention must be paid to QSAR models’ predictive performance, when the models are applied to the screening of large chemical sets, the specific aim being to focus on the most hazardous to prioritize them for experimental tests. Different approaches for splitting the available experimental data sets and various statistical parameters can be used to verify a model’s external predictivity.

All of the available data were evaluated (see Additional file 1), and then, on the basis of strengths of the studies, those studies that provided the most robust data were selected for inclusion in the assessment of the PBT properties of CPY. Studies conducted under non-relevant conditions were then excluded to provide the most robust and relevant data for the characterization.

In the context of screening and priority-setting tools for PBT-assessment, the cumulative PBT Index model, implemented in QSARINS (QSAR-INSUBRIA), new software for the development and validation of multiple linear regression QSAR models, offers a new holistic approach to identify <b>chemicals</b> with cumulative <b>PBT</b> properties directly from their molecular structure. In this study the Insubria PBT Index in QSARINS was applied to screen and prioritize various datasets, containing a large variety of chemicals of heterogeneous molecular structure previously screened by various authors by different methods, for their potential PBT behaviour. Particular attention was devoted to the model Applicability Domain, using different approaches such as Descriptors Range, Leverage, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the modeling molecular descriptors, in order to discriminate between interpolated and extrapolated predictions. The results of this screening, which is based only on the molecular structure features and is not dependent on single threshold values for P, B and T, were compared with those obtained by the on-line US-EPA PBT Profiler. Good agreement between the various approaches was found, supporting the utility of a consensus approach in priority-setting studies. The main discrepancies have been highlighted and commented on. Moreover, a priority list containing the most hazardous compounds identified in agreement between the two tools has been drafted.

The SETAC Advisory Group on Bioaccumulation Assessment (B-SAG) has a proven record of stimulating the incorporation of sound science within regulatory contexts by providing excellent forums for exchange of information and collaboration between scientists from government, industry and academia, and for creating a friendly environment where novel research and young scientists find warm welcome. For the 17 th Annual Meeting, the B-SAG organised two oral sessions and two poster corners, which attracted ~ 60 abstracts and considerable attention at the meeting. The sessions were logically organised around the main themes of in vitro/modelling approaches and lab/field studies, and gave a forum to presenters from two continents, equally eager to share experience and move the science forward. Here we share top lines from the platform presentations. JRC. I. 3 -Toxicology and chemical substance...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of various agents, including humic materials, nanomaterials, microplastics, or simply specific chemical compounds, may cause {{changes in the}} apparent persistence, bioaccumulation, and/or toxicity (<b>PBT)</b> of a <b>chemical</b> compound leading to an either increased or decreased PBT characteristics and thus an increased or decreased hazard evaluation. In the present paper, a series chloro-containing obsolete pesticides is studied as an illustrative example. Partial order methodology is used to quantify how changed P, B, or T characteristics of methoxychlor (MEC) influences {{the measure of the}} hazard of MEC, relative to the other 11 compounds in the series investigated. Not surprisingly, an increase in one of the three indicators (P, B, or T) lead to an increased average order and thus an increased relative hazard {{as a result of a}} synergistic effect. A decrease in one of the indicator values analogously causes a decreased average order/relative hazard through an antagonistic effect; the effect, however, being less pronounced. It is further seen that the effect of changing the apparent value of the three indicators is different. Thus, persistence apparently is more important that bioaccumulation which again appears more important than toxicity, which is in agreement with previous work. The results are discussed with reference to the European chemicals framework on registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals (REACH) framework...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic and non-aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{differ with}} regards to metabolism as well as exposure and uptake routes. Current international and European regulatory criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity (<b>PBT)</b> assessment of <b>chemical</b> substances are mainly based on toxicity and bioaccumulation data in aquatic species. In the literature, {{there is evidence that}} several persistent organic chemicals, which are not classified as bioaccumulative and/or toxic in aquatic organisms according to existing criteria, can biomagnify in non-aquatic food chains up to the top predators (including humans) and exert their toxicity. Therefore, the regulatory frameworks may fail to identify a number of substances that are bioaccumulative and/or toxic in non-aquatic organisms and related food chains (exposed through soil and food), but not in aquatic species. Based on these considerations, two reports were prepared on available criteria for non-aquatic organisms within PBT/vPvB frameworks: one on bioaccumulation assessment (Part I) and one on toxicity assessment (Part II). Specifically, the present document illustrates and discusses the outcomes of a regulatory and literature review on available criteria for bioaccumulation assessment in non-aquatic organisms at international and European level (Part I). This report could be used to support an eventual revision of guidance documents, e. g. for REACH (EU Regulation 1907 / 2006), as well as to promote the harmonisation of regulatory criteria for PBT/vPvB assessment.
