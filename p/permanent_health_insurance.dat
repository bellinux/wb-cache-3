40|$|Using matched {{data from}} the 1996 to 2004 Current Population Survey (CPS), we examine racial {{patterns}} in annual transitions {{into and out of}} <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. We first decompose racial differences in static <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage rates into group differences in transition rates into and out of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. The low rate of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage among African-Americans is due almost entirely to higher annual rates of losing <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> than whites. Among the uninsured, African-Americans have similar rates of gaining <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> in the following year as whites. Estimates from the matched CPS also indicate that the lower rate of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage among Asians is almost entirely accounted for by a relatively high rate of losing <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> In contrast to these findings, differences in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage between Latinos and whites are due to group differences in both the rate of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss and gain. Using logit regression estimates, we also calculate non-linear decompositions for the racial gaps in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss and gain. We find that two main factors are responsible for differences in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss between working-age whites and minorities: job loss and education level. Higher rates of job loss account for 30 percent of the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> gap for African-Americans and Asians, and 16 percent of the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> gap for Latinos. Lower levels of education explain roughly 15 percent of the gap for African-Americans and Latinos (Asians' higher levels of education serve to close the gap). Higher rates of welfare and SSI participation among African-Americans also serve to widen the gap in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss by 8 percent. race, <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> insurance dynamics...|$|R

Two of the criteria, commercial skills and technical skills, showed significant differences. The results of this research provide support for the importance of relationship marketing within this sector of the insurance market.

40|$|In my thesis, I {{deal with}} the issue of {{perception}} of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies in the South Bohemian Region. That is, how South Bohemian citizens perceive <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies and whether they are satisfied with the services that <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies provide. In the theoretical part, I present basic information about public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system in the Czech Republic. I mention the history of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> evolution, its systems, and principles of its operation. I also deal with legislature which is the cornerstone of this system. Most of the laws were passed in the 1990 ?s when the Czech Republic began to develop the current version of <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Since its inception, these laws have been amended several times. Public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system in our country is based on the Bismarck model, which is based on the existence of multiple <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies and contractual relationships between <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies and <b>health</b> care facilities. Furthermore, the theoretical part refers about <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies as such, whose activities are governed by Act No. 551 / 1991 Coll., on the General <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Company, and Act No. 280 / 1992 Coll., on departmental, professional, occupational and other <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. The practical part describes the results of my research focused on the aforementioned issue of perception of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies in the South Bohemian Region. The results have been obtained through quantitative analysis. The method of questioning, the technique of questionnaires, was used. In this research, two of three assumed hypotheses have been confirmed. The research shows that <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> clients in the South Bohemian Region are satisfied with local and time availability of their <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> company subsidiaries. Furthermore, the research carried out shows that citizens respect the opinion of their general practitioners on the selection of their <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> company.

When such application is anticipated or requested, the medical record should be prepared and appropriate consultation obtained. Subjective issues should be identified and addressed.
