5|$|Juan Leyrado {{played a}} {{grandfather}} {{for the first}} time in his career. Unlike the usual telenovela grandfather (a secondary character), his character has a prominent role and his own story arcs. Leyrado, who was 60 years old when the series was made, said that he was still active in his personal life and played the character according to his own experiences. Korean-Argentine Chang Kim Sung, who played Walter Mao, said he was <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> his character did not conform to stereotypes of Asian people.|$|E
5|$|Over dinner, Leslie tells Dave {{that she}} will not move to San Diego with him, as her life is in Pawnee. Dave, {{although}} sad, understands her choice and the two split up amicably. At Pawnee's tree lighting ceremony, Leslie is congratulated by everyone, including Leslie's mother Marlene, who is <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> her daughter successfully fought off the media. Leslie returns to {{work the next day}} much to Ron's immense relief, as he could barely handle just a portion of her daily duties. Everyone is visibly glad that Leslie is back.|$|E
5|$|Shelley wrote eleven poems for Jane {{during that}} time. She {{served as the}} primary {{inspiration}} for the last poems that he wrote before his death. This did not bother Edward; he was <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> his wife inspired such poetry. Some biographers of Shelley have maintained that Shelley's feelings for Jane were strictly platonic, although different scholars have observed themes of frustrated sexual desires in Shelley's poetry during this period. Other critics have noted that Shelley's poems during this period struggle to define his feelings.|$|E

5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E

He {{is said to have}} asked the name of the Postmaster General, and, when told it was Lord John Manners, replied, “Tell those fools in the Post Office that if his Lordship don’t know me, I don’t know manners”.|$|E

25|$|After Leo's arrest, Kira finds Andrei {{preparing}} for a speech to a Communist Party meeting. She declares she is <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> she did what was necessary to save Leo's life, and she expresses contempt for the Communist ideology that would have let him die. Andrei says he understands and accepts responsibility for making her suffer. When she leaves, Andrei confronts Syerov and insists that he use his influence to secure Leo's release. When Andrei gives his speech, he deviates from his prepared remarks to speak in favor of freedom and individualism.|$|E
25|$|At an {{unspecified}} time, Captain Britain and {{an army of}} British heroes defeated Mys-Tech in battle; the agency came close to sending all of Britain to hell {{in order to pay}} off their debts to Mephisto. Following the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. was secretly called in to clean up the remains of Mys-Tech's bases and technology as MI-13 didn't have the resources to do it. Brian was made a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s European Division. Years later, Pete Wisdom learned about this and sarcastically remarked he was <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> Brian was acting like him.|$|E
25|$|Australian war {{memorials}} are distinctive in {{that they}} commemorate not only the dead. Australians were <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour {{whether or not they}} made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit.|$|E

25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> he would not listen to people who had anything to say to him.|$|E
25|$|As {{the century}} ended, the natural-cement {{industry}} dominated the market. The Snyder family was <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> their cement {{had been used}} in the Brooklyn Bridge, an icon of the era. Beach built another new plant in the northeast corner of the property to handle demand. But the development of the cheaper Portland cement during that time period eventually toppled the Rosendale variety, whose market share dropped 90% {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. Local industrial magnate Samuel Coykendall eventually tried to salvage the Rosendale industry through mergers, combining all the local companies save the ones on the Snyder property into one. The Consolidated Rosendale Cement Company was no more successful than any of its component companies had been, and was in receivership by 1918.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{physical}} injuries, Hughes was <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> {{his mind was}} still working. As he lay in his hospital bed, {{he decided that he}} did not like the bed's design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and cold running water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments. The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. Despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed, Hughes' bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed. Hughes' doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous. Hughes, however, believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery, instead asserting the natural life-giving properties of fresh-squeezed orange juice were responsible.|$|E

25|$|Nobb {{suggests}} {{the only way}} the rebels can withstand Griffon is by rebuilding Paznos, a massive mobile fortress. Max and Monica travel to Heim Rada to begin restoring the origin point of the Gundorada Workshop. As they go about rebuilding the village, they are again attacked by the Death Ark. They confront Gaspard and he tells them he is just like them; fighting for a parent. He explains that his changeling father died when he was a child, and he and his mother (Rikako Aikawa/Samantha Newark) were run out of town. Eventually, she died, but beforehand, she told him he must find something worth protecting. Gaspard realizes he hasn't found such a thing, and now lives only for hatred. He tells them they must defeat Griffon, and asks if he can join them. However, the magic of Griffon turns him into a dragon and forces him to fight them. They reluctantly kill him. However, a child Gaspard is then shown meeting his mother in their old house, where she tells him she is <b>proud</b> <b>that</b> he found something worth protecting.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, Ellie of The Last of Us was {{initially}} received negatively in early focus tests.

Druckmann and Straley were surprised {{by some of the}} backlash in regards to gender roles in The Last of Us, although Druckmann noted that [...] "the more progress we make, the more those problems stand out". He declared it a [...] "misconception" [...] that female protagonists hinder game sales, evidenced by the success of The Last of Us.|$|E
500|$|The Max Weinberg 7 {{released}} a self-titled album in 2000 on Hip-O Records; Weinberg said {{he waited until}} then because [...] "I wanted to change my style of playing and hone my style before I committed to a record."
