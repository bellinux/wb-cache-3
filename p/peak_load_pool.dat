40|$|Abstract—The Ontario {{electrical}} grid is sized to meet <b>peak</b> electricity <b>load.</b> A reduction in <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> would allow deferring large infrastructural costs of additional power plants, thereby lowering generation cost and electricity prices. Proposed solutions for <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> reduction include demand response and storage. Both these solutions require accurate prediction of a home’s <b>peak</b> and mean <b>load.</b> Existing work has {{focused only on}} mean load prediction. We find that these methods exhibit high error when predicting <b>peak</b> <b>load.</b> Moreover, a home’s historic <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> and occupancy is a better predictor of <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> than observable physical characteristics such as temperature and season. We explore the use of Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARMA) for <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> prediction and find that it has 30 % lower {{root mean square error}} than best known prior methods.

40|$|Current energy {{distribution}} networks {{are often not}} equipped for facilitating expected sustainable transitions. Major concerns for future electricity networks are the possibility of <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> increases and the expected growth of decentralized energy generation. In this article, we focus on <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> increases; the effects of possible future developments on <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> are studied, together with the consequences for the network. The city of Eindhoven (the Netherlands) is used as reference city, for which a scenario is developed in which the assumed future developments adversely influence the maximum <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> on the network. In this scenario, the total electricity <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> in Eindhoven {{is expected to increase}} from 198 MVA in 2009 to 591 - 633 MVA in 2040. The necessary investments for facilitating the expected increased <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> are estimated at 305 - 375 million Euros. Based upon these projections, it is advocated that - contrary to current Dutch policy - choices regarding sustainable transitions should be made from the viewpoint of integral energy systems, evaluating economic implications of changes to generation, grid development, and consumption. Recently applied and finished policies on energy demand reduction showed to be effective; however, additional and connecting policies on energy generation and distribution should be considered on short term.

One major cost driver concerning electrical energy is often <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> management, motivated through <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> costs. <b>Peak</b> <b>loads</b> {{are caused by}} multiple production machines running energy intensive process patterns simultaneously. Although production planning assigns production tasks to certain time slots, the exact execution times - and therefore the times certain energy consumptions are conducted – are determined by shop floor control.

Thus hydro power stations are ending up to cater base <b>load</b> instead of <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> in non-monsoon months also (ex: Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, HP, J&K, Uttarakhand, etc.). TSO is responsible to ensure the provision of reserves (including spinning reserve for base load power plants by operating in frequency follow mode with upper & lower generation caps) that will allow for sudden contingencies by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each grid trading period. The available hydro power stations in a region/grid {{should be used to}} cater peaking load only at regional/national level. Using hydro power stations to cater <b>peak</b> <b>load,</b> would improve the peaking load capability of a regional/national grid and maintain safe grid frequency and network stability. The 24 hours duration of a day should be divided into four parts only (i.e. daytime <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period, daytime off <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period, nighttime <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period and nighttime off <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> period) instead of 96 number 15 minutes periods for commercially settling the power transactions to cater better to the <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> requirements within the safe frequency range.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of process {{parameters}} on the <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> and the energy absorption of the expansion of thin walled tubes using a die. The energy absorption and <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> during the expansion process were calculated for various punch angles (α) and with different expansion ratios (rp/ro) at different temperatures (T) by finite element analysis where rp is the punch outer radius and ro is the tube inner radius. The effect of these input parameters on the response parameters <b>peak</b> <b>load,</b> energy absorption and local buckling have been critically analyzed using Taguchi method. It is observed that the <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> and energy absorption of the expansion tube is influenced by expansion ratio (rp/ro), punch angle followed by tube temperature. The energy absorption of the expanded tube increases as the rp/ro ratio increases and also larger punch angle improves the energy absorption.

The accuracy of its prediction has great influence on the formulation of power generation plan, power grid dispatching, power grid operation and power supply reliability of power system. Therefore, it is of great significance to construct a suitable model to realize the accurate prediction of the daily <b>peak</b> <b>load.</b> A novel daily <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> forecasting model, CEEMDAN-MGWO-SVM (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise and Support Vector Machine Optimized by Modified Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm), is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the model uses the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm to decompose the daily <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> sequence into multiple sub sequences. Then, the model of modified grey wolf optimization and support vector machine (MGWO-SVM) is adopted to forecast the sub sequences. Finally, the forecasting sequence is reconstructed and the forecasting result is obtained. Using CEEMDAN can realize noise reduction for non-stationary daily <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> sequence, which makes the daily <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> sequence more regular. The model adopts the grey wolf optimization algorithm improved by introducing the population dynamic evolution operator and the nonlinear convergence factor to enhance the global search ability and avoid falling into the local optimum, which can better optimize the parameters of the SVM algorithm for improving the forecasting accuracy of daily <b>peak</b> <b>load.</b> In this paper, three cases are used to test the forecasting accuracy of the CEEMDAN-MGWO-SVM model.
