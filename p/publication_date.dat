The issue numbering was consecutive from 1 to 85, with no volume numbers. The first issue had a <b>publication</b> <b>date</b> of 1 January 1951, and the first eight issues had publication dates of the 1st and 15th of each month. From the ninth issue to the end Authentic maintained a completely regular monthly schedule; the <b>publication</b> <b>date</b> was given in the magazine as the 15th of each month from issue 9 through issue 73; thereafter the date was just given as the month and year.|$|E

5|$|Twin Books {{appealed the}} decision, and in March 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{reversed}} the original decision, {{stating that the}} novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was not in its home country's public domain when published, therefore the original <b>publication</b> <b>date</b> {{could not be used}} in arguing American copyright law. Instead, the 1926 <b>publication</b> <b>date,</b> the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States, is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America. As such, Anna Wyler's renewal was timely and valid, thereby upholding Twin Books' ownership of the copyright.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>publication</b> <b>date</b> neared, {{difficulties}} arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission}} to defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} of the diaries continued, and by June 1982 Gruner + Jahr possessed 35 volumes. In early 1983 the company took the decision to work towards a <b>publication</b> <b>date</b> for the diaries. To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, Stern issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties, Newsweek, Time, Paris Match and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch. Stern rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.|$|E

The English version was published as a hard cover by McClelland & Stewart while the French version was released by Montreal publishers, Les Editions de l'Homme, as a trade paperback. According to La Presse, 17,000 copies were printed; 5,000 sold in the first two weeks. In the Montreal market, the book was listed on the bestseller list at No. 6 for two weeks while the French version spent one week at No. 5.|$|E
5|$|The species, {{originally}} named Agaricus marginatus by the Danish naturalist Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher in 1803, {{has several}} synonyms. Elias Magnus Fries renamed it Agaricus aurantio-marginatus in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum, while Christiaan Hendrik Persoon called it Agaricus schumacheri in 1828. Although Schumacher had the earliest <b>publication</b> <b>date,</b> Fries's name is sanctioned, {{and so the}} specific epithet he used is given nomenclatural precedence. French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred the species to the genus Mycena in 1872. In 1930 Karel Cejp considered {{it to be a}} variety of Mycena elegans.|$|E

5|$|The {{authors and}} Barry Cunningham {{also decided to}} retitle the book Tunnels, to reflect {{that it had been}} changed by some limited editing. With the {{announcement}} of the <b>publication</b> <b>date,</b> and press coverage in the UK, the price of the original self-published books jumped dramatically, with one copy selling for £950. Tunnels was released in the UK as a softcover on 2 July 2007, and in the United States as a hardcover on 10 December 2007, and as a paperback on 1 February 2009. In Canada, the book was released as a paperback on 7 July 2007, as a hardcover on 1 January 2008, and a mass market paperback on 1 February 2009. In the United States, Tunnels had an initial printing of 100,000 copies. In February and March 2008 it appeared on The New York Times Children's Chapter Books Best Seller List.|$|E
5|$|When the two {{companies}} were unable to reach a solution, Twin Books filed suit against Disney for copyright infringement. Disney argued that because Salten's original 1923 publication of the novel {{did not include a}} copyright notice, by American law it was immediately considered a public domain work. It also argued that as the novel was published in 1923, Anna Wyler's 1954 renewal occurred after the deadline and was invalid. The case was reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which ruled that the novel was copyrighted upon its publication in 1923, and not a public domain work then. However, in validating 1923 as the <b>publication</b> <b>date,</b> this confirmed Disney's claim that the copyright renewal was filed too late and the novel became a public domain work in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Andre Norton Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen {{by members of}} the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees {{do not need to be}} members. Works are {{nominated}} each year between November15 and February15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. A SFWA panel of jurors determines if the nominated works are written for young adults, and they may add up to three works to the ballot. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the <b>publication</b> <b>date</b> of the work, which allowed works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.|$|E
5|$|Imagination was digest size (7.5×5.5inches or 19.1×14.0cm) for {{its first}} 17 issues, and then shrank {{slightly}} to a short digest size (7.25×5.5inches or 18.4×14.0cm) {{for the rest of}} its run, a further 46 issues. The volume number rose by one at the start of each calendar year, regardless of the number of issues. Volume 1, 1950, contained only two issues; subsequent volumes contained five to twelve issues, depending on frequency of publication. The overall issue number was printed on the spine (an unusual practice) along with the volume number. The first issue had a <b>publication</b> <b>date</b> of October 1950, and the schedule was bimonthly through the September 1952 issue except that June 1951 was followed by September 1951. The next four issues were dated October 1952, December 1952, January 1953 and February 1953, and then a monthly run began with April 1953 that lasted without a break until the July 1955 issue. The next issue was October 1955, which inaugurated another bimonthly period that ran with perfect regularity until the last issue, October 1958. The price remained at 35cents throughout.|$|E
