5|$|The Via Panisperna boys {{also noticed}} some unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to work}} better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that <b>paraffin</b> wax was effective at slowing neutrons, {{so he decided to}} try that. When neutrons were passed through <b>paraffin</b> wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the <b>paraffin.</b> Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the <b>paraffin.</b> Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E
5|$|All {{houses were}} built with marble-mantelpieced {{fireplaces}} and flues. All houses were supplied with running water supplied from the New River, which flowed through nearby Wood Green. However, not all houses were supplied with gas or mains electricity from the outset, the remainder being lit by candles or oil or <b>paraffin</b> lamps.|$|E
5|$|Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 <b>paraffin</b> (kerosene) {{and high}} test peroxide, a {{concentrated}} form of hydrogen peroxide. It was retired after only four launches {{in favour of}} using American Scout rockets, which the Ministry of Defence calculated to be cheaper than maintaining the Black Arrow programme.|$|E
50|$|Dehydrogenation of <b>paraffins</b> and olefins — <b>paraffins</b> such as n-pentane and {{isopentane}} can {{be converted}} to pentene and isopentene using chromium (III) oxide as a catalyst at 500 °C.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that crude oil is a complex mixture {{containing}} <b>paraffins,</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, resins, and asphaltenes. Among them, <b>paraffins</b> are considered as a major challenge, especially for the upstream petroleum industry. The solubility of high-molecular <b>paraffins</b> is strongly related to the temperature. With the decreasing temperature, these <b>paraffins</b> tend to precipitate and form stable wax crystals. The wax crystals will deposit on the pipe wall and/or transport with fluids, which would reduce the flowability of crude oils and plug pipelines or seize equipments, leading to costly downtime and expensive remediation techniques (Bacon et al. 2010; Bello et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Mineral <b>paraffins</b> {{are used}} as markers of {{contamination}} with mineral oils. Toxic effects are observed in Fisher 344 rats at concentrations of 0. 01 – 20 mg kg 1 bw, {{depending on the type}} of <b>paraffins</b> administered. Concerns arise about possible presence (in contaminated foods) of toxic aromatics and additives and for the ability of mineral <b>paraffins</b> to bioaccumulate also in human tissues. Olives and olive oils generally contain not detectable amounts of mineral <b>paraffins,</b> while all the olive oils analyzed were contaminated (6 – 30 mg kg 1 of mineral <b>paraffins).</b> Contamination levels exceeding 100 mg kg 1 were found in olive-pomace oils. Atmospheric fall-out and incorrect practices of pomace storage have been suggested to be the main sources of contamination. A conclusive proof of the mineral origin of the contamination was provided through hopane analysis...|$|R
5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of <b>paraffin</b> in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of <b>paraffin</b> in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick dropped all {{his other}} {{responsibilities}} {{to concentrate on}} proving {{the existence of the}} neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as <b>paraffin</b> wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E
5|$|The pews and the {{elevated}} pulpit {{date from the}} 19th century. The church has some marble memorials on the walls, dating from the 18th century, and a 15th-century octagonal font. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a bier from 1746, an oak communion table from about 1700, and an inscribed Elizabethan silver cup. <b>Paraffin</b> lamps are used to light the church, {{since there is no}} electricity connection.|$|E
30|$|Chlorinated <b>paraffins</b> (CPs) are the {{chlorinated}} semivolatile {{organic compounds}} {{with the highest}} production volume (1 million tonne/year), and were main substitutes for PCBs in open applications [315]. In May 2017, short-chain chlorinated <b>paraffins</b> (SCCPs) were listed as POPs under the Stockholm Convention, {{with a range of}} exempted uses [109]. For medium-chain chlorinated <b>paraffins</b> (MCCPs), a recent review also documented similar persistence and accumulation challenges [284]. Chlorinated <b>paraffins</b> bioaccumulate in meat/fat [316, 317] and might pose a risk for the future safe production of food from animal origin, considering their large use volumes in open applications and bioaccumulation potential. High levels of chlorinated <b>paraffins</b> (short-, medium- and long-chain chlorinated <b>paraffins)</b> have been detected in wildlife in China, accounting for more than 95 % of all POPs detected in the biota [318, 319]. CPs in sewage sludge are in the mg/kg range [320, 321], and are currently transferred to agricultural soils via this pathway, accumulating and eventually contaminating food-producing animals and wildlife. SCCPs and MCCPs are also transferred from food contact materials such as baking ovens [322] or food blenders [323] to food and human intake.|$|R
40|$|A splitless {{injection}} GC-FID {{method for}} determining mineral <b>paraffins</b> in food was set up. The method {{has been developed}} on vegetable oils and subsequently adjusted and applied to dried fruits, a food matrix not yet investigated {{from this point of}} view. The method avoids the saponification step foreseeing only a clean-up on silica gel SPE, and allows the quantification of mineral <b>paraffins</b> with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 15 mg kg- 1 and a detection limit (LOD) of 5 mg kg- 1 in the oils. LOQ and LOD for the analysis of dried fruit samples are respectively 1. 0 and 0. 3 mg kg- 1. Eighteen samples of dried fruit were analysed (apricots, plums, raisins, coconut, dates, mango, pineapple). Two samples of apricots showed high values of contamination, 23. 0 and 28. 2 mg kg- 1 of mineral <b>paraffins,</b> while all the other samples contained less than 6. 4 mg kg- 1 of mineral <b>paraffins</b> and in four samples mineral <b>paraffins</b> were undetectable...|$|R
30|$|In the {{original}} Marmul, the ratio is 0.75 while when processed this ratio decreases to 0.31. This suggests a conversion of highly branched <b>paraffins</b> into <b>paraffins</b> during the water-induced viscosity reduction, reflecting the dependency of viscosity on carbon chain length and branching.|$|R
5|$|The {{technology}} of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although human {{use of oil}} reaches to prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of <b>paraffin</b> in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The oil was moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.|$|E
5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of patient care for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating, or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and <b>paraffin</b> lamps were used in the operating room. It was difficult to retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with <b>paraffin</b> wax as a neutron moderator, and {{measured}} {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
40|$|Using isoreticular {{chemistry}} {{allows the}} design and {{construction of a new}} rare-earth metal (RE) fcu-MOF with a suitable aperture size for practical steric adsorptive separations. The judicious choice of a relatively short organic building block, namely fumarate, to bridge the 12 -connected RE hexanuclear clusters has afforded the contraction of the well-defined RE-fcu-MOF triangular window aperture, the sole access to the two interconnected octahedral and tetrahedral cages. The newly constructed RE (Y and Tb) fcu-MOF analogues display unprecedented total exclusion of branched <b>paraffins</b> from normal <b>paraffins.</b> The resultant window aperture size of about 4. 7 Å, regarded as a sorbate-size cut-off, enabled a complete sieving of branched <b>paraffins</b> from normal <b>paraffins.</b> The results are supported by collective single gas and mixed gas/vapor adsorption and calorimetric studies...|$|R
40|$|Utilization {{of normal}} and isoparaffins, {{separately}} and in mixtures, by a Trichosporon sp. was investigated. From {{a mixture of}} normal <b>paraffins</b> and isoparaffins, the organism consumed straight-chain <b>paraffins,</b> leaving the branched <b>paraffins</b> relatively unchanged. When offered separately, the highest utilization of n-alkanes by the organism was obtained {{in the range of}} undecane to octadecane; n-pentadecane was poorly utilized. From a mixture of n-alkanes, the rate of consumption of shorter-chain alkanes, n-decane to n-dodecane, was found to be relatively faster and more uniform than that of longer-chain alkanes...|$|R

5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in <b>paraffin</b> oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 <b>paraffin</b> (kerosene), burnt using high test {{peroxide}} as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and <b>paraffin</b> wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from <b>paraffin</b> wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E
5|$|Louis then targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is {{charmed by}} his wife, Edith.

5|$|The protests {{quickly turned}} to riots, with Hutu gangs {{moving through the}} {{district}} attacking Tutsi homes as they went. The violence at this stage consisting primarily of arson rather than killing, except {{in cases where the}} Tutsi tried to fight back. First in Ndiza and then across the country, Hutu burned Tutsi homes to the ground primarily by igniting <b>paraffin,</b> a product widely available in Rwanda for use in lamps. Made homeless, many Tutsi sought refuge in Catholic Church missions and with the Belgian authorities, while others crossed into Uganda and the Congo, beginning what would become a mass exodus {{by the end of the}} revolution. The arsonists recruited local peasants to their ranks, ensuring the rapid spread of the revolt. Many Hutu still believed that the king was superhuman, and claimed that they carried out the attacks on his behalf. By 9 November violence had spread across the country, except for Gitera's home province of Astrida (Butare) and the far southwest and east. Rioting was heaviest in the northwest; in Ruhengeri, every Tutsi home was destroyed by fire.|$|E
40|$|Catalytic {{cracking}} of n-octane and 2 -methylheptane, {{as well as}} {{mixtures of}} these <b>paraffins,</b> has been studied on HY and HZSAI- 5 zeolites, and also on combinations of the catalysts. For cracking on individual zeolites, both feedstock and catalyst influence the resulting product distributions. For all feedstocks, product distributions are shifted towards smaller fragments for reaction on HZSM- 5 compared to HY. Ratios of branched to linear <b>paraffins</b> are much more strongly influenced by catalyst type and feedstock than the corresponding ratios for olefinic products. For reactions on catalyst mixtures, distributions of the Iota I products by carbon number correspond well to a summation of contributions on the individual catalysts. However, a greater departure from prediction is seen for individual distributions of <b>paraffins,</b> olefins and aromatics, {{as well as for}} ratios of branched 10 lineal 2 ̆ 7 <b>paraffins,</b> showing that hydrogen transfer processes and isomerization must occur. The addition of pentasil has also resulted in enrichment of the linear saturates at 101 -, 2 ̆ 7 ercarbon number which is due to preferential cracking of linear <b>paraffins</b> over the branched isomers...|$|R
30|$|Products {{produced}} by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis are considered more environmentally friendly than their crude oil counterparts, as such products contain no sulphur, or metals, and consist mainly of linear <b>paraffins</b> and branched <b>paraffins</b> [8]. The presence of aromatic compounds in these fuels {{depends on the}} type of Fischer–Tropsch technology employed during the refining process.|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} with the RA catalyst, increased distance between Ni species and HZSM- 5 in mixing-bed and separating-bed leads to decrease {{of the interaction between}} them. The content of aromatics in the products of mixing-bed and separating-bed only have a little rise for the significant decrease of catalytic performance. Hydrogenation activity of Ni species also becomes weaker than that is in coupling-bed, which makes a decline of <b>paraffins</b> coming from saturation of olefins. However, HZSM- 5 can still catalyze the cracking of <b>paraffins</b> to a certain extent. Therefore, aromatization of olefins performs badly, and the percentage of <b>paraffins</b> in products drops down.|$|R
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (<b>paraffin</b> oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
