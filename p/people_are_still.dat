Their oral history says {{that some of their}} <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> there, and if they go back they {{will not be allowed to}} leave again. They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from Begho (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The old {{part of the}} town, Calais proper (known as Calais-Nord), is {{situated}} on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies {{to the south and}} south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy of Calais. It is arguably the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France. In this church former French President Charles de Gaulle married his wife Yvonne Vendroux. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the Hôtel-de-ville (the town hall), and the belfry from the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> employed in the lace industry for which the town is also famed.|$|E

Slavery dates back for centuries in Niger and was finally criminalised in 2003, after five years of lobbying by Anti-Slavery International and Nigerian human-rights group, Timidria.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland {{is part of}} the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), {{which was}} created to monitor the {{armistice}} between North and South Korea.

25|$|Historically, {{transsexualism}} {{has also}} {{been included in the}} American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With the DSM-5, transsexualism was removed as a diagnosis, and a diagnosis of gender dysphoria was created in its place. This change was made to reflect the consensus view by members of the APA that transsexuality is not in and of itself a disorder and that transsexual people should not be stigmatized unnecessarily. By including a diagnosis for gender dysphoria, transsexual <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> able to access medical care through the process of transition.|$|E
25|$|The Shang dynasty oracle bone {{script and}} the Zhou dynasty scripts found on Chinese bronze {{inscriptions}} {{are no longer}} used; the oldest script that is still in use today is the Seal Script (篆書(书), zhuànshū). It evolved organically out of the Spring and Autumn period Zhou script, and was adopted in a standardized form under the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. The seal script, as the name suggests, is now used only in artistic seals. Few <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> able to read it effortlessly today, although the art of carving a traditional seal in the script remains alive; some calligraphers also work in this style.|$|E
25|$|Turkey, only 75km away, had {{repeatedly}} claimed, for decades {{before the invasion}} and frequently afterwards, that Cyprus was of vital strategic importance to it. Ankara has defied a host of UN resolutions demanding the withdrawal of its occupation troops from the island. About 142,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north – nearly {{one quarter of the}} population of Cyprus – were forcibly expelled from the occupied northern part of the island where they constituted 80% of the population. These <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> deprived of the right {{to return to their homes}} and properties. U.S. Congress imposed an embargo on arms sales to Turkey leading to excessive tension and mistrust between Turkey and the United States.|$|E

25|$|After Valentino's {{remains were}} taken by train from New York to California, a second funeral was held on the West Coast, at the Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Valentino had no final burial {{arrangements}} and his friend June Mathis arranged a temporary solution when she offered a crypt that she had purchased for the husband that she had since divorced. Coincidentally, she died the following year and was interred in the adjoining crypt that she had purchased for herself; Valentino was never {{moved to a new}} location and he remained in the crypt next to Mathis. The two <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> interred side-by-side at Hollywood Forever Cemetery (originally Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery) in Hollywood, California.|$|E
25|$|Experts on {{the ground}} in Japan agree that mental health {{challenges}} are the most significant issue. Stress, such as that caused by dislocation, uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> concerned and worried. Behavioral changes can follow, including poor dietary choices, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation, all of which can have long-term negative health consequences. People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage was really the psychological stress of not knowing and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley's McKone.|$|E
25|$|For {{many of the}} vCJD patients, direct {{evidence}} exists that they had consumed tainted beef, and this {{is assumed to be}} the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it. Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of nervous system tissue with ground meat (mince) and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the human food chain in the 1980s. Although the BSE epizootic was eventually brought under control by culling all suspect cattle populations, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for prion diseases, which is typically measured in years or decades. As a result, {{the full extent of the}} human vCJD outbreak is still not known.|$|E

Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality {{to a greater extent than}} ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you can sit down and talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of the episode enjoyed the [...] "amusement park" [...] feel of the story. Gillian Anderson later noted, [...] "Because of all the magic, I was {{constantly}} being entertained. The difficulty with something like this is you have tendency to forget that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> having bad things happen to them." [...] Anderson later stated that, {{because many of the}} lines were written in a tongue-in-cheek style, she and David Duchovny said them in a humorous style; the two had to keep reminding themselves that the story revolved around a murder.|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} years Poulenc observed, [...] "if <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{interested}} in my music in 50 years' time {{it will be for}} my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels." [...] In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: [...] "both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias." [...] At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as [...] "a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 2½ stars; he praised the twist ending, but felt the film lacked a {{balanced}} story structure. [...] "The movie is great-looking. Rick Baker's makeup is convincing {{even in the}} extreme closeups, and his apes sparkle with personality and presence. The sets and locations give us a proper sense of alien awe," [...] Ebert commented. [...] "Tim Burton made a film that's respectful to the original, and respectable in itself, but that's not enough. Ten years from now, {{it will be the}} 1968 version that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> renting." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave a negative review. [...] "Call it a letdown, worsened by the forces of shoddy screenwriting. To quote Heston in both films, 'Damn them, damn them all'." ...|$|E
500|$|Carolyn Washburn, {{editor of}} the Ohio {{newspaper}} The Cincinnati Enquirer, stated that the incident [...] "raises important issues we hope will prompt conversations in families throughout our region." [...] Washburn had also received letters that derided the newspaper's use of Alcorn's chosen name in covering her death. When contacted by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Shane Morgan, the founder and chair of transgender advocate group TransOhio, stated that while 2014 witnessed gains for the trans rights movement, Alcorn's death illustrated how [...] "trans <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> being victimized and still being disrespected", highlighting {{the high rate of}} transgender people who had been murdered that year. Since the incident, TransOhio received letters from parents of transgender children describing how Alcorn's death had affected them. Morgan stated that while he understood the anger directed toward Alcorn's parents, [...] "there's no excuse for threats to the family." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} a decade later that the album started to receive almost {{unanimous}} praise from rock critics, many of whom made particular note of its influence in modern rock music. Christgau wrote in his 1977 retrospective review for The Village Voice that the record was difficult to understand in 1967, [...] "which is probably why <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> learning from it. It sounds intermittently crude, thin, and pretentious at first, but it never stops getting better". In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1998), Colin Larkin called it a [...] "powerful collection" [...] that [...] "introduced Reed's decidedly urban infatuations, a fascination for street culture and amorality bordering on voyeurism." [...] In April 2003, Spin led their [...] "Top Fifteen Most Influential Albums of All Time" [...] list with the album. On November 12, 2000, NPR included it in their [...] "NPR 100" [...] series of [...] "the most important American musical works of the 20th century". Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time in November 2003, calling it the most prophetic rock album ever made.|$|E
