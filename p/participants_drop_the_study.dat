40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects on attitudes toward {{hypnosis}} when it is introduced in three different ways to people who explicitly indicated {{that they did not}} want to be hypnotised. One hundred and ten participants (university students) were assigned to three experimental conditions, namely: minimum information control group, trance group, and cognitive-behavioural group. After hypnosis was introduced, those participants who agreed to continue were hypnotised and their suggestibility levels were assessed. The results revealed that trance explanation produces an attitudinal change, since a very high percentage of <b>participants</b> <b>dropped</b> out of <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Cognitive-behavioural explanation decreased the misconceptions that hypnosis makes people lose control over themselves and remains in the hands of the hypnotist. Thus, this explanation reduces the gullibility, the participant"s fear of being hypnotised, and changes the initial opposition to allow someone to hypnotise him/her. The trance explanation only proves to be superior by increasing the participants" interest in hypnosis. No differences between the three groups were found with respect to hypnotic suggestibility...|$|R

Over {{a period of}} almost 2 years, only eight of the 120 eligible patients were willing to enroll <b>the</b> <b>study</b> protocol. Further, four of <b>the</b> eight <b>participants</b> <b>dropped</b> out during <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> and approximately 20 - 30 % of the nocturnal EMG recordings failed.

Univariate and multiple regression analyses revealed that in three of the four patients, changes in nocturnal EMG activity were associated with the period of splint therapy. However, no associations were found between the changes in nocturnal EMG activity and the observed changes in muscle pain. In two patients, the changes in muscle pain were associated with the period of splint therapy and with the changes in psychological stress. Within the limitations of single-patient clinical trials, it can be concluded that changes in chronic masticatory muscle pain seem to be more related to changes in psychological stress than to those in parafunctional activities...|$|R
40|$|Background Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an {{evidence-based}} work rehabilitation {{model with}} well-documented effects {{for people with}} mental illness. The model has, however, never been tested out for people with chronic pain. This pilot study aimed to investigate chronic pain patients’ experiences with the IPS job support model. Methods We recruited eight consecutive patients referred for various chronic pain conditions at a hospital outpatient pain clinic. They were offered IPS job support as an integrated part of their interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation. The patients’ experiences were investigated through semi-structured interviews 3 months after inclusion in <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Results <b>The</b> participants reported mostly positive experiences with IPS. One <b>participant</b> <b>dropped</b> out of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> after deterioration of symptoms, while the remaining participants {{were satisfied with the}} intervention. Particular helpful aspects of the IPS intervention were the follow-up from the employment specialist, focus on competitive employment, focus on work despite pain complaints, reframing work into something positive, administrative support, and practice in writing applications. No participants reported adverse experiences from the IPS intervention. Within a 12 -months time frame, 3 of the 8 participants gained competitive employment. Conclusions This is the first report of the IPS model of supported employment applied in an outpatient setting for chronic pain patients.

This <b>study</b> evaluates <b>the</b> effects of a validated acupressure protocol for treating women with urodynamic stress incontinence. A randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with a before-and-after study design was conducted. Eighty-one women aged between 18 and 60 were recruited at a urogynecology clinic in an acute hospital in Hong Kong. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} an intervention (acupressure) group, a sham group, or a usual care (control) group. A validated acupressure protocol was employed in the intervention group. The intervention comprised three weekly sessions of 30 minutes each for a total of thirty sessions. Outcome measures included pelvic floor muscle strength, number of episodes of urine leakage over four days, self-reported severity of urine leakage, and responses on the Chinese version of the King's Health Questionnaire. No adverse effects were reported. Five percent of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>dropped</b> out of <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted, the results indicated significant differences in pelvic floor muscle strength across the three groups (H = 7. 05, p = 0. 03) and in self-reported severity of urine leakage between the intervention and control groups (Z = - 2. 48, p = 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology, manifesting as combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar syndrome and dysautonomia. Disease-modifying therapies are unavailable. Activation of microglia {{and production of}} toxic cytokines suggest a role of neuroinflammation in MSA pathogenesis. This pilot clinical trial evaluated safety and tolerability of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in MSA. METHODS: This was a single-arm interventional, single-center, open-label pilot study. Interventions included monthly infusions of the IVIG preparation Privigen(R), dose 0. 4 gram/kg, for 6 months. Primary outcome measures evaluated safety and secondary outcome measures evaluated preliminary efficacy of IVIG. Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) was measured monthly. Quantitative brain imaging using 3 T MRI was performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: Nine subjects were enrolled, and seven (2 women and 5 men, age range 55 - 64 years) completed the protocol. There were no serious adverse events. Systolic blood pressure increased during IVIG infusions (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Two <b>participants</b> <b>dropped</b> out from <b>the</b> <b>study</b> because of a non-threatening skin rash. The UMSARS-I (activities of daily living) and USMARS-II (motor functions) improved significantly post-treatment. UMSARS-I improved in all subjects (pre-treatment 23. 9 ± 6. 0 vs. post-treatment 19. 0 ± 5. 9 (p= 0. 01). UMSARS-II improved in 5 subjects, was unchanged in 1 and worsened in 1 (pre-treatment 26. 1 ± 7. 5 vs. post-treatment 23. 3 ± 7. 3 (p= 0. 025). The MR imaging results were not different comparing pre- to post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IVIG appears to be safe, feasible and well tolerated and may improve functionality in MSA.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to explore the developmental experience of novice play therapists. A review of the play therapy training literature {{as well as the}} counselor development literature suggested that there are characteristics such as patience, flexibility, and a love for children that are needed to work with children. Supervision was another aspect of training that appeared significant. Counselor development literature suggested that development takes place in stages that are not linear but fluid with trainees moving back and forth between stages during their training experience. There was little literature available. The play therapy training studies were mostly quantitative in nature. There were two studies that were self reports on a training model. The counselor development literature was both qualitative and quantitative in nature. The review of the literature suggested that there is further need for research. Qualitative research methods were utilized for this <b>study,</b> specifically <b>the</b> use of grounded theory methodology. Seven research participants responded to an email inquiry to play therapy professionals. One <b>participant</b> <b>dropped</b> out of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> after <b>the</b> first interview.

The interview data was coded and analyzed using grounded theory techniques. There were four major categories that emerged from the data. The data suggested that the participants experienced the development of a play therapy identity that includes their past experience and attributes as well as the development of new attributes, understanding their needs, experiencing emotions, developing confidence, and evaluating themselves. Self evaluation serves as a filter that assisted the participants in receiving instruction, interacting therapeutically, and growing through supervision.

Missouri Baptist University, Saint Louis, Missouri; e-mail: haleygrueber@gmail. com A {{method that}} is used to {{facilitate}} improvements in an individual’s aerobic fitness is altitude training. Most increases in aerobic fitness within altitude training are seen at 8, 000 to 10, 000 feet (Goods et al., 2014). The most recent device in altitude training is the Elevation Training Mask 2. 0. PURPOSE: Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the extent to which an individual’s aerobic fitness was increased while training with the Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 compared to a control group training without a mask. METHODS: Nine female participants’ (mean age = 21 years) ran a VO 2 Max test to measure their aerobic fitness baseline. Each participant was then randomized into either an experimental or control group. Both groups completed the same evidence-based High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) three days a week for four weeks. The experimental group wore the Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 during HIIT, while the control group wore no breathing apparatus. The resistance upon the mask was increased from 3, 000 feet to 6, 000 feet during week three of training. After four weeks of training, the participants’ aerobic fitness was again assessed using a VO 2 Max test. One <b>participant</b> <b>dropped</b> out of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> due to musculoskeletal injury. The data was analyzed with paired t-tests and Cohen’s d effect sizes were computed. RESULTS: There was no significant differences across the experimental and control group’s relative change in VO 2 max scores (t(6) =- 0. 05, p 3 ̆c 0. 48) with little to no effect (d= 0. 03). Within the experimental group from pre to post VO 2 max there was a moderate positive effect size (d= 0. 54) but there was no statistical significance (t(8) =- 0. 86, p 3 ̆c 0). CONCLUSION: The Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 did not significantly increase the individual’s aerobic fitness over the course of four weeks when compared to the control group at a 3, 000 to 6, 000 feet elevation setting. However, effect sizes indicated a moderate effect within the experimental group for increases in aerobic fitness. The Elevation Training Mask 2. 0 shows promise for facilitating increases in aerobic training when used in conjunction with an evidence-based HIIT training protocol...|$|R
40|$|Review {{question}} Do drug (medicine) interventions reduce {{weight in}} obese {{children and adolescents}} and are they safe? Background Across the world more children and adolescents are becoming overweight and obese. These children and adolescents {{are more likely to}} have health problems, both while as children or adolescents and in later life. More information is needed about what works best for treating this problem recognising that so-called lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and counselling) have limited efficacy. Study characteristics We found 21 randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing various drugs plus a behaviour changing intervention such as diet, exercise or both (= intervention groups) usually with placebo (a pretend drug) plus a behaviour changing intervention (= control groups). We also identified eight ongoing studies (studies which are currently running but not completed yet). A total of 2484 children and adolescents took part in <b>the</b> included <b>studies.</b> <b>The</b> length of the intervention period ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks, and the length of follow-up ranged from six months to 100 weeks. Key results <b>The</b> included <b>studies</b> investigated metformin (10 studies), sibutramine (six studies), orlistat (four studies) and one <b>study</b> group evaluated <b>the</b> combination of metformin and fluoxetine. <b>The</b> ongoing <b>studies</b> are investigating metformin (four studies), topiramate (two studies) and exenatide (two studies). Most studies reported on body mass index (BMI) and bodyweight: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated from weight and height measurements (kg/m 2). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex, weight and height as children grow older (BMI z score). The average change in BMI across control groups was between a 1. 8 kg/m 2 reduction to a 0. 9 kg/m 2 increase, while across all intervention groups the average reduction was more pronounced (1. 3 kg/m 2 reduction). The same effect was observed for weight change: on average, children and adolescents in the intervention groups lost 3. 9 kg more weight than the children and adolescents in <b>the</b> control groups. <b>Study</b> authors reported an average of serious side effects in 24 per 1000 participants in the intervention groups compared with an average of 17 per 1000 participants in the control groups. <b>The</b> numbers of <b>participants</b> <b>dropping</b> out of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> because of side effects were 40 per 1000 in the intervention groups and 27 per 1000 in the control groups. The most common side effects in the orlistat and metformin studies were gut (such as diarrhoea and mild tummy pain). Common side effects in the sibutramine trials included increased heart rate (tachycardia), constipation and high blood pressure. <b>The</b> fluoxetine <b>study</b> reported dry mouth and loose stools. One study reported health-related quality of life (a measure of physical, mental, emotional and social functioning) and found no marked differences between intervention and control. No <b>study</b> reported <b>the</b> participants' views of the intervention or socioeconomic effects. Only one study reported on morbidity (how often a disease occurs in a specific area) associated with the intervention, where there were more gallstones after <b>the</b> orlistat treatment. <b>Study</b> authors reported one suicide in the orlistat intervention group. However, studies were not long enough to reliably investigate death from any cause. No study investigated drug treatment for children who were only overweight (obese children have a much higher weight, BMI or BMI z score than children being overweight). This evidence is up to date to March 2016. Quality of the evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because there were only a few studies per outcome measurement, the number of included children or adolescents was small, and due to variation in the results of <b>the</b> <b>studies.</b> In addition, many children or adolescents left <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> before <b>the</b> <b>study</b> had finished...|$|R

In such cases, researchers must adapt to the new situation and yet to stay on topic: in one word, they need to improvise. How, then, does research remain scientific? In this chapter, I will argue that it is not planning, organisation or control that make good academic work, and that it is often in the unexpected that the most interesting results emerge. What matters, however, is what is done afterwards; how hunches and surprises are turned into systematic investigations, analyses and interpretations. This argument will be illustrated with the story of an ‘impromptu’ fieldwork in Brussels and its unpredictable consequences; or, rather, how staying on topic requires one to systematically stray away from it...|$|R

The frequency of the awarding of degrees <b>dropped,</b> <b>the</b> range of <b>studies</b> shrank, and there was a sharp {{decline in the number of}} its students. The centuries-old European wide prestige of Salamanca declined.|$|R
