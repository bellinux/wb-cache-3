Phenolic laminates are made by impregnating one or more layers of a base material such as paper, fiberglass or cotton with phenolic resin and laminating the resin-saturated base material under heat and pressure. The resin fully polymerizes (cures) during this process forming the thermoset polymer matrix. The base material choice depends on the intended application of the finished product. Paper phenolics are used in manufacturing electrical components such as <b>punch-through</b> boards, in household laminates, and in paper composite panels.

Examples include the Bipolar Mode Static Induction Transistor (BSIT), ultrasmall <b>Punch-through</b> MOSFETs, and BARITT diodes for microwave applications. The development of <b>punch-through</b> space-charge type of devices is a technology motivated by the demanding high density among the IC chips. This dissertation discusses a device which operates in a <b>punch-through</b> condition with space-charge control of currents. It is a two terminal device, which could be fabricated with no deviation from today's technology. The device structure is simple, with two n⁺ or p⁺ regions formed in p⁻ or n⁻ substrate, respectively. <b>Punch-through</b> space-charge limited structures both n⁺p⁻n⁺ and p⁺n⁻p⁺, were simulated using a general one-dimensional semiconductor device performance simulation program GESIM 1 for dynamic and static analysis. The results of simulation show that the potential barrier height decreases with increasing applied potential and with a reduction of the spacing L between the n⁺ diffusion in an n⁺p⁻n⁺ structure. The resistance increases as the spacing L is increased. A two-dimensional analytical model of carrier transport in the device was developed. This model accounts for surface effects {{as well as the}} space-charge limited flow. Also, a one-dimensional model that includes mobile carriers effects on the device operation. Structures of various configurations were fabricated and tested. Electrical evaluations of these structures provided large value resistors in a remarkably small area compare to traditional integrated resistors. The resistance was observed to increase with the spacing L and with the resistivity of the starting substrate. These <b>punch-through</b> space-charge limited loads should have applications as an alternative approach for integrated resistors in high-speed VLSI applications. They can provide very small area, large value resistors based on the space-charge limiting action of the device. The range of resistance value is large, and small dimensions lead to small capacitance and fast switching times...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{two kinds}} of <b>punch-through</b> phototransistors were studied. GaAs-AlGaAs {{heterojunction}} <b>punch-through</b> phototransistors (HPTPTs) were realized by employing Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) growth and standard wet etching processing technology. Dark I-V characteristics were experimentally studied. Optical conversion gains as high as 1, 400 were measured. The device also showed low output shot noise, which is only 10 % of that of conventional 3 -terminal phototransistor at the same bias condition. This is the first experimental proof that the output noise of phototransistors can be significantly reduced through <b>punch-through</b> operation. Lateral Si phototransistors with a <b>punch-through</b> base were fabricated with regular planar technology. A theoretical analysis of the dark I-V characteristics and gain of the devices, which was confirmed experimentally, was given. Ultra-high optical conversion gains were obtained under extremely low illumination level. The gain was higher than 100, 000 when the incident light power is 0. 19 nW. When the illumination level as low as 0. 1 nW observed optical gain exceeded 150, 000, which is the highest one ever reported in silicon material system. The noise characteristics of the devices were also discussed. Very low output noise was obtained. In comparison to either conventional three terminal phototransistors or p-i-n photodiodes, improvement of SNR beyond 40 dB has been achieved. The device also showed a fast transient response.

40|$|AC-coupled silicon strip sensors can {{be damaged}} {{in case of a}} beam loss due to the {{possibility}} of a large charge accumulation in the bulk, developing very high voltages across the coupling capacitors which can destroy them. <b>Punch-through</b> structures are currently used to avoid this problem helping to evacuate the accumulated charge as large voltages are developing. Nevertheless, previous experiments, performed with laser pulses, have shown that these structures can become ineffective in relatively long strips. The large value of the implant resistance can effectively isolate the “far” end of the strip from the <b>punch-through</b> structure leading to large voltages. We present here our developments to fabricate low-resistance strip sensors to avoid this problem. The deposition of a conducting material in contact with the implants drastically reduces the strip resistance, assuring the effectiveness of the <b>punch-through</b> structures.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{is to develop a}} hazard map for <b>punch-through</b> failure during jack-up rig installation in the Gulf of Suez. This map {{can be used to make}} an upfront assessment of unfavorable foundation conditions at a proposed installation site. This is not self-evident due to the complex geological setting of the area. Data to complete {{this research}} was provided by Fugro Engineers B. V [...] The available data set contains (geotechnical) borehole data, geophysical data, bathymetric data and information regarding the surface sediments in the Gulf of Suez. The borehole data are used to perform bearing capacity calculations for different kinds of spudcan foundations, ranging in diameter between 10 m and 18 m. These calculations resulted in a distinction between locations with a “safe” profile and locations for which a <b>punch-through</b> profile is generated. At these unfavorable locations, the actual risk of a punch-trough failure will depend on the deployed rig and the corresponding preload. Therefore, a factor of safety is calculated for these risky locations. The data was integrated into an ArcGIS project. Data analysis resulted in the identification of different safe and risky zones regarding <b>punch-through</b> occurrence. The identified zones turned out to be valid for every spudcan with a diameter between 10 m and 18 m. An observed trend is that for a constant preload, the risk for <b>punch-through</b> decreases if the spudcan diameter increases. Generalization of the identified zones into depositional environments allowed the production of a risk map that also covers these areas in the Gulf of Suez for which no data was available. Two environments turned out to have the highest risk for punch through failure. The first environment is characterised by a deep bathymetry and fine grained sediments, possibly with coarse grained intercalations. <b>Punch-through</b> in these areas is related to these coarse grained intercalations or to different degree of consolidation inside these fine grained packages. The second environment is related to areas where wadis bring a lot of sediment into the Gulf of Suez and develop an alluvial fan at their mouth. Mixing of this coarse grained input with finer grained deep water sedimentation results in the generation of <b>punch-through</b> profiles. Finally, for two areas with a high borehole concentration, an attempt was made to develop 3 D ground models with the SGeMS software package. The bearing capacity inside the grid was predicted by applying ordinary kriging between the boreholes.

A series of loose sand overlying clay tests was performed and combined with an existing database of tests performed on dense sand overlying clay. The performance of the failure stress dependent model proposed by Lee (2009) and Lee et al. (2009) has then been assessed using this combined dataset which encompasses a wider range of soil properties and problem geometries than was used in the original calibration of the model. The single empirical stress distribution factor (DF) that is employed in the model was then optimised using a back calculation procedure for all tests. The scatter of the optimised DF values was then compared for the original bi-linear calibration proposed by Lee et al. (2009) and a new nonlinear power law calibration. The new non-linear relationship enables the model to better predict qpeak over a wider range of problem geometries and for conditions of both loose and dense sands overlying clay.
