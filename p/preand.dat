40|$|In {{an earlier}} article an {{enlarged}} subpopulation of vasopressin containing neurons {{was found in}} the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of homosexual men as compared to heterosexuals. The present study investigates the possibility that the number of vasopressin neurons in the SCN and sexual partner preference behavior in male rats are both influenced by sex hormones during brain development. For this purpose, we studied groups of adult male rats that had been treated either prenatally or <b>preand</b> postnatally with the aromatase inhibitor ATD (1, 4, 6 -androstatriene- 3, 17 -dione) which blocks the aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. Rats treated with ATD in both <b>preand</b> postnatal periods showed 'bisexual' partner preference behavior and appeared to have 59 % more vasopressin-expressing neurons in the SCN than the controls. The prenatally treated rats did not differ from the controls. This observation supports the hypothesis that the increased number of vasopressin neurons found earlier in the SCN of adult homosexual men might reflect differences {{that took place in the}} interaction between sex hormones and the brain early in development...|$|E

40|$|Floor-by-floor {{survey of}} {{installed}} elements of an elevator shaft using coordinate method and tacheometer is also inhibited by {{the necessity to}} determine device installation points for floors of every mounting horizon that leads to additional measurements due to conditions of the completed building framework and presence of {{a great number of}} situational disturbances and then it entails significant time expenditure and diminution of accuracy in the obtained results. Technical capabilities of the modern electronic tacheometer substantially simplify an accomplishment of the mission because the device can be applied not only in function of vertical projection but it can be used for <b>preand</b> post-construction survey of the elevator shaft with the help of advanced radiation method. While using the given method the electronic tacheometer equipped with diagonal ocular is installed over a bearing sign in the elevator pit and control points of the elevator shaft are determined with the help of specially developed portable beam deflector in the form of disc with radius   r, which is fixed to a handle rod and orientated perpendicularly to a laser beam. An innovation diagram for <b>preand</b> post-construction survey of elevator shaft has been developed while applying this type of deflector. The diagram is characterized by high efficiency {{due to the fact that}} one tacheometer installation makes it possible to execute highly accurate, complete plane and high-level surveying of the whole elevator shaft including doorways, door sills and jambs. The paper proposes a new method for pre and post construction survey of the elevator shaft using the electronic tacheometer while applying specially developed beam deflector that ensures a geometric fixing of one or simultaneously two surveying points to spatial coordinate system where the <b>preand</b> post-construction survey is carried out.
