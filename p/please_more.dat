The one exception was Mrs. Patten, whose strong memory and taste for personal narrative made her a great source of oral tradition in Shepperton.

60|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that Burke was commended to Lord Rockingham by William Fitzherbert. Fitzherbert was President of the Board of Trade {{in the new}} government, but he {{is more likely to}} be remembered as Dr. Johnson's famous example of the truth of the observation, that a man will <b>please</b> <b>more</b> upon the whole by negative qualities than by positive, because he was the most acceptable man in London, and yet overpowered nobody by the superiority of his talents, made no man think worse of himself by being his rival, seemed always to listen, did not oblige you to hear much from him, and did not oppose what you said. Besides Fitzherbert's influence, we have it on Burke's own authority that his promotion was partly due to that mysterious person, William Burke, who was at the same time appointed an under-secretary of state. There must have been unpleasant rumours afloat as to the Burke connection, and we shall presently consider what they were worth. Meanwhile, it is enough to say that the old Duke of Newcastle hurried to the new premier, and told him the appointment would never do; that the new secretary was not only an Irish adventurer, which was true, but that he was an Irish papist, which was not true; that he was a Jesuit, that he was a spy from Saint Omer's, and that his real name was O'Bourke. Lord Rockingham behaved like a man of sense and honour, sent for Burke, and repeated to him what he had heard. Burke warmly denounced the truthlessness of the Duke's tattle. He insisted that the reports which his chief had heard would probably, even unknown to himself, create in his mind such suspicions as would stand in the way of a thorough confidence. No earthly consideration, he said, should induce him to continue in relations with a man whose trust in him was not entire; and he pressed his resignation. To this Lord Rockingham would not consent, and from that time until his death, seventeen years afterwards, the relations between them were those of loyal and honourable service on the one hand, and generous and appreciative friendship on the other. Six and twenty years afterwards (1791) Burke remembered the month in which he had first become connected with a man whose memory, he said, will ever be precious to Englishmen of all parties, as long as the ideas of honour and virtue, public and private, are understood and cherished in this nation.|$|E

5000|$|A {{prominent}} {{point of}} scholarly analysis is the differences of attitude towards gender between Clemence's translation and the Vulgate rendition. Many scholars suggest that Clemence's translation is a gender positive re-interpretation of the Vulgate rendition, and is perhaps meant to partially act as social commentary on women's {{role in society}} at the time. In the opening lines of Clemence's text, Clemence declares her intention to [...] "translator la vie,./De Latin respundre en rumanz/Pur ço que plus plaise as oianz" [...] (to translate the life, expounding it from Latin into the vernacular, in order to <b>please</b> <b>more</b> those who hear it). Scholars argue that in {{this portion of the}} translation, Clemence employed self-authorization. [...] Because the act of writing was already quite subversive for twelfth-century women in Europe, Clemence's strategy of self-authorization is regarded as a bold move. Scholars also suggest that Clemence's reclamation of authority was a strategy for taking hold of patriarchal depictions of women in literature in order to reinterpret them as a woman for women. Scholar, Gina J. Froese writes that Clemence's work [...] "hints at an authorial anxiety that suggests a send of unease with the process of subverting and reclaiming. Though she follows and sometimes mimics the structure, form, and style her male predecessors also apply, we clearly find indications of protest against misogynistic views and corrections of such interpretations that place her at odds with the authority of her predecessors." ...|$|E
5000|$|On October 26, 1805, Mme. Catalani signed {{her first}} {{engagement}} (in {{the possession of}} the writer) with F. Goold and W. Taylor, manager and proprietors of the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, for the season from September 15, 1806, to August 1807, at a salary of £2,000 sterling, with 'a further sum of £100 sterling to defray the expenses of her journey to London,' and also 'one Benefit Night free of expense {{in the month of}} March, at which a new opera shall be performed.' Before crossing, however, she gave concerts at Madrid and Paris, by which she gained large sums of money, and created a deep impression; indeed, Napoleon offered her an engagement from which she had some difficulty in escaping, in order to fulfil that at the King's Theatre. At the moment of her arrival in London, Grassini and Mrs. Billington had just retired; and, as Lord Mount-Edgcumbe says, [...] the great, the far-famed Catalani supplied the place of both, and for many years reigned alone, for she would bear no rival, nor any singer sufficiently good to divide the applause...It is well known, that her voice is of a most uncommon quality, and capable of exertions almost supernatural. Her throat seems endued (as has been remarked by medical men) with a power of expansion and muscular motion by no means usual, and when she throws out all her voice to the utmost, it has a volume and strength that are quite surprising; while its agility in divisions, {{running up and down the}} scale in semi-tones, and its compass in jumping over two octaves at once, are equally astonishing. It were to be wished,... that she was less lavish in the display of these wonderful powers, and sought to <b>please</b> <b>more</b> than to surprise; but her taste is vicious, her excessive love of ornament spoiling every simple air, and her greatest delight (indeed her chief merit) being in songs of a bold and spirited character, where much is left to her discretion (or indiscretion), without being confined by the accompaniment, but in which she can indulge in ad libitum passages with a luxuriance and redundancy no other singer ever possessed, or if possessing ever practised, and which she carries to a fantastical excess. [...] The opinions of all good judges were nearly the same with the above; but the public was led completely away by her marvellous powers. She made her début December 15, 1806, in the 'Semiramide' of Portogallo, composed for her expressly.|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} {{midway through}} the year that a sizeable proportion of our second year students had difficulties with aspects of organic chemistry. It was essential to devise a solution {{that would require the}} students to be active in their learning - a set of ‘remedial lectures’ would simply not be sufficient. We felt that a set of tutorials would be a better approach, but we were concerned that, for some students at least, the learning would be restricted to the timeframe of the tutorial sessions. It should be noted that some of the less able students find textbooks difficult to interpret in this area, with reaction schemes often appearing cluttered with so much information being presented ‘in one go’. Hence we decided to support the delivery of the first tutorial with a suite of video resources. Students were instructed to complete the tutorial (PDF file on Blackboard) over Easter. A set of video tutorials on basic aspects of organic chemistry were made available, along with a set of animated reaction mechanisms. Usage of these resources was monitored with Blackboard’s statistics tracking features. Students were then instructed to submit their work after the Easter break, and copies were taken before the work was returned. The students then completed ‘Self-Assessment’ of their work, using a video of an academic talking through the mark scheme to guide them. The meechanism for delivery of student feedback was directly embedded into the core of the exercise, meaning we were able to obtain feedback from every single student who completed the task, and this made fascinating reading. Some comments include: “I found it very useful. its clearer to see where you’ve gone wrong if you’re marking it yourself rather than having a cross and a wrong answer you see why its wrong” “YES VERY!! <b>please</b> <b>more</b> during the year” “This has been a brilliant exercise if i am honest…” “… you can actually see where you went wrong and understand the areas to work on. It was really good that the videos paused to allow you to add up the marks and stuff. ” “It was a brilliant exercise in covering things I had already understood, whilst simultaneously highlighting things I'd clearly managed to remember or even learn wrong…” “This is an excellent resource and should be developed further for organic chemistry” “…it is a very useful exercise, with the feedback accessible to watch again. ” “Yes, it would have been even more useful before easter [...] . “ “yes there should be more like this that are marked throughout the course” There were also some constructive negative comments including: “Useful but still does not replace contact time with lecturers in tutorial type situations...|$|E
