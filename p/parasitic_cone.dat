5|$|Seismic {{activity}} in Indonesia is {{monitored by the}} Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Indonesia. The monitoring post for Mount Tambora is located at Doro Peti village. They use a seismograph to measure seismic and tectonic activity. Since the 1880 eruption, no significant increase in seismic activity has occurred. Monitoring is performed continuously inside the caldera, especially around the Doro Api Toi <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone</b> produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|Mount Tambora has {{remained}} active {{since the end}} of the 1815 eruption sequence. Minor lava domes and flows were extruded on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries. Sometime between 1850 and 1910, Tambora erupted again but only inside the caldera. Small lava flows and lava dome extrusions were formed. This eruption (VEI-2) created the Doro Api Toi <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone</b> inside the caldera. A very small (VEI-0) and non-explosive eruption occurred in 1967; Another very small eruption was reported in 2011. In August 2011, the alert level for the volcano was raised from level I to level II after increasing activity was reported in the caldera, including earthquakes and smoke emissions.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} {{small size of}} Little Bear Mountain and its close connection with Hoodoo Mountain indicates it is a <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone.</b> Such geographical features are formed when the vent of the main volcanic edifice (i.e. Hoodoo Mountain) is blocked by cooled and solidified lava, forcing magma to intrude into the lines of weakness {{at the side of}} the main volcanic edifice under pressure.|$|E
500|$|The Sunda Strait {{separates}} {{the islands of}} Sumatra and Java with the volcanic island Krakatoa lying between them. Krakatau erupted violently in 1883, destroying two-thirds of the island and leaving a large caldera under the sea. This cataclysmic explosion was heard {{as far away as}} the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius (approx. [...] away). A new <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone,</b> called Anak Krakatau (or the child of Krakatau), rose from the sea at the centre of the caldera in 1930. The other Krakatau islets from the 1883 eruptions are known as Sertung, Panjang and Rakata.|$|E
500|$|The volcano is {{just south}} of Sairecabur, a group of volcanoes which rises to [...] and is an {{apparent}} source of recent volcanic activity. East of Licancabur is its companion volcano, Juriques. This -high volcano has a large——deep crater and is considered a <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone.</b> West-east alignments of volcanoes like Licancabur and Juriques are common in the region, due to tectonic influences. Araral, Cerro Cabana, Cerro Canapa, Cerros de Tocorpuri, Cerro Linzor, Inacaliri, Inca, Jardin, Putana, Volcan Tatio and Zapaleri are other volcanoes in the neighbourhood of Licancabur. Nineteen kilometres (12 miles) southeast, the volcanic chain continues with Tocol, the Purico Complex and the -high Llullaillaco. Volcanoes in the Puna de Atacama formed during the Pliocene on Tertiary dacite, liparite and rhyolite ignimbrites. These rocks have a light colour, due to the rhyolite. Licancabur was formed over 1.35-million-year-old Purico, La Pacana and Chaxas ignimbrite. The Chaxas ignimbrite erupted 1.09 ±0.56million years ago.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>cones</b> of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago. These {{secondary}} vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active {{for a single}} eruption sequence before becoming extinct. The duration of volcanic activity at these cones can last from hours to years. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>cones</b> of the Itcha Range are small cinder cones situated at the summit and flanks of the shield volcano.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1815 eruption, the {{lowermost}} portion contains {{deposits of}} interlayered sequences of lava and pyroclastic materials. The 1 to 4m thick lava flows constitute about 40% of the layers' thickness. Thick scoria beds were {{produced by the}} fragmentation of lava flows. Within the upper section, the lava is interbedded with scoria, tuffs, and pyroclastic flows and falls. At least 20 subsidiary or <b>parasitic</b> <b>cones</b> are known. Some of them have names: Tahe, 844 m; Molo, 602 m; Kadiendinae; Kubah, 1648 m; and Doro Api Toi. Most of these <b>parasitic</b> <b>cones</b> have produced basaltic lavas.|$|R

It {{is known to be}} the northernmost <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone</b> and is similar in structure to a flat-topped, steep-sided tuya, although its inner stratigraphy is not yet known because the area has not been studied in detail due to its remoteness.|$|E
50|$|A <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone</b> (also adventive cone or {{satellite}} cone) is the cone-shaped {{accumulation of}} volcanic material {{not part of}} the central vent of a volcano. It forms from eruptions from fractures on the flank of the volcano. These fractures occur because the flank of the volcano is unstable. Eventually, the fractures reach the magma chamber and generate eruptions called flank eruptions, which, in turn, produce a <b>parasitic</b> <b>cone.</b>|$|E

40|$|Eruption {{patterns}} of parasitic volcanoes {{are discussed in}} order to study their correlation to the activities of their parental polygenetic volcanoes. The distribution density of parasitic vents on polygenetic volcanoes is diversified, probably corresponding to the age and structure of parental volcanoes. Describing existing <b>parasitic</b> <b>cones</b> contextually in relation to parental volcanoes is as indispensable as collecting observational data of their actual formations. In the present paper, spatial distributions of <b>parasitic</b> <b>cones</b> are classified tentatively into the following three categories: individually radial, directionally radial and annular determined according to feature’s placement around the central axes of the parental volcanoes. The formations of parasitic vents are discussed {{from the standpoint of}} material mechanics. Derived from this approach, the maximum shear stress model suggests the possibility of twin parasites, and their existence on particular volcanoes verifies the possible validity of this interpretation though it may be not necessarily universally applicable to every volcano due to various effects of volcanism and lack of complexity in the model. Some characteristics of parasitic eruptions are discussed, such as monogenetic activity of parasitic vents and simultaneous eruptions of summit craters and parasitic vents. Parasitic volcanism proves to be not merely an auxiliary feature of its parental volcano but closely correlated with magma plumbing systems. </p...|$|R
