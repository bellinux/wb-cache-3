We present experimental evidence demonstrating that the technique developed can accurately predict ice thickness in the case of the smooth-surface SOFI panel.

Another challenge for the numerical method are the dissimilar length scales and material properties for the liquid and gaseous parts in combination with the chemical reactions for the LOx-GH 2 combustion. In this study we use the TAU numerical flow solver for the simulation of single-injector experiments conducted at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Lampoldshausen.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, {{dicyclopentadiene}} has been researched {{for use as a}} potential binder in composite solid propellant formulations. The binder of a composite solid propellant is very important because it plays a significant role in defining the mechanical, combustion, and ballistic characteristics of a propellant. Dicyclopentadiene, a hydrocarbon heterodimer that is capable of forming a highly-cross-linked polymer network through ring opening metathesis polymerization, has been investigated as a potential binder due to it 2 ̆ 7 s low viscosity, ability to withstand high solids loading, and favorable mechanical properties. While the continued work with dicyclopentadiene-based composite solid propellants has shown marginal improvements in propellant quality, the purpose of this work was to investigate methods that would produce substantial gains in propellant quality. ^ A major short coming of dicyclopentadiene is the limited time permitted for mixing and casting of composite solid <b>propellents</b> due to the expediency of the polymerization reaction. In an effort to better understand, and predict, the amount of time available for mixing and casting operations, dicyclopentadiene gumstock polymerization tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of mixture temperature and inhibitor concentration on polymerization rate. Experiments have shown that an Arrhenius and power-law equation adequately model the influence of mixture temperature and inhibitor concentration, respectively, on dicyclopentadiene 2 ̆ 7 s polymerization rate. ^ Paradoxically, recent research has shown that dicyclopentadiene 2 ̆ 7 s low viscosity acts more as a hinderance than an advantage. This is because the low viscosity allows particle setting to occur, loss of dicyclopentadiene into mold tooling due to capillary action, and evaporation of liquid dicyclopentadiene during the propellant 2 ̆ 7 s cure cycle, all of which contributes to reduce propellant quality. To remedy these issues, gelling agents were investigated as a means to modify the rheological characteristics of dicyclopentadiene. Experimental research showed that, due to dicyclopentadiene 2 ̆ 7 s non-polar nature, only non- or weakly-polar gelling agents were capable of forming a solution with dicyclopentadiene. All gelling agents that were capable of forming a solution also had the desired effect of modifying dicyclopentadiene 2 ̆ 7 s rheological characteristics. Furthermore, these gelling agents had the positive effect of lowering dicyclopentadiene 2 ̆ 7 s freezing point but, unfortunately, significantly extend the time required for dicyclopentadiene to fully polymerize. ^ A limited-scope aging study was conducted involving dicyclopentadiene-based gumstocks and propellants. Uniaxial tensile tests and surface hardness measurements were used to monitor changes in polymerized dicyclopentadiene 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties over the course of weeks to years. Results from these tests indicate that polymerization is still underway, thus, the current cure cycle is insufficient. ^ Another aspect of this work was to evaluate how propellant formulation variables affect ballistic and mechanical properties of dicyclopentadiene-based propellants.

The {{present study}} aims {{the understanding of}} the factors linked to the genesis of pleasure and suffering as they are experienced by nursing workers in their labour performance. Based on the premisses of labour relations, focusing the work organization and the working conditions, allied to contributions from Christophe Dejours, who analyzes the themes of pleasure and suffering within the work, we brought into evidence the particular aspects of the relationship between labour and suffering/pleasure process expressed by nursing workers who work in both public and universitarian hospital. Empirical data was collected taking into consideration two instruments: a list with closed questions and semi-structured interviews, thus allowing analysis of the speeches supplied by nursing workers. The adopted methodology permits abstraction from concrete reality in order to establish the link between worker/labour/institution and the feelings of pleasure and suffering. The interviews were applied among 36 professionals, representing the categories of nurse, nurse technician and nurse auxiliary at teaching hospital affiliated to a Federal State University in the province of Minas Gerais. Results were obtained from 20 categories of analysis showing that the knowledge of the factors linked to the genesis of pleasure and suffering within the nursing work context opens possibilities to reduce its effects on a worker' s life in benefit to his health and quality of life. Concerning the nursing trajectory from white angel to a professional we could observe that it has been marked by conflicts, preconception, suffering and battles for labour space. Abandoning the position of peripheral and vulnerable knowledge, we verify nowadays the efforts of the nursing workers to construct a new image that contemplates estrategies of revalorization of the professional statute, self-developing control, a motivating career plan and work contents based on new paradigms, thus becoming privileged and active actors to improve community health conditions and <b>propellents</b> of new ideas in order to implant a vanguard administration model in the hospital organizations...|$|R
