2500|$|<b>Professional</b> <b>use</b> {{of social}} {{networking}} services {{refers to the}} employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest. SNSs like LinkedIn, a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or {{keep in touch with}} previous co-workers, affiliates, and clients. Not only does LinkedIn provide a professional social use, but it also encourages people to inject their personality into their profile–making it more personal than a resume. Other network sites are now being used in this manner, Twitter has become [...] mainstay for professional development as well as promotion and online SNSs support both the maintenance of existing social ties and the formation of new connections. Much of the early research on online communities assume that individuals using these systems would be connecting with others outside their preexisting social group or location, liberating them to form communities around shared interests, as opposed to shared geography. Other researchers have suggested that the <b>professional</b> <b>use</b> of network sites produce [...] "social capital". For individuals, social capital allows a person to draw on resources from other members of the networks to which he or she belongs. These resources can take the form of useful information, personal relationships, or the capacity to organize groups. As well, networks within these services also can be established or built by joining special interest groups that others have made, or creating one and asking others to join.|$|E

2500|$|In 1932 Smoky Dawson {{worked at}} a tannery and on {{weekends}} he played a lap steel guitar in a duo, The Coral Island Boys, with his younger brother, Ted, on Spanish guitar. Both sang lead vocals, with Ted's singing described by Dawson as [...] "a much richer voice than mine. He had more depth in his voice". They performed then-popular songs, such as [...] "Gee But I'm Lonesome for You Caroline" [...] and [...] "Southern Moon Keep on Shining". In 1934, Dawson formed a Western group with an accordionist, a bass guitarist, and Malcolm on violin; which cut a test acetate at Fidelity Records with Jack Murray recording. It was the first <b>professional</b> <b>use</b> of Dawson's nickname, [...] "Smoky" [...] – he had tried pipe smoking when living at Stewarton but it had sickened him. The recording led to sponsorship by Pepsodent – a toothpaste company – and so the group were named, Smoky and the Pepsodent Rangers. In 1935 {{they were the first}} Western group to be broadcast live on an Australian radio station, 3KZ, and by 1937 Dawson had his own radio show. His show was re-broadcast into New South Wales on 2CH as [...] "Hill-billy Artists" [...] by [...] "Smoky" [...] Dawson and His Boys. In 1941, he signed with Columbia Records, where he recorded his first commercial releases, including [...] "I'm a Happy Go Lucky Cowhand" [...] and [...] "The Range in the Western Sky".

But reading, far from being then considered, as it is now, an essential attainment for all, and one which we are sure of finding possessed by all who have received any instruction whatever, was regarded in those days a sort of technical art, learned only by those who were to make some <b>professional</b> <b>use</b> of the acquisition. Monks and clerks could always read, but generals, gentlemen, and kings very seldom. And as they could not read, neither could they write.
