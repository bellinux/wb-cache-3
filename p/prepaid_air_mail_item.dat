50|$|SAL, or Surface Air Lifted, is {{a postal}} service used to send {{international}} <b>mail</b> <b>items.</b> Thirty-nine postal authorities provide this service. It is a cost effective international mail. At first SAL mail is processed and transported by surface in the origin country. Then it is transported by air to the destination country and finally processed and delivered as standard-type mail by the destination postal administration. The service is faster than surface mail while the cost is lower than air mail.SAL is more economical for sending heavy items; with light items, it sometimes costs more than <b>air</b> <b>mail.</b>|$|R

50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the first air-mail route in 1918, and the later additional routes, plus the accepted use of premium priced <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> by the public, it was only natural that the Railway Mail Service (RMS), being in charge of transit mail, was assigned the task of establishing <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> Field (AMF) postal facilities at the major airports. Only outgoing <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> was distributed at these workrooms, channeled there by both the post offices and Railway Post Office (RPO) routes. This mail was distributed and dispatched to other AMFs via the different flight connections. Incoming mail from other AMFs was distributed by general scheme and pouched to outgoing RPOs and necessary post offices. The Motor Vehicle Service provided frequent trips between the city post office and the AMF for <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> ground transportation. In 1951, there were 1200 clerks manning forty AMFs. They continue to exist within the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and are now called <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> Centers (AMCs).|$|R

50|$|In 1934, {{following}} a Congressional investigation of how <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contracts had been awarded by the United States Postal Service, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cancelled all existing <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contracts and assigned {{the duty of}} flying the <b>mail</b> to the <b>Air</b> Corps. The squadron began flying its P-12s on <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> routes, but they proved unsuitable for the work, lacking instruments to fly at night or in adverse weather. Moreover, they could only carry about 50 lbs of mail, and with the mail load, the planes were tail heavy and difficult to fly. The P-12s were withdrawn from the project within a week, although the larger observation aircraft continued to fly mail until May, when new <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contracts were awarded.|$|R
50|$|Airmail in the United States Post Office {{emerged in}} three stages {{beginning}} with the 'pioneer period' where there were many unofficial flights carrying the mail prior to 1918, the year the US Post Office assumed delivery of all <b>Air</b> <b>Mail.</b> The US Post office began contracting out {{to the private sector}} to carry the <b>mail</b> (Contract <b>Air</b> <b>Mail,</b> CAM) on February 15, 1926.

Smith was permanently stationed at Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, as an <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> pilot starting in May 1920.

2500|$|As {{safety and}} {{capability}} grew, daytime-only operations {{gave way to}} flying at night, assisted by airway beacons and lighted emergency landing fields. Regular transcontinental <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> delivery began in 1924. In 1925, to encourage commercial aviation, the Kelly Act (also known as the <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> Act of 1925) authorized the Post Office Department to contract with private airlines for feeder routes into the main transcontinental system. The first commercial <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> flight was on the [...] route CAM (Contract <b>Air</b> <b>Mail)</b> No. 5 from Pasco, Washington, to Elko, Nevada, on April 6, 1926. By 1927 the transition had been completed to entirely commercial transport of mail, and by 1929 45 airlines were involved in mail delivery at a cost per mile of $1.10. Most were small, under-capitalized companies flying short routes and old equipment.|$|R
2500|$|The {{exclusive}} {{transportation of}} flown mails by government operated aircraft {{came to an}} end in 1926 under the provisions of the [...] "Kelly Act" [...] which required the USPOD to transition to contracting with commercial air carriers to fly them over Contract <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> (CAM) routes to be established by the Department, although {{during the first half of}} 1934 the U.S. Army Air Forces temporarily took over the routes — with disastrous results — [...] when all CAM contracts were summarily cancelled by President Franklin D.
