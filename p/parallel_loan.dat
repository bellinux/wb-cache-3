50|$|The <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> {{not only}} evolved to {{circumvent}} exchange control regulations, {{but it also}} permits companies to borrow funds in foreign currencies at rates lower than they might get in foreign exchange market, as overseas companies. In this situation, the <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> brings a few advantages and disadvantages to the companies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> is {{very similar}} to a {{back-to-back}} loan. The <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> was one of the proactive management of operating exposure that offsetting expected foreign exchange exposure. Two business companies in different countries will borrow currency to each other for a particular period of time and they will return the borrowed currencies on the date they agreed to with the same loaned amount. The two loans will be valued at the prevailing spot rate and the prescribed period. The currencies borrowing activities conducted outside the foreign exchange market to avoid foreign exchange risk and legal limitations.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> is two loans {{taken out}} by {{two pairs of}} {{companies}} in different countries from local lenders {{with the aim of}} swapping the resulting loans in different currencies. It was an early form of currency swap.|$|E
30|$|Prediction {{correctness}} {{also comes}} from the velocity of Big Data. Since Internet companies can capture the change of borrowers’ online activities in an efficient manner, {{they are able to}} identify changing behavior that can best describe “current” rather than “past” credit risk. For example, one of 100 Credit’s customer companies works on small loans through mobile clients, mainly for borrowers in small cities. Knowing the recent activities of borrowers allows for identification of multiple <b>parallel</b> <b>loans</b> or loan attempts in multiple financial institutions and helps rule out such high-risk applicants.|$|R
500|$|The IFC {{operates}} a Syndicated Loan Program {{in an effort}} to mobilize capital for development goals. The program was created in 1957 and [...] has channeled approximately $38 billion from over 550 financial institutions toward development projects in over 100 different emerging markets. The IFC syndicated a total of $4.7 billion in loans in 2011, twice that of its $2 billion worth of syndications in 2010. Due to banks retrenching from lending across borders in emerging markets, in 2009 the IFC started to syndicate <b>parallel</b> <b>loans</b> to the international financial institutions and other participants.|$|R
50|$|The first formal {{currency}} swap, {{as opposed}} to the then used <b>parallel</b> <b>loans</b> structure, was transacted by Citicorp International Bank for a $US100,000,000 10 year US Dollar Sterling swap between Mobil Oil Corporation and General Electric Corporation Ltd (UK). The concept of the interest rate swap was developed by the Citicorp International Swap unit but cross-currency interest rate swaps were introduced by the World Bank in 1981 to obtain Swiss francs and German marks by exchanging cash flows with IBM. This deal was brokered by Salomon Brothers with a notional amount of $210 million and a term of over ten years.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> {{there is}} an {{exchange}} of currencies between four parties which promises that the loan will be repaid at a specified future date and predetermined exchange rate. It consists of two pairs of the affiliated companies and two pairs parents companies in two different countries. It occurs between two companies simultaneously when a company has a relative advantage {{in the cost of}} funds and then borrows those funds to a foreign affiliate in its own country at a rate lower than the foreign affiliate would have to pay at its parent company’s country. Besides that, the <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> is “similar to cross-border loan, but there are no currencies in the foreign exchange markets”.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> was {{established}} in the early 1970s in effect of the exchange controls in the United Kingdom on British companies. The implementation of exchange control has caused many British firms withdrawn their decision to extend their business because investing in foreign market is not attractive. After the abolition of foreign exchange control in 1979, <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> kept on being utilized with the goal of hedging long-term foreign currency exposure at a lower cost than what will be imposed in the foreign exchange market. At that time, UK organizations needed to pay a premium to get a loan in US dollars. In order to prevent this situation, UK organizations set up parallel or back-to-back loan agreement with US organizations that wish to acquire sterling.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parallel</b> <b>loan</b> {{market was}} created to avoid confinements imposed by the Bank of England on the free stream of British pounds. Most of the British {{companies}} who are desire to invest abroad need to change pounds into US dollars at an exchange rate over the market exchange rate. The motivation behind this strategy was to safeguard {{the value of the}} pound among other currencies. However, companies actually were not keen on providing financial aid to the Bank of England by committing the above-market rate for every dollar obtained from the exchange rate implemented in the policy. Prevention for these currency control leads straightforwardly to the improvement of the market for the currency swaps.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the IFC {{reported}} {{total funding}} commitments (consisting of loans, equity, guarantees, and client risk management) of $12.18 billion, {{slightly lower than}} its $12.66 billion in commitments in 2010. Its core mobilization, which consists of participation and <b>parallel</b> <b>loans,</b> structured finance, its Asset Management Company funds, and other initiatives, grew from $5.38 billion in 2010 to $6.47 billion in 2011. The IFC's total investment program was reported at a value of $18.66 billion for fiscal year 2011. Its advisory services portfolio included 642 projects valued at $820 million in 2011, compared to 736 projects at $859 million in 2010. The IFC held $24.5 billion in liquid assets in 2011, up from $21 billion in 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) {{approved}} a US$365 million loan for the Valley of Mexico Sanitation Project, in <b>parallel</b> with a <b>loan</b> of US$410 {{million by the}} Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. The IDB project, which closed in 2005, foresaw the construction of 4 wastewater treatment plants with a total capacity of 74.5 m3/s {{as well as the}} rehabilitation of drainage systems.|$|R
