Scanned documents could be saved to a special memory area on disk known as the [...] "Save Queue" [...] {{where they could be}} retained, edited if desired (using the built in editor), and later printed [...] "on demand". The system was also capable of printing on sheet sizes up to 14x17 inches. Another important feature of this earliest DocuTech was its ability to perform signature imposition and generate [...] "2-up signatures" [...] (later 4-up was added) in the proper page imposition order to create signature booklets. (note: Folding, trimming, and stitching of booklets was done by an optional accessory known as a C.P. Bourg Signature Booklet Maker or SBM-1, which could be attached in-line to the system's output finisher.) ...|$|E

50|$|Laser printer speed {{can vary}} widely, and depends on many factors, {{including}} the graphic {{intensity of the}} job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 monochrome <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (12,000 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> hour). The fastest color laser printers can print over 100 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (6000 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> hour). Very high-speed laser printers are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with lithography in some commercial applications.|$|R

50|$|In {{the network}} laser-printer market, the 5Si series was succeeded by the 8000, {{and later by}} the 8100 and 8150. The 8000 brought 1200x1200-dpi resolution, which was {{continued}} in the 8100 and 8150. The 8100 and 8150 brought faster printing (32 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute),</b> but this speed was only realized for single-sided (simplex) printing; double-sided printing remained at 24 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> These models, which used the Canon WX engine, provided excellent durability and good maintainability.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed of}} early {{printers}} {{was measured in}} units of characters <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (cpm) for character printers, or lines <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (lpm) for line printers. Modern printers are measured in <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (ppm). These measures are used primarily as a marketing tool, and are not as well standardised as toner yields. Usually <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> refers to sparse monochrome office documents, rather than dense pictures which usually print much more slowly, especially colour images. PPM are {{most of the time}} referring to A4 paper in Europe and letter paper in the United States, resulting in a 5-10% difference.|$|R

50|$|The HP LaserJet 1012 is a low-end, {{monochrome}} {{laser printer}} from Hewlett-Packard that retails for US $199.99 and was designed as an inexpensive laser alternative to Inkjet printers for home and small office use. It is capable of printing a maximum 15 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (although after many pages, the print speed slows down to prevent overheating, as the printer has no onboard fan) and has a 1200 dpi effective output (optical 600 dpi).|$|R
5000|$|One {{reason for}} this is that, when {{rendered}} in studio format, most screenplays will transfer onto the screen at the rate of approximately one <b>page</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> This rule of thumb is widely contested [...] - [...] a page of dialogue usually occupies less screen time than a page of action, for example, and it depends enormously on the literary style of the writer [...] - [...] and yet it continues to hold sway in modern Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|Personal {{printers}} {{are primarily}} designed to support individual users, {{and may be}} connected to only a single computer. These printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround print jobs, requiring minimal setup time to produce a hard copy of a given document. However, they are generally slow devices ranging from 6 to around 25 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (ppm), and the cost <b>per</b> <b>page</b> is relatively high. However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience. Some printers can print documents stored on memory cards or from digital cameras and scanners.|$|R
50|$|VIPP was {{originally}} written by couple of Xerox systems Analysts in Switzerland {{to enable the}} highest speed Postscript printers, at that time 50 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> to have the features of Xerox's proprietary production printing languages PDL and FDL which provide simple variable data printing. Xerox Corporation adopted the idea and developed their work by putting these procedures on Sun Microsystems hosts where the Adobe interpreter also resides. Together, these modules give complete control over the printing engine and data stream.|$|R

The transfer rate is 14.4 kbit/s or higher for modems and some {{fax machines}}, but fax machines support speeds beginning with 2400 bit/s and typically operate at 9600 bit/s. The transferred image formats are called ITU-T (formerly CCITT) fax group 3 or 4. Group 3 faxes have the suffix [...] and the MIME type image/g3fax.|$|R
50|$|A {{less common}} {{measure of the}} speed of a typist, CPM is used to {{identify}} the number of characters typed <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> This is a common measurement for typing programs, or typing tutors, as it can give a more accurate measure of a person's typing speed without having to type for a prolonged period of time. The common conversion factor between WPM and CPM is 5. It is also used occasionally for associating the speed of a reader with the amount they have read. CPM has also been applied to 20th century printers, but modern faster printers more commonly use PPM (<b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute).</b>|$|R
50|$|Konica Minolta OpenAPI {{supports}} {{most new}} Konica Minolta MFPs between the speeds of 20 and 75 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Not all models are supported, and different models have {{different levels of}} support for the API. Despite this, a part of the API is able to query the supported functions and version levels available from the MFP and a stated goal of the API is to allow communication to multiple different devices, without the concern over their exact model - as such, backwards compatibility and conformity across the range is strongly emphasised.|$|R
5000|$|This {{method of}} data {{processing}} involves human operators keying in data {{found on the}} form. The manual process of data entry has many disadvantages in speed, accuracy and cost. Based on average professional typist speeds of 50 to 80 wpm, one could generously estimate about two hundred <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> hour for forms with fifteen one-word fields (not counting the time for reading and sorting pages). In contrast, modern commercial scanners can scan and digitize up to 200 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] The second major disadvantage to manual data entry is the likelihood of typographical errors. When factoring {{in the cost of}} labor and working space, manual data entry is a very inefficient process.|$|R
50|$|Document {{scanners}} have document feeders, usually {{larger than}} those sometimes found on copiers or all-purpose scanners. Scans are made at high speed, perhaps 20 to 150 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> often in grayscale, although many scanners support color. Many scanners can scan both sides of double-sided originals (duplex operation). Sophisticated document scanners have firmware or software that cleans up scans of text as they are produced, eliminating accidental marks and sharpening type; this would be unacceptable for photographic work, where marks cannot reliably be distinguished from desired fine detail. Files created are compressed as they are made.|$|R
5000|$|The semi-mythical NS32732 (sometimes called NS32764), {{originally}} envisioned as the high-performance {{successor to}} the NS32532. This program never came to the market, but a derivative called Swordfish aimed at embedded systems arrived in about 1990. Swordfish had an integrated floating point unit, timers, DMA controllers and other peripherals not normally available in microprocessors. It had a 64-bit databus and was internally overclocked from 25 to 50 MHz. The chief architect of the Swordfish was Donald Alpert, {{who went on to}} manage the architectural team designing the Pentium. The Pentium internal microarchitecture is similar to the preceding Swordfish. The focus of Swordfish was high-end Postscript laserprinters, and performance was exceptional at the time. Competing solutions would produce one new <b>page</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> but the Swordfish demo would happily print out sixteen <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> supported by the laser-engine mechanics, and then on each page print out how much time it was idling, waiting for the engine to complete. The Swordfish die was huge, and it was eventually decided to drop the project altogether, and the product never went into production. The lessons from the Swordfish were used for the CompactRISC designs. In the beginning, there were both a CompactRISC-32 and a CompactRISC-16, designed using [...] "Z". National never brought a chip to the market with the CompactRISC-32 core. National's Research department worked with the University of Michigan to develop the first synthesizable Verilog Model, and Verilog was used from the CR16C and onwards.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line printer}} is an impact printer that prints one entire line of text at a time. It is mostly {{associated}} with unit record {{equipment and the}} early days of digital computing, but the technology is still in use. Print speeds of 600 lines-per-minute (approximately 10 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm. Line printers print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> The different types of line printers are drum printers and chain printers. Other non-impact technologies have also been used, as thermal line printers were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, [...] and some inkjet and laser printers produce output a line or a page at a time.|$|R
50|$|The first {{commercial}} {{implementation of a}} laser printer was the IBM 3800 in 1976. It was designed for data centers, where it replaced line printers attached to mainframe computers. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on continuous stationery, and achieved speeds of 215 <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (ppm), at a resolution of 240 dots per inch (dpi). Over 8,000 of these printers were sold. The Xerox 9700 was brought to market in 1977. Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; but, it did have limited support for the loading of fonts. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut-sheet paper with varying content (e.g. insurance policies).|$|R
