30|$|Attachment theory {{developed}} by (BowlbyI 980 a) explained early childhood development and lays tremendous importance {{that a human}} infant has a biological need for <b>protective</b> <b>attachment</b> figure for survival and absence of such a figure can cause psychological difficulties in the child’s emotional growth. His researches were mostly observations of infants up to formative age (6  years) in a child’s life. To understand and study {{the different types of}} attachments children may have with their parents, Ainsworth and Wittig (1969) developed an assessment technique known as ‘Strange Situation Classification’. This technique was earlier studied by Ainsworth (1967) for Uganda studies and Baltimore studies (Ainsworth et al. 1971).|$|E
40|$|Experiences {{of stress}} and loss occur inevitably and unpredictably over {{the normal course of}} human life, from infancy to old age. Even the birth process itself {{requires}} both the mother and the infant to endure physical and emotional strain and pain. And this is just the beginning, since both mother and baby must adjust and cope with the infant’s inherent helplessness and dependency. No one can survive in this world alone, and the proximity-seeking behavior of young children, based on their biologically based survival instinct, results in the formation of <b>protective</b> <b>attachment</b> relationships (Bowlby, 1969, 1973, 1980). Attachment (whether to parents or to other caretakers) is universal across cultures (Bowlby, 1969; LeVine & Miller, 1990). It serves the four functions of (1) providing a sense of security, (2) regulating affect and arousal, (3) promoting the expression of feelings and communication, and (4) serving as a base for exploration (Davies, 1999). When an attachment relationship is disrupted by separation or death, the child’s development may be compromised, depending on various circumstances (as will be discussed in this and the next chapter). Thus attachment can be a source of both positive and sad feelings. Parkes (1972) has referred to grief as the cost of commitment. When 3...|$|E
40|$|When a tooth sustains a {{luxation}} injury, attachment {{damage of}} varying degrees will occur. In addition, necrosis of the pulp might result, thereby making the pulp space susceptible to infection. Unlike root resorption in primary teeth, which occurs predictably when the permanent tooth erupts, resorption in permanent teeth will occur only under pathologic conditions. This fact {{appears to be}} due to the anti-resorptive properties of the precementum covering of the root that protects it in the presence of inflammation (Figure 1). However, if a luxation injury removes or alters the precementum, the inflammatory response will include root resorption with multinucleated clastic cells in addition to the "usual " bone resorption. Thus, for root resorption to occur, two circumstances must exist: a change must have occurred to the <b>protective</b> <b>attachment</b> layer (precementum externally) of the root and an inflammatory process must be present adjacent to the damaged root surface. Treatment strategies for root resorption include preventing it by recognizing the causes of the root surface injury and avoiding them; minimizing initial inflammation and thus the resorptive consequences by manipulating the inflammatory response; and reversing resorption by eliminating the inflammatory stimulator. External Root Resorption Due to the Injury Alone The luxation injury is the cause of the attachment damage. The byproducts of this mechanical damage stimulate the inflammatory response. The type of tissue that will cover the damaged root surface depends upon the extent of the initial damage. When a tooth sustains a luxation injury, attachment damage of varying degrees will occur. In addition, necrosis of the pulp might result, thereby making the pulp space susceptible to infection. These circumstances can lead to root resorption. Treatment for root resorption includes preventing it by avoiding causes of root surface injury, minimizing initial inflammation, and reversing resorption...|$|E
40|$|Research {{examining}} {{the development of}} online addictions has grown greatly {{over the last decade}} with many studies suggesting both risk factors and protective factors. In an attempt to integrate the theories of attachment and identity formation, the present study investigated the extent to which identity styles and attachment orientations account for three types of online addiction (i. e., internet addiction, online gaming addiction, and social media addiction). The sample comprised 712 Italian students (381 males and 331 females) recruited from schools and universities who completed an offline self-report questionnaire. The findings showed that addictions to the internet, online gaming, and social media were interrelated and were predicted by common underlying risk and protective factors. Among identity styles, 'informational' and 'diffuse-avoidant' styles were risk factors, whereas 'normative' style was a <b>protective</b> factor. Among <b>attachment</b> dimensions, the 'secure' attachment orientation negatively predicted the three online addictions, and a different pattern of causal relationships were observed between the styles underlying 'anxious’ and 'avoidant' attachment orientations. Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that identity styles explained between 21. 2 and 30...|$|R
40|$|Late-adopted {{children}} have often suffered {{a wide range}} of deprivations in their pre-adoption lives. These early adverse experiences can {{have a negative effect on}} children’s attachment representations even after they have been adopted. This study assesses the attachment representations of 61 late-adopted children over the first year of placement, exploring the risk and protective factors of age at placement, length of adoption and gender. The attachment representations were captured using the Manchester Completion Attachment Story Task (MCAST), a doll-play narrative that provides four different attachment classifications – secure, avoidant, ambivalent and disorganised – and three global scorings for disorganisation, mentalising and coherence of mind. The age of adoption was negatively associated with disorganisation, while length of placement was positively correlated with mentalising. Males seemed to be more vulnerable to insecurity and disorganisation than females. The data also suggested that for children placed after the attachment- sensitive phase, the longer the time spent in the adoptive families and being female were <b>protective</b> factors. Moreover, <b>attachment</b> narratives seemed to be a useful tool to explore the inner world of late-adopted children from the first year of placemen...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Adult {{attachment}} {{has been}} suggested to mediate the effect of social support on stress protection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of adult attachment and social support on psychological and endocrine responses to psychosocial stress. Methods: Sixty-three healthy men who were married or cohabiting were randomly assigned to receive either instructed social support from their partner or no social support before being exposed to a standardized psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). Attachment was determined using the Experiences in Close Relationships - Revised questionnaire (ECR-R). State anxiety, mood, and salivary cortisol levels were repeatedly assessed before and after stress. Results: Secure attachment was associated with stronger decreases in state anxiety levels following stress exposure. More importantly, the combination of social support and secure attachment exhibited the lowest anxiety levels after stress (interaction effect). Social support alone reduced cortisol responses to stress, whereas secure attachment did not influence cortisol concentrations. Conclusion: This first study on the interaction of adult attachment and social support in terms of psychological and endocrine stress responses concurs with previous studies suggesting an important <b>protective</b> role of <b>attachment</b> for psychological stress responsiveness. However, attachment did not directly moderate cortisol responses to acute stress...|$|R
40|$|Objective This study {{tested the}} {{specific}} hypothesis that risk factors negatively impact first-year students’ college adjustment and protective factors positively impact first-year students’ college adjustment when controlling for pertinent socio-demographic and psychosocial factors. Methods A correlation design was utilized. An online survey {{was administered to}} first-year college students at a large semi-rural state university. In total, 348 students completed the survey about their experience adjusting to college. A shortened version of the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire measured the dependent variable. Socio-demographic and psychosocial scales and items measured independent and control variables. Three regression models were employed: 1. risk factors, 2. risk and protective factors, and 3. risk, protective, and control factors. Results Risk factors significantly associated with college adjustment included psychiatric medication, fearful-avoidant attachment, and anxious-preoccupied <b>attachment.</b> <b>Protective</b> factors that significantly improved first year college adjustment were resilience, academic self-efficacy, and optimism. Disability was the only control factor that influenced college adjustment. The final model accounted for 54 % of the variance. Notably, risk factors lost their significance after adjusting for protective factors. Conclusions This study is novel to this research domain. It {{is the first to}} frame contributing factors to first year college adjustment in terms of risk and protective factors and to focus only on first-year students. This study demonstrates that strengths can compensate for vulnerabilities. A clinical implication of these findings is that mental health professionals need to assess and enhance protective factors in an effort to improve first year college adjustment, which is likely to impact graduation rates...|$|R
40|$|Child maltreatment is a {{pervasive}} societal concern that has affected countless young people, families, communities and nations with detrimental effects at the physical, psychological, neurobiological and social levels. Despite exposure to chronic adversity, a remarkable {{number of individuals}} are able to display resilience and demonstrate positive adaptation following their experience of trauma. This thesis aims to {{examine the impact of}} attachment and coping styles in the context of resilience following child maltreatment utilising a systemic framework. Chapter One provides an overview of the theoretical literature relating to resilience, attachment, coping and child maltreatment. Chapter Two explores the construct of resilience and critiques the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC; Connor & Davidson, 2003) {{as one of the few}} standardised measures of resilience. This measure focuses on assessing internal factors that promote positive adaptation following adversity with little attention given to external or systemic drivers in the resilience building process. In order to understand the <b>protective</b> role of <b>attachment</b> and coping and its impact upon resilience at multiple levels of functioning, Chapter Three presents a systematic review that explores the literature on the effects of attachment and/or coping styles on resilience following child maltreatment within the framework of a socio-ecological approach with a particular emphasis on female experiences. Chapter Four presents an empirical paper exploring the impact of multiple maltreatment experiences (victimisation, perpetration and abuse types) upon attachment, coping and resilience with an exclusively female sample. Chapter Five summarises the conclusions and limitations from all the chapters in the thesis discussion...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{addressed}} {{the implications of}} concordance versus discrepancy of attachment representations in individuals at 2 stages in their marital relationships. Engaged (n 157) and dating (n 101) couples participated in a multimethod 6 -year longitudinal study of adult attachment. Individuals completed the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), the Current Relationship Interview (CRI), and various questionnaires and were observed in interactions with partners. On the basis of AAI and CRI classifications, participants were placed in one of four groups: SecureAAI/SecureCRI, SecureAAI/InsecureCRI, InsecureAAI/SecureCRI, or InsecureAAI/InsecureCRI. Each of the configurations showed a particular pattern of behavior, feelings about relationships and the self, and likelihood of relationship breakup. The findings of the studies address important points about the <b>protective</b> effects of <b>attachment</b> security and have interesting implications for the extension of attachment theory into adulthood. The value of attachment theory in understanding marriage rests {{in large part on}} the theory’s emphasis on links between childhood relationships and later marital success, “links [...] . that are under-emphasized in or absent from exchange or behavioral theories” (Karney & Bradbury, 1995, p. 6). However, attachment theory has been criticized for its failure to describe how personal history and individual differences “affect the development of a marriage once two people with different relationship needs come together ” (Kar-ney & Bradbury, 1995, p. 6). The goal of the attachment behavioral system is to promote safety (and felt security) through a secure base relationship with an attachment figure. The theory focuses on how relationships with attachment figures have an impact on development, adaptive func-tioning, stress management, safety, and well-being. The attach-ment system provides an organizational framework for requesting help when needed and for recognizing requests for help and providing support (Crowell, Treboux, Gao, et al., 2002). Given this function, individual differences in attachment organization can be expected {{to play a role in}} the development of marriage and the challenges faced by couples (Paley, Cox, Harter, & Margand...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that {{stressful life events}} are strongly linked with negative adjustment indices in adolescence (e. g., Compas & Phares, 1991; Kim, Conger, Elder, & Lorenz, 2003; Waaktaar, Borge, Fundingsrud, Christie, & Torgersen, 2004). Less is known about how different types of life stressors (i. e., dependent versus independent) impact adjustment over time for normative populations of adolescents. An important area for exploration is that of protective/vulnerability factors in adolescents who have endured stressful life events. A promising area of exploration is the moderating role of the adolescent-mother attachment relationship as a protective factor against stressful life events. Relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to distinguishing between negative and positive adjustment outcomes in exploring these associations. The purpose of this short-term longitudinal study was to investigate the role of attachment quality in the associations between stressful life events (dependent and independent) and adjustment outcomes (positive and negative) with a normative population of adolescents. Multilevel modeling was used to examine these interrelationships and adjustment growth curves. A total of 183 adolescents (n = 96 girls; M age (entire sample) at T 1 = 13. 0 years, SD = 0. 72; M age at T 3 = 14. 8 years, SD = 0. 66) completed an attachment questionnaire, a stressful life events scale, and negative adjustment (depressive symptoms, delinquency) and positive adjustment (responsive caregiving, positive affect) questionnaires. Results indicated that both types of life stressors were important predictors of positive and negative adjustment outcomes. Consistent with previous findings, dependent life events were more strongly linked with depressive symptoms than independent life events. Independent life stress in interaction with attachment was significantly associated with changes in adjustment over time. <b>Protective</b> combinations of <b>attachment</b> with life stressors included lower attachment anxiety with higher independent life stress, which was associated with higher positive affect. More vulnerable combinations included higher attachment avoidance with higher attachment anxiety which was associated with the highest increase in delinquency over time. Results support the importance of specificity of life stressors and specificity of types of adjustment outcomes. Implications for adolescent intervention and prevention programs are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|People do {{not express}} jealousy through a single emotion {{or a single}} behavior.They instead express jealousy through diverse {{emotions}} and behaviors, which {{makes it difficult to}} form a scientific definition of jealousy. Scientists instead define jealousy in their own words, as illustrated by the following examples:* [...] "Romantic jealousy is here defined as a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions which follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship, when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival." [...] (White, 1981, p. 24)* [...] "Jealousy, then, is any aversive reaction that occurs {{as the result of a}} partner's extradyadic relationship that is real, imagined, or considered likely to occur." [...] (Bringle & Buunk, 1991, page 135)* [...] "Jealousy is conceptualized as a cognitive, emotional, and behavioral response to a relationship threat. In the case of sexual jealousy, this threat emanates from knowing or suspecting that one's partner has had (or desires to have) sexual activity with a third party. In the case of emotional jealousy, an individual feels threatened by her or his partner's emotional involvement with and/or love for a third party." [...] (Guerrero, Spitzberg, & Yoshimura, 2004, page 311)* [...] "Jealousy is defined as a protective reaction to a perceived threat to a valued relationship, arising from a situation in which the partner's involvement with an activity and/or another person is contrary to the jealous person's definition of their relationship." [...] (Bevan, 2004, page 195)* [...] "Jealousy is triggered by the threat of separation from, or loss of, a romantic partner, when that threat is attributed to the possibility of the partner's romantic interest in another person." [...] (Sharpteen & Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 628)These definitions of jealousy share two basic themes. First, all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual, a partner, and a perception of a third party or rival. Second, all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people, or a dyad. Jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and/or behaviors that are assumed to be <b>protective</b> for their <b>attachment</b> relationships. These themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies.|$|R
