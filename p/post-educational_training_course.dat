40|$|Abstract Background Physicians require {{specific}} communication skills, {{because the}} face-to-face {{contact with their}} patients is {{an important source of}} information. Although physicians who perform work disability assessments attend some communication-related <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> during their professional education, no specialised and evidence-based communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> is available for them. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: 1) to systematically develop a <b>training</b> <b>course</b> aimed at improving the communication skills of physicians during work disability assessment interviews with disability claimants, and 2) to plan an evaluation of the <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> Methods A physician-tailored communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> was developed, according to the six steps of the Intervention Mapping protocol. Data were collected from questionnaire studies among physicians and claimants, a focus group study among physicians, a systematic review of the literature, and meetings with various experts. Determinants and performance objectives were formulated. A concept version of the <b>training</b> <b>course</b> was discussed with several experts before the final <b>training</b> <b>course</b> programme was established. The evaluation plan was developed by consulting experts, social insurance physicians, researchers, and policy-makers, and discussing with them the options for evaluation. Results A two-day post-graduate communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> was developed, aimed at improving professional communication during work disability assessment interviews. Special focus was on active teaching strategies, such as practising the skills in role-play. An adoption and implementation plan was formulated, in which the infrastructure of the educational department of the institute that employs the physicians was utilised. Improvement in the skills and knowledge of the physicians who will participate in the <b>training</b> <b>course</b> will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Conclusions The feasibility and practical relevance of the communication skills <b>training</b> <b>course</b> that was developed seem promising. Such a course may be relevant for physicians in many countries who perform work disability assessments. The development of the first <b>training</b> <b>course</b> of this type represents an important advancement in this field. </p...|$|R

40|$|As {{more and}} more service {{providers}} working in addictions {{and mental health services}} in Ireland are reporting an increase in individuals presenting with dual diagnosis, {{there is a need for}} training these professionals. The dual diagnosis <b>training</b> <b>course</b> developed by the authors is the only continuing professional development <b>training</b> <b>course</b> available to these professionals in Ireland., In this paper, we describe the first group of participants' evaluation of the dual diagnosis <b>training</b> <b>course,</b> which was delivered to service providers working with dual diagnosis service users., Participants found the <b>training</b> <b>course</b> to be motivating and valuable to their work practice. Since completing this <b>training</b> <b>course,</b> participants were more confident in working with dual diagnosis service users., Service user involvement, use of various teaching methods and the opportunity for inter-agency networking are important components of inter-professional <b>training</b> <b>courses.,</b> Abstract A <b>training</b> <b>course</b> on dual diagnosis was developed within the Irish forensic mental health service, to bridge the gap in the lack of training on dual diagnosis in Ireland. The course was designed for service providers within mental health and addiction services. Twenty participants involving nursing, social work, police and social welfare disciplines attended the first <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> A mixed methodology research design was adapted to describe participants' evaluation of the <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> Data were collected using multiple methods: pre- and post-test, daily evaluation and focus group interviews. Quantitative data were analysed using the spss Version 16. 0 and qualitative data were analysed thematically. Findings from the pre- and post-test suggest an increase in participants' knowledge of dual diagnosis and an increase in confidence in conducting groups. Daily evaluation indicates that the course content largely met participants' needs. Finally, three themes emerged from the focus group interview: increased confidence, the training course/teaching methods and personal/organizational challenges. This study implies that service providers within mental health and addiction services benefit from inter-professional, needs and skills based courses incorporating a variety of teaching methods.

Methods: Three types of <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> were conducted in this programme including; five – day, ten – day and bimonthly <b>training</b> <b>courses.</b> Each of the <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> contained theoretical and prac­tical sections and training impact was evaluated by practical examination and multiple-choice quizzes through pre and post tests. Results: Distribution pattern of the participants in the training and refresher <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> showed that the most participants were from Sistan & Baluchistan and Hormozgan provinces where malaria is endemic and most cases of the infection come out from these malarious areas. A total of 695 identified individuals were participated in the <b>training</b> <b>courses.</b> A significant conversely correlation was found between conducting malaria microscopy <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> and annual malaria cases in Iran.
