25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and <b>promegestone.</b> Quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Promegestone</b> (INN) (brand name Surgestone), {{also known}} as 17α,21-dimethyl-Δ9-19-norprogesterone or 17α,21-dimethyl-19-norpregna-4,9-diene-3,20-dione, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-norprogesterone group which was introduced in 1983 and is marketed in France, Portugal, and Argentina. Indications include gynaecological conditions caused by luteal insufficiency, including premenopausal disorders, dysmenorrhea, and premenstrual syndrome. <b>Promegestone</b> has weak glucocorticoid activity, but does not bind to the androgen receptor or possess antimineralocorticoid activity. In addition, <b>promegestone</b> {{has been found to}} act as a non-competitive antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, similarly to progesterone. The drug is mainly bound to albumin; it does not bind to sex hormone-binding globulin, and binds only weakly to transcortin.|$|E
50|$|Trimegestone (INN) (brand names Ondeva, Totelle Sekvens (both in {{combination}} with estrogen)) is a steroidal progestin of the 19-norprogesterone group related to <b>promegestone</b> which is marketed in Europe as a hormonal contraceptive and for use in hormonal replacement therapy for postmenopausal symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Trimegestone {{is closely}} related {{structurally}} to the 19-norprogesterone and 17α-methylprogesterone derivatives demegestone and <b>promegestone</b> and {{is also known as}} 21-hydroxypromegestone.

In addition, the testosterone analogue of 19-norprogesterone, 19-nortestosterone (also known as nandrolone), is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and progestogen, and is the parent compound of a large group of AAS and progestins that includes norethisterone.|$|E
50|$|The {{observation}} of two-fold improved potency of 17α-MP relative to progesterone led to {{renewed interest in}} 17α-substituted derivatives of progesterone. Subsequently, hydroxyprogesterone acetate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate were synthesized in 1953 and introduced in 1956 and 1957, respectively, and medroxyprogesterone acetate was discovered in 1956 and introduced in 1959. In addition, though 17α-MP itself was never introduced for medical use, progestogen derivatives of the compound, including medrogestone (1966) and the 19-norprogesterone derivatives demegestone (1974), <b>promegestone</b> (1983), and trimegestone (2001), have been marketed.|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{defined a}} cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC; ATVLNYYVWRDNS) in the carboxyl terminus of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an {{outer mitochondrial membrane}} protein involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport into the mitochondria, the rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. We examined (i) the PBR–cholesterol interaction by UV crosslinking of the C 17 side-chain containing progestin, <b>promegestone,</b> and (ii) {{the role of the}} CRAC domain of PBR in Leydig cell steroidogenesis by using a transducible peptide composed of the TAT domain of HIV and the CRAC domain of PBR. [3 H]Promegestone photoincorporated into recombinant PBR, and this labeling was displaced by cholesterol. [3 H]Promegestone also photoincorporated into the TAT-CRAC peptide. [3 H]Promegestone crosslinking to TAT-CRAC could be displaced by cholesterol and <b>promegestone,</b> with IC 50 values of 1 and 200 μM, respectively. TAT-CRAC efficiently transduced into MA- 10 Leydig cells and inhibited the hCG- and cAMP-stimulated steroid production in a dose-dependent manner. TAT-CRAC did not affect the hCG-induced cAMP synthesis and the 22 R-hydroxycholesterol-supported steroidogenesis. Mutated TAT-CRAC lost its ability to bind [3 H]promegestone and to inhibit the hCG-stimulated steroidogenesis. These results show that TAT-CRAC binds cholesterol and competes for cholesterol interaction with endogenous PBR, suggesting that the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain of PBR is responsible for taking up and bringing steroidogenic cholesterol into the mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|When MCF- 7 {{cells were}} treated with 17 beta-esiradiol, dexamethasone, or <b>promegestone</b> at 37 degrees C, the K-D of receptors for their cognate ligands was found to {{decrease}} as compared to that measured at 2 degrees C. Cell incubation with hormone at 37 degrees C {{did not affect the}} B-max of glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors, but caused a 40 % increase of that of estrogen receptor. This increase required the presence of ligand, was insensitive to cycloheximide, and was completed within 10 min of cell incubation at physiological temperature. We conclude that an early step of estrogen action is the recruitment of pre-existing receptor molecules through activation of their binding capacity...|$|E
40|$|Progesterone (P 4) {{has been}} {{reported}} to inhibit oxytocin (OT) binding to its receptor in isolated murine endometrial mem-branes. The purpose of the present research was to 1) examine the in vivo and in vitro effect of P 4 on the binding of OT to its receptor in the ovine endometrium and 2) determine whether the endometrial plasma membranes have high-affinity binding sites for P 4. Ovariectomized ewes were pretreated with a se-quence of estradiol- 17 b (2 days) and P 4 (5 days) before being treated with estradiol- 17 b plus either vehicle (corn oil), P 4, or P 4 1 mifepristone (RU 486) for 3 consecutive days. Treatment of ewes with 10 mg P 4 /day for 3 days suppressed binding of OT (P, 0. 01) compared with that of controls, whereas concomi-tant treatment with the progestin antagonist RU 486 (10 mg/ day) blocked the effect of P 4. Similarly, incubation of endome-trial plasma membranes with P 4 (5 ng/ml) inhibited binding of OT (P, 0. 05), whereas this effect of P 4 was blocked by the presence of RU 486 (10 ng/ml). By radioreceptor assay, the en-dometrial plasma membranes were found to contain a high-af-finity binding site for P 4 and the progestin agonist <b>promegestone</b> (Kd 1. 2 3 1029 and 1. 74 3 10210 M, respectively). Incubation of endometrial plasma membranes with P 4 (5 ng/ml) significantly increased the concentration of progestin binding sites. Binding of labeled <b>promegestone</b> (R 5020) was competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled R 5020, P 4, RU 486, and OT but not by estradiol- 17 b, cortisol, testosterone, and arginine vasopressin. These data suggest a direct suppressive action of P 4 on the bind-ing of OT to OT receptors in the ovine endometrial plasma membrane. mechanisms of hormone action, oxytocin, progesterone, proges-terone receptor, uteru...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of {{progesterone}} (P 4) synthesis by cumulus cells during bovine {{in vitro}} oocyte maturation (IVM) causes {{a decrease in}} subsequent embryo development, indicating that P 4 intracellular signaling within the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) is important for oocyte developmental competence. The aim {{of the present study}} was to further elucidate, on a protein level, the downstream signaling pathway involved in P 4 regulation of oocyte developmental competence. COCs were subjected to IVM for 24 h in the presence or absence of trilostane, aglepristone, or <b>promegestone</b> (R 5020). These altered IVM conditions resulted in dynamic changes in protein expression of the progesterone receptors and the cell death-regulated proteins AVEN, BCL-xL, and active caspase 3. In addition, AVEN protein localization, caspase 3 activation, and mitochondrial distribution were studied by immunofluores-cence. Inhibition of progesterone synthesis (trilostane treatment) resulted in changes in AVEN localization within the COC, corresponding to caspase 3 activation and altered mitochondrial distribution. AVEN was also found to bind BCL-xL in COCs, but this interaction was lost following treatment with trilostane. apoptosis, cow, developmental competence, egg quality, in vitro maturation, progesterone receptor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: Sulfotransferases {{are present}} in normal and {{cancerous}} human breast tissues. The {{purpose of this article}} is to present a hypothetical correlation of sulfotransferase activity with proliferation in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Sulfotransferases were evaluated in breast cancer cells by determining the transformation of non-conjugated estrogens to the sulfates. Proliferation was evaluated by the action on cell growth or the size of a transplanted tumor. The effect was obtained using the progestins: nomegestrol acetate, <b>promegestone,</b> and medrogestone, as well as tibolone and its metabolites at concentrations of 5 x 10 – 5 to 5 x 10 – 9 M. Results: A possible correlation of sulfotransferase activity stimulation and cell growth inhibition provoked by the various progestins used, or by tibolone and its metabolites was shown. Conclusion: It is suggested that the antiproliferative effect of these compounds could be related to the decrease of bioactive estradiol by the formation of its biologically inactive sulfate as a consequence of the stimulatory effect by the various progestins or tibolone on sulfotransferase activity.

40|$|A {{progesterone}} receptor (PR) {{in human}} uterine cervical nuclei was demonstrated by a nuclear exchange assay using a synthetic progestin, <b>promegestone</b> (R 5020) as a radio-labeled ligand. Total exchange of previously bound progesterone with R 5020 {{was achieved by}} incubation at 0 degree C for 3 h. A 0. 6 M KCl solution was used to extract the nuclear PR in uterine cervical tissue, and the dextran coated charcoal (DCC) method was used to separate the free [3 H] R 5020 from the bound form. Scatchard plots of nuclear PR binding showed two components with dissociation constants of Kd = 2. 3 X 10 (- 10) and 4. 6 X 10 (- 9) M. Three histological regions of the uterine cervix was studied as to their nuclear PR contents throughout the menstrual cycle. In the follicular phase, the connective tissue (CT) had the highest PR concentration (658. 9 fmole/mg DNA), followed by the columnar epithelium (CE) (253. 6 fmole/mg DNA), and the squamous epithelium (SE) (184. 7 fmole/mg DNA). In the luteal phase, {{there was no significant}} difference among the three regions. Comparing these phases of cycle revealed that the CT had higher PR contents in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase, but no such difference was found in the CE or SE. These three regions had the same Kd value in both phases. </p...|$|E
40|$|The active {{metabolite}} {{of vitamin}} A, retinoic acid (RA), {{plays an important}} role in the female reproductive system. The synthesis of RA is tightly regulated by the activity of retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (Raldh). Among these, Raldh 1 and Raldh 2 exhibit specific temporal and spatial expression patterns in the mouse uterus, both during the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy. In the present study, we have assessed whether oestradiol and progesterone directly influence the uterine expression of Raldh 1 and Raldh 2 in ovariectomised mice. We investigated the effect of gestagen (<b>promegestone</b> 0. 3 mg kg(- 1) bodyweight), oestrogen (oestradiol 3 microg kg(- 1) bodyweight) and their combination on the uterine expression of Raldh 2. Expression was analysed using in situ hybridisation and quantified using real-time detection reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results show that the expression of Raldh 2 is rapidly (within 1 - 4 h) induced in stromal cells by oestrogen, but not by gestagen, treatment, whereas combined oestrogen + gestagen treatment leads to a more prolonged (48 h) response. In contrast, oestrogen, but not progesterone, treatment downregulates (within 4 - 24 h) Raldh 1 expression in the uterine glandular epithelium. We conclude that the uterine RA concentrations are regulated by oestrogens via an effect on the expression of the Raldh synthesising enzymes. Such a regulation is consistent with the natural fluctuations of Raldh expression during the oestrous cycle, early pregnancy and blastocyst implantation...|$|E
40|$|Adrenalectomized rats {{displayed}} a deficiency in retention of an immobility response acquired during an initial 15 -min forced swimming procedure (Porsolt swimming test) and measured 24 h {{later in a}} 5 -min retest session. The deficit could be restored dose dependently with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (microgram range) administered 15 min after the initial test. The antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 administered subcutaneously (1 and 10 mg/kg) inhibited the dexamethasone effect and caused a parallel shift in the dose-response curve of dexamethasone. Intracerebroventricular administration of RU 38486 to intact rats immediately before the initial test attenuated retention of acquired immobility over a 100, 000 -fold lower dose range (ng) and increased the plasma corticosterone level. Local administration of 1 ng RU 38486 in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus also diminished the percentage immobility, but did not influence the adrenocortical response. Injections of RU 38486 in parafascicular and paraventricular nucleus were ineffective on behaviour. In the latter nucleus the antiglucocorticoid disinhibited {{the activity of the}} hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with <b>promegestone</b> did not interfere with RU 38486 action, ruling out involvement of its antiprogestin properties. Intracerebroventricular or subcutaneous treatment of intact rats with the antimineralocorticoid RU 28318 was not effective. Finally, adrenalectomized rats replaced with corticosterone delivered via subcutaneously implanted 100 -mg corticosterone pellets showed normal behavioural performance, while a 25 -mg implant did not. The present study with local infusions of RU 38486 indicates that glucocorticoid feedback via type 2 receptors exerts a long-term influence on behaviour in the hippocampus and controls the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in the paraventricular nucleus...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{retinoic acid}} (RA) synthesizing enzymes, {{retinaldehyde}} dehydrogenases (RALDH), {{are expressed in}} specific spatial and temporal patterns in uterine tissues during estrous cycle and early pregnancy in mice. Expression of RALDH 1 and 2 {{has been shown to}} be induced by estrogen treatment within the uterus. In this study, we determined the influence of progesterone and 17 -ss-estradiol on the uterine expression of the RA-metabolizing enzyme CYP 26 A 1 after specific time intervals (1, 4, 24, and 48 hr after treatment of ovariectomized mice). In a following experiment, we investigated the influence of gestagen (<b>promegestone</b> 0. 3 mg/kg body weight), estrogen (estradiol 3 microg/kg), their combination, as well as the antagonizing anti-progesterone hormone (RU 486 10 mg/kg) on the uterine expression of CYP 26 A 1. Expression of CYP 26 A 1 was localized using in situ hybridization and quantified using RT-PCR. CYP 26 A 1 mRNA expression was strongly [...] although transiently [...] induced in uterine endometrial epithelial and glandular cells after administration of gestagen or the combination of gestagen + estrogen, but not by estrogen alone. These observations were confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments on whole uteri. Thus, we show that the expression of CYP 26 A 1 in endometrial epithelial cells is regulated by progesterone and not significantly influenced by co-administration of estrogen. These data indicate an additional level of hormonal control of endogenous RA levels in the mouse uterus, where its synthesis would rely on estrogen-dependent expression of RALDH enzymes, whereas its active metabolism would be triggered by progesterone-induced CYP 26 A 1 expression...|$|E
40|$|Sebaceous glands were {{isolated}} by manual dissection {{under a microscope}} from surgical specimens of scalp skin with male pattern baldness and skin specimens of hairy and bald scalp obtained at autopsy. The 800 × g pellet (nuclear fraction) and the 164, 000 × g supernatant fraction (cytosol) of homogenates of the sebaceous glands were used for measurements of androgen binding characteristics, using dextrancoated charcoal and sucrose gradient methods. Scatchard plots showed high affinity binding for [3 H]dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and [3 H]methyltrienolone (R 1881). Nuclei prepared from bald scalp contained greater total androgen binding capacity than nuclei of hairy scalp, although Kd values of type I binding were similar (0. 68 vs 0. 56 nM, respectively). On sucrose gradient, the binding protein from cytosol {{was found in the}} 7 to 8 S density range. Androgen binding by cytosol of sebaceous glands of hairy scalp had Kd of 1. 89 ±. 79 and 2. 05 ±. 56 nM for DHT and R 1881, respectively, and Bmax of 18. 7 ± 4. 4 and 20. 0 ± 4. 6 fmol/mg protein for DHT and R 1881, respectively. Cytosol from sebaceous glands of bald scalp had Kd values approximately half those of hairy scalp, and Bmax values 50 %– 100 % higher. The bound 3;H labeled DHT and R 1881 could be partially displaced by testosterone (40 – 50 %), moxestrol (28 – 32 %), <b>promegestone</b> (19 – 26 %), and Δ 4 -androstenedione (6 – 12 %), but not by dehydroepiandrosterone. These data demonstrate the presence of specific androgen binding protein in sebaceous glands, and that sebaceous glands of bald scalp have greater binding affinity and capacity for androgens than those in hairy scalp. This difference may explain the greater androgenic response in androgenic alopecia...|$|E
40|$|The {{inside of}} the fallopian tube is covered with {{epithelial}} cells. These cells {{are involved in the}} transportation of oocytes and sperms in the tube and are important for fertilization to occur. The hormone progesterone has been tested for its effect on the ciliary activity in the fallopian tube and previous studies have shown that progesterone reduces the ciliary beat frequency (CBF). There are (at least) two types of progesterone receptors present in the fallopian tube, the membrane progesterone receptors, mPRs and the nuclear progesterone receptor, nPR. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine which of these receptors that regulate the CBF. Different hormones, specific for a certain receptor or group of receptors, were used to measure the CBF in mouse ex vivo. The fallopian tube was dissected and chopped in small pieces for exposure of the cilia. Each tissue sample was investigated based on ciliary activity by an inverted bright field microscope and a high speed camera. After addition of a certain hormone the change in CBF was recorded during 60 minutes. Progesterone with a concentration of 30 nM gave an average decrease in CBF, - 1. 4 Hz (p= 0. 03). <b>Promegestone</b> R 5020 is an agonist for nPR and gave a reduction in CBF, - 3. 13 Hz (p= 0. 0046) for the concentration 100 nM. An agonist for the mPR, substance X, was tested and gave no significant change in CBF. Mifepristone RU 486 works as an antagonist for nPR and gave no significant change in CBF. The reduction in CBF by progesterone seen in this study is in agreement with that from previous studies. Reduction in ciliary activity by R 5020 gives a clue to the involvement of nPR in the regulation of CBF in the fallopian tube in mouse. Based on the measurements performed in this study the mPR does not seem to be involved in the regulation of CBF...|$|E
40|$|Estrogens can {{be labeled}} with the positron-emitting {{radionuclide}} fluorine- 18 (t 1 / 2 = 110 min) by fluoride ion (n-Bu 4 N 18 F) displacement of a 16 β-trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate) derivative of the corresponding estrone 3 -triflate, and purification by HPLC. That sequence {{has been used}} to synthesize the 11 β-methoxy 1 and 11 β-ethyl 2 analogues of the breast tumor imaging agent, 16 α-(18 F) fluoro- 17 β-estradiol (FES). Tissue distribution studies of 1 and 2 in immature female rats show high selectivity for target tissue (T, uterus) vs non-target (NT, muscle and lung), with T/NT ratios being 43 and 17 at one hour after injection for 1 and 2, respectively. The parent estrogen FES has previously been shown to display an intermediate value for tissue selectivity. The progestin 21 -(18 F) fluoro- 16 α-ethyl- 19 -norprogesterone (FENP), synthesized from the 21 -triflate precursor, is a high affinity ligand for the progestin receptor, and in vivo, exhibits highly selective uptake by the uterus of estrogen-primed rats. Respective T/NT ratios of 16 and 41 at one and 3 hours after injection have been demonstrated. Two epimeric (at C- 21) analogues of the high affinity progestin <b>promegestone</b> (R 5020) were prepared in fluorine- 18 labeled form from the corresponding triflate precursors; while 21 S-(18 F) R 5020 3 showed a T/NT ratio of 4 at 3 hours after injection, 21 R-(18 F) R 5020 4 showed no selective uptake. Compounds 3 and 4 each suffered extensive in vivo defluorination. Derivatives of the high affinity Type I and Type II corticosteroid receptor ligands RU 26752 and RU 28362, respectively, were prepared in fluorine- 18 labeled form from the corresponding 3 '-methanesulfonates. Neither labeled compound showed selective target tissue (brain) uptake and each underwent substantial in vivo defluorination. 1, 2 -(3 H 2) RU 26752 was also synthesized (52 Ci/mmol) as a potential Type I receptor probe. These fluorine- 18 labeled steroids can be prepared within 2 hours of the end of bombardment, and their specific activities range from 500 - 4000 Ci/mmol. The high target tissue selectivities and uterine uptake values for 1, 2 and FENP suggest that these compounds may be useful for in vivo imaging of estrogen and progestin target tissues and tumors (such as human breast tumors) by positron emission tomography.
