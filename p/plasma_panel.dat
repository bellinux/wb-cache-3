50|$|In a {{monochrome}} <b>plasma</b> <b>panel,</b> the gas {{is mostly}} neon, {{and the color}} is the characteristic orange of a neon-filled lamp (or sign). Once a glow discharge has been initiated in a cell, it can be maintained by applying a low-level voltage between all the horizontal and vertical electrodes-even after the ionizing voltage is removed. To erase a cell all voltage is removed {{from a pair of}} electrodes. This type of panel has inherent memory. A small amount of nitrogen is added to the neon to increase hysteresis. In color panels, the back of each cell is coated with a phosphor. The ultraviolet photons emitted by the plasma excite these phosphors, which give off visible light with colors determined by the phosphor materials. This aspect is comparable to fluorescent lamps and to the neon signs that use colored phosphors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>panel</b> sensors are micropattern gaseous {{radiation}} detectors {{which are}} based on the technology of plasma display panels. This thesis summarizes the research that had been done on commercially available plasma display panels that were converted to <b>plasma</b> <b>panel</b> sensor prototypes and describes the construction of a two-dimensional tracker consisting of four of those prototypes, with one-dimensional readout on each, used to detect tracks of cosmic muons. A large amount of 2 -point as well as 3 and 4 -point tracks were detected. Qualitative analyses as well as Pearson’s χ 2 tests are performed on the track angular distribution and on a histogram of the linearity measure of 3 -point tracks to reject the hypothesis that these tracks result from completely random panel hits. Some RF noise effects contributing to false positives are ruled out, while it is shown that other effects can be ruled out only with a high-intensity minimum ionizing particle source. A significant part of the tracker construction was the development of a software toolbox to acquire and analyze signals coming from <b>plasma</b> <b>panel</b> sensor devices, which enables long-term monitoring of various aspects of the experiment. The software can be used in future tracking experiments and in other scenarios of data acquisition from <b>plasma</b> <b>panel</b> sensor devices.

40|$|Abstract–A {{new type}} of highly-pixelated, photon {{counting}} radiation detector is described based on the integration of a photocathode into a <b>plasma</b> <b>panel</b> sensor (PPS). This device called a <b>plasma</b> <b>panel</b> photosensor (or PPPS) should be low cost as it can directly leverage off of the fabrication and materials technologies employed in plasma display panels (PDP’s) and photomultiplier tubes (PMT’s). When optically coupled to a scintillator, the device becomes a PPPS-scintillation detector. The PPS, PPPS and PPPS-scintillation detector all hold promise for high sensitivity with gains {{on the order of}} 1011, high positional and pixel resolutions approaching 10 µm, and fast picosecond to nanosecond response times. Although the PPPS in some ways resembles a flat-PMT or a micropattern detector, it is not an analog device as it does not operate in the proportional region and in this sense resembles an avalanche photodiode. The PPS and PPPS, as <b>plasma</b> <b>panel</b> devices operating in the Geiger region, are digital detectors with the potential to expand beyond the capability of micropattern detector technology for a host of applications covering ionizing particles and photons, as well as non-ionizing photons.
