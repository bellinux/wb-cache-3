5000|$|Older {{televisions}} for <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> {{systems were}} sometimes {{equipped with a}} peak video signal inverter that would turn the white interference spots dark. This was usually user-adjustable with a control on {{the rear of the}} television labeled [...] "White Spot Limiter" [...] in Britain or [...] "Antiparasite" [...] in France. If adjusted incorrectly it would turn bright white picture content dark. Most of the <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> television systems ceased operation by the mid-1980s. The French System L continued on up to the transition to digital broadcasting. <b>Positive</b> <b>modulation</b> was one of several unique technical features that originally protected the French electronics and broadcasting industry from foreign competition and rendered French TV sets incapable of receiving broadcasts from neighboring countries.|$|E

50|$|L: Used only in France. On VHF Band 1 only, {{the audio}} is at −6.5 MHz. Discontinued in 2011, when France transitioned to digital. It {{was the last}} system to use <b>positive</b> video <b>modulation</b> and AM sound.|$|R

50|$|Another {{parameter}} of analog television systems, minor by comparison, is {{the choice}} of whether vision modulation is positive or negative. Some of the earliest electronic television systems such as the British 405-line (system A) used <b>positive</b> <b>modulation.</b> It was also used in the two Belgian systems (system C, 625 lines, and System F, 819 lines) and the two French systems (system E, 819 lines, and system L, 625 lines). In <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> systems, as in the earlier white facsimile transmission standard, the maximum luminance value {{is represented by the}} maximum carrier power; in negative modulation, the maximum luminance value is represented by zero carrier power. All newer analog video systems use negative modulation {{with the exception of the}} French System L.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of negative modulation is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum carrier power, {{it is relatively}} easy to arrange the receiver automatic gain control to only operate during sync pulses and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set. This was not possible for many years with <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> as the peak carrier power varied depending on picture content. Modern digital processing circuits have achieved a similar effect but using the front porch of the video signal.|$|E
50|$|Some {{have argued}} that the primary {{motivation}} for the development of SECAM in France was to protect French television equipment manufacturers. However, incompatibility had started with the earlier unusual decision to adopt <b>positive</b> video <b>modulation</b> for French broadcast signals. The earlier systems System A & the 819-line systems were the only other systems to use <b>positive</b> video <b>modulation.</b> In addition, SECAM development predates PAL. NTSC was considered undesirable in Europe because of its tint problem requiring an additional control, which SECAM and PAL solved. Nonetheless, SECAM was partly developed for reasons of national pride. Henri de France's personal charisma and ambition may have been a contributing factor. PAL was developed by Telefunken, a German company, and in the post-war De Gaulle era there would have been much political resistance to dropping a French-developed system and adopting a German-developed one instead.|$|R
50|$|For example, the GABAA {{receptor}} has two active {{sites that}} the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binds, {{but also has}} benzodiazepine and general anaesthetic agent regulatory binding sites. These regulatory sites can each produce <b>positive</b> allosteric <b>modulation,</b> potentiating the activity of GABA. Diazepam is an agonist at the benzodiazepine regulatory site, and its antidote flumazenil is an antagonist.|$|R

5000|$|Impulsive noise, {{especially}} from older automotive ignition systems, caused white spots {{to appear on}} the screens of television receivers using <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> but they could use simple synchronization circuits. Impulsive noise in negative modulation systems appears as dark spots that are less visible, but picture synchronization was seriously degraded when using simple synchronization. The synchronization problem was overcome with the invention of phase-locked synchronization circuits. When these first appeared in Britain in the early 1950s one name used to describe them was [...] "flywheel synchronisation." ...|$|E
50|$|The use of AM (rather than FM) {{for sound}} {{and the use of}} {{positive}} (rather than negative) video modulation made 405-line signals very prone to visible impulse interference, such as that generated by the ignition systems of vehicles. Such interference manifested itself as a loud popping on sound and large bright spots on the picture, which viewers found much more noticeable than the dark spots encountered when such interference is encountered on a signal using negative video modulation. With <b>positive</b> <b>modulation,</b> interference could easily be of similar amplitude to the sync pulses (which were represented by 0-30% of the transmitter output). The early time-base circuits were less able to discriminate between the signals and the picture would break up. By contrast, in negative modulation sync, pulses represent peak transmitter output (70-100% output). As a result, impulse interference would cause visual dark spots before it was large enough to affect the synchronisation of the picture. If the interference was large enough, the picture was probably unwatchable anyway. The later introduction of flywheel sync circuits rendered the picture much more stable, but these could have alleviated some of the problems with <b>positive</b> <b>modulation.</b> Almost all television systems that succeeded the 405-line system adopted negative modulation for this reason alone.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{successful}} {{trials of}} a [...] "high-definition" [...] 455-line electronic television system designed by Thomson-Houston which improved on the 405-line system originally designed by EMI-Marconi, Radio-PTT Vision renamed itself as Radiodiffusion nationale Télévision (RN Télévision) in July 1937. However, broadcasts using the Nipkow disk system continued alongside the new electronic system until 10 April 1938. In July 1938, a decree of the French PTT agency fixed the French broadcast television standard as transmitting on 455 lines VHF (46 MHz, <b>positive</b> <b>modulation,</b> 25 frames per second), {{to be adopted}} throughout France within three years. The adoption of the electronic standard {{marked the end of}} mechanical television in France, and the advent of electronic television to obtain much better image quality. RN Télévision abruptly stopped broadcasts on 3 September 1939 following the entry of France into the Second World War.|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{has been}} associated with increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Exercise training (ET) has been shown to exert <b>positive</b> <b>modulations</b> on vascular function and {{the purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the effect of moderate ET on the aortic superoxide production index, NAD(P) H oxidase activity, superoxide dismutase activity and vasomotor response in MI rats. Aerobic ET was performed during 11 weeks. Myocardial infarction significantly diminished maximal exercise capacity, and increased vasoconstrictory response to norepinephrine, which was related to the increased activity of NAD(P) H oxidase and basal superoxide production. On the other hand, ET normalized the superoxide production mostly due to decreased NAD(P) H oxidase activity, although a minor SOD effect may also be present. These adaptations were paralleled by normalization in the vasoconstrictory response to norepinephrine. Thus, diminished ROS production seems to be an important mechanism by which ET mediates its beneficial vascular effects in the MI condition...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{ability to}} identify, develop, and exploit {{conditions}} {{of safety and}} security is central to survival and mental health, but little is known of the neurobiology of these processes or associated <b>positive</b> <b>modulations</b> of affective state. We studied electrophysiological and affective correlates of learned safety by negatively correlating an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) with aversive events (US). This CS came to signify a period of protection, reducing fear responses to predictors of the US and increasing adventurous exploration of a novel environment. In nonaversive conditions, mice turn on the CS when given the opportunity. Thus, conditioned safety involves a reduction of learned and instinctive fear, as well as positive affective responses. Concurrent electrophysiological measurements identified a safety learning-induced long-lasting depression of CS-evoked activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, consistent with fear reduction, and an increase of CS-evoked activity in a region of the striatum involved in positive affect, euphoric responses, and reward...|$|R
40|$|When the linearly {{polarized}} object and reference beams {{with the same}} polarization direction are used for recording gratings in bacteriorhodopsin films, the azimuth of polarization of the reconstruction beam {{has an influence on}} the diffraction efficiency. By using Jones matrices to analyze this phenomenon, we find that the azimuth of polarization of the reconstruction beam makes a cosine modulation on the diffraction efficiency. The diffracted beam is {{linearly polarized}} only when the polarization of the reconstruction beam is parallel or perpendicular to that of the recording beams; otherwise, the diffracted beam becomes elliptically polarized. The azimuth of polarization of the reconstruction beam produces a <b>positive</b> cosine <b>modulation</b> on the peak diffraction efficiency, but a negative cosine modulation on the steady diffraction efficiency (with phase difference pi).

For T < 200 K infrared quenching of photoconductivity with a low energy threshold of ~ 0. 6 eV is found. Above 250 K a different infrared quenching process occurs with a low energy threshold of ~ 0. 9 eV.

40|$|A {{recent study}} {{reported}} a <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> {{of the response}}-locked event-related brain potential (ERP) on trials preceding errors (i. e., error - 1 trials). It was proposed that this error-preceding positivity (EPP) reflects the disengagement of the response monitoring system prior to errors. In three studies, we sought to replicate the EPP, and to delineate {{the conditions under which}} it can be observed. Study 1 replicated the finding of a <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> of the ERP on error-preceding compared to RT-matched correct-preceding trials. This enhanced positivity was not due to differences in stimulus-related processing, and a similar modulation was not observed on error - 2 or error + 1 trials. Studies 2 and 3 indicated that similar EPP-like phenomena could be observed across a variety of tasks, and using much longer inter-trial intervals. The onset and duration of the modulation, however, did vary between studies. These results are discussed in terms of response-locked ERPs and action monitoring. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) {{are used}} in the {{treatment}} of myasthenia gravis (MG).

The <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> of those receptors by AChE inhibitors could have an added value to the anti-AChE activity and might be useful in the therapy of MG. Furthermore, to estimate the potential drawbacks of the compounds, cytotoxicity has been assessed on various cell lines. Methods: The whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp method was employed. The experiments were performed on medulloblastoma/rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE 671 expressing human embryonic muscle-like receptor with subunits α 2 βγδ. The effect of the compounds on cell viability was measured by standard MTT assay (Sigma Aldrich) on ACHN (renal cell adenocarcinoma), HeLa (immortal cell line derived from a cervical carcinoma), HEPG 2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and BJ (skin fibroblasts) cell lines. Results: No <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> by the tested AChE inhibitors was observed. Moreover, the compounds exhibited antagonistic activity on the peripheral nAChR.

Nevertheless, cognitive and brain reserves {{are thought to}} act as protective factors against cognitive decline and the re-activation of cognitive and neural networks by means of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may help in maintaining those reserves and improving functional profiles. The present research thus investigates the effect of prefrontal NIBS in empowering executive functions and electrophysiological attention responses in healthy elderly people. Twenty-two volunteers have been assigned to a control or NIBS group. The NIBS protocol (anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) lasted eight weeks (three sessions per week), with twice-weekly administration of tasks tapping on executive functions.

40|$|Scope: Fibers and {{prebiotics}} {{represent a}} useful dietary approach for modulating the human gut microbiome. Therefore, {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the impact of four flours (wholegrain rye, wholegrain wheat, chickpeas and lentils 50 : 50, and barley milled grains), characterized by a naturally high content in dietary fibers, on the intestinal microbiota composition and metabolomic output. Methods and results: A validated three-stage continuous fermentative system simulating the human colon was used to resemble the complexity and diversity of the intestinal microbiota. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to evaluate the impact of the flours on the composition of the microbiota, while small-molecule metabolome was assessed by NMR analysis followed by multivariate pattern recognition techniques. HT 29 cell-growth curve assay was used to evaluate the modulatory properties of the bacterial metabolites on the growth of intestinal epithelial cells. All the four flours showed <b>positive</b> <b>modulations</b> of the microbiota composition and metabolic activity. Furthermore, none of the flours influenced the growth-modulatory potential of the metabolites toward HT 29 cells. Conclusion: Our findings support the utilization of the tested ingredients in the development of a variety of potentially prebiotic food products aimed at improving gastrointestinal health. ...|$|R
40|$|The group I metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (mGluR 1 a and mGluR 5) {{are important}} modulators of neuronal structure and function. Although these receptors share common signaling pathways, {{they are capable}} of having distinct effects on cellular plasticity. We investigated the individual effects of mGluR 1 a or mGluR 5 activation on dendritic spine density in medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which has become relevant with the potential use of group I mGluR based therapeutics in the treatment of drug addiction. We found that systemic administration of mGluR subtype-specific positive allosteric modulators had opposite effects on dendritic spine densities. Specifically, mGluR 5 <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> decreased dendritic spine densities in the NAc shell and core, but was without effect in the dorsal striatum, whereas increased spine densities in the NAc were observed with mGluR 1 a <b>positive</b> <b>modulation.</b> Additionally, direct activation of mGluR 5 via CHPG administration into the NAc also decreased the density of dendritic spines. These data provide insight on the ability of group I mGluRs to induce structural plasticity in the NAc and demonstrate that the group I mGluRs are capable of producing not just distinct, but opposing, effects on dendritic spine density...|$|E

The present research aims at investigating the eff ect of prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in empowering executive functions and electrophysiological attention responses in healthy aging. Methods: 22 participants have been assigned to the intervention or control group and underwent a complex assessment at T 0 and at T 1 – after three months. The anodal tDCS protocol lasted eight weeks (three sessions per week), with twice-weekly administration of tasks tapping on executive functions. A complete set of standardized cognitive tests and an electroencephalographic recording during a challenging computerized attention task have been integrated in the assessment protocol. Results: T 0 -T 1 comparisons highlighted a signifi cant increase in post-intervention performances for the tDCS group. Specifi cally, tests tapping on executive functions and automatic electrophysiological attention responses showed <b>positive</b> <b>modulations.</b> Conclusions: The consistency of behavioral and electrophysiological findings suggests that a moderately intensive NIBS protocol might mediate the empowerment of specific cognitive functions even in healthy aging people.

40|$|SummaryAutism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{may arise}} from increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Many pharmacological treatments have been tested in ASD, but only limited success has been achieved. Here we report that BTBR T+ Itpr 3 tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model of idiopathic autism, have reduced spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission. Treatment with low nonsedating/nonanxiolytic doses of benzodiazepines, which increase inhibitory neurotransmission through <b>positive</b> allosteric <b>modulation</b> of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, improved deficits in social interaction, repetitive behavior, and spatial learning. Moreover, negative allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors impaired social behavior in C 57 BL/ 6 J and 129 SvJ wild-type mice, suggesting that reduced inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to social and cognitive deficits. The dramatic behavioral improvement after low-dose benzodiazepine treatment was subunit specific—the α 2, 3 -subunit-selective positive allosteric modulator L- 838, 417 was effective, but the α 1 -subunit-selective drug zolpidem exacerbated social deficits. Impaired GABAergic neurotransmission may contribute to ASD, and α 2, 3 -subunit-selective <b>positive</b> GABAA receptor <b>modulation</b> may be an effective treatment...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} neurosteroids have been {{demonstrated}} to exert anxiolytic properties {{by means of a}} <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> of inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. The observation that neurosteroid synthesis can be pharmacologically regulated by ligands to the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) has prompted the search for new, more selective TSPO ligands able to stimulate steroidogenesis with great efficacy. In the present study, the potential anxiolytic activity of a selective TSPO ligand, N,N-di-n-propyl- 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) indol- 3 -ylglyoxylamide (MPIGA), was tested by means of the elevated plus maze paradigm. Moreover, the in vitro effects on synaptoneurosomal GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A) R) activity exerted by the conditioned salt medium from MPIGA-treated ADF human glial cells were investigated. MPIGA (30 mg/kg) was found to affect rats' performance in the elevated plus maze test significantly, leading to an increase in both entries and time spent in the open arms. This same dose of MPIGA had no effect on rats' spontaneous exploratory activity. The conditioned salt medium from MPIGA-treated ADF cells potentiated the (36) Cl(-) uptake into cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes. The exposure of ADF cells to MPIGA stimulated the production of pregnelonone derivatives including allopregnanolone, one of the major positive GABA(A) R allosteric modulator. In conclusion, the TSPO ligand MPIGA is a promising anxiolytic drug. The mechanism of action by which MPIGA exerts its anxiolytic activity was identified in the stimulation of endogenous neurosteroid production, which in turn determined a <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> of GABA(A) R activity, thus opening the way to the potential use of this TSPO ligand in anxiety and depressive disorders...|$|E
40|$|Even {{though the}} human {{parasite}} Leishmania donovani encounters tremendous oxidative burst during macrophage invasion, {{a set of}} parasites survives and proliferates intracellularly, leading to transformation from promastigote to amastigote form and disease manifestation. The striking shifts in temperature (from 22 °C in the insect gut to 37 °C in the mammalian host) and pH (7. 2 in the insect gut to 5. 5 in the parasitophorous vacuole of macrophages) are the key environmental triggers for differentiation as these cause an arrest in the G 1 stage of the cell cycle and initiate transformation. Using an established in vitro culture and differentiation system our study demonstrates that the differentiation-triggering environment induces resistance to oxidative damage and consequently enhances infectivity. Differentiation conditions caused a three- to fourfold elevation in cAMP level as well as cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Similar to stress exposure, <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> of intracellular cAMP resulted in blockage of cell cycle progression and induction of resistance against oxidative damage. Resistance against pro-oxidants from either stress or cAMP {{may be associated with}} upregulation of the expression of three major antioxidant genes, peroxidoxin 1, trypanothione reductase, and superoxide dismutase A. <b>Positive</b> <b>modulation</b> of the intracellular cAMP response enables cells to resist the cytotoxic effects of pro-oxidants. In contrast, downregulation of intracellular cAMP by overexpression of cAMP phosphodiesterase A resulted in a decrease in resistance against oxidative damage and reduced infectivity toward activated macrophages.

40|$|Thermal taster status {{refers to}} the finding that, in some individuals, thermal {{stimulation}} of the tongue elicits a phantom taste. Little is known regarding the mechanism for this, it is hypothesised to {{be a result of}} cross-wiring between gustatory and trigeminal nerves whose receptors co-innervate papillae on the tongue. To address this, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to perform the first study of whether the cortical response to gustatory-trigeminal samples is altered with thermal taster status. We study the response to cold (6 °C) gustatory (sweet) samples at varying levels of trigeminal stimulation elicited by CO 2 (no CO 2, low CO 2, high CO 2) in thermal taster (TT) and thermal non-taster (TnT) groups, and evaluate associated behavioural measures. Behaviourally, the TT group perceived gustatory and trigeminal stimuli significantly more intense than TnTs, and were significantly more discriminating of CO 2 level. fMRI data revealed elevated cortical activation to the no CO 2 sample for the TT group compared to TnT group in taste, oral somatosensory and reward areas. In TnTs, a significant <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> in cortical response with increasing level of CO 2 was found across taste, somatosensory and reward areas. In contrast, in TTs, a reduced <b>positive</b> <b>modulation</b> with increasing level of CO 2 was found in somatosensory areas (SI, SII), whilst a significant negative modulation was found in taste (anterior insula) and reward (ACC) areas. This difference in cortical response to trigeminal stimuli supports cross-modal integration in TTs, with gustatory and trigeminal nerves highly stimulated by cold gustatory samples due to their intertwined nature...|$|E
