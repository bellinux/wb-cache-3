50|$|The {{point-contact}} {{semiconductor detector}} was subsequently resurrected around World War II {{because of the}} military requirement for microwave radar detectors. Vacuum-tube detectors do not work at microwave frequencies. The small area of the point contact minimized minority carrier storage and capacitance, making these diodes fast enough to function at radar frequencies.

5000|$|Galena is a {{semiconductor}} with a {{small band}} gap of about 0.4 eV, which found use in early wireless communication systems. It {{was used as the}} crystal in crystal radio receivers, in which it was used as a <b>point-contact</b> <b>diode</b> capable of rectifying alternating current to detect the radio signals. The galena crystal was used with a sharp wire, known as a [...] "cat's whisker" [...] in contact with it. The operation of the radio required that the point of contact on the galena be shifted about to find a part of the crystal that acted as a rectifying diode. Making such wireless receivers was a popular home hobby in Britain and other European countries during the 1930s. Scientists associated with the investigation of the diode effect are Karl Ferdinand Braun and Sir Jagdish Bose. In modern wireless communication systems, galena detectors have been replaced by more reliable semiconductor devices.|$|E

The intrinsic advantage of the point-contact configuration is {{that it is possible to}} achieve very small contact areas for the device thereby allowing very high-frequency operation. In this study, precise control over the contact area and penetration depth of an electrically conductive tip into a metal/insulator combination is achieved using a nanoindenter with in-situ electrical contact resistance measurement capabilities. A diamond probe tip, doped (degeneratively) with boron for conductivity, serves as the point contact and second 'metal' (b-Diamond) of the MIM diode. The base layer consists of Nb/Nb 2 O 5 thin films on Si substrates and serves as the first metal /insulator combination of the MIM structure. The current-voltage response of the diodes is measured under a range of conditions to assess the validity and repeatability of the technique. Additionally, we compare the results of this technique to those acquired using a bent-wire approach and find that Nb/Nb 2 O 5 /b-Diamond MIM devices show an excellent asymmetry (60 - 300) and nonlinearity values (~ 6 - 9).
