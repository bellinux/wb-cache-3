Independence Day activities require Metro to adjust service to provide extra capacity {{to and from}} the National Mall. WMATA makes similar adjustments during other events, such as presidential inaugurations. Metro has altered service and used some stations as entrances or exits only to help manage congestion.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50. Although the banding <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> the chromosomes of all slow lorises are similar, this species may be distinguished from the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) by distinct differences in the number and location of nucleolus organizer regions.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{tropical}} cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when {{the difference between}} temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest.

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E

5|$|At first glance, dazzle {{seems an}} {{unlikely}} form of camouflage, {{drawing attention to}} the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he {{believed to be the}} applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining the goal was to confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship's outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by the <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> a series of land animals, the giraffe, zebra and jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having the}} world's largest {{collection}} of captive wildfowl, Slimbridge takes part in research and is involved in projects and internationally run captive breeding programmes. It was there that Peter Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> the beaks of Bewick's swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} usage, soldiers often either exchange their disruptively-patterned summer uniforms for thicker snow camouflage uniforms {{printed with}} mainly-white versions of camouflage patterns in winter, or they wear white overalls over their uniforms. Some armies have {{made use of}} reversible uniforms, printed in different seasonal <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> their two sides. Vehicles and guns are often simply repainted in white. Occasionally, aircraft too are repainted in snow camouflage patterns.|$|E
50|$|Many {{specimens}} have {{a somewhat}} regular dark 'hourglass' <b>pattern</b> located <b>on</b> the scapular region, {{and may also}} have small reddish-brown tubercles in a scattered <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the dorsum.|$|R

A goat may not move onto a pile, or onto a single goat piece to form a pile. (Similarly, a tiger may be moved one space onto a vacant adjacent point following the <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the board.) ...|$|R
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and honey badger advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study evaluates {{possible}} {{correlations between}} the pattern of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) on indirect immunofluorescence (ILE) testing and nailfold microangiopathy stage (early, active, and late stage) in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Patients with SSc were followed prospectively to monitor progression of microvascular damage. Methods. The ANA <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> IIF was searched in 42 patients with SSc showing an early pattern of nailfold microangiopathy at baseline, and was followed using nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NYC) for a median time of 91 months. Results. Among patients whose microangiopathy showed a rapid progression from early to late <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> NYC, the IIF pattern was fine-speckled + nucleolar (Scl- 70 +) in 44 %, centromeric in 33 %, nucleolar in 11 %, and homogeneous in 11 % of patients with SSc. Antitopoisomerase I antibodies were significantly more frequent (57 %) in patients with late <b>pattern</b> of microangiopathy <b>on</b> NYC. The median time of progression from early to active disease was significantly lower in patients with both fine-speckled + nucleolar and nucleolar ANA positivity. The severity of microangiopathy was higher in patients with the nucleolar <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> IIF. Patients already showing a slight reduction of capillary number at baseline were likely to have either the nucleolar or the fine-speckled + nucleolar <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> IIF. Of note, 37 % of patients still showing the early microangiopathy <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> NYC {{at the end of}} the followup were ANA-negative. Conclusion. ANA-negative patients with SSc display a slower progression of nailfold microangiopathy characterized by the early <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> NYC. Progression to the late NYC pattern (more advanced stage of microvascular damage) seems to be associated with a different autoantibody <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> IIF (fine-speckled + nucleolar pattern being the most prevalent) ...|$|R

5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more probably an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. The wear <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E
5|$|The {{stopping}} <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line {{have generally}} been determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had {{been added to the}} list of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum (Santa Cruz Long-toed Salamander) is {{of particular}} concern and it was afforded protections in 1967 under the US Endangered Species Act. This subspecies lives in a narrow range of habitat in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County, California. Prior to receiving protections, some few remaining populations were threatened by development. The subspecies is ecologically unique, having unique and irregular skin <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> its back, a unique moisture tolerance, {{and it is also}} an endemic that is geographically isolated {{from the rest of the}} species range. Other subspecies include A. m. columbianum, A. m. krausei, A. m. macrodactylum and A. m. sigillatum.|$|E
