40|$|For {{almost twenty}} years, the general delictual claim {{as found in}} par. 823 (!) BGB {{formed the basis for}} <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> claims against {{producers}} in Germany. In 1985, however, a European Directive on <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> was issued and in 1990 Germany enacted the <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> Act. Setting a strict liability standard, the Act was to operate in tandem with the existing general delictual claim. Since producers in any event find it very difficult to successfully defeat <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> claims based on par. 823 BGB, the Act should not drastically change the landscape of German <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> jurisprudence.

40|$|The Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 has {{extended}} consumer protection to South African Consumers in various areas, notably also by introducing a strict <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> regime. Quite {{a number of}} authors have already investigated {{the parameters of the}} <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> regime introduced by section 61 of the Act with emphasis on the absence of a requirement of negligence and how this aspect has opened up access to redress for consumers harmed by defective products. Although this dissertation provides an overview of the new <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> regime introduced by the Consumer Protection Act it has a very specific focus, namely to analyse the defences available to the supply chain against <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> claims. The reason for doing so is twofold: in the first instance it is necessary to appreciate that the <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> regime introduced by the Act, although strict, is not absolute. Hence the provision made in section 61 for a number of defences that may be raised by the supply chain. Second, it is submitted that unless a balanced approach to the issue of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> is taken, consumers will suffer because a <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> regime that does not provide for any defences to <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> claims may stifle development and innovation to the detriment of consumers. The dissertation thus investigates the closed list of defences introduced by section 61 (4) of the Act and compares them with the statutory defences available under the EU <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> Directive in order to draw conclusions regarding their content and adequacy within the realm of modern <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> law.

40|$|In this Article {{we compare}} the {{benefits}} of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> to its costs and conclude that the case for <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> is weak {{for a wide range}} of products. One benefit of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> is that it can induce firms to improve product safety. Even in the absence of <b>product</b> <b>liability,</b> however, firms would often be motivated by market forces to enhance product safety because their sales may fall if their products harm consumers. Moreover, products must frequently conform to safety regulations. Consequently, <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> might not exert a significant additional influence on product safety for many products — and empirical studies of several widely sold products lend support to this hypothesis. A second benefit of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> is that it can improve consumer purchase decisions by causing product prices to increase to reflect product risks. But because of litigation costs and other factors, <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> may raise prices excessively and undesirably chill purchases. A third benefit of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> is that it compensates victims of product-related accidents for their losses. Yet this benefit is only partial, for accident victims are frequently compensated by insurers for some or all of their losses. Furthermore, the award of damages for pain and suffering tends to reduce the welfare of individuals because it effectively forces them to purchase insurance for a type of loss for which they ordinarily do not wish to be covered. Opposing {{the benefits of}} <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> are its costs, which are great. Notably, the transfer of a dollar to a victim of a product accident through the liability system requires more than a dollar on average in legal expenses. Given the limited nature of the benefits and the high costs of <b>product</b> <b>liability,</b> we come to the judgment that its use is often unwarranted. This is especially likely for products for which market forces and regulation are relatively strong, which includes many widely sold products. Our generally skeptical assessment of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> for such <b>products</b> is in tension with the broad social endorsement of this form of liability. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{explain in}} this Article that the {{benefits}} of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> may well be outweighed by its costs {{in a wide range of}} circumstances. One benefit is that the threat of liability may induce firms to improve product safety. However, this benefit is limited: even in the absence of <b>product</b> <b>liability,</b> firms would often be motivated by market forces to enhance product safety because their sales are likely to fall if their products harm consumers; moreover, their products must frequently conform to safety regulations. Consequently, <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> might not be expected to exert a significant additional influence on product safety — and the available empirical evidence suggests that such liability does not in fact have a measurable effect on the frequency of product accidents. A second benefit of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> is that it causes product prices to increase to reflect the riskiness of products and thereby may improve consumer purchase decisions. But this benefit also involves a detriment, because product prices may rise excessively and undesirably chill purchases. A third benefit of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> is that it compensates victims of product-related accidents for their losses. Yet this benefit is only partial, for accident victims are already often compensated by their insurers for some or all of their losses. Potentially offsetting the benefits of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> are its costs, which are great. To transfer a dollar to a victim of a product accident requires more than a dollar on average in legal expenses. Given the limited benefits and the high costs of <b>product</b> <b>liability,</b> we conclude that it may be socially undesirable — especially for widely sold products, with respect to which market forces and regulation are relatively strong. This judgment is in tension both with the broad social endorsement of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> and with proposals for its reform, which generally do not question its existence. Our more critical assessment of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> stems from the fact that we engage in an analysis of its benefits and costs, whereas neither the proponents of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> nor its reformers undertake to do so...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Questioning the Social Desirability of <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> Claims This thesis {{seeks to}} answer the primary {{question}} as to whether <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> Claims are socially desirable by reference to three <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> case studies and a survey of 132 archived <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> claims. These constitute a representative random sample of <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> cases handled by the Author’s Legal Practice. This practice has provided a window through which serious failings are identified in (i) the strict <b>liability</b> based <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> Directive; (ii) tort itself as a mechanism for compensating injured persons; and (iii) the procedural infrastructure in which claims are made, as recently reformed in accordance with Lord Justice Jackson’s recommendations. This thesis tests <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> claims against the objectives of tort: deterrence; corrective justice; retribution and vindication; distributive justice and compensation. It is found that <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> claims fail to meet the defined standard of social desirability. There is nothing special about products to necessitate or justify a bespoke system of <b>liability.</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> claims for damages represent in microcosm the broader picture of personal injury claims as a whole. This thesis highlights the failings of a system which relies heavily on gambling upon outcomes; perpetuates a ‘have a go’ culture; rewards the lucky few; builds in an unacceptable element of moral hazard and tolerates and generates the costs of a high volume of claims which serve no practical or legal purpose. It is concluded that 1. The <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> Directive was introduced as an emotive response to the Thalidomide tragedy but it would fail to provide a remedy in a similar disaster. Instead it treats sufferers of minor mishaps as victims and contributes to a litigation industry that inculcates in society a false and unnecessary sense of entitlement. 2. The <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> Directive should be repealed as a flawed and misconceived piece of legislation that fails to achieve its key goal of protecting consumers and harmonising the law. 3. Support is found in this practical research for much of what Atiyah advocated in his seminal work The Damages Lottery. The possibility of an all-embracing no-fault liability system should be reconsidered subject to strict controls, including thresholds, to ensure that it compensates and rehabilitates only those with genuine needs. 4. A first party insurance market would have to develop to fill the gaps...|$|R

40|$|This thesis takes {{a global}} {{approach}} to analyzing, discussing and critiquing {{the effectiveness of}} <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> law in Europe. The thesis approaches the study of European <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> law beyond the main <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> instruments themselves. It first offers a purely legal analysis, based on the content, effects and judicial interpretation of the European <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> directive and on the procedural context {{in which it is}} framed. Second, it analyzes the directive's effects on accident deterrence, examining the interaction between Europe's ex post liability laws and ex ante safety regulations from theoretical as well as practical perspectives. Third, the thesis analyzes the effectiveness of ex post liability as a mechanism for compensating the victims of product-related accidents in Europe. This last issue of victim compensation reaches beyond tort law to include alternative sources of compensation, such as public and private insurance. Social insurance systems, in particular, arise as the major mechanism of compensation in Europe, and for this reason the compensation of product-related accident victims proves {{to be one of the}} issues that differentiates the role, development and effectiveness of <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> law in Europe from the U.
