40|$|The major {{challenges}} in Li-S batteries are {{the formation of}} soluble <b>polysulphides</b> during the reversible conversion of S- 8 Li 2 S, large changes in sulphur particle volume during lithiation and extremely poor charge transport in sulphur. We demonstrate here a novel and simple strategy to overcome these challenges towards practical realization of a stable high performance Li-S battery. For the first time, a strategy is developed which does away with the necessity of pre-fabricated high surface area hollow-structured adsorbates and also multiple nontrivial synthesis steps related to sulphur loading inside such adsorbates. A lithiated polyethylene glycol (PEG) based surfactant tethered on ultra-small sulphur nanoparticles and wrapped up with polyaniline (PAni) (abbreviated as S-MIEC) is demonstrated here as an exceptional cathode for Li-S batteries. The PEG and PAni network around the sulphur nanoparticles serves as an efficient flexible trap for sulphur and <b>polysulphides</b> and also provides distinct pathways for electrons (through PAni) and ions (through PEG) during battery operation.

The aim of this work was {{to gain a better}} understanding of the role of sulphide minerals in controlling metal concentrations in ore depositing and other natural aqueous systems. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the surface sensitive techniques of Auger electron spectroscopy, and in particular, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, provided information relating to the chemical and morphological changes occurring at the mineral surface. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to monitor solution concentrations.;KAuCldollar 4 dollar is reduced to Au(0) on all three sulphides. The sulphide mineral acts as the reducing agent. High resolution XPS of S 2 p region indicated that PbS and (Zn,Fe) S are oxidised to <b>polysulphides.</b> Zn, Fe and Pb are released as the sulphide lattice is disrupted. Although <b>polysulphides</b> were detected on pyrite after long reaction times, soluble sulphate appears to be the major oxidation product. The difference in the oxidation state and amount of gold detected on pyrite and galena plates from solutions of Nadollar 3 Au(S 3 O 3) 2 dollar, suggest that the ability of the mineral to concentrate reduced gold will be a function of the reduction potential of the mineral and the gold complex.;Nadollar 2 PdCl 4 dollar is also reduced to the metal by all three minerals. Detailed studies with pyrite show that the reduction is controlled by the solution concentrations of Cldollar-dollar and Hdollar+dollar. The non-uniformity of the reduction process is a result of surface control of the reaction. Adsorbed Pd(II) species were also detected. PbS and (Zn,Fe) S are oxidised to <b>polysulphides,</b> and palladium sulphides are also formed.;Three forms of sorbed Hg(II) were detected on PbS.

In {{this way the}} amount of polysulphide-linked vs mono- and polysulphide-linked carbon skeletons was assessed. Steranes, phytane and gammacerane are bound by <b>polysulphide</b> linkages in large amounts (30 % or more) in the immature Vena del Gesso sediment whereas squalane, isorenieratane and C 35 hopane carbon skeletons are hardly bound at all by polysulphide-bonds only.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effect of single {{extensions}} and continuous fatigue on the structures of various natural rubber networks. The change in network structure of a conventional vulcanisate on a single extension manifests itself as permanent set. The change in network structure has been assessed by the use of the chemical probes, propan- 2 -thiol/piperidine, hexane-thiol/piperidine and triphenyl phosphine, which determine the <b>polysulphide</b> and disulphide crosslink densities and main chain modification respectively. The permanent set induced on a single extension of a conventional sulphur vulcanisate has been shown to result from the destruction and reformation of <b>polysulphide</b> crosslinks. The magnitude of the effect was dependent upon the degree of extension and showed a maximum at extensions corresponding to the onset of stress-induced crystallisation. The incorporation of a reinforcing filler, HAF-carbon black, magnified the effect. Vulcanisates that possessed only mono and disulphide crosslinks did not show any significant permanent set. The continuous changes in network structure during fatigue have also been determined, and the effects of carbon black and antioxidants on these changes and the fatigue life have been assessed. During fatigue the overall crosslink density increased slightly, which resulted from the destruction of <b>polysulphide</b> crosslinks. and their replacement by principally disulphide crosslinks. Antioxidants reduced the rate of destruction of <b>polysulphide</b> crosslinks and increased the fatigue life of the rubber network.

The method employs a ‘Swagelok’ cell design equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode, in which redox species are placed initially in the counter electrode compartment only. Permeability through the membrane, which separates working and counter electrodes, is determined using a square wave voltammetry technique that allows the concentration of crossover redox species to be evaluated over time with very high precision. We test the method using a model and well-behaved electrochemical system to demonstrate its sensitivity, reproducibility and reliability relative to alternative approaches. This new method offers advantages in terms of small electrolyte volume, and simple, fast, quantitative and in-situ measurement...|$|R
40|$|Lithium–sulphur (Li–S) {{batteries}} {{are one of}} the most promising candidates for the next generation of energy storage systems to alleviate the energy crisis. However, Li–S batteries’ commercialization faces the challenges of low active materials utilization, poor cycling life, and low energy density. Recently, tremendous progress has been achieved in improving the electrode performances and tap density by using the nanostructured metal compounds in Li–S batteries. In this review, we not only present the latest various nanostructured metal compounds applications in Li–S batteries, including metal oxides, metal sulphides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, and metal organic frameworks, but also we focus on the interaction mechanisms between these polar metal compounds with <b>polysulphides.</b> The issues and bottlenecks of these metal compounds are concluded and the corresponding available solutions to address these issues are proposed. This systematic discussion and proposed strategies can offer avenues to the practical application of Li–S batteries in the near future.
