50|$|Pyridazines {{are rare}} in nature, {{possibly}} reflecting {{the scarcity of}} naturally occurring hydrazines, common building blocks for the synthesis of these heterocycles. The pyridazine structure is a popular pharmacophore which is found within a number of herbicides such as credazine, pyridafol and <b>pyridate.</b> It is also found within the structure of several drugs such as cefozopran, cadralazine, minaprine, pipofezine, and hydralazine.|$|E
40|$|Crop-rhizobium {{symbiosis}} can {{be influenced}} by leaching of herbicides which is unavoidable after their application. Due to an adjuvant which might help to develop the low-use-rate of herbicide, an experiment was carried out to compare {{the impact of the}} recommended rate (1200 g active ingredient ha- 1) and the optimized rate (282. 15 g active ingredient ha- 1) of <b>pyridate</b> on the biological properties of eight chickpea cultivars inoculated with Mesorhizobium mediterraneum, grown in pots. Based on the required rate of herbicide to give 95 % control of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) value, the efficacy of <b>pyridate</b> improved up to 3. 87 -fold by adding methylated rapeseed oil to spray solution. The ‘Desi ’ cultivar had significantly higher nodulation than ‘Kabuli ’ cultivar. In general, toxicity of the recommended rate was higher than the optimized rate. With the exception of root dry weight, all of the measured parameters were significantly affected by the recommended rate of <b>pyridate</b> in varying degrees. The symbiotic properties of chickpea cultivars were affected more than 10 % at the recommended dose. The reduced nodulation ranged from 29 % to 73 % among cultivars exposed to <b>pyridate</b> at the recommended dose. The ‘Desi ’ cultivar was more sensitive than the ‘Kabuli ’ to the recommended rate of <b>pyridate.</b> We may conclude that effective low-use-rate of <b>pyridate</b> via applying of activator adjuvants should be noted...|$|E
40|$|Bentazon (Basagran®) at 0. 5 to 2. 0 lb a. i. /A, halosulfuron (Permit®) at 0. 025 to 0. 10 lb a. i A, and <b>pyridate</b> (Lentagran®) at 0. 25 to 1. 5 lb a. i. /A {{were applied}} postemergence on cantaloupe and watermelon. Bentazon was {{marginally}} safe on cantaloupes and controlled purslane and pigweeds. Morningglory and Wright's groundcherry were not effectively controlled by bentazon. Bentazon {{appeared to be}} less injurious to watermelons relative to cantaloupes. Halosulfuron was safe on both cantaloupes and watermelons (< 15 % injury). Halosulfuron at greater than 0. 05 lb /A was effective in controlling only Hyssop spurge and London rocket. In one test, halosulfuron gave acceptable control (85 %) of morningglory. Purslane and groundcherry were not controlled by halosulfuron. <b>Pyridate</b> was not safe on cantaloupes causing severe crop stand reduction. <b>Pyridate</b> was safer on watermelons and caused marginally acceptable injury, however, weed control was not effective against groundcherry, spurge or London rocket. <b>Pyridate</b> appeared to give acceptable control of morningglory in one test...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of 14 substances, including {{a number of}} pesticides, to the eggs of the pest slug Deroceras reticulatum was determined in laboratory experiments. Eggs were kept in contact with a precisely defined artificial soil to which a range of concentrations of the test substances had been applied. Mortality of the eggs was assessed every 24 h and the median lethal doses (LD 50) were determined. The herbicides bromoxynil, ioxynil and <b>pyridate</b> + bromoxynil, the insecticides thiocyclam, diflubenzuron and azadirachtin, the molluscicides metaldehyde and methiocarb, and other compounds such as carvone, iron-EDDHA, saponin, and an extract of Pongamia pinnata, killed the eggs after periods of exposure ranging from 2 to 14 days, depending on the compound and the dose. Only two compounds, the insecticides imidacloprid and teflubenzuron, failed to kill the eggs of D. reticulatum {{at any of the}} doses tested. Values of LD 50 below 0. 01 mg a. i. cm- 2 were obtained for the herbicides bromoxynil, ioxynil and <b>pyridate</b> + bromoxynil, and for the biological pesticide azadirachtin. The feasibility of slug egg control in different contexts is discusse...|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{field study}} provided results of postemergence herbicide weed control efficacy and broccoli tolerance. <b>Pyridate</b> (Tough®), clopyralid (Stinger®), and oxyfluorfen (Goal®) did not cause any crop stand reduction compared to bentazon (Basagran®) that completely reduced the broccoli stand. Tough and Goal at the lower rates tested caused marginally acceptable broccoli injury. Goal effectively controlled pigweed species (Amaranthus sp.), groundcherry (Physalis wrightii), and purslane (Portulacç oleracea). Tough gave good control of pigweed and purslane but not groundcherry. Stinger was safe on broccoli and marginally controlled groundcherry. In a second field study, Tough and Goal were evaluated for cheeseweed control. Goal marginally controlled cheeseweed at all rates tested and caused marginally acceptable injury at the two lowest rates. Tough was relatively safe at the lower rates but did not adequately control the cheeseweed...|$|E
40|$|Weed control ratings at 3 {{weeks after}} {{treatment}} (WAT) showed that knotweed (Polvgonum argyrocoleon) and yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis) were not controlled by oxyfluorfen (Goal®), <b>pyridate</b> (Lentagran®), clopyralid (Stinger®), sulfentrazone (FMC), or carfentrazone (FMC). Carfentrazone at 0. 50 lb AI/A gave good control (> 89 %) of London rocket (Sisvmbrium irio) and sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus). A lower rate at 0. 125 lb AI/A provided acceptable control (85 %). Carfentrazone at 0. 50 lb AUA caused severe broccoli and cabbage injury and crop stand reduction. Sulfentrazone at 0. 50 lb AI/A gave nearly acceptable control of knotweed, London rocket, and sowthistle. Cabbage was severely injured and broccoli {{appeared to be}} more tolerant and injury was marginally acceptable (15 %). Stinger and Goal gave nearly acceptable control of sowthistle. Goal at 0. 094 lb AI/A gave 80 % control of London rocket. Goal caused marginally acceptable injury (12 to 17 %) and Stinger caused minimal crop injury. Goal appears to be ineffective against weeds at less than 0. 094 lb AI/A and crop safety is very marginal. Lentagran was relatively safe on broccoli and cabbage but did not control the existing weed spectrum...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} over fifteen years of {{experimentation}} are summarized, concerning the possibility of use of herbicides included in several chemical classes and with various mechanisms of action on poplar clones of different species, European and North American. The active ingredients were tested mainly singly or in commercial mixtures as well, applied before emergence (interpreted here as sprout of poplar cuttings not yet occurred and before weed infestation) or after emergence (interpreted here as cuttings with sprouts 20 - 25 cm long and after weed colonisation). Almost 50 % of the 43 tested formulations {{has proved to be}} unserviceable in poplar nursery because of the hard damage induced on plantlets, i. e. dicotyledonicides and those with a wide action range, especially applied after emergence. It was the case of acetolactate synthase inhibitors and synthetic auxins. About 25 % of formulations has proved to be utilizable with limited risks and 20 % without risk. After emergence, the lowest damage was caused by graminicide compounds included in the class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (e. g. diclofop-methyl, cycloxydim); before emergence, very good applicative opportunities were showed by microtubule assembly inhibitors, especially propyzamide, and the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. Among the herbicides utilizable with some risk after emergence, the photosynthesis inhibitors <b>pyridate</b> and phenmedipham (singly or in mixture) were interesting since they are the only ones that allow the control of broad-leaved weeds in the presence of herbaceous poplar shoots. Before emergence, flufenacet and isoxaflutole were remarkable as well, the latter being active versus hardly limited weeds. In summary, besides the two aforesaid compounds, the graminicide cycloxydim and - more cautiously - clodinafop and propaquizafop may be hopefully introduced in poplar nurseries after emergence, in association with the wide action range mixture of phenmedipham, desmedipham and ethofumesate...|$|E
