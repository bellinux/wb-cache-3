However, they perceived these academic professionals as having fewer social responsibilities and as facing less psychological and physical stress than themselves. 2) High school teachers viewed university faculty members as possessing superior research capabilities both on broad-ranging and specialist knowledge.

A single camera and image processing technique is utilized to develop the system and the following tasks are achieved. 1. When the patient lies on the sickbed, we can measure the position and height of the patient’s body and provide the data to the second subproject to adjust the sickbed such that the patient can be much comfortable. 2. When the patient leaves the sickbed, we can track the location of the patient and detect if there is any accident happened. 3. According to the recognized gesture of the patient, we can understand what he (or she) wants or whether he (or she) needs some help. Then we can know the requirement or feeling of the patient. 4. The system can also recognize the expression of the patient. If the system detects pain expression, there will be alarm sound to notice nurses.
