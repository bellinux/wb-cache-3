One of the key reasons {{this is such a}} critical point is in instances where an issue of contamination arises, and a recall is required. Where traceability has been closely adhered to, it is possible to identify, by precise date/time & exact location which goods must be recalled, and which are safe, potentially saving millions of dollars in the recall process. Traceability within the food processing industry is also utilised to identify key high production & quality areas of a business, versus those of low return, and where points in the production process may be improved.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{husbandry}} in Eastern Croatia, especially concerning family husbandries, is {{well known}} for its traditional way of swine breeding and <b>processing</b> <b>meat</b> and its products. Higher frequent occurrence of trichinellosis in swine during last decade has resulted in increased number of people reported to be infected. Beside human health, this disease directly threatens swine breeding, as well. If only one animal is found to be trichinellotic, it is necessary to remove harmlessly all the other swine from the same production group. This makes huge economical losses, both for the owner and country itself. Systematic monitoring and persistent practicing of by low regulated trichinellosis eradication and preventive measures during the last three years has significantly reduced number of infected swine, which directly reduced harmful effects on swine breeding and selection...|$|E
