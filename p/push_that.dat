5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final <b>push</b> <b>that</b> would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Bloods storyline {{represented}} the last serious <b>push</b> <b>that</b> Eaton {{was given by}} the WCW booking team. After the run with Regal and Taylor ended, Eaton wrestled mainly on WCW's weekend show, Saturday Night, occasionally winning against wrestlers low in the rankings and losing to wrestlers above him. He also became a trainer at the WCW Power Plant and worked backstage for WCW as a road agent until he was released in early 2000, before the Eric Bischoff/Vince Russo reboot. In July 2000, Eaton made a surprise appearance in ECW, some time before Heat Wave.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL-E, he wanted to <b>push</b> <b>that</b> for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare, and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, {{and then trying to}} replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E

25|$|The {{first version}} {{predicted}} that Germans would attack from Pomerania towards Warsaw, with supporting thrusts from Silesia and Prussia, aiming at establishing an early link through the Polish Corridor between German Pomerania and Prussia. After German annexation {{of parts of}} Czechoslovakia and changes of borders, Polish planners revised the plan {{with the expectation that}} a main thrust would originate from Silesia - through Piotrków and Łódź towards Warsaw and Kraków. The Polish planners correctly predicted the direction of most German thrusts, with one crucial exception: they assigned low priority to a possible deep, flanking, eastward push from Prussia and Slovakia, a <b>push</b> <b>that</b> was however assigned high priority in the German plan (Fall Weiss).|$|E
25|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest Hebrew-language manuscripts of the Bible were Masoretic texts dating to the 10th century CE, such as the Aleppo Codex.

25|$|A past {{resonance}} between Jupiter and Saturn {{may have}} played a dramatic role in early Solar System history. A 2004 computer model by Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in Nice suggested that the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn (due to interactions with planetesimals that caused them to migrate inward and outward, respectively) created a gravitational <b>push</b> <b>that</b> propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits, and in some scenarios caused them to switch places, which would have doubled Neptune's distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt as Neptune moved outwards could explain the Late Heavy Bombardment 600million years after the Solar System's formation and the origin of Jupiter's Trojan asteroids. An outward migration of Neptune could also explain the current occupancy of some of its resonances (particularly the 2:5 resonance) within the Kuiper belt.|$|E

25|$|The {{price of}} gold bullion is volatile, but unhedged gold shares and funds are {{regarded}} as even higher risk and even more volatile. This additional volatility {{is due to the}} inherent leverage in the mining sector. For example, if one owns a share in a gold mine where the costs of production are $300 per ounce and the {{price of gold}} is $600, the mine's profit margin will be $300. A 10% increase in the gold price to $660 per ounce will <b>push</b> <b>that</b> margin up to $360, which represents a 20% increase in the mine's profitability, and possibly a 20% increase in the share price. Furthermore, at higher prices, more ounces of gold become economically viable to mine, enabling companies to add to their production. Conversely, share movements also amplify falls in the gold price. For example, a 10% fall in the gold price to $540 will decrease that margin to $240, which represents a 20% fall in the mine's profitability, and possibly a 20% decrease in the share price.|$|E

The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an armistice (Armistice of Villa Giusti). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near Padua, on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the following days the Italian Army occupied Innsbruck and all Tyrol with 20 to 22,000 soldiers.|$|E
