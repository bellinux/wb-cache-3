40|$|During recent years, {{increasing}} specialisation {{and complex}} market structures have made companies divide their <b>purchasing</b> <b>functions</b> into several organisational units {{to cope with}} increasingly diversified demands on linking the internal operations within the firm with operations at their suppliers.

We suggest a framework focusing on how the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> works as an interface between the firm’s suppliers and (other) firm internal functions, such as production, product development and marketing. The framework builds on two dimensions; one that describes how the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> of a firm relates to other internal functions and one describing how it relates to suppliers. The purchasing situations described by the framework are illustrated with some examples. Also, {{the ways in which}} the organising principles can be aligned to purchasing strategies are discussed.

40|$|Purpose – Prime {{contractors}} spent {{a substantial}} part of their turnover on purchasing. The management of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> therefore has a large influence on the overall performance of a prime contractor. The more developed the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> is, the greater its contribution to success of the companies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to measure and explain the development in maturity of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in construction firms. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review, a theoretical framework for the assessment of purchasing maturity is provided first. Then a longitudinal multiple case study is executed in order to assess the maturity development of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in seven construction companies. Results are compared with a historical baseline assessment. Findings – The results demonstrate an increase in the maturity of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in general and in particular in the management of strategic relations. The case companies have reached a maturity in which they start to coordinate activities in their supply chains. Increased use of IT solutions enables a more integrated approach of the construction process. Practical implications – IT and in particular Building Information Modelling pave the path towards an integrated supply chain, which in turn enables the reduction of waste in the processes. Nevertheless, companies still struggle with the tension between project-based flexibility and long-term relations with suppliers. Originality/value – The development of purchasing maturity was measured in a baseline measurement and in a second assessment performed five years later by using the exact same model and exact same case companies...|$|R
50|$|However, {{with the}} start of {{dieselisation}} in 1950s and speeding up of electrification from 1960s, the face of railways started changing. Electric locomotives, compared to steam locomotives, required more items that were sophisticated {{and had to be}} purchased. It was mainly with dieselisation and electrification, that the <b>purchase</b> <b>function</b> of railways started evolving though other changing areas, e.g. signaling, production of coaches, track laying, and maintenance activity. Apart from more number of purchase items, the issues like quality and reliability of items and the firms who were supplying them also became relevant as diesel and electric locomotives required sophisticated items for which credentials and capabilities of vendors needed to be pre-assessed. Activity of approval and registration of firms thus started. As the railway system was expanding, the funds became scarce and there was an urgent need to keep inventories at optimum levels so that capital could be used elsewhere, making inventory control important. Similarly the scrap sales function also became more and more important over the years.|$|E

40|$|As {{highlighted}} by Bititci et al. (2005), both academics and practitioners have developed models that aim {{to define and}} measure the overall performance of an organization and cover various business areas and processes, including, for example, performance measures for production planning and control (Kochhar et al., 1996), performance measurement for the product development process (O’Donnel and Duffy, 2002), performance measurement for human resources (Kelly and Gennard, 2001), performance measurement for service management (Wilson, 2000) and performance measurement for supply chain management (Beamon, 1999; Gunasekaran et al., 2001 and 2004; Sanchez-Rodriduez et al., 2003). However, {{although there have been}} many contributions to the debate on performance measurement systems, there is little in the literature regarding performance measurement for the purchasing process and, more in general, for the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> (Kumar et al., 2005). This appears strange {{in the light of the}} increasing importance of the role covered by the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in the achievement of the organization’s goals (Lamming, 1993). This evolution has led to recognise the important role that the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> can play within an organization being recognised, i. e. its potential for enhancing the overall performances of the firm. Leenders et al. (2002) asserts that these are exiting times for those concerned with an effective and efficient purchasing and supply management process. Actual business context, characterised by an increasing competition among organizations, <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> is recognise as a strategic weapon in enhancing firm competitive advantage. Changing context in supply market and the introduction of new approaches to manage purchasing activities have increased the complexity related to the management of purchasing activities. In this perspective PPMS should support the employees management and the whole firm in the management of the function especially in the new roles played so far from the clerical one that have characterised the past of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function.</b> From past work experience PPMS could play a role in making purchasing contribution more visible, especially for those activities characterised as intangible, resulting in a greater recognition of the purchasing department within the firm. From the review of PPMS literature and in comparison between PMS and PPMS literatures the following research gaps have been identified: -	Few empirical researches on design, implementation and use of PMS in the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function.</b> -	Lack of a global approach to performance measurement considering all the purchasing activities undertaken and its role within the organization. -	There is no clear link to the purchasing strategy and organization’s strategy. -	There is no clear link to purchasing market maturity. Some contributions found in this context have dealt with the measurement of <b>purchasing</b> <b>function,</b> however, in the majority of cases, this contributions have proposed some models that could be applied in the measurement of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> but there is no contribution that systematically classifies what is already done in literature or proposes guidelines highlighting proprieties of PPMS useful during the implementation of the measurement system. In the literature review only Carter et al. (2005) and Fant and Panizzolo (2006) have proposed a list of proprieties. The firsts related to performance measures, whereas the latter to measurement system. Another important consideration is that nobody has taken in consideration to identify contingent factors affecting the design, implementation and use of PPMS. The aim of this research is to fill this gap, identifying organizational and operational factors affecting the adoption of a PPMS...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{research}} problem: In more recent years, the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> {{has been given}} more attention as {{it has come to}} play a bigger role in improving and maintaining company performance. One of the underlying reasons for this could be the trend of increased outsourcing which implies that costs that used to be internal in form of wages and production costs are now external in the form of purchased items. This development therefore enhances the strategic importance of purchasing and the need for managing the relations with external sources. Currently available {{research in the area of}} purchasing management is mostly based on large companies and puts forward general guidelines for increasing purchasing effectiveness. From my observations of previous research I have concluded that there is a need for gaining a better understanding of how purchasing performance can be advanced in medium sized companies in particular. Currently available theory also show that the techniques and tools that provide for operational effectiveness and efficiency in purchasing also differs dependent on the industry and the relative position of the company in the value chain. Through studying purchasing for companies of this specific size segment with a similar position in the value chain the objective to be able to generate solutions for improving the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> that are better fitted to this company segment. Research purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate what measures can be taken to improve the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in medium sized manufacturing companies. Method: The study is based on a qualitative research design and has been conducted by the use of semi-structured interviews. Five medium sized manufacturing companies participated in the study. Theoretical perspective: Literature relating to competitive strategy, the construct and process of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> and theories concerning improvements of the same is overviewed. Conclusions: The main obstacles to improving purchasing performance in medium sized companies are cooperation, information and costs. By improving organizational coordination and knowledge about internal processes, medium sized manufacturing companies could also have a better ability to identify separate issues specific to their company that is causing ineffectiveness in the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function.</b>   Information about costs and complete cost calculations are also of essence for being able to correctly evaluated alternatives and to make well informed choices. ...|$|R

This {{procedure}} is linear {{in the number of}} customers and products and therefore it can scale with very big matrices.

30|$|The {{methodology}} {{is implemented}} in a three-step process: (i) pre-process, where the data about customer purchases is transformed in a format suitable for our analysis; (ii) analysis, where we calculate the <b>Purchase</b> <b>Function</b> and the Product/Customer Sophistication; (iii) validation, where through a null model we evaluate {{the significance of}} the descriptors. We now proceed describing these three steps, starting from the pre-process.|$|E
30|$|In our {{framework}} we are implementing {{an alternative}} way {{to calculate the}} <b>Purchase</b> <b>Function</b> (isocline). We have chosen {{to do so for}} two reasons. First, all algorithms explicitly reorder the matrix. We do not want to reorder our matrix, since the order we defined in the pre-process is a fundamental prerequisite for the <b>purchase</b> <b>function,</b> as it has been defined above to connect the ranks of customers and products calculated on their volumes of purchases and sales, respectively. These ranks are obtained by the matrix ordering during the preprocessing stage and thus this order cannot be modified. Secondly, the state-of-the-art algorithms are designed to deal with ecology data, with a number of cells in the order of 104 or 105. Since our cells are ∼ 109, we need to define a new procedure, enabling the application of our framework to large datasets. We described the specifications of this methodology in a previously published technical report [15].|$|E

First, we develop a relational view of strategic purchasing embracing both the quality of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> and the properties of its internal and external relations. Second, based on exploratory empirical analysis, we propose four patterns of the link between strategic purchasing and innovation. We find that strategic purchasing is an enabling, but not necessary, condition for a contribution of purchasing to innovation, which in turn mostly relates to the relational resources of purchasing...|$|R
