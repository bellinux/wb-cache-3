The reason lies in the electrostatic adsorption reaction between the cationic gel particle and the anion residual polymer on the rock surface, which larges the grain diameter of cationic gel particle. Therefore, the blocking effect of cationic gel is better than anion gel particle.|$|R

According to Uniform Crime Report statistics {{compiled by the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2011, there were 19 violent crimes and 166 property crimes. The violent crimes consisted of one forcible rape, three robberies and 15 aggravated assaults, while 32 burglaries, 104 larceny-thefts, eight motor vehicle thefts and one arson defined the property crimes. The FBI classifies Omak as having 4,921 people located within the Omak Police Department area. The city's highest crime rate was recorded in 2004, with 413 incidents per 100,000 people. Until 2013, when a murder and motor-vehicle theft occurred in the city, {{there had not been}} a homicide for over ten consecutive years. The crime in Omak has decreased throughout the past decade.

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of low Reynolds number nozzle flows {{was performed to}} investigate the loss mechanisms involved and to determine the nozzle wall contour that minimizes these losses. DSMC was used to simulate flows through three different nozzle configurations at two different stagnation chamber temperatures so that the heat transfer losses could {{be separated from the}} wall contour effects on performance. A trumpet-shaped nozzle had 5 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> efficiency <b>than</b> a conical nozzle and a 3 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> efficiency <b>than</b> a bell-shaped nozzle with the unheated flow. With heated flow both the trumpet and bell-shaped nozzles had a 6. 5 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> efficiency <b>than</b> the conical nozzle. The conical nozzle had the highest discharge coefficient of the three configurations, 0. 92, and the trumpet-shaped nozzle had the lowest, 0. 82. The discharge coefficient of each nozzle was unaffected by the change in stagnation temperature; however the increase in stagnation temperature increased the heat transfer and viscous losses in the boundary layer. These results suggest that the trumpet-shaped wall contour performed most efficiently except near the throat region, where it incurred large viscous losses. However, the bell-shaped nozzle may increase its overall performance with an increase in stagnation temperature...|$|R

Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000.

40|$|Effects of mora phonemes on Japanese {{word accent}} was {{analyzed}} statistically, utilizing {{a set of}} about 124, 000 frequently used common nouns derived from the Japanese Word Dictionary edited by EDR (the Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute, Ltd., Japan). In this analysis, Japanese syllable was defined as preceding consonant (+semi-vowel) +following vowel, accompanied / not accompanied by mora phoneme. Mora phonemes adopted here were elongated portion of vowel: /H/, chocked sound: /Q/, syllabic nasal: /N/, and /i/ portion of diphthongs: /I/. The average ratio of attachment of accent to vowel type syllables was 13 % and to semi-vowel +vowel type syllables 16 %. In both types, the difference according {{to the kind of}} following vowels was not significant. As for the effect of mora phonemes, the ratios of accent attached to the syllables accompanied by mora phonemes were about several <b>percents</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> their average for any kind of following semi-vowels and vowels. The average ratio of accent attached to vowel and semi-vowel +vowel type syllables was 14 %, but in syllables of any kind of preceding consonants accompanied by mora phoneme, the ratios were more <b>than</b> several <b>percents</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the average.
