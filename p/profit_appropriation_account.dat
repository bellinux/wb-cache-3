Without adequate controls, Congress was concerned that agencies could disburse money in amounts and for purposes {{that it had not}} approved. GAO found that DOD improperly charged <b>appropriation</b> <b>accounts</b> after they were closed. GAO also found that DOD did not establish the requisite systems, controls, and managerial attention required to properly account for its disbursements consistent with the 1990 account closing law. As a result, DOD made at least $ 615 million of illegal or otherwise improper adjustments during fiscal year 2000 alone. DOD was aware of the limitations the account closing law placed on the availability of canceled appropriations and that the law was enacted because of previous abuses by DOD. DOD also knew that a major system used to control its use of appropriations allowed for disbursements to be charged {{in a way that was}} inconsistent with the law. However, DOD did nothing to fix the system, even though the cost to do so was minimal. The $ 615 million of adjustments GAO identified as illegal or otherwise improper must be immediately reversed. Also, at a minimum, DOD will need to change its systems, policies, and procedures, along with the weak control environment that fostered these practices, and served to perpetuate the problem. GAO summarized this report in testimony before Congress (GAO- 01 - 994 T). ...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress changed the law governing the use of <b>appropriation</b> <b>accounts</b> in 1990 because it found that the Department of Defense (DOD) may have spent {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars for purposes that Congress had not approved. The 1990 law provided that, 5 years after the expiration of the period of availability of a fixed-term <b>appropriation,</b> the <b>appropriation</b> <b>account</b> be closed and all remaining balances canceled. After closing, the <b>appropriation</b> <b>account</b> could no longer be used for obligations or expenditures for any purpose. DOD has started the process of correcting the illegal or improper closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2000. However, this will require substantial effort and, according to DOD, estimates will not be complete before the end of fiscal year 2002. DOD had upgraded its system control features by the end of fiscal year 2001 to preclude many of the wholesale adjustments that GAO had previously identified. Because its system enhancements were done in stages, including some near the end of fiscal year 2001, DOD continued to make large amounts of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments during the year. However, given the intensity of staff efforts to address these issues, it did not expect to complete the correct accounting for transactions found to be in error until September 2004. A lack of fundamental controls and management oversight over the closed accounts was the primary reason DOD was making so many closed account adjustments. DOD's action to resolve its problems with closed account adjustments is beginning to produce positive short-term results. However, if DOD fails to sustain these positive results, Congress could require DOD to validate and report to the Congress all closed account adjustments. ...|$|R

Officials from four of the eight components define their M&A activities according to the activities funded through their <b>appropriations</b> <b>accounts</b> and programs, projects, or activities (PPA) that are M&A in nature. For example, officials from the Transportation Security Administration said its M&A activities are those found within three PPAs within its Transportation Security Support <b>appropriations</b> <b>account.</b> The remaining four components each define M&A activities differently, and those definitions are not tied to activities contained in specific <b>appropriations</b> <b>accounts.</b> For example, the Coast Guard's M&A activities are those associated with headquarters and its service centers (e. g., personnel support), according to officials.

Officials from seven of the eight components said they could provide M&A spending data for some, but not all, fiscal years since 1999 because of changes in their financial systems, among other reasons.
