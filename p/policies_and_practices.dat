5|$|Many of the <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> which {{resulted}} in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

40|$|While many of {{the drivers}} for {{evidence-based}} <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> are UK wide, there are some distinctive features of the <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> contexts in Scotland that have shaped {{the way in which}} evidence-based implementation is being forged. Within the field of health improvement <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in Scotland, this paper focuses on what Nutley (2003) refers to as one of the prerequisites of evidence based <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> - the development of collaborative mechanisms for bringing closer together those working across research, <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> The first part of the article looks at research-policy-practice collaborations in the development and evaluation of two public health interventions: needle exchanges and teacher-delivered sex education in secondary schools. The second part of the article considers the development of professional roles that are intended to facilitate cross-boundary linkage and exchange between research, <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} geopolitical factors, {{and in particular the}} collapse of Communism and EU accession, on language education <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in Central <b>and</b> Eastern Europe (CEE). CEE is understood here as referring to the former soviet-controlled, eastern bloc counties of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. A particular focus is placed in this paper on the teaching of English and Russian as foreign languages in Hungary and the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). The paper begins by reviewing current thinking in the field of language education <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> It then provides an overview of developments in language education <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in CEE more generally before focussing on two case-studies of language education <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in Hungary <b>and</b> the former GDR. Implications both for language education <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in CEE <b>and</b> for the nature of research in this field are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This {{research}} aims {{to answer}} the call for more empirical research on identity theory by exploring the role and impact of human resource management (HRM) <b>policy,</b> <b>and</b> the gap between HRM <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice,</b> on organizations <b>and</b> their employees. It looks at the role that soft policy plays in obscuring hard <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> considers the impact of unions and HRM role on policy. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses survey data collected from the {{senior members of the}} HRM function in 189 large Australian organisations. Findings - The research found a gap between <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> with soft <b>policy</b> being used more often than soft practice. It found that a gap between <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> has a negative impact on outcomes. Strategic HRM (SHRM) positively impacts on the implementation of soft practices reducing the gap between <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> impoverished HRM that lacks resources, power and time, has a larger gap between <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> Unions did not improve outcomes by minimizing the gap between <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> Research limitations/implications - This paper used survey data from HRM managers, who whilst being the best single source of information, may have distorted their responses. Further research is required to confirm these results using several data sources. Practical implications - Managers and HR functions should increase both soft <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> ensure there is no gap between <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> To achieve this, organizations should ensure that the HRM function is both strategic and effectively resourced. Originality/value - This research makes a theoretical and empirical contribution to debates on the role that HRM rhetoric plays in organizations. It also adds value to SHRM research <b>and</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|R

5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 {{that it looked like}} the garrison would be wiped out in a matter of months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Games {{have been}} criticised as {{upholding}} (and {{in some cases}} increasing) the colonial <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> of some host nations and cities either {{in the name of}} the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production, erasure, commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} researchers’ {{perceptions about}} {{the factors that}} influenced the <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> impacts (or lack of impact) {{of one of their}} own funded intervention research studies. Design: Mixed method, cross-sectional study. Setting: Intervention research conducted in Australia and funded by Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council between 2003 and 2007. Participants: The chief investigators from 50 funded intervention research studies were interviewed to determine if their study had achieved <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> impacts, how <b>and</b> why these impacts had (or had not) occurred and the approach to dissemination they had employed. Results: We found that statistically significant intervention effects and publication of results influenced whether there were <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> impacts, along with factors related {{to the nature of the}} intervention itself, the researchers’ experience and connections, their dissemination and translation efforts, and the postresearch context. Conclusions: This study indicates that sophisticated approaches to intervention development, dissemination actions and translational efforts are actually widespread among experienced researches, <b>and</b> can achieve <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> impacts. However, it was the links between the intervention results, further dissemination actions by researchers and a variety of postresearch contextual factors that ultimately determined whether a study had <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> impacts. Given the complicated interplay between the various factors, there appears to be no simple formula for determining which intervention studies should be funded in order to achieve optimal <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> impacts...|$|R
