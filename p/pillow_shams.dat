40|$|This {{spectacular}} volume, with 260 {{works in}} color and 510 in black and white, records the Eugene and Clare Thaw collection of Native American art now housed in a wing of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Introductory essays by Eugene Thaw, Gilbert Vincent, and Ralph Coe exploring {{the origins of the}} collection and its eventual move to Cooperstown set the stage for eight individual essays by various scholars introducing each of the cultural areas into which the holdings are divided. The Thaw collection was built around the collectors 2 ̆ 7 aesthetic responses to individual works rather than anthropological interest, making it one of very few major collections of Native art to have developed in this manner. Educated as an art historian, Eugene Thaw became a major art dealer specializing in European master drawings. Gradually his own collecting expanded and, with Clare Thaw 2 ̆ 7 s first purchase of a northern Athabascan beaded <b>pillow</b> <b>sham,</b> the couple 2 ̆ 7 s interest in Native American art began. Initially they focused on art that incorporated images of the American flag but soon included masterpieces not bound by that theme. Only when they began to think about a museum location for their holdings 345 did they seek works that allowed the collection to become more fully representative; nonetheless, they still maintained high quality in the expanding breadth of the works. Given the Thaws 2 ̆ 7 location in New York, {{it is not surprising that}} the collection grew particularly strong in Woodlands area art. Through the fortunate timing of other purchases detailed in Coe 2 ̆ 7 s essay, they also obtained extraordinary examples of Northwest Coast work. These are the foremost areas of the collection. The Plains section, discussed in a brief essay by Ted Brasser that examines the Southern, Central and Northern Plains with a very small Plateau section, is quite strong in late-nineteenth-century beadwork, much of it incorporating flag imagery. Among the outstanding pieces are a beaded violin case and a horse mask, both Lakota, from approximately 1899. Drawings on paper are also well represented, most by only a few pages from individual books, but the seventy-six drawings of the Lakota chief Black Hawk 2 ̆ 7 s ledger are important in their exploration of visions and genre scenes of Lakota life. Various other Plains art forms also appear, ranging from painted hides from the first half of the nineteenth century to later nineteenth-century sculpture. An 1830 - 40 Northern Plains shirt and a pair of leggings are true masterpieces...|$|R
5000|$|European pillow (or Continental pillow): A Euro or Continental pillow—a large square pillow—is a {{decorative}} pillow that sits {{back against the}} headboard. These are often placed behind the standard size <b>pillow</b> <b>shams</b> as a backdrop, or on top of standard pillows as a coordinated set with a duvet cover.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} throw pillows (also called toss pillows or <b>pillow</b> <b>shams</b> in {{different}} worldwide dialects of English), which are pillows that are mainly decorative and {{not designed for}} support or comfort. A cushion is a soft bag filled with air or padding such as hollow fiber, feathers, foam or rubber. In the United Kingdom, pillows used on chairs and sofas are called cushions or throw cushions, with the word pillow used only for pillows on a bed. In the UK, cushions are usually square, while bed pillows are oblong.|$|E
50|$|A set of bedding usually {{consists}} of a flat or fitted bed sheet that covers the mattress; a flat top sheet; either a blanket, quilt, or duvet, sometimes with a duvet cover which can replace or be used {{in addition to the}} top sheet; and a number of pillows with pillowcases, also referred to as <b>pillow</b> <b>shams.</b> (See #Terminology for more info on all these terms.) Additional blankets, etc. may be added to ensure the necessary insulation in cold sleeping areas. A common practice for children and some adults is to decorate a bed with plush stuffed animals, dolls, and other soft toys. These are not included under the designation of bedding, although they may provide additional warmth to the sleeper.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Dalton in Northwest Georgia {{became the}} tufted {{bedspread}} {{capital of the}} US thanks to Catherine Evans (later adding Whitener) who initially revived the handcraft technique in the 1890s. Hand-tufted bedspreads with an embroidered appearance became increasingly popular and were referred to as [...] "chenille" [...] a term which stuck. With effective marketing, chenille bedspreads appeared in city department stores and tufting subsequently became important to the economic development of North Georgia, maintaining families even through the Depression era. Merchants organised [...] "spread houses" [...] where products tufted on farms were finished using heat washing to shrink and [...] "set" [...] the fabric. Trucks delivered pattern-stamped sheets and dyed chenille yarns to families for tufting before returning to pay the tufters and collect the spreads for finishing. By this time, tufters {{all over the state}} were creating not only bedspreads but <b>pillow</b> <b>shams</b> and mats and selling them by the highway. The first to make a million dollars in the bedspread business, was Dalton County native, B. J. Bandy {{with the help of his}} wife, Dicksie Bradley Bandy, by the late 1930s, to be followed by many others.|$|E
