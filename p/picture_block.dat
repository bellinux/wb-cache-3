40|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} for MC-DCT (motion compensated – Discrete Cosine Transform) hybrid video coding based on true motion estimation is proposed. The true motion estimation technique employs the leastmedian-squares (LMedS) matching criterion in block matching process for motion estimation. The rationale for using such true motion estimator is that at low bit-rates, very few bits are available for coding the motioncompensated DCT errors, and thus the detection of the true underlying motion of the <b>picture</b> <b>block</b> becomes {{much more important than}} just trying to find a blockmatch that satisfies the traditional least-mean-squares (LMS) matching criterion. Without detecting the true motion of the <b>picture</b> <b>block,</b> the errors due to insufficient bits for coding the motion-compensated DCT errors will be propagated to succeeding inter-frames, resulting in a progressive degeneration on perceptual quality of the pictures. An important advantage of using true motion estimation is that it results in better perceptual video quality compared to the conventional block-matching algorithm that utilizes least-mean-squares matching criterion. Experimental results obtained had supported our proposition on using the LMedS-based matching criterion in block-matching motion estimation for low bitrate video coding. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—One main {{element of}} modern hybrid video coders {{consists}} of motion compensated prediction. It employs spatial or temporal neighborhood {{to predict the}} current sample or block of samples, respectively. The quality of motion compensated prediction largely depends on the similarity of the reference <b>picture</b> <b>block</b> used for prediction and the current <b>picture</b> <b>block.</b> In case of varying blur in the scene, e. g. caused by accelerated motion between the camera and objects in the focal plane, the picture prediction is degraded. Since motion blur is a common characteristic in several application scenarios like action and sport movies we suggest the in-loop compensation of motion blur in hybrid video coding. Former approaches applied motion blur compensation in single layer coding with the drawback of needing additional signaling. In contrast to that we employ a scalable video coding framework. Thus, we can derive strength {{as well as the}} direction of motion of any block for the high quality enhancement layer by base-layer information. Hence, there is no additional signaling necessary neither for predefined filters nor for current filter coefficients. We implemented our approach in a scalable extension of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) reference software HM 8. 1 and are able to provide up to 1 % BD-Rate gain in the enhancement layer compared to the reference at the same PSNR-quality for JCT-VC test sequences and up to 2. 5 % for self-recorded sequences containing lots of varying motion blur...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is based}} on the finding that pictures or a picture stream can be encoded highly efficient when a representation of pictures is chosen that is having different picture blocks, wherein each <b>picture</b> <b>block</b> is carrying picture information for picture areas smaller than the full area of the picture and when the different picture blocks are carrying the picture information either in a first color-space-representation or in a second color-space-representation. Since different color-space-representations have individual inherent properties with respect to their describing parameters, choosing an appropriate color-space-representation individually for the picture blocks results in an encoded representation of pictures that is having a better quality at a given size or bit rate...|$|E

EMG was recorded from {{the left and right}} corrugator and zygomaticus muscles while participants (N = 21) viewed blocks of negative and positive pictures that were high or low in arousal. Ratings of valence and arousal were taken before and after each of the four emotion blocks.

30|$|The blockiness metric is {{measure of}} the visible edges on the coded <b>picture</b> <b>block</b> boundary; it is {{calculated}} based on the Boundary Strength (BS) of the transform block boundaries {{which is part of the}} encoder standard. The amount of blockiness present over a widow of frames is accumulated and a normalized blockiness metric (BM) is computed based on this amount of blockiness. BS value of 4 is high blockiness and BS value of 0 is less blockiness. For the calculation of amount of blockiness, all the block boundaries which have BS equal to 4 for intra coded frames and BS equal to 2 for the inter coded frames are counted. This count is accumulated over a frame and based on this the normalized BM metric is calculated and converted to percentage terms. So the value of the BM is between 0 to 100.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- We have {{presented}} a desktop image compression algorithm for real-time {{applications such as}} remote desktop access by desktop image transmission. The desktop image is called as a complex image, because one 800 X 600 true color image has a size of approximately 1. 54 MB with pictures and text. The algorithm is called as group extraction and coding (GEC). Real-time image transmission requires that the compression algorithm should not only achieve high compression ratio, but also have excellent visual quality and low complexity. In the extraction/ separation phase of the complex desktop image, we have separated the blocks into picture and text/graphics blocks by thresholding the number of colors contained in each block. Text/graphics block classes have been compressed by using a wavelet based SPIHT lossless coding algorithm, while <b>picture</b> <b>block</b> classes, by JPEG algorithm. The compressed blocks have been combined to form a single bit stream.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{majority}} of patients with disgust-related psychiatric disorders such as animal phobias and contamination-related obsessive-compulsive disorder are women. The aim of this {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study was to examine possible sex differences in neural responses to disgust-inducing stimuli that might help explain this female predominance. METHODS: Thirty-four healthy adult volunteers (17 women, all right-handed) were scanned while viewing alternating blocks of disgusting and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Using a partially-silent fMRI sequence, the participants rated their level of discomfort after each <b>block</b> of <b>pictures.</b> Skin conductance responses (SCR) were measured throughout the experiment. All participants completed the Disgust Scale. RESULTS: Both women and men reported greater subjective discomfort and showed more SCR fluctuations during the disgusting <b>picture</b> <b>blocks</b> than during the neutral <b>picture</b> <b>blocks.</b> Women and men also demonstrated a similar pattern of brain response to disgusting compared with neutral pictures, showing activation in the anterior insula, ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, and visual regions. Compared with men, women had significantly higher disgust sensitivity scores, experienced more subjective discomfort, and demonstrated greater activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal regions. However, these differences were no longer significant when disgust sensitivity scores were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adult volunteers, there are significant sex-related differences in brain responses to disgusting stimuli that are irrevocably linked to greater disgust sensitivity scores in women. The implications for disgust-related psychiatric disorders are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{compound}} image compression algorithm for real-time applications of computer screen image transmission. It is called Shape Primitive Extraction and Coding (SPEC). Real-time image transmission {{requires that the}} compression algorithm should not only achieve high compression ratio, but also have low complexity and provide excellent visual quality. SPEC first segments a compound image into text/graphics pixels and pictorial pixels, and then compresses the text/graphics pixels with a new lossless coding algorithm and the pictorial pixels with the standard lossy JPEG, respectively. The segmentation first classifies image <b>blocks</b> into <b>picture</b> and text/graphics <b>blocks</b> by thresholding the number of colors of each block, then extracts shape primitives of text/graphics from <b>picture</b> <b>blocks.</b> Dynamic color palette that tracks recent text/graphics colors is used to separate small shape primitives of text/graphics from pictorial pixels. Shape primitives are also extracted from text/graphics blocks. All shape primitives from both block types are losslessly compressed by using a combined shape-based and palette-based coding algorithm. Then the losslessly coded bitstream is fed into a LZW coder. Experimental {{results show that the}} SPEC has very low complexity and provides visually lossless quality while keeping competitive compression ratios.
