5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety stop to a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by <b>precordial</b> doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.|$|E
25|$|The <b>precordial</b> leads {{lie in the}} {{transverse}} (horizontal) plane, {{perpendicular to}} the other six leads. The six <b>precordial</b> electrodes act as the positive poles for the six corresponding <b>precordial</b> leads: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6). Wilson's central terminal is used as the negative pole.|$|E
25|$|Leads {{are broken}} down into three sets: limb; {{augmented}} limb; and <b>precordial</b> or chest. The 12-lead EKG has {{a total of three}} limb leads and three augmented limb leads arranged like spokes of a wheel in the coronal plane (vertical), and six <b>precordial</b> leads or chest leads that lie on the perpendicular transverse plane (horizontal).|$|E
25|$|In addition, any two <b>precordial</b> leads next to {{one another}} are {{considered}} to be contiguous. For example, though V4 is an anterior lead and V5 is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are {{next to one}} another.|$|E
25|$|In case of type A {{pre-excitation}} (left atrioventricular connections), {{a positive}} R wave {{is seen in}} V1 ("positive delta") on the <b>precordial</b> leads of the electrocardiogram, while in type B pre-excitation (right atrioventricular connections), a predominantly negative delta wave is seen in lead V1 ("negative delta").|$|E
25|$|The <b>precordial</b> thump is a {{manoeuver}} {{promoted as}} a mechanical alternative to defibrillation. Some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once {{and only in}} the case of witnessed and monitored V-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully cardioverting a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} 12-lead ECG report (an electrocardiograph) shows a 2.5 second tracing {{of each of}} {{the twelve}} leads. The tracings are most commonly arranged in a grid of four columns and three rows. the first column is the limb leads (I, II, and III), the second column is the augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, and aVF), and the last two columns are the <b>precordial</b> leads (V1-V6).|$|E
25|$|Additional {{electrodes}} may rarely {{be placed}} to generate other leads for specific diagnostic purposes. Right-sided <b>precordial</b> leads {{may be used}} to better study pathology of the right ventricle or for dextrocardia (and are denoted with an R (e.g., V5R)). Posterior leads (V7 to V9) {{may be used to}} demonstrate the presence of a posterior myocardial infarction. A Lewis lead (requiring an electrode at the right sternal border in the second intercostal space) can be used to study pathological rhythms arising in the right atrium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Precordial</b> {{monitoring}} of the pulmonary artery is the usual monitoring site, as it combines all the blood returning to the body before {{it goes to the}} lungs, so it is least likely to miss bubbles from a peripheral source, and is most compatible with the Spencer and K-M scales, as heart sounds are clearly audible. Other sites which have been used include the subclavian vein, carotid artery, femoral vein and inferior vena cava. Protocols for ultrasonic investigation of decompression bubbles are still in development, and may vary between researchers.|$|E
25|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms of}} commotio cordis are still poorly understood, but probably {{related to the}} activation of mechanosensitive proteins, ion channels. These trigger extra electrical excitation waves which, if occurring right at {{the trailing edge of}} a previous electrical cycle, can give rise to ventricular fibrillation. Since the trailing edge of the preceding electrical cycle travels over the ventricular surface, the critical window for mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation varies locally - i.e. the commotio cordis risk window exists in time and in space. This helps to explain why <b>precordial</b> impacts tend to have benign consequences.|$|E
25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as <b>precordial</b> catch syndrome).|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the <b>precordial</b> thump (hard blows {{given over}} the precordium with a closed fist [...] to revert cardiac arrest) is a sanctioned {{procedure}} for emergency resuscitation by trained health professionals witnessing a monitored arrest when no equipment is at hand, {{endorsed by the}} latest guidelines of the [...] It has been discussed controversially, as—in particular in severe hypoxia—it may cause the opposite effect (i.e., a worsening of rhythm—commotio cordis). In a normal adult, the energy range involved in the <b>precordial</b> thump is five to 10 times below that associated with commotio cordis.|$|E
2500|$|A lead is {{slightly}} more abstract {{and is the}} source of measurement of a vector. For the limb leads, they are [...] "bipolar" [...] and are the comparison between two electrodes. For the <b>precordial</b> leads, they are [...] "unipolar" [...] and compared to a common lead (commonly the Wilson's central terminal), as described below.|$|E
2500|$|Commotio cordis (Latin, [...] "agitation of the heart") is {{an often}} lethal {{disruption}} of heart rhythm that occurs {{as a result}} of a blow to the area directly over the heart (the <b>precordial</b> region), at a critical time during the cycle of a heart beat causing cardiac arrest. It is a form of ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib), not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs, and not the result of heart disease. The fatality rate is about 65% even with prompt CPR and defibrillation, and more than 80% without.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{that same}} year, while {{performing}} an aortic root aortography, Mason Sones, a pediatric cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, {{noted that the}} catheter had accidentally entered the patient's right coronary artery. [...] Before the catheter could be removed, 30cc of contrast agent had been injected. [...] While the patient went into ventricular fibrillation, the dangerous arrhythmia was terminated by Dr. Sones promptly performing a <b>precordial</b> thump which restored sinus rhythm. [...] This became the world's first selective coronary arteriogram. [...] Until that time, {{it was believed that}} even a small amount of contrast agent within a coronary artery would be fatal.|$|E
2500|$|The program {{introduced}} many {{viewers to}} {{the concepts of}} pre-hospital care, fire prevention and CPR. The program was also credited for demonstrating first aid techniques that enabled some viewers to save lives in real medical emergencies. When the medical community saw that the general public were learning these techniques from the show, they started teaching programs for CPR in every state. The show later added a disclaimer that the first aid techniques demonstrated should only be performed by trained individuals. Furthermore, to illustrate the perils of performing first aid when not adequately trained, the episode [...] "Grateful" [...] has a civilian character causing a chest injury when he wrongly performs a <b>precordial</b> thump, a procedure sometimes performed by Gage or DeSoto, but severely reprimanded by Dr. Early for the mistake.|$|E
