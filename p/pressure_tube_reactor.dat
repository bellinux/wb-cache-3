40|$|The Canadian Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) is a {{vertical}} <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> <b>reactor</b> cooled with supercritical light water and moderated with heavy water.

This means that to simulate adequately {{the behavior of the}} core under operating conditions or for anticipated accident scenario, expensive 3 D transport calculations for a complete fuel channel are required. Here, we propose a simulation strategy that takes into account axial variations of the local conditions and avoids 3 D transport calculations. This strategy consists in replacing the 3 D simulation by a series of isolated 2 D calculations followed by a single 1 D simulation. It is shown that this strategy is efficient because the axial coupling along the fuel channel is relatively weak. In addition, the neutronic properties of a channel with axial reflector can be modeled using a simplified 3 D transport calculation...|$|E

40|$|Analytical {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict the hydrodynamic transients resulting from the energetic interactions between a high temperature molten material and a low temperature liquid coolant. Initially, the molten material at high temperature and pressure is separated from the low temperature fluid by a solid metal barrier. Upon contact between the molten material and solid barrier, thermal attack occurs eventually resulting in a loss of barrier integrity. Subsequently, the molten material is injected into the liquid pool resulting in energetic interactions. The analytical models have integrated a wide variety of potentially mutually-interacting transport phenomena which dominate the transient process into a deterministic scheme to predict the hydrodynamic transient process. The model calculations have been compared with the existing experimental results to show its engineering accuracy and adequacy in predicting such energetic interactions. In addition, sensitivity analyses have been performed for the models by varying the values of the major parameters to justify the values of parameters assumed in the numerical calculations. Two {{models have been}} formulated to bracket the transport of molten material to the rupture site for the reactor system. The 2 ̆ 2 stratified 2 ̆ 2 model minimized the rate of transport of material to the break location while the 2 ̆ 2 dispersed 2 ̆ 2 model maximized such transport.

40|$|Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC) is a {{crack growth}} {{mechanism}} {{that occurs in}} zirconium alloys, including the <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> of CANDU <b>reactors.</b> DHC is caused by hydrogen in solution in zirconium components being diffused to any flaws present, resulting in an increased concentration of hydrogen within these flaws. An increased hydrogen concentration can lead to brittleness, followed by cracking, in high-stress regions of a <b>pressure</b> <b>tube.</b> Regular in-service ultrasonic inspection of CANDU <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> aim to locate and classify any flaws that pose a potential for DHC initiation.

40|$|The {{following}} {{report is}} a study of {{various aspects of the}} relationship between heavy water and the development of the civilian and military uses of atomic energy. It begins with a historical sketch which traces the heavy water storyfrom its discovery by Harold Urey in 1932 through its coming of age from scientific curiosity to strategic nuclear material at the eve of World War II and finally into the post-war period, where the military and civilian strands have some- times seemed inextricably entangled. The report next assesses the nonproliferation implications of the use of heavy water- moderated power reactors; several different reactor types are discussed, but the focus in on the natural uranium, on- power fueled, <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> <b>reactor</b> developed in Canada, the CANDU. The need for and development of on-power fueling safe- guards is discussed in some detail. Also considered is the use of heavy water in plutonium production reactors as well as the broader issue of the relative nuclear leverage that suppliers can bring to bear on countries with natural ura- nium-fueled reactors as compared to those using enriched designs. The final chapter reviews heavy water production methods and analyzes the difficulties involved in implemen- ting these on both a large and a small scale. It concludes with an overview of proprietary and nonproliferation constraints on heavy water technology transfer. Our major conclusions are as follows: 1. On-power fueling of CANDU reactors leads to special, well recognized safeguarding problems. These have been addres- sed by a safeguards development program, encompassing both systems analysis and hardware development, jointly sponsored by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd. (AECL), the Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The approach involves surveillance, containment, and item-counting of irradiated fuel bundles. Although the complete system has not as yet been tested on an operating reactor, {{it appears to be a}} good example of "proliferation resistance engineering. " The major problem may be the political one of obtaining agreement to incorporate the system in operating reactors and those under construction. 2. The question of relative leverage on natural uranium vs. enriched uranium fuel cycles does not have a neat answer. At the moment, most of the countries of proliferation concern have neither large amounts of uranium ore nor the ability to enrich it. (There are, of course, some significant excep- tions, the most obvious being South Africa which has both.) In the near term, the chances of achieving a consensus among current suppliers of separative work, all of whom belong to the London Club, not to supply it in the event of violations of nonproliferation agreements, also seems greater than the prospects of reaching a similar agreement among all countries who might be able to supply uranium ore. If we assume in ad- dition that the malefactor also can produce heavy water [...] no small matter [...] the potential leverage advantage would seem to lie with enriched reactors. On the other hand, the spread of enrichment technology [...] which is easier to rationalize on civil- ian grounds if enriched reactors are in place [...] could tip the scales the other way. In general, however, this weighing of enriched vs. natural uranium fuel cycles is unnecessarily restrictive. Experience has shown that there are many poten- tial levers [...] nuclear and non-nuclear [...] which can be used to persuade countries to adhere to nonproliferation norms. The heart of the matter is the political will to use these in the face of conflicting policy objectives. 3. Unlike uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion and the gas centrifuge, key aspects of which are closely held on nonproliferation grounds, techniques for heavy water produc- tion, particularly by hydrogen sulfide-water exchange (the GS process), have been extensively documented in the open liter- ature. Nevertheless, construction and operation of large plants are difficult, and thus there is good reason to believe that the technology will not spread rapidly through the indig- enous efforts of developing countries. Unlike uranium enrich- ment and fuel reprocessing, heavy water production does not provide a direct route from civilian fuel cycle to weapons- usable materials; on these grounds a logical quid pro quo forits transfer would be adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or acceptance of the principle of full-scope safeguards by the recipient...|$|E

Control valves are installed in the bottom lines. Due to the large L/D value and to the presence of valves and other geometric discontinuities along the lines connecting with the pressure channels, the Fuel Channel Blockage (FCB) event is possible and already occurred in two documented NPP events. <b>Pressure</b> <b>tube</b> rupture occurred in a third NPP event not originated by FCB. Previous investigations, have shown the relevance of these events for the safety technology, and the availability of proper computational technique for the analysis, see the ﬁrst and the third companion paper in this journal issue, respectively. The occurrence of the FCB event remains undetected for a few tens of seconds {{because of the lack of}} full monitoring for the individual channels, fourth companion paper in this journal issue. Therefore, ﬁssion power continues to be produced in the absence of cooling. This brings in subsequent times to fuel rod overheating, <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> failure, damage of the neighbouring graphite brick and ejection of damaged fuel. Following the <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> rupture, <b>reactor</b> cavity pressurization, radioactivity release into the same area and change of ﬂuid properties occur that allow the detection of the event and cause the reactor scram at a time of a few tens of seconds depending upon the channel working conditions and the severity of the blockage. Notwithstanding the [delayed] scram and the full capability of the reactor designed safety features to keep cooled the core, the multiple <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> rupture (MPTR) issue is raised. The question to be answered is whether the ‘explosion’ of the blocked <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> damages not only the neighbour graphite bricks but propagates to other channels causing the potential for several channel failure.

The initial uptake coefficient was found to be independent of the concentration of H 2 O 2 and UV irradiation intensity and to decrease with increasing RH and temperature according to the following expressions: γ 0 = 4. 8 × 10 – 4 /(1 + RH 0. 66) at T = 275 K and γ 0 = 3. 2 × 10 – 4 /(1 + 2. 5 × 1010 exp(− 7360 /T)) at RH = 0. 35 % (calculated using BET surface area, estimated conservative uncertainty of 30 %). By contrast, the steady state uptake coefficient was found to be independent of temperature, to increase upon UV irradiation of the surface, and to be inversely (γSS ∼ [H 2 O 2]− 0. 6) dependent on the concentration of H 2 O 2. The RH independent steady state uptake coefficient was measured under dark and UV irradiation conditions: γSS(dark) = (0. 95 ± 0. 30) × 10 – 5 and γSS(UV) = (1. 85 ± 0. 55) × 10 – 5, for RH = (2 – 69) % and [H 2 O 2] 0 ≅ 1. 0 × 1012 molecules cm– 3.

40|$|A CANDU- 6 reactor, {{which has}} 380 fuel {{channels}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> type, {{is suffering from}} aging or creep of the <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes.</b> Most of the aging effects for the CANDU primary heat transport system were originated from the horizontal crept <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes.</b> As the operating years of a CANDU <b>reactor</b> proceed, a <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> experiences high neutron irradiation damage under high temperature and pressure. The crept <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> can deteriorate the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) of a fuel channel and finally worsen the reactor operating performance and thermal margin. Recently, the modification of the central subchannel area with increasing inner pitch length of a standard 37 -element fuel bundle was proposed and studied {{in terms of the}} dryout power enhancement for the uncrept <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> since a standard 37 -element fuel bundle has a relatively small flow area and high flow resistance at the central region. This study introduced a subchannel analysis for the crept <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> loaded with the inner pitch length modification of a standard 37 -element fuel bundle. In addition, the subchannel characteristics were investigated according to the flow area change of the center subchannels for the crept <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes.</b> Also, it was discussed how much the crept <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> affected the thermalhydraulic characteristics of the fuel channel as well as the dryout power for the modification of a standard 37 -element fuel bundle...|$|R

The uptake coefficients were measured {{as a function of}} the initial concentration of gaseous H 2 O 2 ([H 2 O 2] 0 = (0. 15 – 16. 6) × 1012 molecule cm− 3), irradiance intensity (JNO 2 = 0. 002 − 0. 012 s− 1 JNO 2 = 0. 002 − 0. 012 s− 1), relative humidity (RH = 0. 003 – 73 %) and temperature (T = 268 – 320 K). Deactivation of mineral surfaces upon exposure to H 2 O 2 was observed and only initial uptake coefficients of H 2 O 2 were quantified, given by the following expressions: γ 0 (Al 2 O 3) = 1. 10 × 10 − 3 /(1 + RH 0. 93) and γ 0 (Fe 2 O 3) = 1. 05 × 10 − 3 /(1 + RH 0. 73) (calculated using BET surface area, estimated conservative uncertainty of 30 %) at T = 280 K. The initial uptake coefficients were found to be independent of the UV irradiation intensity and concentration of H 2 O 2. Temperature dependence of γ 0 measured at RH = 0. 3 % corresponded to almost temperature independent values of γ 0 at lower temperatures of the study (268 – 280 K) and to rather rapid decrease of γ 0 with increase of temperature above 290 K, according to the following expressions: γ 0 (Al 2 O 3) = 8. 7 × 10 − 4 /(1 + 5. 0 × 1013 exp(− 9700 T− 1)) and γ 0 (Fe 2 O 3) = 9. 3 × 10 − 4 /(1 + 3. 6 × 1014 exp(− 10300 T− 1)).

The uptake coefficients were measured {{as a function of the}} initial concentration of gaseous H 2 O 2 ([H 2 O 2] 0 = (0. 17 – 120) × 1012 molecules cm– 3), irradiance intensity (JNO 2 = 0. 002 – 0. 012 s– 1), relative humidity (RH = 0. 003 – 82 %), and temperature (T = 275 – 320 K). Under dark conditions, a deactivation of TiO 2 surface upon exposure to H 2 O 2 was observed, and only initial uptake coefficient of H 2 O 2 was measured, given by the following expression: γ 0 (dark) = 4. 1 × 10 – 3 /(1 + RH 0. 65) (calculated using BET surface area, estimated conservative uncertainty of 30 %) at T = 300 K. The steady-state uptake coefficient measured on UV irradiated TiO 2 surface, γss(UV), was found to be independent of RH and showed a strong inverse dependence on [H 2 O 2] and linear dependence on photon flux. In addition, slight negative temperature dependence, γss(UV) = 7. 2 × 10 – 4 exp[(460 ± 80) /T], was observed in the temperature range (275 – 320) K (with [H 2 O 2] ≈ 5 × 1011 molecules cm– 3 and JNO 2 = 0. 012 s– 1). Experiments with NO addition into the reactive system provided indirect evidence for HO 2 radical formation upon H 2 O 2 uptake, and the possible reaction mechanism is proposed. Finally, the atmospheric lifetime of H 2 O 2 with respect to the heterogeneous loss on mineral dust was estimated (using the uptake data for TiO 2) to be in the range of hours during daytime, i. e., comparable to H 2 O 2 photolysis lifetime (∼ 1 day), which is the major removal process of hydrogen peroxide in the atmosphere. These data indicate a strong potential impact of H 2 O 2 uptake on mineral aerosol on the HOx chemistry in the troposphere...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are major}} {{component}} of nuclear reactor, but only selected samples are periodically examined due to numerous numbers of <b>tubes.</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>tube</b> material gradually pick up deuterium, as such are susceptible to a crack initiation and propagation process called delayed hydride cracking (DHC), which is the characteristic of <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> integrity evaluation. If cracks are not detected, such a cracking mechanism could lead to unstable rupture of the <b>pressure</b> <b>tube.</b> Up to this time, integrity evaluations are performed using conventional deterministic approaches. So {{it is expected that}} the results obtained are too conservative to perform a rational evaluation of lifetime. In this respect, a probabilistic safety assessment method is more appropriate for the assessment of overall <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> safety. This paper describes failure probability estimation of the <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> using probabilistic fracture mechanics. Failure assessment diagram (FAD) of <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> material is proposed and applied in the probabilistic analysis.
