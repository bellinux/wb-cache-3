5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that <b>pick-up</b> {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to <b>pick-up</b> eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|The Hotshot vehicle or {{truck is}} {{essentially}} a <b>pick-up</b> with a larger load capacity than a personal truck. Hotshots are typically single axle 1-ton to 3-ton trucks, which can be either a dual or single tire.|$|E

50|$|Other {{customized}} vehicles {{used for}} mobilization of police personnel are usually modified Isuzu Elfs and Toyota Dynas with horizontal side sitting facilities {{inside of the}} trunk covered by dark colored canvas for canopy. Costumed patrol <b>pick-ups</b> with mounted sitting facilities on the trunk covered with canopy are also operated by the police to carry police personnel during patrol, the <b>pick-ups</b> are usually Isuzu Panther <b>pick-ups</b> and usually operate in rural areas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pick-ups</b> are wired {{in series}} rather than the more usual {{parallel}} configuration. The output is also added together when {{wired in series}}, meaning that with all three <b>pick-ups</b> turned on the output is tripled.|$|R
5|$|After August, pick-ups were {{conducted}} as Raimi sought to film more action scenes. The film then wrapped in October, although additional special effects shots {{were taken to}} finalize the production a month later. In early 2007, there were further <b>pick-up</b> shots regarding the resolution of Sandman's story, amounting to four different versions.|$|E
5|$|McG, Schwartz's fellow {{executive}} producer on The O.C., directed {{the pilot and}} consequently became an {{executive producer}} (via his production company, Wonderland Sound and Vision), along with Fedak, Peter Johnson, Scott Rosenbaum, Matthew Miller and Allison Adler. NBC gave the series an early <b>pick-up</b> and a thirteen-episode order on May10,2007.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the <b>pick-up</b> points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the <b>pick-up</b> points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pick-ups</b> were {{conducted}} from 2001 to 2003 {{for six weeks}} every year to refine each film's edit. For the first two films they often returned to sets; for the third, they had to shoot around the clock in a car park full of set parts. <b>Pick-ups</b> provided a chance for cast and crew to meet in person again, and during The Two Towers <b>pick-ups,</b> Sean Astin directed a short film entitled The Long and Short of It.|$|R

He originally wound his own <b>pick-ups,</b> as he had for his first guitar, {{but he did not}} like the resulting sound because of the polarity of these pick-ups: alternating North-South instead of all North.|$|R
5|$|The 1972–73 NC State Wolfpack {{team was}} forced to skip postseason play due to an NCAA {{recruiting}} infraction. Assistant coach Eddie Biedenbach had played in a <b>pick-up</b> (impromptu) basketball game with David Thompson on a recruiting visit to Raleigh, North Carolina. The Wolfpack finished the season undefeated at 27–0 but were never {{given the opportunity to}} compete for the national championship.|$|E

Michael Straczynski have cameo {{appearances}} as <b>pick-up</b> truck drivers, Walter Simonson has a cameo appearance {{as one of the}} guests at a large Asgardian banquet, and Samuel L. Jackson and Jeremy Renner have uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Clint Barton, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} airport services are further transportation connections, including rail networks, taxi and shuttle services at curbside <b>pick-up</b> areas, and public buses. Large areas for automobile parking, often in co-located multi-storey car parks, are also typical to find at airports. Some airports provide shuttle services to parking garages for passengers and airport employees. Due to the very large scale of international airports, some have constructed shuttle services to transport passengers between terminals. Such systems operate for example, in Singapore Changi Airport and Zurich Airport.|$|E

5|$|Development of Spider-Man 3 began {{immediately}} {{after the release of}} Spider-Man 2 for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman, but at the request of producer Avi Arad, he added Venom, and the producers also requested the addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006, and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland before moving to New York City from May until July 2006. Additional <b>pick-up</b> shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures Imageworks created 900 visual effects shots.|$|E
5|$|The town of Redemption was {{designed}} by Patrizia von Brandenstein, known for her work on Amadeus (1984) and The Untouchables (1987). Raimi's first choice as the visual effects supervisor was William Mesa, his collaborator on Darkman (1991) and Army of Darkness (1993). Instead, Sony chose The Computer Film Company to create the VFX sequences. <b>Pick-up</b> scenes took place through November - December 1994. This included an extended duel between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman.|$|E
5|$|The {{two major}} {{evacuation}} points chosen for Operation Frequent Wind were the DAO Compound adjacent to Tan Son Nhut Airport for American and Vietnamese civilian evacuees, and the US Embassy, Saigon for Embassy staff. The {{plan for the}} evacuation included buses positioned at 28 buildings throughout metropolitan Saigon designated as <b>pick-up</b> points, with American civilian bus drivers standing by at those buildings. The buses would follow one of four planned evacuation routes from downtown Saigon to the DAO Compound, each route named after a Western Trail: Santa Fe, Oregon, Texas, etc.|$|E

50|$|The XDR can use three {{different}} weapons from item <b>pick-ups</b> including its standard upgradable shot, missile <b>pick-ups</b> and Options. The ship can collect the Wide Beam/Vulcan shot, Laser and the Wave Shot. The missile <b>pick-ups</b> actually fire as ground force bombs that fire in four directions once fully upgraded. The ship's Options power up strangely {{in that the}} first selected Option encircles the ship, but {{the second and third}} power-ups cause the Option to follow the ship from behind rather than encircle it as well as multiply. The ship can also collect items such as a temporary shield and 1 Up icons.|$|R
5|$|Attendees {{of major}} {{conventions}} receive a {{bag with the}} convention book (or conbook), a lavishly illustrated volume featuring themed artwork, fiction and articles submitted by members and the Guests of Honor, along {{with a description of}} the event's programming, staff, rules, guests and any charity being supported by the convention. Local restaurant information and a combination pocket schedule and map may also be included.

They may also be displayed prominently in convention publications.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a <b>pick-up</b> by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
5|$|Enugu {{is located}} on the narrow-gauge Eastern Line railway linked to the city of Port Harcourt; the Enugu train station is {{by the side of the}} National Stadium; dating back to its coal-mining origins, it {{is located on}} Ogui Street. The main forms of {{transportation}} in the city are taxi cabs and buses. , Okada (motorcycles) once served as public transportation in the city until the state government banned them from this use in April 2009. Most transport enters and leaves the city through Enugu's Ogbete Motor Park, Garki Motor Park serves as a transport <b>pick-up</b> point as well. Unregistered taxis are known as Kabu Kabu and are differentiated with registered ones through the lack of yellow paint on the unregistered vehicles.|$|E

5|$|In late 1939, the Southern Railway, {{until then}} {{primarily}} a high-density commuter railway serving London and South-East England, {{much of it}} electrified with third-rail <b>pick-up,</b> found itself on the British front line of the Second World War, with a severe lack of modern freight-handling capability. The newest freight design was the Q Class 0-6-0 of 1938, the last locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell. Built to essentially Victorian era principles, these had been designed as replacements {{for many of the}} older 0-6-0s inherited by the Southern Railway in 1923, and entered service in January 1938. Maunsell, having retired at the end of October 1937, was replaced by Oliver Bulleid.|$|E
5|$|N'Diaye {{was born}} in Dakar, Senegal to Seynabou and Mbad N'Diaye. He has an older brother, named Adam. He grew up playing soccer and did not seriously begin playing {{basketball}} at a young age. In 2010, Amadou Koundoul, who was the assistant coach for the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team at the time, saw N'Diaye participate in a <b>pick-up</b> game in a gymnasium at Dakar. He asked him {{to travel to the}} United States, and N'Diaye accepted the offer. He arrived in the US without knowing how to speak English. In the new country, he initially had trouble with speaking English and often needed things to be translated to French.|$|E
5|$|Nash grew {{up playing}} soccer—he stated in a 2005 {{interview}} {{that he could have}} played professionally if he had focused on it—and continues to hold an interest in the sport.

Nash is friends with several professional soccer players, including Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Owen Hargreaves, Massimo Ambrosini and Steve McManaman. During his off-season, when he lives in New York City, he has trained with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, and once tried to arrange a <b>pick-up</b> game in the city's Central Park with the Red Bulls and one of his local teams.|$|E
