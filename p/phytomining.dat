50|$|Pycnandra acuminata is {{a species}} of plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is a {{rainforest}} shrub, endemic to New Caledonia, and is adapted to the nickel-rich ultramafic soils found there. Pycnandra acuminata is notable {{as one of the}} most prolific hyperaccumulators of trace metals known, actively absorbing nickel from the soil and concentrating it within the plant to a concentration of up to 25% nickel citrate as dry weight of the sap, which is blue in colour due to the nickel content. The reason for this adaptation is not well established, but heavy metals such as nickel in soil are usually toxic to plants and it is thought that by complexing them into less-toxic organic salts and concentrating them in certain tissues, the plant may protect other more sensitive tissue from excess levels of toxic metal ions, or deter herbivores due to the toxicity.

40|$|The {{technique}} of <b>phytomining</b> involves growing {{a crop of}} a metal-hyperaccumulating plant species, harvesting the biomass and burning it to produce a bio-ore. The first <b>phytomining</b> experiments were carried out in California using the Ni-hyperaccumulator Streptanthus polygaloides and {{it was found that}} a yield of 100 kg/ha of sulphur-free Ni could be produced. We have used the same technique to test the <b>phytomining</b> potential of the Ni-hyperaccumulators Alyssum bertolonii from Italy and Berkheya coddii from South Africa. The effect of different fertiliser treatments on growth of Alyssum bertolonii was established in situ in Tuscany and showed that the biomass of the plant could be increased by a factor of nearly 3 (4. 5 t/ha to 12 t/ha) without significant loss of the Ni concentration (7600 mg/kg) in the plant. Analogous experiments have been carried out on Berkheya coddii where a biomass yield of over 20 t/ha can readily be achieved though the Ni concentration is not as high as in A. bertolonii. The total yield is, however, much greater. We have also been able to induce plants to hyperaccumulate Au by adding ammonium thiocyanate to the substrate. Up to 57 mg/kg Au (dry mass) could be accumulated by Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). Unusual hyperaccumulation (> 500 mg/kg dry mass) of T 1 has been determined in Iberis intermedia and Biscutella laevigata (Brassicaceae) from southern France. The Iberis contained up to 0. 445 TI (4000 mg/kg) in the whole-plant dry matter and the Biscutella over 1. 5 %. This unusually high accumulation of T 1 has significance for animal and human health, phytoremediation of contaminated soils, and <b>phytomining</b> for T 1.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in Italy on the {{potential}} use of the hyperaccumulator Alyssum bertolonii in <b>phytomining</b> of ultramafic soils for Ni. In situ experimental plots at Murlo, Tuscany were fertilized with various regimes during a 2 -year period. The best fertilizer treatment (N 4 - K 4 - P) gave a threefold increase of the biomass of reproductive matter to 9. 0 t/ha without dilution of the unfertilized Ni content. A Ni content of 0. 8 % in dry matter (11 % in ash), would give a Ni yield of 72 kg/ha without need of resowing for a further crop. There was no correlation between the age of a plant and its Ni content. The long-term cropping sustainability of the soils was simulated by sequential extractions with KH phthalate solutions at pH 2, 4 and 6 that showed a limiting available Ni content of 768 μg/g. Thus just over seven croppings at pH 6 in the rhizosphere would reduce the available Ni pool by 30 %. A proposed model for <b>phytomining</b> involves harvesting the crop after 12 months and burning the material to produce a sulphur-free bio-ore with about 11 % Ni.

This review examines the current status, progress and challenges {{in the development of}} Ni <b>phytomining</b> agronomy since the first field trial over two decades ago. To date, the agronomy of less than 10 species has been tested, while most research focussed on Alyssum murale and A. corsicum. Nickel <b>phytomining</b> trials have so far been undertaken in Albania, Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and USA using ultramafic or Ni-contaminated soils with 0. 05 - 1 % total Ni. N, P and K fertilisation significantly increases the biomass of Ni hyperaccumulator plants, and causes negligible dilution in shoot Ni concentration. Organic matter additions have pronounced positive effects on the biomass of Ni hyperaccumulator plants, but may reduce shoot Ni concentration. Soil pH adjustments, S additions, N fertilisation, and bacterial inoculation generally increase Ni phytoavailability, and consequently, Ni yield in 'metal crops'. Calcium soil amendments are necessary because substantial amounts of Ca are removed through the harvesting of 'bio-ore'. Organic amendments generally improve the physical properties of ultramafic soil, and soil moisture has a pronounced positive effect on Ni yield. Repeated 'metal crop' harvesting depletes soil phytoavailable Ni, but also promotes transfer of non-labile soil Ni to phytoavailable forms.

Fertilization of wild plants of A. bertolonii in Italy increased the biomass {{by a factor of}} three, to give a yield of 9 t ha(- 1) without consequent reduction of the nickel concentration of 7000 mg kg(- 1) dry mass. This species can thus be used for phytoremediation of soils lightly polluted with nickel. Analogous experiments with B. coddii gave a fertilized dry biomass of 22 t ha(- 1) with 5000 mg kg- 1 nickel in dry biomass. This species would need only half the number of crops required for A. bertolonii to remediate weakly polluted soils. A single crop of B. coddii could remove about 110 kg ha(- 1) of nickel (worth US$ 579 in November 2001) compared with 63 kg ha(- 1) by A. bertolonii, worth $ 331. Assuming that only half {{of the value of the}} nickel was returned to the grower, the <b>phytomining</b> operation could be potentially economic for B. coddii but not for A. bertolonii.

Alyssum murale, a Ni-hyperaccumulator, is commonly found on ultramafic soils around the Mediterranean. For a more efficient <b>phytomining,</b> we should characterize rhizosphere microorganisms of these plants, to find good indicators for the success of Ni extraction and to select interesting PGPR. However, most studies have focused on analyzing soils with techniques that provide little detail about the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities. Alyssum murale can grow on non-ultramafic soils as well, with an altitudinal extension ranging from sea level to 2000 m. a. s. l. Among edaphic factors that could influence the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities, altitude and Ni bioavailability could be significant. Our objectives were to understand the specific changes in the structure of A. murale rhizosphere bacterial community that occur across two gradients: 1) elevation and 2) bioavailable Ni.

Chapter 3 discusses the potential of <b>phytomining</b> to recover palladium from mine waste materials. These studies determined that willow (Salix sp.) and miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus) were able to accumulate high levels of palladium in the aerial tissues when grown on synthetic media containing palladium as well as on mine waste materials. The use of chemical lixiviants improved the uptake and translocation of palladium in both willow and miscanthus. The potential of palladium nanoparticle formation in plants as plant-based catalysts was investigated but no palladium nanoparticles were detected when the plants were grown on synthetic mine waste. Chapter 4 evaluates the potential of merA gene for mercuric reductase in Arabidopsis as a genetic engineering approach to improve tolerance to gold and palladium in plants. In contrast to previously published findings merA expression did not increase tolerance of the transgenic plants to toxic levels of gold and palladium. Inhibition studies on purified mercuric reductase further revealed that gold and palladium inhibited the activity of MerA with ionic mercury. In Chapter 5, the potential of synthetic biology strategy was also investigated where the expression of synthetic short peptides, which are shown to be responsible in the formation of various sizes of metal nanoparticles in vitro, were found to increase the formation of smaller sized gold nanoparticles (< 10 nm diameter) compared to wild type plants when expressed in Arabidopsis. Chapter 6 describes the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis to precious metals and investigates the potential involvement of heavy metal transporter 5 (AtHMA 5) in the detoxification mechanism for gold and palladium. AtHMA 5 was found to be strongly up regulated in response to gold and palladium. However, studies with Arabidopsis hma 5 - 1 mutant knockout lines and yeast heterologous expression studies demonstrated that gold and palladium is not a substrate for AtHMA 5 suggesting that AtHMA 5 is not involved in gold and palladium detoxification.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the investigation of}} the potential use of plants to remove heavy metals, in particular nickel, zinc and cadmium, from soils. The study is divided into three sections, bioavailability, <b>phytomining,</b> and phytoremediation. The effect of various extractants on the solubility of heavy metals in some soils was tested. It was found that the solubility of the metal invariably increased as the pH of the extractant decreased, and as the concentration of the extractant increased. These relationships could be predicted mathematically. It concluded that a more concentrated, neutral, non-chelating extractant such as 1 M ammonium acetate, is the most suitable for estimating bioavailability. An investigation into the addition of some compounds to soils to increase metal solubility showed that EDTA and citric acid should maximise solubility while keeping soil parameters (pH, osmotic potential, nutrient availability) within the growth range of the plant. These compounds are also relatively inexpensive. The effect of bioavailable elements on a New Zealand serpentine flora was investigated with regard to the soil's potential for phytoextraction. It was found that nickel was the only element that would be suitable for phytoextraction from these soils. The relative infertility of the serpentines was attributed primarily to the toxic effects of magnesium and/or nickel. Removing nickel from the soil by phytoextraction may enable the soil {{to be used as a}} magnesium-rich fertiliser. The potential of the hyperaccumulator plants Alyssum bertolonii and Berkheya coddii for nickel phytoextraction was studied. With the addition of fertilisers, the plants could remove respectively in excess of 72 kg and 100 kg of nickel per hectare per annum. Were the metal to be sold, and energy from the plant's incineration utilised, the net profit per hectare would be greater than that of a crop of wheat. Both of these plants re-grew after harvesting without the need to re-sow. In the case of B. coddii, the nickel concentration in the regrowth was more than twice that of the original crop. <b>Phytomining</b> for nickel is a viable proposition provided the operation is carried out over a large area. The nickel concentration in the plants was logarithmically related to the nickel extracted by a 1 M ammonium acetate extract. Theoretical nickel yields from various soils could be predicted by performing a 1 M ammonium acetate extraction on the soils. About half of the soils tested from various locations around the world contained enough soluble nickel to be economically phytomined. Alyssum bertolonii and B. coddii also have the potential to remove nickel from polluted soils. The addition of EDTA and citric acid to the soil in which the plants grew actually decreased the nickel concentration in the plants despite increasing the nickel solubility in the soil. The economics of <b>phytomining</b> are closely linked to the value of the metal. Cobalt and possibly even the noble metals could be economically phytomined at low concentrations in plants: a fertile area for future research. Sequential extractions were used to model the effect of successive hyperaccumulator crops on the bioavailability of nickel in ultramafic soils from around the world. The nickel concentration in all of the soils tested, decreased in a regular manner and could be predicted mathematically. Assuming an initial nickel crop of 100 kg/ha, the number of nickel crops above 70 kg/ha that could be obtained was calculated for each soil. The number of economic nickel crops varied between 3 and 18 before the soil would have to have been modified to increase nickel bioavailability. The possibility of removing zinc and cadmium using Thlaspi caerulescens showed that the plant has a potential use for removing cadmium from weakly polluted soils. The low bioaccumulation factor for zinc accumulation means that this element will never be removed in a reasonable time span. The concentration of both zinc and cadmium in the plant could be predicted by the extractable fraction in the soil as estimated by using 1 M ammonium acetate as extractant. It was concluded that <b>phytomining</b> and phytoremediation are feasible possibilities under certain conditions. (1) Metals necessarily have to be slightly soluble in the soil before they can be phytoextractcd. Metal solubility may be improved by the addition of chemicals such as chelating agents. (2) Due to relatively low yields, <b>phytomining</b> will only be viable for more valuable elements where the concentrations in soils are too low for conventional mining. (3) Phytoremediation will be most effective on weakly polluted soils. (4) The economics of phytoextraction favour its use over large areas.

Plants grown at initial densities of four and six plants per square metre did not fully cover the ground; gaps were filled in naturally by a second spontaneous generation of A. murale seedlings (recruits) that had germinated in Autumn 2012. Other weeds were eliminated with herbicides. At Domosdove, at densities of one and six plants and at Pojske of four plants per square metre, the biomass yield was 10, 5 and 10 tha(- 1), respectively. Concentration of phytoextracted nickel was 77, 41 and 112 kgha(- 1). We suggest that a density of four plants per square metre is suitable for phytoextraction with native populations of A. murale. A. murale can be a weed itself and lower the nickel phytoextraction yield. Plants responded differently in their native environment than in previous field trials in North America...|$|E
40|$|The genus Alyssum (Brassicaceae) {{contains}} Ni hyperaccumulators (50), many {{of which}} can achieve 30 g kg- 1 Ni in dry leaf. Some Alyssum hyperaccumulators are viable candidates for commercial Ni phytoremediation and <b>phytomining</b> technologies. It is not known whether these species secrete organic and/or amino acids into the rhizosphere to solubilize Ni, or can make use of such acids within the soil to facilitate uptake. It has been hypothesized that in fields with mixed plant species, mobilization of metals by phytosiderophores secreted by Graminaceae plants could affect Alyssum Ni, Fe, Cu and Mn uptake. We co-cropped the Ni hyperaccumulator Alyssum murale, non-hyperaccumulator A. montanum and perennial ryegrass in a natural serpentine soil. All treatments had standard inorganic fertilization required for ryegrass growth and one treatment was compost amended. After 4 months A. murale leaves and stems contained 3600 mg kg- 1 Ni which {{did not differ significantly}} with co-cropping. Overall Ni and Mn concentrations were significantly higher in A. murale than in A. montanum or L. perenne. Copper was not accumulated by either Alyssum species, but L. perenne accumulated up to 10 mg kg- 1. A. montanum could not compete with either A. murale or ryegrass, and neither Alyssum species survived in the compost-amended soil. Co-cropping with ryegrass reduced Fe and Mn concentrations in A. murale but not to the extent of either increasing Ni uptake or affecting plant nutrition. The hypothesized Alyssum Ni accumulation in response to phytosiderophores secreted by co-cropped grass did not occur. Our data do not support increased mobilization of Mn by a phytosiderophore mechanism either, but the converse: mobilization of Mn by the Alyssum hyperaccumulator species significantly increased Mn levels in L. perenne. Tilling soil to maximize root penetration, adequate inorganic fertilization and appropriate plant densities are more important for developing efficient phytoremediation and <b>phytomining</b> approaches...|$|E
40|$|Serpentine (i. e. ultramafic) {{outcrops}} in Europe {{cover more}} than 10, 000 km 2 {{and have a}} low-fertility and low-productivity, making them unattractive for traditional agriculture. In general, these areas are slowly abandoned by local farmers, affected by strong rural exodus and landscapes undergo a process of closure. However, ultramafic landscapes {{have the potential to}} provide multiple ecosystem services that can contribute to Europe’s goals towards insuring food security, production of renewable raw materials and renewable energy. <b>Phytomining</b> (Agromining) aims at cultivating metal hyperaccumulator plants that are able to accumulate Ni and other strategic elements from metal-rich soils and transport them to the shoots (> 1 %), which can then be harvested as a bio-ore. Such metal-rich biomass can be used to recover highly valuable metals, e. g. nickel (Ni) and also to produce energy (heat, electricity). Nickel agromining can thus offer an eco-efficient alternative to classical pyro- or hydrometallurgical processes without disturbing the soil cover and the geology from soils and rocks that would be considered as low grade ores or sterile material for conventional mining methods. <b>Phytomining</b> agroecosystems can lead to better soil resource efficiency and can offer a fully integrated, new agromining agriculture that could cover thousands of km 2 in Europe, benefit local communities with a sustainable rural development and provide a wide array of ecosystem services which will need to be optimised under a Life Cycle Assessment methodology: 1. 	Production of bio-sourced metal products 2. 	Production of energy biomass 3. 	Restoration of soil fertility for conventional agriculture (Ni stress) 4. 	Limiting Ni intake by local populations and farmers 5. 	Use and conservation of local biodiversity (plant and soil fauna and microflora) as cultivated ecosystems 6. 	Store carbon in cultivated soils 7. 	Enhance pollination activity at landscape level. Nickel agromining could therefore change the economical balance in historically-disadvantaged ultramafic regions of Europe...|$|E
30|$|Algae are {{considered}} as significant nanofactories {{and hold a}} huge potential as ecofriendly and cost-effective tools, avoiding toxic, harsh chemicals and the high energy demand required for physiochemical fabrication. In the present review, we have discussed the biosynthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles {{from a variety of}} algae and their toxicity against several pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The proteins, polysaccharides, amines, amino acids, alcohols, pigments, carboxylic acids carbohydrates and sugars have been shown to act as reducing agents. Also, they act as capping and stabilizing agents for the fabricated nanoparticles. The results suggest that the functionalized metal nanoparticles may be exploited in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria and fungi. They can also be used in <b>phytomining</b> and sequestering metals from waste disposals by redox process.|$|E
40|$|Phytoremediation, the use {{of plants}} to {{remediate}} sites contaminated with organic and inorganic pollutants, and <b>phytomining,</b> the technology involved in extracting the pollutants removed for commercial purposes, are rapidly-growing industries with multi-million dollar markets. This solar-driven, green technology is often favored over more conventional methods of clean-up due to its low cost, low impact, and wider public acceptance. In this paper we discuss phytoremediation as a valid alternative for remediating contaminated bodies of soils and water in developing countries like Sri Lanka, where clean-up can often be stalled due to the high costs associated with traditional remediation technologies. While phytoremediation techniques clearly have limitations, a carefully-planned phytoremediation-phytomining operation using native, fast-growing, deep-rooted, high-biomass species, will not only remediate contaminated sites, greatly reducing exposure to contaminants by humans and wildlife, but also generate income from otherwise barren land unsuitable for agricultural or recreational purposes...|$|E
40|$|The term “hyperaccumulator” {{describes}} {{a number of}} plants that belong to distantly related families, but share the ability to grow on metalliferous soils and to accumulate extraordinarily high amounts of heavy metals in the aerial organs, far {{in excess of the}} levels found in the majority of species, without suffering phytotoxic effects. Three basic hallmarks distinguish hyperaccumulators from related non-hyperaccumulating taxa: a strongly enhanced rate of heavy metal uptake, a faster root-to-shoot translocation and a greater ability to detoxify and sequester heavy metals in leaves. An interesting breakthrough that has emerged from comparative physiological and molecular analyses of hyperaccumulators and related non-hyperaccumulators is that most key steps of hyperaccumulation rely on different regulation and expression of genes found in both kinds of plants. In particular, a determinant role in driving the uptake, translocation to leaves and, finally, sequestration in vacuoles or cell walls of great amounts of heavy metals, is played in hyperaccumulators by constitutive overexpression of genes encoding transmembrane transporters, such as members of ZIP, HMA, MATE, YSL and MTP families. Among the hypotheses proposed to explain the function of hyperaccumulation, most evidence has supported the “elemental defence” hypothesis, which states that plants hyperaccumulate heavy metals as a defence mechanism against natural enemies, such as herbivores. According to the more recent hypothesis of “joint effects”, heavy metals can operate in concert with organic defensive compounds leading to enhanced plant defence overall. Heavy metal contaminated soils pose an increasing problem to human and animal health. Using plants that hyperaccumulate specific metals in cleanup efforts appeared over the last 20 years. Metal accumulating species can be used for phytoremediation (removal of contaminant from soils) or <b>phytomining</b> (growing plants to harvest the metals). In addition, as many of the metals that can be hyperaccumulated are also essential nutrients, food fortification and phytoremediation might be considered {{two sides of the same}} coin. An overview of literature discussing the phytoremediation capacity of hyperaccumulators to clean up soils contaminated with heavy metals and the possibility of using these plants in <b>phytomining</b> is presented...|$|E
