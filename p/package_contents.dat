500|$|After closing {{addresses}} from Kenealy and Hawkins, Cockburn began summing-up on 29 January 1874. His {{speech was}} prefaced by a severe denunciation of Kenealy's conduct, [...] "the longest, severest and best merited rebuke ever administered from the Bench {{to a member}} of the bar" [...] according to the trial's chronicler John Morse. The tone of the summing-up was partisan, frequently drawing the jury's attention to the Claimant's [...] "gross and astonishing ignorance" [...] of things he would certainly know if he were Roger Tichborne. Cockburn rejected the Claimant's version of the sealed <b>package</b> <b>contents</b> and all imputations against Katherine Doughty's honour. Of Cockburn's peroration, Morse remarked that [...] "never was a more resolute determination manifested [...] to control the result". While much of the press applauded Cockburn's forthrightness, [...] his summing-up was also criticised as [...] "a Niagara of condemnation" [...] rather than an impartial review.|$|E

However, the content of packages may be accessed through special keyboard and mouse combination events. For this purpose, the control-click, or right-click, menu displays a directive Show <b>Package</b> <b>Contents.</b>|$|E

The package is also configured for streaming operations, where portions of files may be delivered on an as-needed basis to clients. Guidelines for sequencing applications are different for the 4.x and 5.x versions.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{receiving}} the package, the client will download appropriate metadata, and possibly (dependent on both package and client configurations) {{some or all}} of the package components. The client is designed to utilize a streaming file system that operates much like local file paging activity. This allows for starting the application without all of the file(s) present in the cache locally. When the application requires a file portion not present, an operation called a stream-fault is performed that retrieves the needed file portion. The streamed <b>package</b> <b>contents</b> are cached by the client in memory for the duration of the application session, and may be retained in a local disk cache for future use.|$|E
