40|$|It is no {{exaggeration to}} say that <b>percutaneous</b> <b>gastrostomy</b> has {{revolutionized}} the feeding of disabled patients with intact gastrointestinal tracts. The most common indication is inability to swallow. It is generally best to place a gastrostomy tube early to prevent malnutrition and minimize complications of procedures on poorly nourished tissue. If a patient is expected to live for only weeks to months, nasoenteric feedings are the nutritional route of choice. Contraindications to <b>percutaneous</b> <b>gastrostomy</b> include coagulation disorders, upper gastrointestinal fistulas, intestinal obstruction, varices, peritoneal dialysis, septicemia and esophageal obstruction. Three techniques are described: 'pull,' 'push' and 'introducer. ' The most frequently reported complications are wound infection and pneumoperitoneum. Now that multiple methods for successful insertion of endoscopic percutaneous feeding tubes have been described, the literature appears to be concentrating on complications of the various techniques.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{evidence}} {{on the effectiveness of}} medical management of bowel obstruction for patients with advanced cancer and to summarize treatment options for home and hospital care. DATA SOURCES: Articles were identified by searching MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: Research articles published between 1973 and 1995 on the surgical and medical management of bowel obstruction in patients with advanced cancer were identified. Seven original research articles on medical management were identified and all were reviewed and critically appraised. Given the small number of original papers in this field, studies using prospective and retrospective methodology were included. Articles looking only at the use of <b>percutaneous</b> <b>gastrostomy</b> tubes and subcutaneous hydration were used in the formulation of treatment recommendations but were not critically reviewed. A critical appraisal of the surgical literature was not undertaken. SYNTHESIS: Recommendations regarding medical management of bowel obstruction were based on strength of evidence for improving symptoms with pharmacologic treatment. The few clinical trials were uncontrolled trials with small samples. The trials show improvement of symptom control with pharmacologic management using morphine, anticholinergics, major tranquilizers, corticosteroids, and somatostatin analogues. Intravenous hydration was unnecessary for most patients. <b>Percutaneous</b> <b>gastrostomy</b> tubes are effective for patients with proximal intestinal obstruction and intractable vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacologic management and <b>percutaneous</b> <b>gastrostomy</b> for intractable vomiting and hypodermoclysis or oral fluids for hydration can control symptoms without surgery or nasogastric tubes...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Although <b>percutaneous</b> {{endoscopic}} <b>gastrostomy</b> may {{be complicated}} by iatrogenic bowel injury, most clinicians consider a small pneumoperitoneum on radiographs obtained after the pro-cedure a benign finding of little clinical consequence. The {{possibility of a}} relationship between findings of early pneumoperitoneum after <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> and subsequent iatrogenic bowel injury was examined. • METHODS Charts of 85 patients in a surgical intensive care unit who had undergone <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> between 2000 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had a follow-up upright chest radiograph obtained after <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy.</b> The charts of 4 patients with radiographs that showed early pneumoperitoneum were reviewed. • RESULTS Findings were clinically significant in 1 of the 4 patients. That patient had a perforated transverse colon that required surgical repair. The other 3 patients had no complications. • CONCLUSION Pneumoperitoneum after <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> {{may be a sign}} of possible bowel injury and requires further evaluation. It should not be dismissed as benign. Obtaining a chest radiograph after a patient has undergone <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> is essential. (America...|$|R

This study was done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <b>percutaneous</b> placement of <b>gastrostomy</b> with gastropexy using imaging guidance in patients with oropharyngeal and esophageal cancers. Methods: Over five years, 105 patients were referred to our department for <b>percutaneous</b> radiologic <b>gastrostomy.</b> In five patients the procedure was not performed because of overlying viscera and high position of stomach. We performed 100 gastrostomies with gastropexy procedures using seldinger technique. Results: Success rate for <b>percutaneous</b> radiologic <b>gastrostomy</b> was 100 %. No major complication had occurred. There were 11 minor complications occurred including 4 stomal infection, 3 catheter obstruction, one peritonism and three were extensive pneumoperitoneum.

All patients had previously been fed through a nasogastric tube using manual administration and a dietitian assessed protein calorie intake. Based upon body mass index (weight/height 2), midarm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness, 20 (67 %) were malnourished, with 10 patients having a body mass index less than 17 (severe malnutrition); attributed to high rates of both tube displacement and feed regurgitation.

We performed this prospective multi-centre study to clarify the efficacy of half-solidification of nutrients to prevent fever possibly caused by aspiration pneumonitis in elderly patients with <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy.</b> The study subjects were 42 elderly patients undergoing <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> feeding (mean age 85. 8 years).

Thirty-two of 42 patients were successfully observed in both nutrient periods. Fever was frequently observed in both nutrient periods, however, the percentage of observational days with fever during half-solid nutrient feeding was significantly lower than that during liquid nutrient feeding (15. 3  ±  0. 3 vs 19. 8  ±  0. 4 %, p =  0. 030). The percentage of observational days when patients had diarrhea was not significantly different (10. 1  ±  3. 8 vs 7. 2  ±  3. 2 %, p =  0. 357).

40|$|Background: The {{placement}} of <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> tubes {{is a common}} procedure in patients with head and neck cancer who require adequate nutrition because of the inability to swallow before or after surgery and adjuvant therapies. A potential complication of <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> tubes is the metastatic spread from the original head and neck tumor to the gastrostomy site. Methods: This {{is a case of}} a 59 -year-old male with a (T 4 N 2 M 0) Stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx who underwent <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> tube placement {{at the time of his}} surgery and shortly thereafter developed metastatic spread to the gastrostomy site. A review of the published literature regarding the subject will be made. Results: Twenty-nine cases of <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> site metastasis occurring in patients with head and neck cancer have been previously reported in the literature. The pull-through method of gastrostomy tube placement had been used in our patient as well as in the majority of the other cases reviewed in the literature. Conclusion: The metastatic spread of head and neck cancer to the <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> site is a very rare occurrence. The direct implantation of tumor through instrumentation is the most likely explanation for metastasis; however, hematogenous seeding is also a possibility. To prevent this rare complication, other techniques of tube insertion need to be considered...|$|R
