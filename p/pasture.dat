5|$|Under the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Whitton Bridge <b>Pasture</b> is {{considered}} as mesotrophic grassland because it represents well-drained and permanent <b>pasture.</b> In particular it {{is considered}} to be an MG5 community because of the species present. MG5 is widespread in many lowland areas in England, Wales, and Scotland, particularly in the Midlands. Whitton Bridge <b>Pasture</b> is predominantly subcommunity MG5c (Danthonia decumbens), however subcommunity MG5a (Lathyrus pratensis) is present with a substantially different species composition.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, a bonus was introduced to reward farmers who retained their best bulls, even though they were not productive. The increase in weight of the animals began with improved grassland. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of fertilizers and improved pastures such as clover and ryegrass, which not only improved the productivity of existing fields but also transformed the moorland <b>pasture.</b> Vineyards affected by phylloxera were also being returned to <b>pasture.</b>|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive. In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer <b>pasture</b> was up in the mountains, the winter <b>pasture</b> in the valleys.|$|E

5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect <b>pasture,</b> plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in <b>pasture</b> production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of <b>pasture</b> and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of management intensity on the richness, abundance {{and composition of}} land snail species was examined in 21 calcareous, nutrient-poor cattle <b>pastures</b> in the northwestern Jura mountains, Switzerland.

40|$|Land use {{change is}} {{a major threat to}} global biodiversity. Forest species face the dual threats of {{deforestation}} and intensification of forest management. In regions where forests are under threat, rural landscapes that retain structural components of mature forests potentially provide valuable additional habitat for some forest species. Here, we illustrate the habitat value of traditional wood <b>pastures</b> for a woodpecker assemblage of six species in southern Transylvania, Romania. Wood <b>pastures</b> are created by long-term stable silvo-pastoral management practices, and are composed of open grassland with scattered large, old trees. Because of their demanding habitat requirements, woodpeckers share habitat with many other bird species, and have been considered as possible indicator species for bird species diversity. We first compared woodpecker assemblages between forests and wood <b>pastures.</b> Second, we grouped features of wood <b>pastures</b> into three spatial contexts and addressed how these features related to the occurrence of three woodpecker species that are formally protected. Woodpecker species composition, but not the number of species, differed between forests and wood <b>pastures,</b> with the green woodpecker occurring more commonly in wood <b>pastures,</b> and the lesser spotted woodpecker more commonly in forests. Within wood <b>pastures,</b> the intermediate context (especially surrounding forest cover) best explained the presence of the grey-headed and middle spotted woodpecker. By contrast, variables describing local vegetation structure and characteristics of the surrounding landscape did not affect woodpecker occurrence in wood <b>pastures.</b> In contrast to many other parts of Europe, in which several species of woodpeckers have declined, the traditional rural landscape of Transylvania continues to provide habitat for several woodpecker species, both in forests and wood <b>pastures.</b> Given the apparent habitat value of wood <b>pastures</b> for woodpeckers we recommend wood <b>pastures</b> be explicitly considered in relevant policies of the European Union, namely the Habitats Directive and the EU Common Agricultural Policy...|$|R
