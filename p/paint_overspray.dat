5000|$|Spray {{painting}} with solvent-based or water-based paint creates <b>paint</b> <b>overspray,</b> a waste material {{that must be}} effectively neutralized, or [...] "detackified", and collected for disposal. In order {{to assist in the}} removal of the oversprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of the down-draft, water-washed paint spray booths utilize paint detackifying chemical agents. The detackification products are commonly introduced into the water that is recirculated in the paint spray booth system. The first purpose is to render the paint non tacky so it does not stick to the booth equipment and foul the paint system. The second purpose is to efficiently collect the paint solids that were sprayed into the system and remove them from the water for disposal.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical studies {{to determine the}} particle size distributions (PSD) and concentrations in <b>paint</b> <b>overspray.</b> Two kinds of paint materials, solvent borne and water borne paints, both with and without manufactured nanomaterials (pigments), and an industrial spray gun were used. Different aerosol measuring techniques, namely the Spraytec Fraunhofer type particle sizer for micro-sized droplets in the spray jet and the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) for nano particles in <b>paint</b> <b>overspray</b> were applied. It was found, that solvent borne clear coats create significantly higher number concentration of nano-sized droplets than the water borneprimers. Only small differences in PSD between paints with and without manufactured nanomaterials were found. Numerical simulations of droplet trajectories within the spray booth, for both micro and nano sized droplets, were carried out. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a representative particle size distribution (smaller than 1 μm) for the given spray gun was obtained. Effects of turbulence models on the particle deposition on targets, especially for submicron particles, have been analysed in detailed...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle coating is an {{important}} component of automotive manufacturing. The paint shop constitutes the plurality of initial investment in an automotive assembly plant, consumes the majority of energy used in the plant's operation, and generates significant waste from <b>paint</b> <b>overspray.</b> The coating process also results in the emission of polluting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). New paint technologies based upon powder coatings offer reductions in VOC emissions along with potentially reduced energy usage and the ability to reuse <b>paint</b> <b>overspray.</b> However, quantification of these advantages requires clear understanding of the life cycle costs associated with each paint technology, modeled over the decades-long time horizons within which a paint shop operates. Life cycle cost models go beyond acquisition cost to consider all relevant cost drivers for a given system. This includes obvious candidates such as investment and operating costs, but also may include more subtle factors such as costs associated with variation, disruption, or flexibility, hereafter referred to as hidden costs. (cont.) In this thesis, methods for estimating these costs for a paint shop are explored. First, the development of a life cycle cost modeling tool, capable of quickly forecasting investment and operating costs and testing the sensitivity of life cycle cost to changes in input costs, is discussed. This tool is then used to compare the life cycle cost of three different primer surfacer application technologies. Next, the potential impact of hidden costs on life cycle cost for manufacturing systems are investigated, both through real-world examples and simulations. Finally, this thesis explores the wider implications of a shift to life cycle cost analysis for General Motors, in terms of both internal and external relationships for the Global Paint and Polymers Center at General Motors, and identifies situations in which a focus on life cycle cost can bolster managerial objectives. by Christopher W.

40|$|In the {{cooperative}} research project {{funded by the}} German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF Green Carbody Technologies - InnoCaT "Energy efficient painting" (duration March 2010 to December 2012) new methods for the painting process in the automotive industry has been investigated in close teamwork with automotive and machine building industry. The overall project aimed to reduce the energy demand in the carbody production in which 60 companies joined in 30 projects using 100 million euros innovations. Three of them concentrated on painting, namely "overspray free coating", "energy efficient dryers" and "modular product and facility concepts" to reduce the most demanding energy consumers in <b>painting.</b> The <b>overspray</b> free <b>painting</b> works with the well-defined generation of paint drops by a short opening of a micro dosing valve. The droplet generation is investigated by high speed cameras and laser Doppler anemometry. The film building process is simulated by numerical methods and demonstrated by painting patterns on a hood. The possible energy savings are calculated by regarding the primary energy consumption.

40|$|During {{automotive}} painting, {{volatile organic}} compounds (VOCs) associated with the paint solvents are emitted to the atmosphere. Most VOC emissions come from spraying operations via the use of solvent-based paints, as the spraybooth air picks up gaseous solvent compounds and <b>overspray</b> <b>paint</b> materials. The VOCs consist of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, alcohols, and glycolethers. Most VOCs (some hydrophilic VOCs are captured and retained in the water.) are captured by an adsorption system and thermally oxidized. In this paper, the processes involved in automotive painting and in VOC control are reviewed. The topics include: painting operations (briefly), the nature of VOCs, VOC-control processes (adsorption, absorption, biological removal, and thermal oxidation) and energy recovery from VOCs using a fuel reformer and a fuel cell, and the beneficial use of paint sludge...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} paper is to minimize the processes and production cost in a spray powder line. The coating operation is the bottleneck point in modular furniture industries. For minimize the wastage of the powder by avoiding <b>overspray</b> <b>painting</b> on the article and improved {{the quality of the}} coating by using work study methodology and RTA method. Both are widely used to produce articles as per customer’s demands. The sequencing {{is an important factor in}} powder coating industries. For resolved the sequencing problem in favour of minimizing the total cost and keeping uniform usage of each part and cost model is presented. To get best alternative between work study and RTA method, a comparison is done, concerning sequencing problem. This investigation suggests best sequence of the process and method. It gives continued consumption of parts as well as reducing cycle time which helps for higher production and cost saving.

40|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has funded a Pilot {{project to}} assist small and medium-size {{manufacture}} {{who want to}} minimize their generation of waste but who lac the expertise to do so. In an effort to assist these manufacturers Waste Minimization Assessment Centers (WMACs) we established at selected universities and procedures were adapted from the EPA Waste Minimization Opportunity Assessment Manual. The WMAC team at the University of Tennessee performed an assessment at a plant that manufactures outboard motors for water craft. Three basic subunits received from other manufacturing plants undergo primarily painting and assembly operations {{in order to produce}} the final product. The team`s report, detailing findings and recommendations, indicated that <b>paint</b> <b>overspray</b> waste and spent clean-up solvent are generated in large quantities and that significant cost savings could be achieved by installing robotic paint application equipment.

40|$|Spray {{painters}} {{are potentially}} exposed to aerosols containing hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] via inhalation of chromate-based paint sprays. Evaluating the {{particle size distribution}} of a paint spray aerosol, and the variables that may affect this distribution, is necessary to determine the site and degree of respiratory deposition and the damage that may result from inhaled Cr(VI) -containing paint particles. This study examined the effect of spray gun atomization pressure, aerosol generation source and aerosol aging on the size distribution of chromate-based <b>paint</b> <b>overspray</b> aerosols generated in a bench-scale paint spray booth. The study also determined the effect of particle bounce inside a Marple personal cascade impactor on measured size distribu-tions of paint spray aerosols. Marple personal cascade impactors with a modified inlet were used for sample collection. The data indicated that paint particle bounce did not occur inside the cascade impactors sufficiently to affect size distribution when using uncoated stainless steel or PVC substrate sampling media. A decrease in paint aerosol mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) from 8. 2 to 7. 0 mm was observed as gun atomization pressure increased from 6 to 10 psi. Overspray aerosols were sampled at two locations in the spray booth. A downstream sampling position simulated the exposure of a worker standing between the painted surface an...|$|E
40|$|The {{recycling}} of <b>paint</b> <b>overspray</b> is handicapped especially {{by the use}} of chemical detackifying agents. The chance to reuse booth wastes could be significantly improved by employing separation methods other than chemical, e. g. high tension fields, or ultrasonic waves. We examined these possibilities, starting the experimental work with simple paint components on a laboratory scale, and later on with model and commercials paint on a bench-scale spray installation. It turned out that the booth wastes spontaneously coagulate even without the assistance of coagulants, exhibiting a remarkably reduced water content of 20 - 30 % (as compared with about 50 % by chemical treatment). However, the handling of the wastes remained problematic due to their inherent tackiness, with the extent depending mainly on the type of binder. In the course of this work we set up a measure of the tackiness of booth wastes and were able to correlate this 'tackiness factor' with the rheological properties of the wastes. Moreover it could be shown that the technological conditions of the spray process as well as the storage period of the booth wastes, and the period of employment of the circulating water significantly influence the tackiness. These results could be verified on an industrial spray plant. Under controlled technology conditions we succeeded in generating detackified booth wastes with certain types of binders. The examined nonchemical methods, especially electrocoagulation, proved to be unsuitable to eliminate the tackiness of both wastes. Based on these results, we presented the working strategy for future investigations. (orig.)

40|$|This {{research}} studied on {{characteristics of}} the conventional paint spray compared to the High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP) type of paint spray used in the automotive painting industries in terms of cost and air quality in the spray booths. Characterization of conventional and HVLP of paint spray gathered through experimental methods. Results recorded from the experiments are air pressure, air volume, paint viscosity, transfer efficiency, and overspray. The analysed results are used as parameters in the Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS CFX V. 15. The simulated paint spray patterns of the conventional paint spray compared to the High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP), concurred with {{the findings from the}} experiments. At the end of this research, it concluded that HVLP has a more stable flow rate compared to the conventional spray gun. HVLP produces smaller droplet size of <b>paint</b> thus reducing <b>overspray</b> impact on hygiene and surrounding environment. HVLP recorded 77. 39 % transfer efficiency which was 20 % more than the conventional spray gun. The spray patternation of HVLP nozzle using ANSYS CFX Version 15 simulated a full cone and symmetry spray right after the paint discharge from the nozzle. In terms of practicality, the HVLP spray gun is more suitable for coating of a car’s part in the SME compared to the conventional spray paint...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{to catch}} <b>paint</b> <b>overspray</b> has been proposed. Overspray is an unavoidable parasitic component of spray that occurs because {{the flow of}} air or other gas in the spray must turn at the sprayed surface. Very small droplets are carried away in this turning flow, and some land on adjacent surfaces {{not meant to be}} painted. The basic principle of the paint-spray catcher is to divert the overspray into a suction system at the boundary of the area to be painted. The paint-spray catcher (see figure) would include a toroidal plenum connected through narrow throat to a nozzle that would face {{toward the center of the}} torus, which would be positioned over the center of the area to be spray-painted. The plenum would be supported by four tubes that would also serve as suction exhaust ducts. The downstream ends of the tubes (not shown in the figure) would be connected to a filter on a suction pump. The pump would be rated to provide a suction mass flow somewhat greater than that of the directed spray gas stream, so that the nozzle would take in a small excess of surrounding gas and catch nearly all of the overspray. A small raised lip at the bottom edge of the nozzle would catch paint that landed inside the nozzle. Even if the paint is directly piston pumped, the droplets entrain an air flow by time they approach the wall, so there is always a gas stream to carry the excess droplets to the side. For long-duration spraying operations, it could be desirable to include a suction-drain apparatus to prevent overflowing and dripping of paint from inside the lip. A version without an external contraction and with the throat angled downward would be a more compact version of catcher, although it might be slightly less efficient...|$|E
