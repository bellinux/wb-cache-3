40|$|Abstract—A {{common mode}} of limb {{suspension}} for transtibial amputees is the pin liner/shuttle lock system. Despite its popu-larity, some clinicians question its use because of observed daily and chronic {{changes to the}} residual limb. For this study, we measured limb interface pressures during ambulation with pin and suction suspension systems. No pressure differences were seen between the modes of suspension during stance phase. However, during swing <b>phase,</b> <b>pin</b> suspension main-tained an average occlusive compressive pressure of 6. 7 kPa on the proximal tissues, {{as compared to the}} subocclusive pressure of 1. 1 kPa with suction suspension. Simultaneously, pin sus-pension elevated the peak magnitude of suction to – 39. 5 kPa at the distal residual limb, compared to – 26. 1 kPa with suction suspension. During swing phase, the pin liner squeezes proxi-mally while creating a large suction distally on the residual limb and is the likely cause of daily and chronic skin changes observed in pin users.

40|$|Up to now, for the {{conventional}} exchange bias (EB) systems {{there has been}} one <b>pinning</b> <b>phase</b> and one <b>pinned</b> <b>phase,</b> and the <b>pinning</b> and <b>pinned</b> <b>phases</b> are inherent to the material and do not mutually transform into each other. Interestingly, we show here that EB is observed in a special system (Fe 2 O 3) 0. 1 (FeTiO 3) 0. 9 (HI 9) different from {{the conventional}} EB system. Neutron powder diffraction and magnetic measurement confirm that for HI 9 : i) two types of short range antiferromagnetic ordering coexist, ii) there are two <b>pinning</b> <b>phases</b> and one <b>pinned</b> <b>phase,</b> iii) the <b>pinned</b> <b>phase</b> is not intrinsic to the structure but can be dynamically produced from the <b>pinning</b> <b>phase</b> {{with the help of}} an external magnetic field. Consequently, two anomalous EB behaviors are observed: i) both the coercivity (HC) and the exchange bias field (HE) simultaneously decrease to zero at 30 K, ii) for a high cooling field (Hcool) HE decreases logarithmically with increasing Hcool. Using Arrott plots it is confirmed that the first order magnetic phase transformation (FOMPT) from the AFM Fe 2 + to ferromagnetic (FM) Fe 2 + and the second order magnetic phase transformation (SOMPT) for the process whereby the FM Fe 2 + aligns with the external field direction coexist in HI- 9. The Morin transition and FOMPT cause the anomalous EB behaviors. This work may provide fresh ideas for research into EB behavior...|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} {{discrete}} renewal processes with super-exponentially decaying inter-arrival distributions {{coincides with the}} infinite volume limit of general homogeneous pinning models in their localized <b>phase.</b> <b>Pinning</b> models are statistical mechanics systems to {{which a lot of}} attention has been devoted both for their relevance for applications and because they are solvable models exhibiting a non-trivial phase transition. The spatial decay of correlations in these systems is directly mapped to the speed of convergence to equilibrium for the associated renewal processes. We show that close to criticality, under general assumptions, the correlation decay rate, or the renewal convergence rate, coincides with the inter-arrival decay rate. We also show that, in general, this is false away from criticality. Under a stronger assumption on the inter-arrival distribution we establish a local limit theorem, capturing thus the sharp asymptotic behavior of correlations. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

It is found that local impurity pinning becomes less effective at low temperatures and may eventually cease completely. These results are independent of spatial dimensionality as expected for local impurity pinning. Comparison with Larkin’s model is also made. PACS: 71. 45. Lr, 71. 55. Jv, 72. 15. Nj...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{and nuclear}} spins of shallow donors in Silicon are {{attractive}} candidates for qubits in quantum computer proposals. Shallow donor exchange gates are frequently invoked to preform two-qubit operations in such proposals. We study shallow donor electron properties in Si within the Kohn-Luttinger envelope function approach, incorporating the full Bloch {{states of the}} six band edges of Si conduction band, obtained from ab initio calculations within the density-functional and pseudopotential frameworks. Inter-valley interference between the conduction-band-edge states of Si leads to oscillatory behavior in the charge distribution of one-electron bound states and in the exchange coupling in two-electron states. The behavior in the donor electron charge distribution is strongly influenced by interference from the plane-wave and periodic parts of the Bloch functions. For two donors, oscillations in the exchange coupling calculated within the Heitler-London (HL) approach are due to the plane-wave parts of the Bloch functions alone, which are pinned to the impurity sites. The robustness of this result is assessed by relaxing the <b>phase</b> <b>pinning</b> to the donor sites. We introduce a more general theoretical scheme, the floating-phase HL, from which the previously reported donor exchange oscillatory behavior is qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed. The floating-phase formalism provides a "handle" on how to theoretically anticipate the occurrence of oscillatory behavior in electronic properties associated with electron bound states in more general confining potentials, such as in quantum dots.
