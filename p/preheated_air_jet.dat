A <b>preheated</b> <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> at 130 °C issues a fully developed circular pipe at Reynolds number 60, 000 and discharges {{in the laboratory}} room to impinge a flat plate located 3 diameters downstream. The description of the velocity field and the complete Reynolds stress tensor is provided by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (S-PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements. For the first time, data are reported for the mean and fluctuating temperature of an impinging jet configuration {{with the help of}} cold-wire thermometry (CWT) measurements. The heat transfer distribution on the impinged plate is determined through an inverse method based on infrared thermography measurements on the rear face of the plate. The agreement between S-PIV and LDV measurements is shown excellent over the whole flow field. The measured Nusselt number distribution exhibits a secondary maximum at r/D = 2, as observed in previous experiments for short impinging distances. Flow dynamics is characterized through a spectral analysis of time-resolved measurements while flow topology features are identified through coherent structure detection based on S-PIV spatially-resolved instantaneous velocity fields. This analysis shows that the jet column mode, associated with a Strouhal number of 0. 4, {{plays a key role in}} the primary structure dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Due to the irreversibilities {{that occur}} during biomass gasification, gasifiers {{are usually the}} least {{efficient}} units in the systems for production of heat, electricity, or other biofuels. Internal thermal energy exchange is responsible for a part of these irreversibilities and can be reduced {{by the use of}} <b>preheated</b> <b>air</b> as a gasifying medium. The focus of the paper is biomass gasification in the whole range of gasification temperatures by the use of <b>air</b> <b>preheated</b> with product gas sensible heat. The energetic and exergetic analyses are carried with a typical ash-free biomass feed represented by CH 1. 4 O 0. 59 N 0. 0017 at 1 and 10 bar pressure. The tool for the analyses is already validated model extended with a heat exchanger model. For every 200 K of <b>air</b> <b>preheating,</b> the average decrease of the amount of air required for complete biomass gasification is 1. 3 % of the amount required for its stoichiometric combustion.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by a goal to understand the mixing and emissions in the Rich-burn/Quick-mix/Lean-burn (RQL) combustor scheme that has been proposed to minimize the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in gas turbine combustors. The study reported herein was a reacting jet-in-crossflow experiment at atmospheric pressure. The jets were injected from the perimeter of a cylindrical duct through round-hole orifices into a fuel-rich mainstream flow. The number of orifices investigated in this study gave over- to optimum to underpenetrating jets at a jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratio of J = 57. The size of individual orifices was decreased {{as the number of}} orifices increased to maintain a constant total area; the jet-to-mainstream mass-flow ratio was constant at MR = 2. 5. The experiments focused on the effects of the number of orifices and inlet <b>air</b> <b>preheat</b> and were conducted in a facility that provided the capability for independent variation of jet and main inlet <b>air</b> <b>preheat</b> temperature. The number of orifices was found to {{have a significant effect on}} mixing and the distributions of species, but very little effect on overall NOx emissions, suggesting that an aerodynamically optimum mixer might not minimize NOx emissions. <b>Air</b> <b>preheat</b> was found to have very little effect on mixing and the distributions of major species, but preheating both main and <b>jet</b> <b>air</b> did increase NOx emissions significantly. Although the <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> injected in the quick-mix section of an RQL combustor may comprise over 70 percent of the total air flow, the overall NOx emission levels were found to be more sensitive to main stream <b>air</b> <b>preheat</b> than to <b>jet</b> stream <b>air</b> <b>preheat...</b>|$|R

40|$|To provide {{necessary}} {{plant protection}} in orchards, spray drops are transported to {{and into the}} apple tree canopy with an <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> from a fan sprayer. The interaction between the spray <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> and the canopy is central to effective droplet transport, spray coverage and pest control. Converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> were introduced {{as a way of}} improving the spray application. In this study, a two unit cross-flow fan orchard sprayer, configured as converging or plane (vertical fan units) <b>air</b> <b>jets,</b> were compared in several experiments. Inclining the top or bottom fans towards the tree created different types of converging <b>air</b> <b>jets.</b> The influence of these <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> on spray deposition, on air velocities and on forces acting on apple trees was measured. Deposition was measured throughout the season with fluorescent tracer on leaf sized filterpaper targets inside canopies. Different types of air velocity measurements were made with the fan sprayer passing the tree. Peak velocities were recorded at positions throughout apple tree canopies, and indepth measurements of several air velocity parameters were made inside, above and beyond an apple tree canopy. Velocity pulse values were integrated over time. Air velocity profiles were measured in stationary situations and compared to existing mathematical models. Forces and moments caused by the <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> striking the tree were measured with a new method, utilizing a multicomponent force transducer, placed between the tree trunk and the ground. Compared to plane <b>air</b> <b>jets,</b> converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> resulted in significantly higher deposition values, more uniformly distributed through the canopy. The converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> increased the <b>air</b> velocity parameters in the denser parts of the canopy, and resulted in higher air power and energy at those positions. Converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> transferred greater forces to the canopy. This could be explained by the ability of the converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> to reduce the air flow directed above the trees, thereby concentrate and increase the amount of spray liquid, penetrating into the densest part of the canopy. Finally, an increased air velocity improved deposition prerequisites. The new method for measuring forces and moments has a potential to extend and complement other application technology measuring methods.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>jet</b> vortex {{generators}} are {{a boundary}} layer control device {{and as such}} can effect a significant delay to the stall of an aerofoil. They can also reattach a separated flow, {{as long as the}} angle of attack is less than the <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> 'on' stall angle. A wind tunnel model was built and tested and then modified to incorporate <b>air</b> <b>jets.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> increased CL max by 55 % and reduced the drag throughout the incidence range, a, for the chosen blowing pressure of 1 p. s. i. (6900 Pa). By varying the air supply so that the jets operate between 'off' and fully 'on' a whole family bf aerofoil L/D characteristics could be derived. The blade set of a 150 kW stall regulated wind turbine was then modified with <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> vortex generators and tested at full scale. This was done primarily to increase its energy yield by reducing energy loss in the region of the power curve 'knee', but also to allow a degree of power regulation in high wind speeds. The air supply in this demonstration was supplied by a fan mounted on, and rotating with, the rotor. Full-scale trials demonstrated that <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> can indeed be used to straighten the power curve prior to rated wind speed. This important result means that a stall regulated machine can be made to behave {{in the same way as}} a pitch controlled machine without having to pitch the blades. Of the two <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> configurations tested in the wind tunnel, the second had an improved L/D characteristic and required less mass flow, even though the physical change was minor. This indicates that further optimisation of <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> may be achieved. Further wind tunnel testing showed that it should be possible to eliminate the fan used in the full scale trials and use one of two 'passive' blowing techniques. It was shown that the <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> can be supplied by air at atmospheric pressure due to the suction on the upper surface of the aerofoil which is sufficient to pull <b>air</b> through the <b>jet</b> exits and create vortices. However, to achieve an optimised <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> configuration and to investigate the possibilities of using passive blowing, <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> vortex generators will need to be modelled numerically, so that this innovative concept can be brought to market quickly...|$|R

Present study {{is an attempt to}} compare the heat transfer characteristics of the isothermal <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> and premixed flame <b>jets.</b> The isothermal <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> having jet temperature of 30 degrees C (cold jet or ambient temperature jet), 100 degrees C (hot jet), and premixed methane <b>air</b> flame <b>jet</b> (stoichiometric mixture) with Reynolds numbers of 500, 750, 1000, 1250 and 1500 and nozzle or burner to plate spacings of 2 d, 4 d and 6 d are experimentally investigated for heat transfer characterisation. Thin metal foil technique is used for characterising isothermal <b>air</b> <b>jets.</b> For a fixed jet Reynolds number, the Nusselt number of isothermal <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> is found independent of the temperature difference between jet and surrounding fluid. A steady state technique is proposed for characterisation of premixed flame jets. The outcome of the present study reveals that the heat transfer characteristics of isothermal <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> and the premixed flame jet are almost same. The higher thermal entrainment in premixed flame jet in comparison with isothermal <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> results in a lower effectiveness. The present heat transfer data can be directly utilised for many practical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
