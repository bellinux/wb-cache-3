5000|$|Abel Bliss, Jr. {{was born}} on August 8, 1853. His father, Abel Bliss, Sr., {{was a native of}} Wilbraham, Mass, and {{was born on}} February 9, 1810. His mother was Lucinda Blake, a native of the Bay State and born in Springfield, October 14, 1816. He was the sixth of the seven {{children}} born into his family, and attended high school at Englewood, and afterward was a student of engineering at University of Illinois at Champaign. He was married, on February 21, 1877, to Nettie Lynk. [...] He gave up engineering partway through his degree, due to circumstances that required him to take charge of the family farm, where he grew wealthy through his agricultural business and real estate investments. In June 1874, the University granted him a <b>partial</b> <b>certificate</b> in civil engineering. His business ventures included agriculture and real estate, and by 1929, he was a partner in the land development and oil production company of Bliss & Wetherbee. Mr. Bliss died in the mid-1930s.|$|E
30|$|A control {{variable}} not specified in Table  1 {{is about the}} pursuit of any further education, and whether such education was completed (or rounded off with a <b>partial</b> <b>certificate)</b> or discontinued.|$|E
30|$|The estimations include control {{variables}} for the following: gender, age, age squared, {{status as a}} Western immigrant and as a non-Western immigrant, the final grade, part-time work status, {{a job at the}} programme’s level, the pursuit of further education, and whether such education was completed (or rounded off with a <b>partial</b> <b>certificate)</b> or discontinued. These are all dummy variables, except age, which is measured in years. The interpretation of the dummy variables is obvious, except for the dummy for further education. It should be noted that this variable equals one if further education was completed or interrupted and equals zero if no further education was pursued.|$|E
30|$|The DCA {{approach}} {{has also been}} proposed in Wireless Mesh and Vehicular Networks {{and a number of}} schemes have been devised for these. Since a little work has been done in Wireless Mesh Networks, only one scheme has been proposed. In MANET, many DCAs schemes have been designed and they can be classified as partially or fully distributed certificate authorities (FDCA). In partially implemented DCA (PDCA), services of the CA are distributed to a set of specialized server nodes using secret sharing. Each of these nodes can generate <b>partial</b> <b>certificates</b> and a client can create a valid certificate by combining enough number of these <b>partial</b> <b>certificates.</b> In this case, these special server nodes must have high energy and the inherent heterogeneity of the nodes in network is utilized to choose the candidates for CA nodes. However, if all the nodes in MANET were identical, the nodes of the distributed CA might be chosen randomly.|$|R
30|$|In FDCA, {{services}} of a CA are distributed to all nodes and using secret sharing, each of these nodes can generate <b>partial</b> <b>certificates</b> [4]. FDCA reduces the communication delay and improves the availability because almost all the neighbors of a requesting node hold shares of the DCA's private signature key. However, it allows attackers break the system more easily and when an intruder enters the network and compromises one or more nodes, he becomes {{as good as a}} valid one. To overcome this problem, an intrusion detection system is required to be presented in the network, which can identify the misbehaving or compromised nodes, and remove them from the network. In some schemes such as [5], certificates have limited lifetime and after expiration time they are revoked. Thus, compromised keys cannot be used anymore. The amount of this expiration time will be a tradeoff between security and performance.|$|R
30|$|Lee and Jeong [10] {{proposed}} a partially distributed certificate management {{system that can}} handle mobility of nodes. It minimizes routing loads and enhances expandability of network by allowing participating nodes to authenticate each other without being interrupted by joining the cluster. In their model, certificate creation time slightly rose {{as the number of}} bits increased. But, the pace of increase was much slower than that obtained from the use of existing certificate-based authentication protocol. In addition, the proposed model offered a steady delivery time in the certificate creation phase despite the increase in packet size. The efficiency and security can be therefore maintained in the network. It was also found that the efficiency of the network was not influenced by changes in the number of nodes (k) because <b>partial</b> <b>certificates</b> are consistently generated by coalition of existing member nodes without being interfered by nodes joining the cluster. Since the node requesting partially distributed certificates performs the whole process involving certificate creation, unnecessary system overhead can be eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{previous}} research work in key management can only resist passive attacks, such as dropping the certificate request, and are vulnerable under active attacks, such as returning a fake {{reply to the}} node requesting the certification service. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to address both security and efficiency issues of certification services in ad hoc networks. Both of the algorithms can resist active attacks. In addition, simulation results show that, compared to the previous works, our second algorithm is not only much faster in a friendly environment, but it also works well in a hostile environment in which existing schemes work poorly. Furthermore, the process of generating <b>partial</b> <b>certificates</b> in our second algorithm is extremely fast. Such advantage is critical in ad hoc networks where by nature the less help a node requests from its neighbors, the higher is the chance of obtaining the help. Consequently, using our second algorithm, a node can easily find enough neighboring nodes which provide the certification service...|$|R
40|$|Can {{activation}} requirements control {{moral hazard}} problems in public sickness absence insurance and accelerate recovery? Based on empirical analysis of Norwegian data, {{we show that}} it can. Activation requirements not only bring down benefit claims, they also reduce the likelihood that long-term sickness absence leads to inactivity. Our findings show that absentees who are issued graded (<b>partial)</b> absence <b>certificates</b> by their physician have shorter absences and higher subsequent employment rates {{than they would have}} had on regular sick leave. We conclude that the activation strategies that in recent years have permeated European and US welfare policy may fruitfully be carried over to sick leave insurance. sick leave, disability, activation, workfare...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} efforts in key management can only handle very {{limited number of}} nodes and are vulnerable to active attacks. In addition, the flexibility and adaptivity of handling dynamic risks {{in different parts of}} networks, although critical in the practical usages of ad hoc networks, have been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical scheme based on threshold cryptography to address both security and efficiency issues of key management and certification service in Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). The main contributions of our key management scheme include: 1. providing various parts of MANET the flexibility of selecting appropriate security configurations, according to the risks faced; 2. providing the adaptivity to cope with rapidly-changing environments; 3. handling of MANETs with a large number of nodes; 4. issuing certificates with different levels of assurance. We also propose two algorithms, which can be used independently from the hierarchical structure, to protect certification services in ad hoc networks from active attacks. Our simulation results show that, compared to the previous work [16], [18] and [19], our second algorithm is much faster in a friendly environment. When the key length is 1024 bits, the process of generating or renewing a certificate in our second algorithm is around six to eight times faster, and the process of generating <b>partial</b> <b>certificates</b> in our second algorithm is around 20 - 80 times faster. The latter advantage is critical in MANET where intrinsically the less help a node requests from its neighbors, the higher is the chance of obtaining the help. Furthermore, simulation results also show that our two algorithms work well in a hostile environment in which existing schemes work poorly...|$|R
30|$|The {{absence of}} any fixed {{infrastructure}} and centralized authorities makes public key management for MANETs a very difficult task from both an algorithmic and computational point of view. Any public key-based security system must be provided by an efficient way of making the public key of a node available to another and proving {{in the same time}} the authenticity of this key. The solution to this problem in wired, general-purpose networks comes from the use of on-line or off-line servers that issue certificates to the nodes of the network. In MANETs, the absence of centralized services and the possible network partitions makes this problem hard to deal with. Recently, some public key management schemes for MANETs have been proposed. These schemes can be roughly classified into two categories. The first approach uses a set of nodes as servers that can provide <b>partial</b> <b>certificates</b> to a combiner by utilizing the concepts of threshold secret sharing [1 – 3]. Other server oriented solutions not utilizing threshold cryptography also exist like the Kaman one [4] which is based on Kerberos. The second category, which is our topic of interest, is based on the web-of-trust model [5, 6]. According to this approach, every node issues certificates only to the nodes it trusts. By considering every issued certificate as an edge, a certification graph is formed. If two nodes wish to exchange their public keys and form a common secret, they find a certification path in the graph and they can in this way authenticate each other. However, the major disadvantage of this approach is the cumbersome problem of finding a certification path in the graph. A solution to this problem is proposed in [7] where a virtual hierarchy is built among the nodes in the graph. Finally, an emerging third category attempts to combine trust graphs and threshold cryptography [8] in a fully distributed manner.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{one group of}} large {{industrial}} firms in Tasmania and their claims that the Renewable Energy Target (RET) is costing them $ 20 million. Overview The Renewable Energy Target (RET) {{has been subjected to}} a lot of criticism in recent years. Most of it has centred on the idea that the RET increases electricity prices. Numerous studies including the government’s recent review of the RET have shown that over time it is lowering electricity prices. But the criticism has also come from some large industrial users of electricity hoping to get an exemption from the RET. Their claims have been subjected to for less scrutiny than claims that the RET is causing significant price pressures. This paper looks at one group of large industrial firms in Tasmania and their claims that the RET is costing them $ 20 million. This claim is false. For it to be true large industrial users would have to be using one and half times more electricity than all of Tasmania. This is of course impossible. RET assistance significantly offsets the pressure placed on industrial firms by the introduction of the RET. While rates vary annually, in 2014, <b>Partial</b> Exemption <b>Certificates</b> have covered 40 - 67 per cent of electricity costs for these businesses. These firms have conveniently excluded this quite substantial assistance that they receive from the government. A conservative estimate of their RET liability has large industrial users in Tasmania paying less than $ 8. 5 million. The paper also shows that Tasmania gains large benefits from the RET. Focusing only on the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) that Tasmania creates the benefit is $ 125 million. This ignores investment benefits, jobs and lower wholesale electricity prices. While advocating to government for a better deal for your industry is to be expected, these gross exaggerations do nothing to improve public debate and allow the proper evaluation of government policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis stems from my {{interest}} in finding out whether a <b>partial</b> early childhood <b>Certificate</b> qualification could procure employment in early childhood centres for Chinese student teachers, which could then eventuate in Permanent Residency status. Employment in early childhood centres is currently being driven {{by the need to}} comply with Ministry of Education requirements which state that centres need to have fifty per cent of their teachers fully qualified and registered by 2007. The literature surrounding the employment experiences of Asian immigrants to New Zealand reveals negative outcomes, and discrimination is cited as one of the causes of this. However, early childhood education in New Zealand espouses a strong philosophy of cultural diversity and inclusive practice. The employment experiences of seven Chinese early childhood student teachers are documented in this thesis using a qualitative mixed-method approach involving Case Study as the overarching methodology/method, supplemented with Narrative Inquiry and Documentary Analyses to collect and analyse the data. The main findings of my research were: there are obstacles that this ethnic group faced in gaining employment relevant to their qualification - this was a negative, but not unexpected outcome. The second major finding was that, despite the over-arching philosophy of early childhood education in Aotearoa/New Zealand, I found that there were several areas where the participants of this study were vulnerable to 'discrimination'. This was predominantly in the form of unfair practices and included: interview experiences; relief teaching; employment contracts; and payment issues. The participants of this study were also vulnerable in other ways. In order to enrol in further study to become fully qualified, they need to achieve a high IELTS (International English Language Testing System) level. A third and much more positive outcome was that participants who found employment did so through practicum placements, networks of friends, and with those centres that were accepting of 'cultural difference'. All of these findings were to some extent largely congruent with the literature on immigration experiences of 'migrants'. Further research needs to be undertaken on this topic by myself, and others in this field, in particular, how International Students are 'protected' in Aotearoa/New Zealand. I found that there was a 'loophole' in the Immigration Points Table and that International Students are possibly being encouraged to enrol in Early Childhood Certificate programmes in the belief that they will find employment and eventually Permanent Residency status. This research shows that this is not always the case. In addition to this, further research needs to focus on the views of centre owners and staff, with regard to employing Chinese early childhood educators; the views of Chinese parents with regard to their perspective of Chinese teachers and lastly, in the area of relief teaching. In the conclusion several recommendations for changes to policy and practice at the tertiary level are raised...|$|R
