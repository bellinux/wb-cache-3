5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin,</b> polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} a study of two-step plywood adhesives made with varying amounts of phenol, 1, 3, 5 xylenol, resorcin, and formaldehyde. Each resin was evaluated by using it as the adhesive in making plywood. The plywood was then tested for shear strength and wood failure after a four hour boil. Procedures are given for making and testing various straight <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> and resins modified with 1, 3, 5 xylenol or resorcin, or comibinations of both of these accelerating <b>resins.</b> The straight <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> gave boil-proof bonds, but the curing cycle was too long. Those phenolics modified with 1, 3, 5 xylenol gave relatively short cures, but large quantities of this modifier were necessary. Modification of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> with resorcin gave very rapid cures, but the pot life of these resins was too short. The best compromise was obtained {{with a combination of}} 1, 3, 5 xylenol and resorcin as modifying agents for the phenolic.

40|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> are {{an advanced}} class of ultra-stable mesoporous materials that offer potential {{applications in the}} field of catalysis. Two select examples of asymmetric catalysis will be presented.

This novel catalytic system shows high catalytic activity and excellent enantioselectivity in the asymmetric epoxidation of diline. The heterogeneized Jacobsen catalyst is demonstrated to be a re-usable and zero-leaching catalyst system. In a second example, the mesoporous <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> were functionalized with sulphonic acid groups and acted as novel support for the non-covalent immobilization of a L-phenylalanine derived chiral diamine organocatalyst for asymmetric aldol reactions. The immobilization is established by an acid-base interaction between the sulphonic acid group and the amine function. The acidity and in particular the electronic withdrawing environment of the sulphonic acid groups influence enormously the catalytic performance of the non-covalent immobilized chiral diamine catalyst...|$|R
