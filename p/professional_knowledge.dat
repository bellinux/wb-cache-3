25|$|Graham {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Sydney-Belmore in 1894 and held the seat until his defeat in 1901. In 1898 he became {{a member of the}} Sydney City Council and took a {{prominent}} part in a successful reform movement. His <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> was also of great use during the plague scare in 1900. Graham was Mayor of Sydney in 1901 during the visit of the Duke of York and was knighted by him. In 1906 Graham opposed Chris Watson for the federal seat of South Sydney but was defeated. At the 1907 state election, Graham was again elected to the Legislative Assembly, this time for Surry Hills but lost his seat at the 1910 election. He was for several years vice-president of the Liberal and Reformist Association, later the Liberal Association. Graham died at Sydney on 8 March 1913 and was buried in the Anglican section of Waverley Cemetery. He married in 1890 Fanny, daughter of the Rev. G. W.

As an extremely competent and resourceful leader, Rear Admiral Loughlin exercised military and operational command over a major portion of the Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet during a period of unprecedented growth. In particular, he supervised the post construction and post overhaul pre-deployment training, Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO) and tactical load out periods for the Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarines in an exemplary manner. By virtue of dynamic leadership and outstanding <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> he ensured the successful operation of two SSBN replenishment sites and the effective functioning of off crew support operations at Charleston, South Carolina.
