5|$|In 1793, {{the newly}} {{established}} Philadelphia Mint began striking cents and half cents. Coinage of <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> was delayed; Congress required the assayer and chief coiner to each post a security bond of $10,000, a huge sum in 1793. In 1794, Congress lowered the chief coiner's bond to $5,000, and the assayer's to $1,000; President Washington's appointees to those positions were thus able to qualify and take office. Subsequently, silver coinage began that year.|$|E

5|$|Platinum is a <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> commodity; its bullion has the ISO {{currency}} code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E

5|$|The new coins {{began to}} enter {{circulation}} in late 1965, and alleviated the shortages. They passed {{side by side}} with their silver counterparts for a time, but the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> coins were hoarded beginning in 1967 as the Treasury ended its efforts to keep silver prices low. The act also banned the production of silver dollars until at least 1970.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} and purification methods of <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> from the scrap containing <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> are introduced in this review. The solid waste containing <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> first is dissolved by the solution somprising oxidation agents and ligands, such as aqua regia, Cl 2 +HCL and NaCN+O 2. The separation of <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> in the leached solution or wasted solution {{is carried out}} by using various methods like classic precipitation, cementation, ion exchange resin, activated carbon adsorption and solvent extraction. It depends on the concentration and combination of <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> what kind of separation method is applied. Generally, adsorption and ion exchange methods are applicable to the dilute solution, while precipitation, cementation and solvent extraction are used for the concentrated solution. In {{the recovery of the}} <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> in automoble catalyst, the collection of the platinum group matels in Cu or Fe metals melted by a plasma melting method is performed as one of the recovery techniques by the pyro-metallurgy.

50|$|The pennyweight is {{the common}} weight used in the {{valuation}} and measurement of <b>precious</b> <b>metals.</b> Jewellers use the pennyweight in calculating the amount and cost of <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> used in fabricating or casting jewellery.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these bank acquisitions, UBS also acquired an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> refinery founded in 1951, through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold bars. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the refinery changing to Hereaus & Management. Nevertheless, UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which is famous for the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E
5|$|Niobium {{is used as}} a <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> in {{commemorative}} coins, {{often with}} silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin anodized oxide layer. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin, and the 2006 Austrian €25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is {{a member}} of the {{platinum}} group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5μg/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> commodity.|$|E
40|$|The {{investment}} role of <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> {{in financial}} markets is investigated by analysis of daily data for gold, platinum, and silver from 1976 to 2004. All three <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> have low correlations with stock index returns, {{which suggests that}} these metals may provide diversification within broad investment portfolios. Moreover, the data reveal that all three <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> have some hedging capability, particularly during periods of "abnormal" stock market volatility. Financial portfolios that contain <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> perform significantly better than standard equity portfolios. © 2006, CFA Institute...|$|R

5|$|The silver half dime, {{equal to}} five cents, had been issued since the 1790s. The American Civil War caused {{economic}} hardship, driving {{gold and silver}} from circulation; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued paper currency. In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M. Clark, head of the Currency Bureau (today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing), placed his own portrait on the denomination. After the successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces without <b>precious</b> <b>metal,</b> Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal; the Mint began striking this version in 1866.|$|E
