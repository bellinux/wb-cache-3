25|$|With the {{discovery}} of the Mantle site by Lebovic Enterprises, Archaeological Services Inc. was contracted to complete an evaluation of the site's significance. A decision was made to preserve about 5% of the original Mantle site, primarily along the bank of the creek. The site was documented and over 150,000 artifacts were removed for study and interpretation at McMaster University and the University of Toronto. Because of their national significance, the artifacts will be safeguarded by the Canadian Museum of Civilization. The archaeological site-work took three years to complete (2003–2005). Most of the site is now a storm water pond; the homes on the south-west corner of Lost Pond Crescent are also on the village site. A small cemetery found outside the village walls has been preserved and protected in accordance with the provincial cemeteries act and in consultation with First Nations. The consequent development of {{the west side of the}} creek in the Fieldgate River Ridge subdivision around James Ratcliff Avenue was delayed significantly. The village ossuary, a mass grave with an expected 300 to 400 skeletal remains, has not been yet been located. The Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville is planning further housing development immediately south of the Mantle site in the town's <b>Phase</b> <b>Two</b> <b>development</b> plan.|$|E

5000|$|The {{search for}} new ways to improve {{treatment}} of patients infected with HIV is constant. Considering the experience that has been gathered since the 1980s of ARV drug development arrival of INSTIs as a new potent class of ARV signals a new era in the treatment of HIV. Development of a successful INSTI treatment was accomplished when raltegravir was discovered by Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited. A conditional marketing authorization was licensed in December 2007 by the European Commission which was valid throughout the European Union. In 2009 this authorization was converted to a full marketing authorization and in the same year the FDA changed the approval from accelerated to traditional approval and listed the drug as a first line ARV treatment agent. [...] The second INSTI drug, elvitegravir, was identified by Japan Tobacco and clinical trials began in 2005. In 2011 the drug was still in phase three clinical trials, where it is being compared to raltegravir, in treatment experienced subjects and is also in <b>phase</b> <b>two</b> <b>development</b> in naïve subjects {{as a part of a}} multidrug treatment. S/GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor discovered by ViiV/Shinongi which was entering phase three in clinical trials in 2011. This new drug is promising and seems to be well tolerated and so far shows better results than both raltegravir and elvitegravir.|$|E

40|$|We analyze China's rapid {{economic}} development {{in the context of}} the dualistic development theory. Over the period 1965 – 2009, we find that China's economic growth is mainly attributable to the development of the non-agricultural (industrial and service) sector, driven by rapid labor migration and capital accumulation. We find that the sectoral reallocation of labor plays a significant role in promoting China's economic growth. Further, we find that the marginal productivity of agricultural labor stopped stagnating in 1978, which indicates that China entered quickly into <b>phase</b> <b>two</b> of economic <b>development</b> with the initiation of market reforms. Moreover, by 2009, the marginal productivity of labor has likely exceeded the institutional wage, as defined by the initially low average labor productivity, indicating that China may be now in the process of entering phase three of economic development. © 2011 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
