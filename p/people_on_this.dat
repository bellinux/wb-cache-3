5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made.

And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

The ship's surgeon later revealed this person as Jeanne Baré, possibly Commerçon's mistress; she would become the first woman known to circumnavigate the globe.

25|$|The astylar {{design is}} by Jean Chalgrin (1739–1811), in the Neoclassical version of ancient Roman {{architecture}} (see, for example, the triumphal Arch of Titus). Major academic sculptors of France {{are represented in}} the sculpture of the Arc de Triomphe: Jean-Pierre Cortot; François Rude; Antoine Étex; James Pradier and Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire. The main sculptures are not integral friezes but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast ashlar masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze appliqués on Empire furniture. The four sculptural groups {{at the base of}} the Arc are The Triumph of 1810 (Cortot), Resistance and Peace (both by Antoine Étex) and the most renowned of them all, Departure of the Volunteers of 1792 commonly called La Marseillaise (François Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> last was used as the belt buckle for the honorary rank of Marshal of France. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing Peace is interpreted as commemorating the Peace of 1815.|$|E

25|$|At PDC 2008, Microsoft {{demonstrated}} Windows 7 {{with its}} reworked taskbar. On December 27, 2008, the Windows 7 Beta was leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent. According to a performance test by ZDNet, Windows 7 Beta beat both Windows XP and Vista in several key areas, including boot and shutdown time {{and working with}} files, such as loading documents. Other areas did not beat XP, including PC Pro benchmarks for typical office activities and video editing, which remain identical to Vista and slower than XP. On January 7, 2009, the x64 version of the Windows 7 Beta (build 7000) was leaked onto the web, with some torrents being infected with a trojan. At CES 2009, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the Windows 7 Beta, build 7000, had been made available for download to MSDN and TechNet subscribers in the format of an ISO image. The Beta was to be publicly released January 9, 2009, and Microsoft initially planned for the download to {{be made available to}} 2.5million <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> date. However, access to the downloads was delayed because of high traffic. The download limit was also extended, initially until January 24, then again to February 10. People who did not complete downloading the beta had two extra days to complete the download, and, after February 12, unfinished downloads became unable to complete. Users could still obtain product keys from Microsoft to activate their copies of Windows 7 Beta, which expired on August 1, 2009.|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days." [...] John and Julian maintained a low profile for the next five years. Sean has followed in his parents' footsteps with a musical career, performing solo work, working with Ono, and forming a band, the Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger.|$|E
500|$|Described by her actress, Lauren Cohan, as [...] "a female Humphrey Bogart", Bela is [...] "a {{little bit}} manipulative" [...] and she [...] "always {{wants to be}} in control". According to series creator Eric Kripke, the writers {{conceptualized}} the character as [...] "someone [...] really never come across before" [...] because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the [...] "altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting". Writer and producer Sera Gamble summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy [...] "mercenary that [...] just [...] give a shit about the cause". Gamble believed that Bela [...] "finds it quite amusing" [...] that the Winchesters use their knowledge of the supernatural to help <b>people.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> aspect, Gamble added, [...] "I always suspect when someone is that blasé that there's something underneath, and we're finally getting into that".|$|E

500|$|While {{control of}} the House of Representatives {{went over to the}} Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain {{continued}} to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were [...] "my heroes". In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: [...] "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> matter has been troubling and counterproductive." [...] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.|$|E

2500|$|During the concert, Love polled the {{audience}} {{as to whether or}} not they wanted her band to continue performing. After {{the audience}} responded encouragingly, she derided both Manson's use of pyrotechnics and the audience's expectations of a decadent spectacle, then justified Hole's performance approach as musically-focused. Manson initially resisted responding to Love's criticism during his band's turn on stage. However, after the band performed their single [...] "The Dope Show", Manson retorted by holding his own poll, asking how much of the audience were there to watch his band. After the majority of concertgoers erupted in a loud cheer he taunted, [...] "I show pity for the older <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> tour...the graying mothers" [...] in reference to Love.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2008, a {{photo of}} Obama dressed in a turban and other local {{clothing}} while on a 2006 visit to an ethnic Somali community in Kenya appeared on the Drudge Report, which attributed it to a Clinton staffer upset at Obama getting more favorable coverage in the media than Clinton. The photo was interpreted as suggesting Muslim garb, and the Obama campaign accused the Clinton campaign of “shameful, offensive fear-mongering”. A spokesman for Clinton replied that {{the release of the}} photo had not been sanctioned by the campaign—but added that [...] "We have over 700 <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> campaign, and I’m {{not in a position to}} know what each one of them may or may not have done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said [...] "Liam Cosgrave {{was someone}} who {{devoted his life to}} public service; a {{grateful}} country thanks and honours him for that and for always putting the nation first.

2500|$|Haarlem has a {{rich history}} {{dating back to}} pre-medieval times, as it lies on a thin strip of land above sea level known as the strandwal (beach ridge), which connects Leiden to Alkmaar. The <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> narrow strip of land {{struggled}} against {{the waters of the}} North Sea from the west, and the waters of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travellers moving on this busy North-South route. However, as shipping became increasingly important economically, the city of Amsterdam became the main Dutch city of North Holland during the Dutch Golden Age. The town of Halfweg became a suburb, and Haarlem became a quiet bedroom community, and for this reason Haarlem still has many of its central medieval buildings intact. Nowadays many of them are on the Dutch Heritage register known as Rijksmonuments. The [...] gives an overview of these per neighbourhood, with the majority in the old city centre.|$|E
2500|$|Negoiţescu's other late {{contribution}} to the memoir genre was Ora oglinzilor, which groups and rearranges fragments of a diary covering his life {{between the ages of}} 16 and 30, as well as autofictional pieces (as diaries of fictional characters named Paul and Damian) and intertextual homages to French modernist author André Gide. According to philologist Florin Rogojan, the full text [...] "restores Negoiţescu's image as a personality about to be born, reflecting him in his own subjectivity of a being who places all his stakes on creativity." [...] In Rogojan's view, the key element in the volume is its author's confessed ability to [...] "divide himself between the observer and the observed": [...] "I have acquired something that all the <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> Earth ought to be envying. [...] I am at once the modeler and the sheer matter I am modeling." [...] The book records the young author's own hierarchy of his personal projects, based on {{the manner in which they}} could impact on the outside world—from [...] "my most important work so far", the diary, to planned (but never written) novels which were meant to celebrate his creative maturity. Rogojan views the introduction of fictionalized elements as a basis for stating the [...] "cruel truths" [...] about Negoiţescu's life (the moral problems posed by his own homosexuality or the fear of losing artistic inspiration).|$|E
