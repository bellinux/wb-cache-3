5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in <b>perceptions</b> <b>about</b> relationships.|$|E

Even though there has been effort to create relationship building towards patient in the William Booth Hospital Semarang but the amount of hospital patient visitation has been decreased. The target {{of this research was}} to analyze the influence of factor of customer relationship marketing towards the multi visit patient attitude to build a long term relationship in the out patient unit in William Booth Hospital. This research was of explanatory research. Research method used by survey with the approach of cross sectional study or study split transversal. Population in this research was the amount of out patient in the year 2005 total 1. 012 patients. The sample which was taken in this research was the out patient visitation unit and the number of service of 94 people. The bivariate analysis this research was correlation chi-square. The multivariate analysis in this research which was being analyzed was logistic regression. The result of the effect of multivariate analysis shows that the influence of the out patient unit and their responsiveness, the <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> the unit care service and the <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> the unit care service and the <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> the unit care service and the <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> caring the unit service, and the <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> depth of information transaction towards the out patient unit is to create a long term relationship.

Rewards from a long­termloyalty and cumulative so the longer a consumer loyalty, the greater the profit to be gained by an effort from the cunsomer. Maintaining consumer loyalty is a major capital to maintain the company’s existence. Consumer loyalty is determined by the perception of the product price. Telkomsel is the mobile telecommunications operator in Indonesia. Until now, Telkomsel has three main products for GSM cards, namely simPATI and As for prepaid and HALO for postpaid. Competition between producers service provider in Indonesia caused them to drop rates to get new consumers and even to keep the old consumers. Where it is increasingly indulging consumers to always try the service providers that is appropriate with their need and that indicated unloyalty of consumers. This study aim to determine the relationship between the <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> price with Telkomsel’s consumer loyalty. If consumers have a positive <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> Telkomsel’s price is high consumer loyalty and vice versa if consumers have a negative <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> Telkomsel’s price is low consumer loyalty. This research is quantitative research. Population in this research is Telkomsel’s consumer in Malang with 100 samples. The sampling technique used was incidental sampling technique. Instrument research using the scale of <b>perception</b> <b>about</b> price and the scale of consumer loyalty with Likert model. The data analysis methods used product moment correlation is aided by the computer program SPSS for windows 13. 00.
