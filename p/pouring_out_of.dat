5|$|Along {{the east}} coast of Florida, the most severe damage was {{reported}} from Miami to Fort Pierce, particularly in Palm Beach County. In West Palm Beach, one of the most severely affected coastal cities, a total of 1,711houses were destroyed and 6,369 others suffered damage, which left about 2,100families homeless. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 268businesses and affected 490others. There were four deaths, and severe damage totaling just under $13.8 million (1928USD). At Palm Beach, which had many houses owned by wealthy individuals, approximately 1,500houses and 500businesses were destroyed. Damage totaled around $10million. Inland, many communities on the southern and eastern shores of Lake Okeechobee, such as the cities of Belle Glade, Canal Point, Chosen, Miami Locks (today Lake Harbor), Pahokee, and South Bay, were ravaged by flooding after storm surge resulted in water <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shallow lake over the small dikes. Numerous structures were swept away or destroyed, and at least 2,500people drowned. Overall, the hurricane left at least $25million in damage.|$|E

25|$|The Mackenzie River delta was a {{focus of}} ground and air surveys as early as 1957, and geologists drew {{comparisons}} then to the Mississippi and Niger Deltas, speculating that the Mackenzie could prove as prolific. For millions of years sediments had been <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie, creating tremendous banks of sand and shale – laminates of sedimentary rock warped into promising geological structures. Drilling began in the Mackenzie Delta-Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula in 1962, and accelerated during the early 1970s. The mouth of the Mackenzie River was not a Prudhoe Bay, but it did contain large gas fields.|$|E

[...] Drysdale served as the Dodger radio broadcast announcer with Vin Scully that year. As Hershiser left the mound with the record in hand, he was searching for Drysdale and saying [...] "Where is Drysdale? I've got to find Drysdale". Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game. In fact, when Hershiser returned to the dugout, Drysdale was waiting with his microphone for an interview.|$|E

To avoid the metal detector he entered the building through a basement window, and proceeded {{to the office of}} Mayor George Moscone. [...] Following a brief argument, White shot the Mayor in the shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head. White then walked to his former office, reloading his gun, and asked Milk to join him. White then shot Milk in the wrist, shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head, execution style.

500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{selected}} the track as an album pick, but {{stated that the}} honest songs on Unbroken, including [...] "Fix a Heart", [...] "Skyscraper" [...] and [...] "For the Love of a Daughter", were similar {{to the content of}} Lindsay Lohan's record A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005). He also criticized Lovato's voice, saying that she [...] "doesn't quite have the pipes to sing [...] without straining". In contrast, Joe DeAndrea of AbsolutePunk wrote, [...] "Lovato's vocals are unmatched – not only compared to her previous efforts, but the majority of vocalists in general. [...] The emotion throughout tracks like 'Lightweight' and 'Fix a Heart' show the true compassion within her voice as you can feel her heartache <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the speakers". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy called it [...] "one of the purest, rawest songs" [...] on the record.|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 2010, Gaga {{performed}} the song at the MAC AIDS Fund Pan-Asia Viva Glam launch in Tokyo where {{she wore a}} doily lace dress. She entered the stage in a procession inspired by a Japanese wedding, and as the lights dimmed, she sat at her piano on the rotating stage and belted out [...] "Speechless", which {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Alejandro", where she was picked up by one of her dancers, who appeared to be covered in talcum powder. Gaga taped a medley of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Alejandro" [...] for the ninth season of American Idol on April 28, 2010. Her performance aired on the show's May 5, 2010 episode. The performance started with Gaga playing the piano for a slowed-down snippet of [...] "Bad Romance". She was dressed in a revealing-but-veiled black outfit, wielding a cape and was surrounded by shirtless dancers. Halfway through the performance, she shed her cape and began writhing on the floor. Over {{in one corner of the}} stage, a statue of the Virgin Mary had flames <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the top of it, as Gaga sang the chorus. Fog filled the stage, as Gaga and her dancers performed an energetic dance routine. Luchina Fisher from ABC News called it a [...] "thinly-veiled performance dripping with sex and violins" [...] and [...] "Gaga doing her best Madonna impression." [...] On July 9, 2010, the song was performed on The Today Show, where she sang it on a stage, outside the studio. In May 2011, Gaga {{performed the}} song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the finale {{received}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN thought it [...] "fantastic," [...] because it was [...] "a great story that leads us into one hell of a conclusion to the season," [...] and that it [...] "right away [...] us the deepest, most exciting look into the alternate universe we've seen so far." [...] He rated it 9.0/10. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly and MTV's Josh Wigler agreed on this last point, with Tucker noting the first part [...] "was a complete success and a blast at giving us a fully lived-in alternate universe." [...] Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded the first part with an A−, calling it [...] "a fun, exciting episode that nicely set up next week's finale". Isler, Wigler, and Murray loved the return of the Cortexifan subjects; Murray docked the episode a half point, explaining [...] "I love the idea of Olivia & The Cortexifanatics so much that I'm bummed Fringe burned through the group so quickly." [...] Critic Andrew Hanson, writing for the Los Angeles Times, noted that because of the parallel universe focus, the first part felt like the following season's premiere. He praised the opening scene, and believed the scenes between Peter and his mother helped [...] "ground the episode. They might be out of pace with the action and drama <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> every other moment, but there was weight and emotion. Bravo Joshua Jackson and Orla Brady. Bravo." [...] Ken Tucker noted that the scenes with Peter and his true mother indicated [...] "a great, humantistic use of a sci-fi trope". MTV's Josh Wigler praised Torv's performance, but wished the two-part finale was not broken up, explaining [...] "I could have easily tuned in for another several hours. Heck, I could watch an entire parallel series focused solely on the alternate universe!" ...|$|E

500|$|On the 7thJune, 1917, while {{disguised}} as a British merchant vessel with a dummy gun mounted aft, H.M.S. [...] "Pargust" [...] was torpedoed at very close range. Her boiler-room, engine-room, and No. 5 hold were immediately flooded, and the starboard lifeboat was blown to pieces. The weather was misty at the time, fresh breeze and a choppy sea. The [...] "Panic Party", {{under the command of}} Lieutenant F. R. Hereford, D.S.C., R.N.R., abandoned ship, and as the last boat was shoving off, the periscope of the submarine was observed close before the port beam about 400 yards distant. The enemy then submerged, and periscope reappeared directly astern, passing to the starboard quarter, and then round to the port beam, when it turned again towards the ship, breaking surface about 50 yards away. The lifeboat, acting as a lure, commenced to pull round the stern; submarine followed closely and Lieutenant Hereford, with complete disregard of the danger incurred from the fire of either ship or submarine (who had trained a maxim on the lifeboat), continued to decoy her to within 50 yards of the ship. The [...] "Pargust" [...] then opened fire with all guns, and the submarine, with oil squirting from her side and the crew <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the conning tower, steamed slowly across the bows with a heavy list. The enemy crew held up their hands in token of surrender, whereupon fire immediately ceased. The submarine then began to move away at a gradually increasing speed, apparently endeavouring to escape in the mist. Fire was reopened until she sank, one man clinging to the bow as she went down. The boats, after a severe pull to the windward, succeeded in saving one officer and one man. American Destroyers and a British sloop arrived shortly afterwards, and the [...] "Pargust" [...] was towed back to port. As on the previous occasions, officers and men displayed the utmost courage and confidence in their captain, and the action serves as an example of what perfect discipline, when coupled with such confidence, can achieve.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the NSA desired new tools to collect {{intelligence}} from the growing flood of information <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the new digital networks like the internet.

He became part of the [...] "minority" [...] that favored ThinThread for several reasons, including its theoretical ability to protect the privacy of US individuals while gathering intelligence. Trailblazer required billions of dollars, dwarfing the cost of ThinThread. Drake eventually became [...] "disillusioned, then indignant" [...] regarding the problems he saw at the agency. Around 2000 NSA head Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer over ThinThread; ThinThread was cancelled and Trailblazer ramped up, eventually employing IBM, SAIC, Boeing, CSC, and others.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the early}} {{members of the}} Western Sephardim {{consisted}} of persons who themselves (or whose immediate forebears) personally experienced an interim period as New Christians, which resulted in unceasing trials and persecutions of crypto-Judaism by the Portuguese and Spanish Inquisitions, the early community continued to be augmented by further New Christian emigration <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1700s. Jewish-origin New Christians were officially considered Christians due to their forced or coerced conversions; as such they were subject to {{the jurisdiction of the}} Catholic Church's Inquisitorial system, and were subject to harsh heresy and apostasy laws if they continued to practice their ancestral Jewish faith. Those New Christians who eventually fled both the Iberian cultural sphere and jurisdiction of the Inquisition were able to officially return to Judaism and open Jewish practice once they were in their new tolerant environments of refuge.|$|E
