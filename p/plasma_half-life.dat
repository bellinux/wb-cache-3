40|$|The {{influence}} of cigarette smoking on <b>plasma</b> theophylline elimination <b>half-life</b> was examined {{in a group}} of elderly in-patients, to determine whether the modifying effect of cigarette smoking is also present in this age-group. The <b>plasma</b> theophylline <b>half-life</b> was determined in five non-smokers and seven smokers aged 66 - 88 years after administration of 320 mg of theophylline syrup. A wide range of plasma theophylline half-lives was observed in each group.

The total clearance of the compound from the plasma is about 0.9 mL/min. The excretion of the compound takes primarily place via the feces and urine. After 6 days approximately 24% of the intake is excreted from the body, of which about 9% is excreted via the feces and 14.5% via the urine.|$|R
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of these drugs derives from two factors: their target, the H+/K+ ATPase {{which is responsible for}} the last step in acid secretion; therefore, their action on acid secretion is independent of the stimulus to acid secretion, of histamine, acetylcholine, or other yet to be discovered stimulants. Also, their mechanism of action involves covalent binding of the activated drug to the enzyme, resulting in a duration of action that exceeds their <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life.</b>|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine {{is absorbed}} from the gut to about 88%. Bioavailability varies greatly between {{individual}} patients, between 30 and 90%, because {{the drug is}} partly inactivated in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations, counting not only the drug itself but also its metabolites, are reached after one to two hours; and the average <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life</b> is 26 to 80 minutes for azathioprine and three to five hours for drug plus metabolites. 20 to 30% are bound to plasma proteins while circulating in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} {{exercised}} {{by people who}} are also taking protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours. Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include erythromycin and cimetidine, both of which can also lead to prolonged <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life</b> levels.|$|E
2500|$|Such drug {{interactions}} {{are associated with}} the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving NSAIDS and theophylline. [...] As such, these {{drug interactions}} involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect. [...] The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine and the absorption of levothyroxine. The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose. [...] This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the <b>plasma's</b> <b>half-life</b> that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking norfloxacin.|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of a syrup formulation {{consisting of}} four parts of amoxycillin and {{one part of}} potassium clavulanate (Augmentin) were studied in 11 paediatric patients, 3 to 14 years of age. Single oral doses of 25 mg of Augmentin per kg body weight (20 mg of amoxycillin per kg plus 5 mg of potassium clavulanate per kg, i. e. 1 mg of the syrup per kg) were administered on an empty stomach, and were well accepted and tolerated. Mean peak plasma concentrations 60 - 90 min after dosing were 7. 2 mg/l for amoxycillin and 2 - 0 mg/l for clavulanic acid. Mean terminal phase <b>plasma</b> <b>half-lifes</b> were 1. 4 and 1. 0 h, respectively. It is concluded that 25 -mg/kg doses of this syrup formulation of Augmentin administered three times daily should be adequate therapy for various childhood bacterial infection...|$|R
25|$|The ADAMTS {{protease}} family contains {{enzymes that}} process collagen, cleave inter-cellular matrix, inhibit angiogenesis and blood coagulation. ADAMTS13 {{belongs to the}} zinc metalloproteases, and is mainly expressed in liver stellate cells and endothelial cells, but was also found in other cell types, such as platelets, podocytes in the kidney and several brain cells. The only known role of the ADAMTS13 protease is to cleave VWF multimers. The <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life</b> of administered ADAMTS13 in USS patients is around 2–4 days, whereas the protective effects seems to last longer.|$|E
25|$|After intra-muscular {{administration}} of Parecoxib sodium peak plasma concentration is reached within 15 minutes. The plasma concentration decreases rapidly after administration {{because of a}} rather short serum half-life, which is about 15–52 minutes. This {{can be explained by}} the rapid formation of Valdecoxib. In contrast to the rapid clearance of Parecoxib, plasma concentration of Valdecoxib declines slowly because of a longer half-life. On the other hand, when Valdecoxib is taken orally it is absorbed rapidly (1–2 hours), but presence of food can delay peak serum concentration. It then undergoes the same metabolism that is described above. It is extensively protein-bound (98%), and the <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life</b> is about 7–8 hours. Note that the half-life can be significantly prolonged in the elderly or those with hepatic impairment, and can lead to drug accumulation.|$|E
25|$|MDMA and {{metabolites}} {{are primarily}} excreted as conjugates, such as sulfates and glucuronides. MDMA is a chiral compound {{and has been}} almost exclusively administered as a racemate. However, the two enantiomers {{have been shown to}} exhibit different kinetics. The disposition of MDMA may also be stereoselective, with the S-enantiomer having a shorter elimination half-life and greater excretion than the R-enantiomer. Evidence suggests that the area under the blood plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was two to four times higher for the (R)-enantiomer than the (S)-enantiomer after a 40mg oral dose in human volunteers. Likewise, the <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life</b> of (R)-MDMA was significantly longer than that of the (S)-enantiomer (5.8±2.2 hours vs 3.6±0.9 hours). However, because MDMA excretion and metabolism have nonlinear kinetics, the half-lives would be higher at more typical doses (100mg is sometimes considered a typical dose).|$|E
40|$|Biopharmaceuticals hold {{important}} {{value for}} the treatment of severe diseases. However, stability concerns remain one of the main obstacles for their successful market authorization. Generally, physical instabilities (in particular aggregation), in vivo immunogenicity, and short circulation half-lifes due to enzymatic degradation and fast renal elimination pose major challenges. After PEGylation, the covalent conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) to biopharmaceuticals, decreased enzymatic degradation, prolonged <b>plasma</b> <b>half-lifes,</b> reduced in vivo immunogenicity, and improved formulation stability have been reported. However, several challenges remain for covalent PEGylation: i) the chemical processing and subsequent purification needed to attach the PEG may represent further stress on the protein, resulting in increased aggregation and possible loss of activity, ii) heterogeneous products are obtained requiring separation and characterization, and iii) an observed reduced in vivo bioactivity resulting from decreased interactions of the drug with its receptor due to steric shielding by the PEG. As described in this thesis, we addressed the need for alternative PEGylation approaches by development of novel techniques based on non-covalent interactions...|$|R

25|$|Lumiracoxib {{is unique}} amongst the coxibs {{in being a}} weak acid. It was {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. The acidic nature of lumiracoxib allows it to penetrate well into areas of inflammation. It has shown to be rapidly and well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring in about 1–3 hours. A study showed that when a subject was given 400nbsp&mg dose, the amount of unchanged drug in the plasma 2.5 hours postdose suggest a modest first pass effect. The terminal half-life in plasma ranged from 5.4 to 8.6 hours (mean =6.5 hours). The half-life in synovial fluid is considerably longer than in plasma, and the concentration in synovial fluid 24 hours after administration would be expected to result in a substantial COX-2 inhibition. This fact can explain why some users may suffice with once-daily dosage despite a short <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life.</b> The major plasma metabolites are 5-carboxy, 4’-hydroxy, and 4’-hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives. Lumiracoxib is extensively metabolized before it is excreted, and the excretion routes are in the urine or feces. Peak plasma concentrations exceed those necessary to maximally inhibit COX-2, and that is consistent with a longer pharmacodynamic half-life. In vitro lumiracoxib has demonstrated a greater COX-2 selectivity {{than any of the other}} coxibs.|$|E
25|$|A severe ADAMTS13 {{deficiency}} below 5% or <10% of {{the normal}} (depending on the definitions) is highly specific for the diagnosis of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity assays {{are based on the}} direct or indirect measurement of VWF-cleavage products. Its activity should be measured in blood samples taken before therapy has started, to prevent false high ADAMTS13 activity. If a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is present an ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is needed to distinguish between the acquired, autoantibody-mediated and the congenital form of TTP (USS). The presence of antibodies can be tested by ELISA or functional inhibitor assays. The level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor may be fluctuating over the course of disease and depends on free circulatory antibodies, therefore an onetime negative test result does not always exclude the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors and thereby an autoimmune origin of TTP. A severe ADAMTS13 deficiency {{in the absence of an}} inhibitor, confirmed on a second time point in a healthy episode of a possible USS patient, usually sets the trigger to perform a molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene to confirm a mutation. In unclear cases a plasma infusion trial can be done, showing an USS in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13-antibodies a full recovery of infused plasma-ADAMTS13 activity as well as a <b>plasma</b> <b>half-life</b> of infused ADAMTS13 activity of 2–4 days. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in first-degree relatives is also a very strong indicator for an Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome.|$|E

Eight groups of mice dosed orally with a different anticoagulant rodenticide in a dose equal to one-half the lethal dose 50 (LD(50)), were killed at various times up to 21 days after administration. The eight anticoagulant rodenticides were assayed in plasma and liver by an LC-ESI-MS/MS method. Depending on the compound, the limit of quantification was set at 1 or 5 ng/mL in plasma.
