50|$|A {{macrograph}} or <b>photomacrograph</b> is {{an image}} taken at a scale that is {{visible to the naked}} eye, as opposed to a micrographic image. It is sometimes defined more precisely as an image at a scale of less than ten times magnification.|$|E
40|$|Report proposes {{radiographic}} terminology standardization {{which allows}} scientific interpretation of radiographic films to replace dependence on individual judgement and experience. Report includes over 50 photographic pages where radiographs of aluminum welds with defects are compared with prepared weld sections <b>photomacrographs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cover illustration: The authors {{intentionally}} chose representative {{eyes from}} the various book illustrations {{as a tribute to}} James M. Reilly, Director of the Image Permanence Institute. In his “Flowchart for Identification Guide, ” Care and Identification of 19 th Century Prints (1996), Reilly used <b>photomacrographs</b> of eyes t...|$|R
40|$|The extinct Eocene Baltic amber genus Propelma Trjapitzin 1963 {{is removed}} from {{synonymy}} under Eupelmus Dalman 1820 (Hymenoptera, Eupelmidae, Eupelminae) and treated as a valid genus within Neanastatinae Kalina 1984 based on examination of the holotype female of P. rohdendorfi Trjapitzin. Propelma rohdendorfi is redescribed, illustrated by <b>photomacrographs,</b> and compared to other described extant and extinct genera of Neanastatinae. Taxonomic, morphological and geological diversity of Neanastatinae relative to Eupelminae and Calosotinae is also discussed relative to potential age of the subfamily...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of representative types of flush-riveted joints {{has been determined}} by testing 865 single-shearing, double-shearing, and tensile specimens representing 7 types of rivet and 18 types of joint. The results, presented in graphic form, show the stress at failure, type of failure, and d/t ratio. In general, 'dimpled' joints were appreciably stronger than countersunk or protruding-head joints, but their strength was greatly influenced by constructional details. The optimum d/t ratios have been determined for the several kinds of joints. <b>Photomacrographs</b> of each type show constructional details and, in several instances, cracks in the sheet...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{deals with}} {{the influence of the}} addition of soft graphite particles on the abrasive wear of composite reinforced with hard SiC particles. The discussed hybrid composites were produced by stirring the liquid alloy and simultaneous adding the mixture of particles. The adequately prepared suspension was gravity cast into a metal die. Both the composite castings obtained in this way and the comparative castings produced of the pure matrix alloy were examined for the abrasive wear behaviour. <b>Photomacrographs</b> of the sliding surfaces of the examined composites were taken, and also the hardness measurements were carried out. It was found that even a small addition of Cgr particles influences positively the tribological properties of the examined composite materials, protecting the abraded surface from the destructive action of silicon carbide particles. The work presents also the results of hardness measurements which confirm that the composite material hardness increases with an increase in the volume fraction of hard reinforcing particles...|$|R
