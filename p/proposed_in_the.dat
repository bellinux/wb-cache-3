5|$|A freeway {{along the}} I-475 {{corridor}} was <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s.

5|$|A {{greenway}} and/or connecting trail along Leggetts Creek was <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan in {{the early}} 2000s.

The South Abington Park and the Leggetts Creek Trail are in Chinchilla and the creek flows though the latter. Trestle Hole Park is also along the creek's lower reaches.

5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1878 session, tax {{assessments}} for railroad property {{were raised}} to match {{those of other}} property. Agrarian interests were pleased that the legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they had <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous session. Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) from Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) {{and the establishment of}} a state board of health.

5|$|An inter-municipal railway {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the Ålgård Line towards Hunnedalen via Setesdalsheiene to Lunde in Telemark. The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 {{to look at the}} various proposals. After considering the impact and value of the various railways that had been <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened.|$|E
5|$|Another pet project Johnson {{supported}} {{was prompted}} by his friendship with John Cleves Symmes, Jr., who proposed that the Earth was hollow.

The proposal was soundly defeated, receiving only twenty-five votes in the House and Senate combined.|$|E
5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903.

The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E
