5|$|In certain regions, <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> {{of certain}} scales {{may be a}} quick way to {{distinguish}} non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{environmental}} factors affecting {{the distribution of}} living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities.|$|E

50|$|Clamp {{connections}} are structures {{unique to the}} phylum Basidiomycota. Many fungi from this phylum produce spores in basidiocarps (fruiting bodies, or mushrooms), above ground. Though clamp {{connections are}} exclusive to this phylum, not all species of Basidiomycota possess these structures. As such, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absences</b> of clamp connections has been a tool in categorizing genera and species.|$|R
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{classification scheme}} {{has been suggested}} by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy. The system consists of five grades and it assigns one point for the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of each of five factors: age greater than 50; Hunt and Hess grade 4 or 5; Fisher scale 3 or 4; aneurysm size greater than 10 mm; and posterior circulation aneurysm 25 mm or more.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. The <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due {{to the complexity of}} organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia {{are the most important}} characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus.|$|E

5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of sunlight. Nearly all life {{forms in the}} ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory {{skin condition}} characterized by eczematous lesions, i. e. ill-demarcated erythematous patches and plaques. AD is {{commonly associated with}} elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) and atopic disorders, such as asthma, hay fever, and food allergies. Rackemann and Mallory {{were some of the}} first to distinguish between asthma based on the <b>presence</b> (“extrinsic”) <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> (“intrinsic”) of allergy. This distinction has subsequently been applied to AD based on the <b>presence</b> (“extrinsic”) <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> (“intrinsic”) of increased IgE and atopic disease. Although the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic AD is widely used, it remains controversial...|$|R
40|$|Few {{reports have}} been {{published}} on the chemical nature of the keratohyaline granules, and all are not in agreement. In addition to the published disagreements as to the <b>presence</b> (8) <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> (4) of iron, the <b>presence</b> (4) <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> (8) of calcium and magnesium, and the <b>presence</b> (5) <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> (4) of rihonucleic acid, we wish {{to call attention to}} our findings on the absence of alkaline phosphatase in the granules. Association of these granules with alkaline phosphatase has been reported (4). Inasmuch as the Gomori col) altous sulfide method used (4) to demonstrate the presence of this enzyme (1) is said to be as satisfactory as more recent methods, we have examined the keratohyaline granules using this method in comparison with the Mannheimer-Seligman heta-naphthol azo-dye coupling (6) and the Gomori alpha-naphthol azo-dye coupling (2) techniques.

5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence,</b> but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E

5|$|In 1735 Brandt {{proposed}} {{to make the}} <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of malleability the principle of this classification. On that basis he separated mercury from the metals. The same view was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun had observed the solidification of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The malleability of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> of particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E

30|$|In Step 5, {{chemicals}} with {{exposure levels}} exceeding their RVs are identified using the exposure assumptions described below. In an actual risk assessment, these estimates of exposure and the RVs {{would be subject}} to refined chemical-specific risk assessments.
