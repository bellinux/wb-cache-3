For <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surimi</b> treated with ozone, ozone water (8 [*]mg/L) {{was used in}} either the first (To 1) or the second (To 2) cycle of rinsing. As compared with control samples (Tc) (rinsing two cycles with water), myofibrillar proteins from To 1 surimi showed slightly lower free sulfhydryl contents and higher surface hydrophobicity throughout frozen storage and lower Ca 2 +-ATPase activities after 30 [*]d. To 2 did not significantly (P> 0. 05) affect these physicochemical properties, indicating that myofibrillar proteins structure was well maintained. Consequently, To 1 significantly (P> 0. 05) decreased breaking force <b>of</b> <b>surimi</b> gels while To 2 did not significantly (P> 0. 05) affect gel breaking force. In addition, the whiteness <b>of</b> <b>surimi</b> gels was increased more obviously by To 2 than by To 1.

Gels were made from surimi containing either 0. 105 % quercetin, fish oil (group ω 3), or fish oil additionally supplemented with 0. 105 % quercetin (group ω 3 -Q). Antioxidant capacity, measured by DPPH•, was reduced when quercetin was added to the surimi to made the gel, suggesting a modification due to the technological process The addition of omega- 3 fatty acids together with quercetin did not hinder its antiradical efficiency. Lipid stability was not enhanced due to quercetin since commercial fish oil already contains stabilizers. The addition of quercetin did not alter rheological properties nor microstructure but produced a large increase in yellowness (b*). The gels were given to male Wistar rats for four weeks. Food intake and body weight gain were similar in the three groups, indicating good tolerance to this food. Plasma lipid profile of ω 3 and ω 3 -Q fed rats was not significantly different from the control group in the experimental conditions. No structural modifications were observed in liver due to the diet. Total plasma antioxidant capacity, measured by the FRAP assay, was significantly increased only in the group containing quercitin.

The overall objective {{of this research was}} to study the changes in protein structure that are associated with the preparation and frozen storage <b>of</b> <b>surimi.</b> In addition, the relative cryoprotective effects of whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate, flaxseed meal and flaxseed protein were assessed in surimi during storage. Raw surimi was prepared by repeatedly washing Alaska pollock flesh with chilled water. The product was either slowly frozen or underwent rapid freezing using liquid air; in either case it was then subjected to frozen storage at - 20 °C for 24 months. Protein structural changes were monitored using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native-PAGE, Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR/ATR spectroscopy showed that during <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surimi</b> the alpha-helix content increased with increased number of washing cycles. DSC results revealed a shift in the thermal transition of actin to a higher temperature during surimi preparation. All electrophoresis, FTIR/ATR spectroscopy and DSC results revealed a loss of myofibrillar proteins from surimi after three washing cycles, suggesting that three washing cycles were adequate to prepare surimi. Native-PAGE showed no major changes in surimi after 24 months storage at - 20 °C. SDS-PAGE showed relatively minor changes in protein subunit structure with some loss of the myosin light chains (MLC); myosin heavy chain (MHC), actin and tropomyosin were found to be relatively stable. FTIR/ATR spectroscopy indicated a significant decrease in alpha-helix relative to beta-sheet structure in surimi after 2 years of storage at - 20 °C. The loss of alpha-helical content was more significant in slowly frozen surimi compared to rapid-frozen surimi samples. DSC results revealed a shift in the thermal transition of actin to lower temperatures during frozen storage <b>of</b> <b>surimi.</b> Changes in the ratio of alpha-helix to beta-sheet structures suggested that flaxseed protein was the most effective cryoprotectant, followed by whey protein isolate and soy protein isolate, for maintaining protein structure stability during frozen storage. Whey protein concentrate and flaxseed meal showed the least cryoprotective ability. After 15 days storage at 4 °C, the SDS-PAGE results showed that flaxseed protein was the only cryoprotectant that prevented the degradation of myosin heavy chain, actin and myosin light chains...|$|R
