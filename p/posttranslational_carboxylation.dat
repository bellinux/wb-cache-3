40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{a boy who}} had excessive {{bleeding and}} bruising from birth and showed markedly prolonged prothrombin times, partially correctable by oral vitamin K administration. Additional laboratory studies demonstrated decreased activities of plasma factors II, VII, IX, and X; near normal levels of immunologically detected and calcium binding-independent prothrombin; undercarboxylation of prothrombin; excess circulating vitamin K epoxide; decreased excretion of carboxylated glutamic acid residues; and abnormal circulating osteocalcin. These results all are consistent with effects resulting from decreased <b>posttranslational</b> <b>carboxylation</b> secondary to an inborn deficiency of vitamin K epoxide reductase. This individual also had nasal hypoplasia, distal digital hypoplasia, and epiphyseal stippling on infant radiographs, {{all of which are}} virtually identical to features seen secondary to first-trimester exposure to coumarin derivatives. Therefore, by inference, the warfarin embryopathy is probably secondary to warfarin's primary pharmacologic effect (interference with vitamin K-dependent <b>posttranslational</b> <b>carboxylation</b> of glutamyl residues of various proteins) and may result from undercarboxylation of osteocalcin or other vitamin K-dependent bone proteins...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin K,discovered in the 1930 s, {{functions}} as cofactor for the <b>posttranslational</b> <b>carboxylation</b> of glutamate residues. Gamma-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) -residues were first identified in pro-thrombin and coagulation {{factors in the}} 1970 s; subsequently, extra-hepatic Gla proteins were described,including osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein (MGP). Impairment of the function of os-teocalcin and MGP due to incomplete carboxylation results in an increased risk for developing osteoporosis and vascular cal-cification, respectively, and is an unexpected side effect of treat-ment with oral anticoagulants. It is conceivable that other side effects, possible involving growth-arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas 6...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the liver}} vitamin K epoxide, which is {{produced}} during the <b>posttranslational</b> <b>carboxylation</b> of proteinbound glutamic acid residues, is recycled by {{the action of}} one or more dithiol-dependent reductases. In vitro synthetic dithiols may serve as a cofactor for these enzymes, but the physiological reluctant has not yet been found. In this paper we report that in vitro the commercially available thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase from E. coli can replace the synthetic dithiols during the various reactions of the vitamin K cycle. Based on the assumption that in vivo thioredoxin also plays a role in the regeneration of vitamin K hydroquinone from the epoxide, an extension of the generally accepted vitamin K cycle is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular disease {{remains the}} leading cause of mor-tality and is {{worldwide}} directly responsible for ≈ 12 mil-lion deaths and 20 % of total mortality. 1 Calcification of the conduit arteries is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, 2 – 4 stroke, 3, 4 and cardiovascular death. 2, 4 Vascular smooth muscle cells synthesize a small secretory protein (11 kDa), which contains 5 γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) amino-acids and which was therefore named matrix Gla protein (MGP). 5 Activation of MGP requires 2 <b>posttranslational</b> modifications: γ-glutamate <b>carboxylation</b> in a vitamin K–dependent manner and serine phosphorylation. Carboxylated MGP is a potent inhibitor of arterial calcification. 6 In the presence of vitamin K deficiency, MGP is partly synthesized in a noncarboxyl-ated form that does not inhibit calcification. The MGP gene is located on chromosome 12. 6 In animal experiments, vitamin K antagonists induce arte...|$|R
40|$|In mammalians {{the only}} known {{function}} of vitamin K is that of γ-glutamylcarboxylase cofactor, enzyme catalyzing the <b>posttranslational</b> <b>carboxylation</b> of the so-called vitamin K-depending proteins. Well-known for the activation of the coagulation proteins, vitamin K {{has also been shown}} to be required by extra-hepatic proteins involved in bone metabolism, vascular calcification, and apoptosis. This vitamin is characterized by a cyclic metabolism: it is its stable quinonic form to be absorbed and transported in blood, but it is the hydroquinone one to act as enzymatic cofactor and to be transformed into vitamin K 2, 3 -epoxide. The latter is then recycled to quinone and hydroquinone in successive reactions catalyzed by vitamin K reductases, dithiol-depending enzymes inhibited by coumarin drugs. A second NAD(P) H-dependent quinone reductase is relatively insensitive to these anticoagulants and operates at high concentrations of vitamin K. Probably because of its efficient recycle system, very low levels of vitamin K circulate in plasma. Moreover, its Recommended Daily Allowance has currently been set at 1 μg/kg/day; this value is surely suitable for its hepatic function, but an extra demand might be required for guaranteeing the bone and vessel health, especially in subjects under anticoagulant therapy. For these reasons, an accurate determination of the vitamin K and its metabolites is a real analytical challenge. This work was just addressed to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties making use of an advanced analytical technique such as liquid chromatography-linear ion trap mass spectrometry. After its development and validation, the method was applied for refining the status of phylloquinone (vitamin K 1) and for defining that of vitamin K 1 2, 3 -epoxide in a significant cohort of healthy subjects and of patients under anticoagulant therapy. An accumulation of both forms was verified in individuals taking long-term coumarin drugs...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a competitive chemiluminoimmunoassay of osteocalcin {{that is similar}} to radioimmunoassay but uses acridinium-ester-labeled antigen instead of 125, labeled osteocalcin; a second antibody immobilized on plastic beads is used to separate free and bound frac-tions. There was good correlation of the new chemilumi-noimmunoassay (y) with a polyclonal antiserum (R 102) radioimmunoassay (x) used in many previous clinical studies (r = 0. 96, y = 0. 968 x + 2. 69, S = 0. 029, n = 86). The new assay recognized both the intact and the small fragment of osteocalcin in plasma and detected decreases of them (total,- 47 %) after a 24 -h infusion of parathyroid hormone. Patientswith primary hyperparathy-roidism had increased concentrations of intact osteocal-cm. Children had higher concentrations of osteocalcin than adults did. Healthy women had greater osteocalcin concentrations at ages 50 - 70 years than earlier. Inverse correlations of bone mineral density and osteocalcin were found in healthy women and in women with osteoporosis. IndexIng Terms: bone osteoporosis reference values age-related effects An ideal biochemical marker of bone formation would be a matrix constituent of bone specifically synthesized by osteoblast 8 at a rate proportional to collagen synthe-sis, with a fraction released into the circulation in an amount proportional to the amount of the fraction incorporated into the matrix. None of the currently available biochemical markers of bone formation meet all these criteria, but osteocalcin is the most satisfactory marker (1). Ost. eocalcin (bone-Gla-protein) is a bone matrix protein of 49 amino acid residues (molecular mass 5800 Da) containing three y-carboxyglutamic ac-ids (Gla) by <b>posttranslational</b> <b>carboxylation</b> of glutamic acid at positions 17, 21, and 24 (2 - 4). Osteocalcin is synthesized mainly in bone by osteoblasts, and 70 % is released into the circulation. Only a small amount is synthesized in dentin, but none in the liver or other organs. Thus, osteocalcin is a specific biochemical marker of bone formation (1). Bone formation can be measured by histomorphome-try on the bone biopsy specimen, prernarked by tetracy-cline double-labeling, similar to measuring tree growt...|$|E
