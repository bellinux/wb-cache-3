5|$|Aristotle's {{work was}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, {{as well as}} in Europe during the Renaissance.

5|$|According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his {{interest}} in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of epigrammatic expression, suggest {{that he was in}} fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history). While <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.|$|E

Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature. The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for their lost homes and the need for integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Busch was {{influential}} in both poetry and illustration, {{and became a}} source for future generations of comic artists. The Katzenjammer Kids was inspired by Busch's Max and Moritz, {{one of a number}} of imitations produced in Germany and the United States. The Wilhelm Busch Prize and the Wilhelm Busch Museum help maintain his legacy. His 175th anniversary in 2007 was celebrated throughout Germany. Busch remains one of the most influential <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> artists in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} {{the education of}} a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying rhetoric and literature. In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation. Among his first published works were poetry, as well as writings on law and administration.|$|E

5|$|In aristocratic Russian society, {{the greater}} freedoms allowed to women {{led to the}} rise of the powerful, socially-connected woman, {{including}} such iconic figures as Catherine the Great, Maria Naryshkina, and Countess Maria Razumovskaya. Women also began to compete with men in the literary sphere, with Russian women authors, <b>poets,</b> <b>and</b> memoirists increasing in popularity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poets</b> <b>and</b> {{artists were}} among the early {{visitors}} to Helvellyn {{at the beginning of}} the nineteenth century.

5|$|Scholars however concur {{that the}} rulers of the {{imperial}} dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.|$|E
5|$|Vagaland, {{who grew}} up in Walls, was arguably Shetland's finest poet of the 20th century.

5|$|A more {{traditional}} Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighborhood where the <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> artists of Belgrade {{gathered in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At {{one end of the}} neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja("?").|$|E

5|$|As {{a patron}} of <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> authors James V (r. 1513–42) {{supported}} William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. David Lyndsay (c. 1486–1555), diplomat {{and the head}} of the Lyon Court, was a prolific poet. He wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. George Buchanan (1506–82) had a major influence as a Latin poet, founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century. Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland (1537–95), reformer Andrew Melville (1545–1622), John Johnston (1570?–1611) and David Hume of Godscroft (1558–1629).|$|E
5|$|As {{a patron}} of <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> authors James V {{supported}} William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount the Lord Lyon, {{the head of}} the Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540. James also attracted the attention of international authors. When he married Mary of Guise, Giovanni Ferrerio, an Italian scholar who had been at Kinloss Abbey in Scotland, dedicated to the couple a new edition of his work, On the true significance of comets against the vanity of astrologers. Like Henry VIII, James employed many foreign artisans and craftsmen to enhance the prestige of his renaissance Court.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneous {{to these}} developments, Nagavarma II wrote his Kannada grammar Karnataka bhashabhushana ("Ornament of Karnataka language", 1042 or 1145). A {{milestone}} {{in the history}} of Kannada literature, it helped consolidate the language as competitor to established languages such as Sanskrit and Prakrit, bringing the local language within the realm of literary cosmopolitanism. Writing a Kannada grammar in Sanskrit language was essential to Nagavarma II, a subtle rebuttal to Sanskritic scholars of the day who may have considered Kannada a language of the common man and its grammar as underdeveloped. In addition to the Chalukya patronage, Kannada <b>poets</b> <b>and</b> writers of this period were popular in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western Deccan. The Hoysalas, the southern Kalachuris, the Seunas, the Gangas and the Silharas are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used Kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature.|$|E
