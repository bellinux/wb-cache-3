25|$|The US {{government}} in Puerto Rico enticed US companies by providing labor at costs below {{those on the}} mainland, access to contiguous US markets without import duties, and profits that could transfer to the mainland free from federal taxation. The Administration of Economic Development invited investment of external capital, importing the raw materials, and exporting the finished products to the mainland. To entice <b>participation,</b> tax <b>exemptions</b> and differential rental rates were offered for industrial facilities. As a result, Puerto Rico's economy shifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing and tourism. The manufacturing sector has shifted from the original labor-intensive industries, such as the manufacturing of food, tobacco, leather, and apparel products, to more capital-intensive industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and electronics. Through this project, a rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the results of a thematic analysis of 79 semi-structured interviews collected at six research sites in four countries in relation to the inclusion and exclusion of students with developmental disabilities (DD) in and from special education and bilingual opportunities. The participants were individuals with expertise either in special needs and/or language education to support bilingualism (e. g., second language (L 2) instruction), who served as key informants about service delivery and/or policy in these areas. Six themes emerged as salient during the analysis: we include all kids, special needs drives it, time/scheduling conflicts, IEP/IPP/statement drives it, it’s up to the parents, and service availability. The results suggested that access to language programs and services is limited for children with DD, even though participants at all sites reported adherence to a philosophy of inclusion. A priority on special education services over language services was identified, as well as barriers to providing children with DD access to programs and services to support bilingual development. Some of these barriers included time and scheduling conflicts and limited service availability. Additionally, the role of parents in decision making was affirmed, although, in contrast to special education services, decision-making about <b>participation</b> or <b>exemption</b> from language programs was typically left up to the parents. Overall, the results suggest a need for greater attention to providing supports for both first (L 1) and L 2 language development for bilingual children with DD and greater access to available language programs...|$|R

Assuming {{all the relevant}} entities or groups are trading companies and groups, if a company together with its fellow group companies has a shareholding of over 10% in another company, and has held those shares for more than twelve months, disposals of those shares are exempt from chargeable gains.

50|$|Most {{companies}} are taxed {{at a rate}} of 15%. The rate of 10% is applied on the interest and royalty income paid to non-resident companies.

The rate of 0% is applied on the profit generated by social enterprises and the business profit of non-profit enterprises up to a threshold of 25,000 litas (2014).

50|$|Holding {{companies}} are a central tool in many tax planning strategies of companies. The location decision for holdings depends on multiple general tax factors (such as <b>participation</b> <b>exemption</b> for dividends and capital gains, a wide treaty network, low withholding taxes, a group taxation regime) {{as well as}} on specific holding regimes. Certain countries thus try to enhance their tax attractiveness by offering special regimes for holding companies. Special rules for holdings include the exemption from local corporate income tax (e.g. Switzerland), exemption from current taxation (e.g. Luxembourg until 2010), the exemption from tax on all disposals of shares in subsidiaries (e.g. Singapore) or a refund of taxes paid to non-resident shareholders if profits are distributed (e.g. Malta).|$|E

Borrowing through similar manufactured loans allows companies to bypass restrictions to deducting the cost of borrowing. PEX induced arbitrage exploitable through stock and options portfolios is available even when put-call parity holds for European options. Derivatives that hedge a stock can “inherit” the PEX regime of the stock they hedge. PEX gives companies that own a stock a tax timing option, which can be exploited through stock straddle strategies, i. e. long-short positions in the same stock, and which can generate valuable tax savings...|$|E

The case concerned a Swedish company that held a 45 % shareholding in a UK subsidiary company whose shares were issued in US dollars.

40|$|The Discussion Draft of the “Tax Reform Act of 2014 ” (TRA 14) {{released}} by US House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) on February 26, 2014 represents {{a major effort}} for fundamental and far reaching reform of US tax law. Unfortunately, while {{many parts of the}} proposal seem quite sensible as an effort to bring back the “spirit of 1986 ”, the international tax reform proposals are deeply flawed and based on obsolete assumptions on the world facing US multinationals in 2014. Overall, TRA 14 represents a welcome effort to propose a revenue neutral combination of base broadening and rate cutting. TRA 14 envisages three individual rates of 10 %, 25 % and 35 % and a corporate rate of 25 %. This rate structure is quite sensible, and if it can be achieved in a revenue neutral fashion that is an added advantage. However, the international tax proposals are {{based on the assumption that}} because most other OECD countries have adopted a limited version of territoriality, i. e., a “participation exemption” for dividends out of the active income of Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs), the US must follow suit to preserve the competitiveness of US based MNEs. But this assumption is wrong, for three reasons. First, the empirical data indicate that under current law US based MNEs do not face a competitive disadvantage despite the fact that they are nominally taxed on a worldwide basis without a <b>participation</b> <b>exemption.</b> Second, the OECD BEPS project suggests that the effective tax rates of foreign MNEs are headed up, not down. Third and most importantly, reducing the US corporate tax can be done without putting US-based MNEs at a competitive disadvantage even if deferral were completely eliminated, and this has the added advantage of eliminating both lock out (the main problem the <b>participation</b> <b>exemption</b> is designed to solve) and the incentive to shift profits out of the US (which this version of TRA 14 does little to address). This paper will discuss these points and conclude that as far as the international proposals are concerned it would be better to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch with a simple proposal of full inclusion at whatever corporate rate is judged to be similar to the effective rates paid by foreign-based MNEs...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{tax reform}} {{proposals}} by House Ways and Means Committee Chair David Camp, R-Mich., and by President Obama seem to offer starkly contrasting visions {{of how to}} reform the taxation of foreign-source income earned by U.

S. -based MNEs currently have more than $ 1 trillion of ‘‘permanently reinvested’’ income offshore, which they cannot bring back to the U. S. without incurring a 35 percent tax penalty. However, they seem to offer radically different solutions: Under the Camp proposal, a <b>participation</b> <b>exemption</b> will enable U. S. -based MNEs {{to bring back the}} income without paying significant tax. Under the Obama proposal, deferral will be abolished and U. S. -based MNEs will have to pay a minimum tax on foreign-source income earned by their controlled foreign corporations as it is earned. The result would be that the tax penalty on repatriating that income would be reduced because dividends would only be subject to tax at the difference between the statutory rate (reduced to 28 percent under the Obama proposal) and the minimum rate...|$|E
40|$|A {{tax holiday}} is a time-limited {{exemption}} from taxation {{and one of the}} most commonly employed tax incentives in developing countries. The main objective behind tax holidays is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), as this is believed to stimulate economic growth and development. An {{exemption from taxation}} under a tax holiday could encourage investors to invest in developing countries.

The subject of this article is the interrelation between tax holidays offered by developing countries and rules in industrialized countries for the taxation of income earned by controlled foreign companies (CFCs). Most countries recognize each company as a separate legal entity (distinct from its shareholders) and as a separate taxpayer. Hence, profits derived by a non-resident company would usually not be taxed to its resident shareholders until profits are remitted as dividends or shares are realized at a gain. This is often described as ‘deferral of domestic tax’, and involves a saving in terms of postponed taxation. If the parent company is resident in a country that does not tax dividends or share gains resulting from foreign subsidiaries (e. g., under <b>participation</b> <b>exemption</b> rules or tax sparing credit) the investors would receive the full benefit of the tax holiday. This would lead to double non-taxation of the tax holiday income.

40|$|In this contribution, {{the author}} {{discusses}} three cases. The first case, Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) {{is a case}} which has been inspired by the Groupe Steria decision. The main issue in Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) is whether the Groupe Steria decision implies that a Dutch resident parent company cannot be {{denied the right to}} take into account currency losses in respect of a UK resident subsidiary. The Netherlands has denied this right {{on the basis of the}} Dutch <b>participation</b> <b>exemption.</b> The possible inconsistency with EU law has been founded on the idea that a Dutch resident parent company could have taken into account currency losses if the UK resident subsidiary had been a Dutch resident subsidiary with a permanent establishment (PE) in the UK and that subsidiary had been included in a fiscal unity with its Dutch resident parent company. Can this single element of the Dutch fiscal unity regime be relied on because of the Groupe Steria decision? This per-element approach may be relevant not only for the Netherlands, but for all EU Member States and EEA Member States which have a group taxation regime. The two other cases to be discussed, T- 760 / 15 (The Netherlands v. Commission) and T- 636 / 16 (Starbucks and Starbucks Manufacturing Emea v Commission), concern the European Commission decision that Starbucks received forbidden State aid from the Netherlands through an advanced pricing agreement (APA) concluded between Starbucks and the Dutch Tax Authorities (DTA). Both the Netherlands (Case T- 760 / 15) and Starbucks (Case T- 636 / 16) have appealed the decision. The European Commission is very active in the field of taxation of MNEs and potential State aid. In the Starbucks case the arm’s length pricing is at stake, but the Commission is also active in respect of other fields. Sometimes the fields are closely related, such as in the Apple case which concerns the allocation of profits between head office and PE. However, mismatches are also under investigation, such as the mismatch of the PE concept under the US-Luxembourg tax treaty leading to double non-taxation in the McDonald’s case. The Starbucks case may also be relevant for all EU and EEA Member States, because APA practices are widely applied by the Member States. This contribution starts by discussing Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) which is followed with a discussion of the Starbucks cases. For each of the cases, an initial description of the facts is provided. Subsequently, domestic tax law and tax treaty law are addressed. Next, the considerations of the Hoge Raad (HR; Dutch Supreme Court) and the Commission are set out respectively. Thereafter, the focus is on the preliminary questions of the HR and the pleas in law and main arguments in the Starbucks cases. Potential answers to the questions raised are then provided along with comments on the positions taken by the EC, the Netherlands and Starbucks from the author’s personal perspective. These potential answers and comments are not be given in isolation, rather they are based on benchmarks. The contribution is closed by summarizing the author’s main conclusions...|$|E
40|$|An Intermediary Holding Company (“IHC”) is {{a company}} that is {{interposed}} between an ultimate holding company and the operating subsidiaries of a group of companies. The IHC operates at an international level such that either its holding company or its subsidiaries or both are located in a country foreign to the IHC. Its main functions are to acquire, manage and dispose of the assets of the group of companies and to facilitate structural flexibility of a group of companies. Investors have tax and non-tax reasons for conducting business using an IHC, and, depending on the reasons, they determine the location of the IHC based on the characteristics of potential host countries. This thesis analyses the suitability of the South African corporate tax regime for the use of South African-resident Intermediary Holding Companies. The South African government has the objective of promoting South Africa as a gateway for investment in Africa and for this reason the present research is important. Such an objective could be adversely affected by a corporate tax regime that is not suitable for the operations of an IHC. Furthermore, the Katz Commission recommended in 1997 that South Africa should consider introducing a regime that is suitable for the location of holding companies. In discharging its functions the IHC attracts liability for corporate income tax, capital gains tax, controlled foreign company tax and dividends tax. It also exposes itself to anti-avoidance measures such as thin capitalisation and transfer pricing provisions. The existence of such taxes and anti-avoidance measures in the tax system of a country may deter investors from locating an IHC in such country. Exchange control regulations could also adversely affect the ability of the IHC to perform its functions effectively, as their purpose is to restrict the movement of capital out of the country. The South African legal system contains all these taxes and anti-avoidance measures as well as exchange control provisions. However, it also contains tax instruments that alleviate the tax burden on an investor using an IHC such as the <b>participation</b> <b>exemption,</b> advance tax rulings and a network of tax treaties. Against this background this thesis analyses the South African corporate tax system to determine whether it is suitable for locating an IHC. In the analysis, a comparative study is done of the tax systems of two of the most effective IHC host countries, namely the Netherlands and Mauritius. In addition, a brief discussion of the special features contained in the tax systems of Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom outlines why these jurisdictions are not necessarily successful in attracting IHCs. The thesis also discusses harmful tax practices and the attitude of the international community towards countries that engage in harmful tax competition {{in order to determine the}} limits to which a country should use the tax system to attract investment. Finally, the thesis makes recommendations as to what adjustments could be made in order to enhance the suitability of South Africa to host an IHC. The thesis recommends a special dispensation as regards corporate income tax and exchange control that would apply to wholly-owned South African companies that own foreign subsidiary shares and loans that consist of 80 % of the gross asset total of these companies.
