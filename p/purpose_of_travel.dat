25|$|Caledonian's transatlantic growth {{strategy}} {{focused on}} {{taking advantage of}} strong ethnic ties of overseas Scottish communities in North America {{to the land of}} their ancestors and an obscure International Air Transport Association (IATA) resolution dating from 1953. Under this resolution, airlines were permitted to offer cut-price charter tariffs if these were negotiated with an individual representing a distinct group that shared a common affinity among its members prior to the application for charter transportation. The way independent charter operators like Caledonian, who were not IATA members, interpreted that resolution was that it applied to closed groups only whose primary <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> was their common interest or kinship, rather than securing cheap air fares for its members. IATA imposed further restrictions on airlines seeking to exploit this loophole by insisting that any agent booking these flights had their commission capped at 5%, that the affinity group's membership could not exceed 20,000 and that those seeking to avail themselves of these offers must have been members for at least six months prior to the commencement of travel. These restrictions were designed to protect IATA members' transatlantic scheduled traffic by preventing non-members from undercutting them.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to criticism, the [...] "Gummi Ship" [...] {{feature of the}} first game was re-imagined to be [...] "more enjoyable". Although retaining its basic <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel,</b> the system was completely redone to resemble a combination of rail shooter and [...] "Disney theme park ride". In the world map, the player must now control the Gummi Ship from a top-down view and fly to the world the player wishes to enter. Worlds are no longer open from the beginning—the player must unlock the routes to them by entering a new level, controlling the ship from a third-person point of view, and battling enemy ships. After the route is opened, travel to the world is unimpeded, unless it is blocked again due to a plot-related event. The player may also gain new Gummi Ships from completing routes, {{which is also a}} new feature from the first game.|$|E

50|$|The tourism {{industry}} in Angola {{is based on}} the country's natural beauty, including its rivers, waterfalls and scenic coastline.
