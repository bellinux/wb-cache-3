40|$|This paper {{describes}} a diagnosis technique for locating design errors in circuit implementations {{which do not}} match their functional specification. The method efficiently propagates mismatched patterns from erroneous outputs backward into the network and calculates circuit regions which most likely contain the error(s). In contrast to previous approaches, the described technique {{does not depend on}} a fixed set of error models. Therefore, it is more general and especially suitable for transistor-level circuits, which have a broader variety of possible design errors than gate-level implementations. Furthermore, the proposed method is also applicable for incomplete sets of mismatched patterns and hence can be used not only as a debugging aid for formal verification techniques but also for simulationbased approaches.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to Monte Carlo estimation of the velocity of charge carriers driftdiffusing in a random medium. The random medium is modeled by a 1 -dimensional lattice and the position of the charge carrier is modeled by a Markov jump process, whose state space is the set of lattice points. The transition rates of the Markov jump process are determined by the underlying energy landscape of the random medium. This energy landscape is modeled by a Gaussian process and contains regions of relatively low energy, in which charge carriers quickly become stuck. As a result, the state space is not adequately explored by the standard algorithms and the velocity of the charge carrier is poorly estimated. In addition, the conventional Monte Carlo estimators have very high variances. Our approach aims {{to reduce the number of}} simulation steps that are spent in the low energy <b>problem</b> <b>regions.</b> We do this by identifying the <b>problem</b> <b>regions</b> via a stochastic watershed algorithm. We then use a coarsened state space model, where the <b>problem</b> <b>regions</b> are treated as single states. In this way, we are able to simulate a semi-Markov process on the coarsened state space. This results in estimators that are unbiased and have considerably lower variance than the crude Monte Carlo alternatives. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of the Australian (June 1972 –April 1985) and NOTOS (1957 – 62) gridded monthly-mean, mean sea level pressure datasets over Antarctica is examined by comparison with station data from 29 sites over the continent. After rejecting about 30 % of the months in both sets of gridded data, the remaining “good” months are used in a principal component motion technique to reconstruct gridded data from the station data for 1957 to 1985. The regression technique uses the “good” Australian data for calibration and verifies the statistical relationships developed between station and grid point pressure data with the “good” NOTOS data. The reconstructions are shown to be reliable over all of Antarctica between 60 ° and 75 °S except {{in the area to}} the east of the Ross Sea and adjacent areas of the southern Pacific Ocean. The reconstructions are used to compare the NOTOS data with the more recent Australian gridded pressure data. Major differences between the two datasets are found over eastern Antarctica and the extreme southern Pacific and adjacent areas of western Antarctica. The first <b>problem</b> <b>region</b> was found to be related to extrapolation of the NOTOS data beyond their region of reliability as defined by the original published maps. The second <b>problem</b> <b>region</b> has a 10 mb difference between the two datasets, with the NOTOS data higher than the Australian. As this is the region of poorest data coverage anywhere in the world, the difference is difficult to resolve. In contrast, comparisons with the Taljaard et al.

A composite dataset linking the Australian, NOTOS and the reconstructed data can be produced for the whole region except for the southern Pacific and wet Antarctic region. This extended dataset is used to examine changes in pressure patterns between the January 1957 –May 1972 and June 1972 –April 1985 periods. Some of the changes in temperature that have occurred over this period can be explained by changes in surface circulation patterns...|$|E

In {{order to avoid the}} problem of treating these methods separately and increasing the computational efficiency, a simultaneous color demosaicing and AWB scheme was proposed.

The gray edge assumption was used to achieve color constancy and a predefined achromatic region was used to avoid dominant color <b>problem.</b> <b>Region</b> adaptive color demosaicing was performed to improve the performance and the computational complexity. The experiments verified that the proposed method effectively suppressed color artifacts while preserving the details, texture, and fine structures in the images and showed well-white-balanced images. The results of the proposed algorithm indicate that it outperformed conventional algorithms in both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Moreover, the proposed algorithm was more computationally efficient than when the AWB method and color demosaicing were treated separately. The future research in this area include a new approach to combine other color demosaicing and AWB methods and experiments with other sensors to improve the algorithm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that using {{a set of}} cellular neural networks (CNNs) in parallel can achieve higher level information processing and reasoning functions either from application or bio-logics points of views. Such an integrated CNN system can solve more complex intelligent problems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for automatically constructing a multiple-CNN integrated neural system {{in the form of}} a recurrent fuzzy neural network. This system, called recurrent fuzzy CNN (RFCNN), can automatically learn its proper network structure and parameters simultaneously. The structure learning includes the fuzzy division of the problem domain and the creation of fuzzy rules and CNNs. The parameter learning includes the tuning of fuzzy membership functions and CNN templates. In the RFCNN, each learned fuzzy rule corresponds to a CNN. Hence, each CNN takes care of a fuzzily separated <b>problem</b> <b>region,</b> and the functions of all CNNs are inte-grated through the fuzzy inference mechanism. A new online adap-tive independent component analysis mixture-model technique is proposed for the structure learning of RFCNN, and the ordered-derivative calculus is applied to derive the recurrent learning rules of CNN templates in the parameter-learning phase. The proposed RFCNN provides a solution to the current dilemma on the decision of templates and/or fuzzy rules in the existing integrated (fuzzy) CNN systems. The capability of the proposed RFCNN is demon-strated on the real-world defect inspection problems. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective and promising.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the 19602 ̆ 7 s, Appalachia was rediscovered as a social <b>problem</b> <b>region.</b> Efforts of {{mainstream}} social scientists to explain the stubborn persistence of poverty and underdevelopment in Appalachia can be categorized as two types: the subculture of poverty model, and the regional development model. In response to the inadequacy of these models, and the social policy that followed from them, radical intellectuals and activists developed an internal colonialism model for the Central Appalachian region. In recent years substantial gains {{have been made in the}} theoretical and empirical investigation of neocolonialism, dependency, internal colonialism, advanced capitalism, and the capitalist world system. The resulting clarification of these concepts suggests that the analysis of Central Appalachia as an internal colony needs to be reconsidered, and a more adequate formulation developed. My conclusion is that Central Appalachia is best characterized as a peripheral region within an advanced capitalist society. Each of the three current models was first developed in the context of underdevelopment in the Third World, and later applied by analogy to the Appalachian case. I will suimmarize and criticize these models and argue for the alternative formulation suggested above. The question is more than academic. At issue are the goals and strategy of a movement for social change. Writers using the internal colonialism model have been ambiguous about what solution is appropriate for Appalachian problems. Taking the term 2 ̆ 2 colony 2 ̆ 2 in its strcngest sense, that of a suppressed nation, would prescribe an Appalachian nationalism aiming at secession and an independent nation-state. No one has proposed such a solution, although a weaker version [...] a state of Appalachia [...] has been mentioned. Nor have many sericusly suggested that the region would be better off if all the coal companies were owned by the local elite of 2 ̆ 2 hillbilly millionaires 2 ̆ 2 [...] a sort of bourgecis decolonization [...] instead of the national and international energy corporations, although an exclusive focus on absentee ownership might lead to that conclusion. If the heart of the problem is defined aF liivate ownership of the coal industry, then the possibility of public ownership, perhaps even limited to a regional basis, is suggested. If the problem is defined as capitalist relations of production generally, then the alternative [...] some form of socialism [...] takes on a dimension that goes far beyond the nationalization or Appalachianization of the coal industry alone. It is this challenge of defining socialist goals and strategies that is presented by the model of peripheral regions within an advanced capitalist society...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{techniques to}} utilize information theory, particularly entropy for enhancing data visualization and exploration. The ultimate goal with {{this work is}} to enable users to perceive as much as information available for recognizing objects, detecting regular or non-regular patterns and reducing user effort while executing the required tasks. We believe that the metrics to be set for enhancing computer generated visualizations should be quantifiable and that quantification should measure the information perception of the user. The proper way {{to solve this problem}} is utilizing information theory, particularly entropy. Entropy offers quantification of the information amount in a general communication system. In the communication model, information sender and information receiver are connected with a channel. We are inspired from this model and exploited it in a different way, namely we set the information sender as the data to be visualized, the information receiver as the viewer and the communication channel as the screen where the visualized image is displayed. In this thesis we explore the usage of entropy in three different visualization problems, -Enhancing the visualization of large scale social networks for better perception, -Finding the best representational images of a 3 D object to visually inspect with minimal loss of information, -Automatic navigation over a 3 D terrain with minimal loss of information. Visualization of large scale social networks is still a major challenge for information visualization researchers. When a thousand nodes are displayed on the screen with the lack of coloring, sizing and filtering mechanisms, the users generally do not perceive much on the first look. They usually use pointing devices or keyboard for zooming and panning to find the information that they are looking for. With this thesis we tried to present a visualization approach that uses coloring, sizing and filtering to help the users recognize the presented information. The second problem that we tried to tackle is finding the best representational images of 3 D models. This problem is highly subjective in cognitive manner. The best or good definitions do not depend on any metric or any quantification, furthermore, when the same image is presented to two different users it can be identified differently. However in this thesis we tried to map some metrics to best or good definitions for representational images, such as showing the maximum faces, maximum saliency or combination of both in an image. The third problem that we tried to find a solution is automatic terrain navigation with minimal loss of information. The information to be quantified on this problem is taken as the surface visibility of a terrain. However the visibility problem is changed with the heuristic that users generally focus on city centers, buildings and interesting points during terrain exploration. In order to improve the information amount at the time of navigation, we should focus on those areas. Hence we employed the road network data, and set the heuristic that intersections of road network segments are the residential places. In this <b>problem,</b> <b>region</b> extraction using road network data, viewpoint entropy for camera positions, and automatic camera path generation methods are investigated...|$|E
