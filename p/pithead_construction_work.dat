40|$|This {{paper offers}} a bidding {{strategy}} model {{for use by}} contractors {{as part of a}} more informed approach in selecting which contracts to bid for, and as a basis for determining the most appropriate mark-up level for various types and sizes of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client types. Regression analysis is used in measuring a contractor’s competitiveness between bids (by using the lowest bid / own bid ratio) and within bids (by using the lowest bid / cost estimate ratio) according to type and size of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client type. The model was tested on a large and reputable Hong Kong contractor. This particular contractor's bidding behaviour was found to be largely unaffected by type of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> but significantly affected by client type and size of <b>construction</b> <b>work.</b> Three quadratic models (regressing lowest bid / cost estimate on size of <b>construction</b> <b>work)</b> are also successfully developed for projects from the private sector, the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Housing Authority respectively...|$|R
