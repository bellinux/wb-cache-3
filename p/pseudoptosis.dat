40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the localization {{and severity of}} dermatochalasis and accompanying <b>pseudoptosis</b> with age. METHODS:One hundred and thirteen subjects with dermatochalasis {{were included in the}} study. Age, gender and body mass index(BMI) of the subjects were recorded. Palpebral fissure height(PFH) and marginal reflex distance(MRD) were measured in the primary position. The severity of dermatochalasis was assesed as Stage 1 : behind eyelid margin(minimum 1 mm); Stage 2 : inline with eyelid margin; Stage 3 : before eyelid margin. RESULTS: Mean age of the subjects were 52. 7 ± 8. 6 (range 32 to 74) y. Thirty-six cases(31. 9 %) were male and 77 (68. 1 %) were female. The mean BMI was 30. 3 ± 4. 7 (range 21. 5 to 36. 6) kg/m 2, mean PFH was 10. 7 ± 1. 6 (range 7 to 15) mm, mean MRD was 3. 8 ± 1. 2 (range 1 to 5) mm. In 30 (26. 5 %) of the subjects dermatochalasis was localized behind eyelid margin, in 38 (33. 6 %) it was inline with eyelid margin and in 45 (39. 8 %) it was before eyelid margin. There was <b>pseudoptosis</b> due to dermatochalasis in 50 (44. 2 %) of the subjects. Age was significantly different in terms of dermatochalasis severity. Mean ages of subjects with dermatochalasis localization behind or inline with eyelid margin(50. 3 ± 6. 6, 50. 5 ± 9. 5 y), were significantly lower than subjects with dermatochalasis localization before eyelid corner(56. 0 ± 8. 2 y). Mean age of subjects with <b>pseudoptosis</b> were significantly higher(56. 3 ± 8. 3 y), than subjects without it(49. 8 ± 7. 8 y). There was no BMI difference between the subjects in terms of dermatochalasis severity and presence of <b>pseudoptosis.</b> CONCLUSION:Dermatochalasis localization, severity and frequency of <b>pseudoptosis</b> increase with age...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acquired {{unilateral}} ptosis usually {{results from}} either levator palpebrae disinsertion, eyelid disorder, myasthenia gravis, mitochondrial myopathy, Horner's syndrome, or third nerve palsy. In rare cases, an orbital process {{is responsible for}} ptosis or <b>pseudoptosis.</b> HISTORY AND SIGNS: A healthy 31 -year-old patient complained for 6 months of right eyelid ptosis. On examination, there was 1 mm right upper eyelid ptosis and 1 mm of right enophthalmos. Upon downgaze, an apparent right eyelid retraction was present. Magnetic resonance imaging showed filling and retraction of the right maxillary sinus with inferior displacement of the right orbital floor. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Surgical management was performed with a favourable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Silent sinus syndrome is an asymptomatic chronic maxillary sinus atelectasis, resulting in ipsilateral enophthalmos, hypoglobus, and occasionally eyelid <b>pseudoptosis.</b> Silent sinus syndrome should be incorporated in the differential diagnosis of acquired unilateral ptosis...|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] A {{surgical}} technique {{has been developed}} {{in order to obtain}} ocular alignment in the primary position in patients with third nerve palsy. METHODS [...] A method for surgically correcting the vertical deviation and the <b>pseudoptosis</b> is described in three patients with longstanding third nerve palsy. By decreasing the ability of the non-involved eye to elevate, a fixation duress was created which eliminated the secondary deviation that characteristically occurs in such patients when the involved eye fixates. As a result of this technique, both eyes in all patients on attempted fixation were under similar duress, therefore requiring equal amounts of stimulation to move into the primary position. When the fixation duress was sufficient, elimination of the hypotropia and ptosis was achieved. Additionally, in order to correct the exotropia, generous recession and resection procedures in the involved eye and recession of the lateral rectus in the noninvolved eye were performed. RESULTS [...] Between 8 and 10 prism dioptres of esotropia were achieved and maintained in two patients. One patient had 20 prism dioptres of exotropia. Two patients had no residual ptosis and one required an additional anterior levator resection to achieve a satisfactory result. CONCLUSION [...] Patients with a third nerve palsy and a <b>pseudoptosis</b> may be candidates for this approach...|$|E
40|$|Background:. The {{inverted}} T/keyhole {{pattern is}} commonly used for large breast reductions. This technique relies on the breast skin to retain the shape. With {{the passage of time}} “fallout” (<b>pseudoptosis)</b> occurs impairing the cosmetic result. A technique is described that uses parenchymal sutures and inframammary fold (IMF) reinforcement sutures to maintain the intraoperative shape. Methods:. A retrospective study of 25 consecutive patients (50 breasts) where the IMF was reinforced and parenchymal sutures were inserted. The patients were followed up and the nipple to notch and nipple to IMF distance was measured and compared with that marked preoperatively and set intraoperatively. Complications, especially T junction breakdown, were also recorded. Results:. The mean age was 38 years (range, 16 – 62 years) with a mean follow-up of 12 months. The mean body mass index was 31 (range, 22 – 41). The mean mass of tissue excised was 925 [*]g (range, 340 – 1, 800 [*]g) per side. The distance from the suprasternal notch to the nipple remained unchanged. The distance from the nipple to the IMF remained the same as that marked preoperatively except in 3 patients who developed <b>pseudoptosis.</b> Only 3 patients had wound dehiscence. Conclusion:. Parenchymal and superficial fascial system sutures combined with IMF reinforcement contributes to maintaining the aesthetic result and decreasing complications, in weight stable patients...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: According to Hering's law, the induced palsy of an extraocular muscle {{will result}} in an {{increased}} innervational flow to this muscle {{as well as to}} its contralateral synergist. A retroequatorial myopexy (Cüppers Faden Operation), with or without muscle recession, can be considered as an iatrogenic palsy. METHODS: Two patients, aged 16 and 5 years respectively, presented with hypotropia, the deviated eye showing limited ocular movements in elevation and <b>pseudoptosis</b> of the upper eye lid. Both patients underwent surgery, this consisting of a posterior fixation and recession of the superior rectus of the sound eye. RESULTS: After surgery, both cases showed a stable improvement of the opening of the palpebral fissure and of the vertical deviation.

40|$|Background: A major {{advantage}} of vertical scar reduction mammaplasty is the improved long-term {{projection of the}} breasts. In their experience with more than 1700 cases, the authors have observed the following important trends: Postoperatively, the nipple-areola complex is located higher than one would predict from the preoperative skin markings, and <b>pseudoptosis</b> does not occur. This study was performed to provide objective measurements to confirm these observations. Methods: Forty-nine consecutive women had the following measurements taken of their right breast preoperatively and on postoperative day 5 : distance from the clavicle to the superior border of the nipple-areola complex; the clavicle to the nipple; and the inframammary crease to the inferior border of the nipple-areola complex. Forty-six women were available for follow-up at 4 years, and measurements were repeated.

Autologous dermal sling with wise pattern skin {{reducing}} mastectomy allows one-stage implant reconstruction {{in women}} with large and ptotic breasts needing mastectomy for cancer or risk reduction. However, this technique is not suitable for women who lack ptosis and also carries risk of T-junction breakdown. Method. We have performed one-stage nipple sparing mastectomies with implant reconstruction in 5 women (8 breasts) by modifying the autologous dermal sling approach. All these women had small to moderate breasts with no ptosis or <b>pseudoptosis.</b> Results. Three women had bilateral procedures, two underwent bilateral mastectomies simultaneously, and one had contralateral risk reduction surgery {{a year after the}} cancer side operation. All women underwent direct to implant reconstruction with implant volumes varying from 320 to 375 [*]cc. There were no implant losses and only one required further surgery to excise the nipple for positive nipple shaves. A low complication rate was encountered in this series with good aesthetic outcome.

Methods: A retrospective review was performed of eight patients presenting with ptosis and hypotropia to oculoplastic service. All patients underwent full ocular evaluation and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} of brain and orbit. Five of these patients underwent stepwise correction of hypotropia by single-stage adjustable strabismus surgery (SSASS), followed by a frontalis sling if needed. Results: Eight patients had congenital strabismus with severe ptosis and a positive forced duction test. There was a highly significant improvement from preoperative mean hypotropia angle of 30 prism diopters (PD) to 9 PD mean postoperative angle (P = 0. 006). Surgery for ptosis was not needed in 80 % of eyes. Conclusion: CFEOM involving both ptosis and hypotropia could be properly managed with the correct sequence of surgical steps.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of an upper eyelid mass induced by a rigid contact lens {{retained}} for more than 3 years {{in the eye of}} a patient with a general history of keloids and to provide {{a review of the literature}} on retained contact lenses. Methods: Case report. Results: A 45 -year-old woman with an ophthalmologic history of dry eyes and follicular chronic conjunctivitis presented at our department complaining of irritation, mucous discharge, and contact lens intolerance in her left eye. The ophthalmic examination revealed a visual acuity of 20 / 20 in both eyes and bilateral blepharitis. A <b>pseudoptosis</b> and an impressive mass growing from the superior tarsal conjunctiva with a lot of mucous discharge were present in the left eye. After a delay of 3. 5 years with persisting complaints, a double lid eversion revealed the presence of a hard contact lens retained in the deep fornix of the left eye. After removing the lens and a short period of treatment with local corticosteroids, the mass and the symptoms disappeared. Conclusions: in patients who wear or wore contact lenses and present with one-sided chronic irritation and tissue proliferation, the possibility of a retained contact lens should be considered. The previous history of dry eyes and chronic conjunctivitis led us to miss the diagnosis at the first visits, despite persisting complaints.

In augmentation mammoplasty, organ function must be preserved. Indications for the best tissue plane for coverage of silicone implants and association with mastopexy can be challenging. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate a series of cases of mastopexy {{associated with}} silicone implants. Methods: A retros-pective descriptive study was performed in patients who underwent mastopexy at the Plastic Surgery Unit of the Hospital Daher Lago Sul (Brasília, DF, Brazil). From July 2008 to July 2011, 243 patients with a mean age of 31. 4 years underwent surgery. In 149 patients, the subglandular technique was used and in 94 patients, the submuscular technique was used. Implant volume ranged from 150 mL to 400 mL. Results: There were 174 cases of combined procedures. Four patients who underwent surgery using the subglandular technique developed capsular contracture (grade II). We followed up 7 cases of <b>pseudoptosis</b> with the submuscular technique and 14 cases of mammary ptosis with the subglandular technique. Eight patients experienced a mobile implant resulting from muscle activity. The reoperation rate was 6. 58 %.

Generally accepted that, new modifications are the results of improvements of existing techniques. In this study we present a new modification of Moufarrege total posterior pedicle mammaplasty. We performed central plication to achieve a juvenile look in the superior pole of the breast and to prevent postoperative <b>pseudoptosis</b> and used central U shaped flap to achieve maximum NAC safety and to preserve lactation and nipple sensation. Sixty-nine patients were operated with the above mentioned tech-nique. Out of 69 patients, 52 underwent reduction mammaplasty (11 had gigantomastia), eleven mastopexy, and six oncoplastic. All of the patients were satisfied with functional and aesthetic results and none of them had major complications such as total NAC loss.

40|$|Palpebral ptosis {{indicates}} the abnormal drooping {{of the upper}} lid, caused by partial or total reduction in levator muscle function. It {{may be caused by}} various pathologies, both congenital and acquired. Based on a review of the available literature and on our own clinical experience, a classification is proposed as well as a differential diagnosis between ptosis and <b>pseudoptosis.</b> Some basic surgical guidelines related to age of onset and etiopathogenesis are drawn. Ptosis is divided into neurogenic, myogenic, aponeurotic, and mechanical. The aim of surgery is two fold: functional, to correct the limit in the visual field; and also aesthetic. From January 2000 to January 2004, 42 patients were referred and treated at the Unit of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery-Centre for Orbital Pathology and Surgery, Hospital and University, Ferrara, Italy. Of these, 12 cases were congenital and 30 acquired (13 were monolateral and 29 bilateral, for a total of 71 cases). The most widely used surgical techniques were levator muscle recession and frontalis suspension. In congenital forms, these techniques were often associated with techniques to correct oculo-muscular imbalance (i. e., strabismus). Seventy-one upper eyelids were treated, 5 of which were mild, 35 moderate, and 31 severe. Regarding levator muscle function, 60 were fair and 11 poor. Surgical treatment followed the indications and timing with good morphologic and aesthetic results. Complications included two cases of hypocorrection, two asymmetries, and two cases of hypercorrection. Surgical treatment of palpebral ptosis is complex and requires precise diagnosis and indications for surgery related to clinical examination and pathogenesis. Even if these indications are strictly followed, in some cases, the outcomes are unpredictable...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inferior rectus recession, Knapp procedure, partial tendon transposition, and {{combined}} procedure are different surgical {{procedures in the}} management of monocular elevation deficiency (MED). Only a few studies have been published on the management of this problem. In this study, we report our experience with patients with MED focusing on the indications and types of surgery in the south of Iran. Methods: In this case series, a computerized database review on 4773 patients with strabismus was performed and 18 patients diagnosed as having MED who had undergone strabismus surgery were enrolled. Results: Of the 18 patients, 13 had only hypotropia and 5 had horizontal deviation as well. Preoperative vertical deviation was between 15 and 60 prism diopter (mean±SD= 25. 8 ± 10. 7 PD). Fourteen patients had positive forced duction test on elevation. Seventeen patients had ptosis twelve of them had true ptosis and the remaining 5 had <b>pseudoptosis).</b> The mean postoperative follow-up was 24. 4 months. Four patients underwent Knapp procedure, 12 patients underwent inferior rectus recession, and for 2 patients a combined procedure was performed. The mean postoperative hypotropia was 6. 1 ± 7. 9 PD. Twelve out of the 18 patients were corrected to within five PD of orthophoria and no one was found with overcorrection. Conclusion: Although MED is etiologically multifactorial, satisfactory surgical results can be achieved by judicious selection of the surgical technique {{based on the results of}} the forced duction test.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies on reduction mammaplasty and its modifications in the literature. The multitude of modifications of reduction mammaplasty indicates that the ideal technique {{has yet to be}} found. There are four reasons for seeking the ideal technique. One reason is to preserve functional features of the breast: breastfeeding and arousal. Other reasons are to achieve the real geometric and aesthetic shape of the breast with the least scar and are to minimize complications of prior surgical techniques without causing an additional complication. Last reason is the limitation of the techniques described before. To these aims, we developed a new versatile reduction mammaplasty technique, which we called conical plicated central U shaped (COPCUs) mammaplasty. Methods We performed central plication to achieve a juvenile look in the superior pole of the breast and to prevent postoperative <b>pseudoptosis</b> and used central U shaped flap to achieve maximum NAC safety and to preserve lactation and nipple sensation. The central U flap was 6 cm in width and the superior conical plication was performed with 2 / 0 PDS. Preoperative and postoperative standard measures of the breast including the superior pole fullness were compared. Results Forty six patients were operated with the above mentioned technique. All of the patients were satisfied with functional and aesthetic results and none of them had major complications. There were no changes in the nipple innervation. Six patients becoming pregnant after surgery did not experience any problems with lactation. None of the patients required scar revision. Conclusion Our technique is a versatile, safe, reliable technique which creates the least scar, avoids previously described disadvantages, provides maximum preservation of functions, can be employed in all breasts regardless of their sizes. </p...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundTo review our {{management}} of common venous malformation (VM) affecting the orbit and/or periorbital area. MethodsConsecutive patients with orbital and/or periorbital VM were identified from our vascular anomalies database. Demographic {{details of the}} patients, anatomic site(s) affected, symptoms and signs, presence of {{a family history of}} VM, and types of treatment(s) were collected, supplemented by chart review. ResultsA total of 24 patients’ age 1 – 68 (mean, 30) years with orbital and/or periorbital VM presented with cosmetic concerns (n[*]=[*] 17, 71 %), distensibility (n[*]=[*] 15, 63 %), pain (n[*]=[*] 9, 38 %), diplopia (n[*]=[*] 4, 17 %), and spontaneous thrombosis (n[*]=[*] 1, 8 %). The VM caused globe dystopia (n[*]=[*] 13, 54 %), enophthalmos (n[*]=[*] 6, 25 %), proptosis (n[*]=[*] 3, 12 %), exotropia (n[*]=[*] 3, 12 %), and <b>pseudoptosis</b> with visual obstruction (n[*]=[*] 3, 13 %). A total of 11 (46 %) patients were managed conservatively. 13 (54 %) patients underwent active treatment. Ethanol sclerotherapy (ES) was performed in six patients with extensive facial VM associated with orbital/periorbital involvement, resulting in symptomatic improvement in five patients, one of whom developed skin necrosis and another patient developed reduced infraorbital nerve sensation. Surgery was performed for localized lesion (n[*]=[*] 3, 23 %), for extensive lesions (n[*]=[*] 4, 31 %) and as an adjunct to ES (n[*]=[*] 6, 46 %) resulting in symptomatic improvement in all patients. One patient required correction of lower lid ectropion. ConclusionOrbital and/or periorbital VMs are heterogeneous, and management needs to be individualized. Surgery is used for localized lesions aiming for complete excision, as a debulking procedure for extensive orbital/periorbital VM when ES was not possible, or following ES for extensive facial VM with orbital and/or periorbital involvement...|$|E

Twenty-three of the patients were nonsmokers, 1 smoker and 1 patient's smoking status was not mentioned. Eighteen patients presented with grade I capsular contracture, 3 patients with grade II contracture and 4 patients had a combination of grade I and II capsular contracture. <b>Pseudoptosis</b> was present in 6, class B ptosis in 6, A/B ptosis in 3, water-down deformity in 5 and rippling in 5 patients. Average preoperative size of implant used initially was 334. 4 mL (range: 250 - 340 mL) and the mean implant size selected for revision surgery was 416 mL (range: 260 - 525 mL). Mean follow-up time was 18 months (range: 6 - 48 months). Of 25 patients, 21 had a bilateral procedure whereas the technique was used unilaterally in 4 patients for the correction of asymmetry. All patients had a single dose of intravenous antibiotics and followed by an oral course for 5 days, there was no infection noted in the series. In the current series, no patient required revision surgery following the multiplane internal mastopexy. Conclusion: Multiplane internal mastopexy can be useful in selected cases of revisionary augmentation mammoplasty...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Thirty-one {{patients}} {{presented for}} surgical correction of unilateral hypotropia {{of the globe}} and blepharoptosis. The hypotropia and <b>pseudoptosis</b> were corrected by Knapp procedures. The Bell's phenomenon was thereby improved, allowing safe correction of the true ptosis, generally by an anterior levator resection whose magnitude depended on measured levator function. The association of unilateral ptosis and hypotropia of the globe arises {{in a number of}} clinical situations, most commonly in congenital double elevator palsy. Their surgical correction was approached by Beard,' who found double elevator palsy in 6 % of his cases of unilateral congenital ptoses. He noted levator resec-tion was less effective where superior rectus weak-ness coexisted, and recommended an additional 4 mm approximately of levator resection. He approached the correction of hypotropia by superior rectus resection and inferior rectus recession with release of the lower lid retractors. Knapp ' subse-quently described transposition of the horizontal rectus tendons to that of the superior rectus. This improved the position of the globe and its elevation. Scott and Jackson, recognised, by forced duction tests, that inferior rectus restriction plays a part in some cases and advocated recession of the muscle with release of the lower lid retractors. This was not combined in their work with the Knapp procedure as they feared anterior segment ischaemia. Callahan' modified the approach (to reduce the risk of ischaemia) by routinely recessing the inferior rectus combining this with a Jensen ' style procedure, in which the active horizontal rectus muscles were split and half of each muscle was sutured to the weak superior rectus. Lee, Collin, and Timms " recommend that a forced duction test is done initially. If the eye moves freely, a Knapp procedure alone is done. If there is limitation, the inferior rectus muscle is recessed, and this is combined with a Knapp procedure except in those cases considered to be at risk of ischaemia, that is, those patients over 25 years of age or with a large globe, in whom they do a Callahan procedure...|$|E
