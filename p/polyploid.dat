5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the <b>polyploid</b> complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to <b>polyploid</b> ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the <b>polyploid</b> complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E
5|$|Functional {{genomics}} using RNAi is {{a particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are <b>polyploid,</b> which presents substantial challenges for more traditional genetic engineering methods.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of polyploidy among flowering plants {{has long been}} recognized, and recent studies have uncovered multiple ancient polyploidization events in the evolutionary history of several angiosperm lineages. Once <b>polyploids</b> are formed they must get locally established and then propagate and survive while adapting to different environments and avoiding extinction. This might ultimately lead to their long-term evolutionary success, where their descendant lineages survive for {{tens of millions of}} years. Along this road to evolutionary success, <b>polyploids</b> must overcome several obstacles, to which several genetic and ecological factors are likely to contribute. One recurrent observation, based on present-day <b>polyploids,</b> has been the high frequency of <b>polyploids</b> in harsh environments. Also, recent studies proposed that the success of certain ancient <b>polyploids</b> might be linked to periods of climatic change. Although we are still {{in the early stages of}} unraveling the factors that resulted in the long-term evolutionary success of ancient <b>polyploids,</b> the advances in genomic sequencing and molecular dating methods promise to enhance our understanding. It, therefore, seems timely to review our current knowledge of what determines the success of <b>polyploids.</b> Here, we discuss especially how harsh conditions or periods of climatic change might affect the rate of formation, establishment, persistence and long-term evolutionary success of <b>polyploids</b> in angiosperms...|$|R

5|$|Plant Hybridization is more commonplace {{compared}} to animal hybridization. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the <b>polyploid</b> wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are <b>polyploid</b> (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are <b>polyploid</b> (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{species of}} the genus Cucurbita {{were present in the}} Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the New World. The likely center of origin is {{southern}} Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating back only to the Holocene, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, in the shape of seeds similar to Bryonia, dates to the Paleocene. No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. C.moschata can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become <b>polyploid.</b> The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene nad1 show there were at least six independent domestication events of Cucurbita separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include C.digitata (calabazilla), and C.foetidissima (buffalo gourd), C.palmata (coyote melon), and C.pepo. Some species, such as C.digitata and C.ficifolia, are referred to as gourds. Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa. Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe.|$|E

40|$|Polyploidy—the {{increase}} in the number of whole chromosome sets—is an important evolutionary force in eukaryotes. Polyploidy is well recognized throughout the evolutionary history of plants and animals, where several ancient events have been hypothesized to be drivers of major evolutionary radiations. However, fungi provide a striking contrast: while numerous recent <b>polyploids</b> have been documented, ancient fungal polyploidy is virtually unknown. We present a survey of known fungal <b>polyploids</b> that confirms the absence of ancient fungal polyploidy events. Three hypotheses may explain this finding. First, ancient fungal <b>polyploids</b> are indeed rare, with unique aspects of fungal biology providing similar benefits without genome duplication. Second, fungal <b>polyploids</b> are not successful in the long term, leading to few extant species derived from ancient polyploidy events. Third, ancient fungal <b>polyploids</b> are difficult to detect, causing the real contribution of polyploidy to fungal evolution to be underappreciated. We consider each of these hypotheses in turn and propose that failure to detect ancient events is the most likely reason for the lack of observed ancient fungal <b>polyploids.</b> We examine whether existing data can provide evidence for previously unrecognized ancient fungal polyploidy events but discover that current resources are too limited. We contend that establishing whether unrecognized ancient fungal polyploidy events exist is important to ascertain whether polyploidy has played a key role in the evolution of the extensive complexity and diversity observed in fungi today and, thus, whether polyploidy is a driver of evolutionary diversifications across eukaryotes. Therefore, we conclude by suggesting ways to test the hypothesis that there are unrecognized polyploidy events in the deep evolutionary history of the fungi...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Taraxacum is shortly discussed and {{attention is paid to}} the significance of the taxonomical and phytogeographical studies of Professor Van Soest. The mode of reproduction and the occurrence of sexuality and hybridization in Europe is described. The results of an investigation of sexuality in about 70 populations found in the northern parts of Switzerland and Austria and {{in the southern part of}} Germany (B. R. D.) are concisely reported. It appears that sexuals are of common occurrence in this area and that there is a transitional zone from about Stuttgart to Passau in which the diploids in the populations are gradually replaced by <b>polyploids.</b> The diploids belong to the section Vulgaria and include a great number of forms. It is unknown whether these forms are the products of hybridization or if they indeed belong to genetically isolated (micro) species. The causes of the distribution of the diploid sexuals are unknown. They appear to have a slight preference for less disturbed habitats as compared with the <b>polyploids.</b> The transition from the diploids to <b>polyploids</b> in the populations may be caused by a more intensive agriculture in the area concerned and by climatic factors and may be influenced by historic phytogeographical factors.
