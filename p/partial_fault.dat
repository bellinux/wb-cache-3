We also present effective heuristics to determine some of the redundant faults and to derive the test vectors for some PI faults, by the use of implication relations.

These applications are assembled as dataflow graphs, where each vertex of the graph is a stream operator and each edge is a stream connection. In this environment, a fault in a stream operator can result in massive data loss or in the generation of inaccurate results. Most of the fault tolerance solutions proposed for streaming applications aim at guaranteeing that no data is lost or that no data item is delivered to the application more than once. These techniques result in high performance overhead, given the need to coordinate the state stored in checkpoints of distributed components or maintain consistency between replicas. In this dissertation, we investigate <b>partial</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance methods, which protect only the most critical stream operators of a streaming application. These methods {{take advantage of the}} fact that stream processing algorithms are approximate by nature and, as a result, can still achieve acceptable results under data loss and duplicate data delivery. The methods proposed in this dissertation include a checkpoint-based mechanism and a partial graph replication technique. Both techniques were implemented in System S, IBM Research's stream processing middleware. In addition, this dissertation describes two different fault tolerance evaluation techniques. The first technique is based on fault injection and is used to emulate the effects of <b>partial</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance on a streaming application. With the fault injection results, the developers can understand the impact of faults on the application output and identify the most critical operators on their streaming application. The second evaluation technique is a model-based framework which provides generic abstractions for representing streaming applications with the stochastic activity network formalism. The framework allows the comparison of different fault tolerance techniques under varying fault models.

However, selecting a circuit subset that minimizes both the area overhead and the vulnerability to faults remains an open topic. Area-Constrained <b>Partial</b> <b>Fault</b> Tolerance (ACPFT) is a unique approach that explicitly accepts the device resources as an input and attempts to find a maximally fault-tolerant subset within this constraint.

40|$|Abstract. Endothelial {{cells are}} {{responsible}} for the formation of the capillary blood vessel network. We describe a system of endothelial cells by means of two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of point-like particles. Cells ’ motion is governed by the gradient of the concentration of a chemical substance that they produce (chemotaxis). The typical time of degradation of the chemical substance introduces a characteristic length in the system. We show that point-like model cells form network resembling structures tuned by this characteristic length, before collapsing altogether. Successively, we improve the non-realistic point-like model cells by introducing an isotropic strong repulsive force between them and a velocity dependent force mimicking the observed peculiarity of endothelial cells to preserve the direction of their motion (persistence). This more realistic model does not show a clear network formation. We ascribe this <b>partial</b> <b>fault</b> in reproducing the experiments to the static geometry of our model cells that, in reality, change their shapes by elongating toward neighboring cells...|$|E

This thesis work develops an applicable procedure for a FDD scheme to both fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in the discrete-time stochastic domain based on the Kalman filter techniques. In particular, the proposed techniques are developed in highly nonlinear and 6 degree-of-freedom equations of Matlab/Simulink simulation environment for a quad-rotor helicopter UAV, a Boeing 747, and a NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) fixed-wing UAV. A key development in this thesis is that an Adaptive Two-Stage Extended Kalman Filter (ATSEKF) algorithm and a Dual Unscented Kalman Filter (DUKF) algorithm are applied for simultaneous states and fault parameters estimation of these UAVs. The statistical decision-making techniques for fault detection and diagnosis are also discussed in the presence of <b>partial</b> <b>faults</b> in the UAVs.
