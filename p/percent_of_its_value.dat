2500|$|At {{the moment}} of Ptolemy XII's restoration, Roman {{creditors}} demanded the repayment of their loans, but the Alexandrian treasury could not repay the king's debt. Learning from previous mistakes, Ptolemy XII shifted popular resentment of tax increases from the king to a Roman, his main creditor Gaius Rabirius Postumus, whom he appointed Dioiketes (minister of finance). So Rabirius was placed in charge of debt repayment. Perhaps Gabinius had also put pressure on Ptolemy XII to appoint Rabirius, who had now {{direct access to the}} financial resources of Egypt but exploited the land too much. The king had to imprison Rabirius to protect his life from the angry people. Then he allowed him to escape. The Roman immediately left Egypt and went back to Rome {{at the end of the}} year 54 BC. There he was accused de repetundis, but defended by Cicero and he was probably acquitted. [...] Ptolemy, also, permitted a debasing of the coinage as an attempt to repay the loans.
