In this configuration, three different arrangement designs of piezoelectric power generation devices were put and compared for obtaining a greater produced output power. Evidence shows that the Sample 2 among the three different arrangement stackable piezoelectric power generation devices could avoid damage to the PZT- 5 H and achieve a highest instantaneous output power (5. 175 mW). Moreover, to establish the high efficiency energy storage system, using low power buck converter IC (LTC 3588 - 1) was proposed. The obtained results show that a 15 mAh Ni-MH battery could be fully-charged within two hours by utilizing the optimal arrangement design stackable <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>device</b> combining with micropower energy storage system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{usefulness}} of most high technology {{devices such as}} cell phones, computers, and sensors {{is limited by the}} storage capacity of batteries. In the future, these limitations will become more pronounced as the demand for wireless power outpaces battery development which is already nearly optimized. Thus, new <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> techniques are required {{for the next generation of}} wearable computers, wireless sensors, and autonomous systems to be feasible. Piezoelectric materials are excellent <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>devices</b> because of their ability to couple mechanical and electrical properties. For example, when an electric field is applied to piezoelectric a strain is generated and the material is deformed. Consequently, when a piezoelectric is strained it produces an electric field; therefore, piezoelectric materials can convert ambient vibration into electrical <b>power.</b> <b>Piezoelectric</b> materials have long been used as sensors and actuators; however their use as electrical generators is less established. A <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>power</b> generator has great potential for some remote applications such as in vivo sensors, embedded MEMS devices, and distributed networking. Developing piezoelectric generators is challenging because of their poor source characteristics (high voltage, low current, high impedance) and relatively low power output. This paper presents a theoretical analysis to increase the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> that is verified with experimental results.

One important way to settle the energy shortage is to develop new energy <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> technology.
