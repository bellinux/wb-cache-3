On both a scheduled and event-driven basis, Pneuron executes configured workflows to <b>pull</b> <b>current</b> inventory from both internal and partner/distributor systems to gather up-to-the minute inventory information (quantities, models) which allows an accurate valuation calculation. Further by analyzing trending and forecasted consumption, Pneuron triggers a replenishment order to various internal and distributor systems to avoid running out of stock.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how supply-side policies {{may play a}} role in …ghting a low aggregate demand that traps an economy at the zero lower bound (ZLB) of nominal interest rates. Future increases in productivity or reductions in markups triggered by supply-side policies generate a wealth e¤ect that <b>pulls</b> <b>current</b> consumption and output up. Since the economy is at the ZLB, increases in the interest rates do not undo this wealth e¤ect, as we will have in the case outside the ZLB. We illustrate this mechanism with a simple two-period New Keynesian model. We discuss possible objections to this set of policies and the relation of supply-side policies with more conventional monetary and …scal policies...|$|R

40|$|Nonradiative {{recombination}} {{and other}} heat generation processes affect both {{the performance and}} lifetime characteristics of semiconductor diode lasers. This {{is especially true for}} high-power devices, where facet heating due to nonradiative recombination can lead to catastrophic optical damage (COD). Here we present for the first time temperature measurements of a semiconductor laser in which the surface temperature profile (and hence the current density profile) of the laser is measured as it evolves in time. The laser studied is a λ= 1. 55 μm 1 -cm-long InGaAsP/InP watt-class slab-coupled optical waveguide laser (SCOWL). The ridge width of the SCOWLs examined here is approximately 5 μm. Temperature measurements are taken using multiple microthermocouples with sizes less than 20 μm. Surface temperature fluctuations in time are seen to be quite large, as high as 20 % of the total temperature increase of the device. Time-resolved measurements allow us to see both positive correlation (in which the temperature rises at the same time across an area of the device) as well as negative correlation (in which part of the device gets hot {{at the same time as}} another part of the device gets cold). Negative correlations are likely due to facet heating processes which cause bandgap shrinkage and hence increased current flow to a facet, <b>pulling</b> <b>current</b> away from the center of the device. Time-resolved measurements of the surface temperature profile therefore show promise as a non-destructive method for characterizing the failure mechanisms of a laser, as facet damage over time is otherwise very difficult to measure before the COD runaway process destroys the device.

50|$|When {{mains voltage}} TRIACs are {{triggered}} by microcontrollers, optoisolators are frequently used; for example optotriacs {{can be used}} to control the gate current. Alternatively, where safety allows and electrical isolation of the controller isn't necessary, one of the microcontroller's power rails may be connected one of the mains supply. In these situations it is normal to connect the neutral terminal to the positive rail of the microcontroller's power supply, together with A1 of the triac, with A2 connected to the live. The TRIAC's gate can be connected through an opto-isolated transistor, and sometimes a resistor to the microcontroller, so that bringing the voltage down to the microcontroller's logic zero <b>pulls</b> enough <b>current</b> through the TRIAC's gate to trigger it. This ensures that the TRIAC is triggered in quadrants II and III and avoids quadrant IV where TRIACs are typically insensitive.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) {{live streaming}} using unstructured mesh, packet scheduling {{is an important}} factor on overall playback delay. The hybrid pull-push approach has been recently proposed to reduce delay compared to classical pulling method. In this approach, video are divided into substreams and packets are pushed with low delay. There has been little work addressing the scheduling problem on substream assignment. In this paper, we study the scheduling problem on assigning substreams to minimize packet delay. Given heterogeneous contents, delays and bandwidths of parents, we formulate the Substream Assignment (SA) problem to assign substreams to parents with minimum delay. The SA problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time by transforming it into a Max-Weighted Bipartite Matching problem. Simulation results show that our distributed algorithm achieves substantially lower delay as compared with traditional <b>pull</b> and <b>current</b> hybrid pull-push approaches based on greedy algorithm.

40|$|Hair pulling {{disorder}} (HPD; trichotillomania) {{is thought}} to be associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity and functional impairment. However, few methodologically rigorous studies of HPD have been conducted, rendering such conclusions tenuous. The following study examined comorbidity and psychosocial functioning in a well-characterized sample of adults with HPD (N= 85) who met DSM-IV criteria, had at least moderate hair pulling severity, and participated in a clinical trial. Results revealed that 38. 8 % of individuals with HPD had another current psychiatric diagnosis and 78. 8 % had another lifetime (present and/or past) psychiatric diagnosis.

40|$|The United States has {{experienced}} rising immigration levels and changing source since the 1950 s. The changes in source {{have been attributed}} to the 1965 Amendments to the Immigration Act that abolished country-quotas and replaced them with a system that emphasized family reunification.

Given this view, it seems all the more remarkable that the sources of immigration changed so dramatically. This paper isolates the economic and demographic fundamentals that determined immigration rates by source from 1971 to 1998 ? income, education, demographic composition and inequality. The paper also allows for persistence - big US foreign-born stocks implying a strong 'friends and neighbors' <b>pull</b> on <b>current</b> immigrant flows. Specific policy variables are included which are derived directly from the quotas allocated to different visa categories. Parameter estimates from the panel data are then used to implement counterfactual simulations that serve to isolate the effects of immigration policy as well as source-country economic and demographic conditions...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that the interocean exchange south of Africa is an important link in the global overturning circulation of the ocean, the so‐called ocean conveyer belt. At this location, warm and salty Indian Ocean waters enter the South Atlantic and are <b>pulled</b> by <b>currents</b> that eventually reach the North Atlantic, where water cools and sinks. A major contributor to the exchange is the frequent shedding of ring eddies from the termination of the Agulhas Current south of the tip of Africa.
