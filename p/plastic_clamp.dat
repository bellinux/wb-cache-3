40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the long-term results of adult circumcisions performed by <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp</b> technique {{as well as}} the effects on sexual function. Materials and Methods: A total of 186 adult males with the mean age of 21. 2 ± 2. 8 years who presented to our clinic for circumcision between February 2007 and January 2010 were included in the study. Safety and acceptability of circumcision with <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp</b> technique as well as its effects on sexual functions were analyzed with a mean follow-up period of 30. 4 ± 14. 2 months (range, 12 to 52 months). Results: The mean duration of circumcision and removal of the clamp were 3. 1 ± 1. 1 minutes and 16 ± 7 seconds, respectively. The total complication rate was 2. 15 %. Wound dehiscence (1. 07 %), infection (0. 54 %), and bleeding (0. 54 %) were the encountered complications. Complete wound healing was observed at a mean of 25. 5 ± 4. 6 days. We did not encounter any penile deformity or other long-term complications. Circumcision did not adversely affect the sexual drive or ejaculation based on the brief male sexual function inventory scores. Erectile function and overall satisfaction improved following circumcision. Conclusion: Circumcision performed by <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp</b> technique in adult males had a low early complication rate with no long-term complications and caused improvement in some of the sexual functions. We suggest the utilization of this technique as an easy and a safe way of circumcising adult males...|$|E

3000|$|A {{method for}} calculating <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp</b> force from {{tightening}} torque was presented by considering a bi-linear model obtained from experimental tightening torque-clamp force relationships. The practical {{applicability of the}} calculation method was verified by tightening tests of Cryptomeria japonica-bolted joints using metal washers of various sizes. Results were as follows: {{it was found that}} a ratio of side-length (diameter) to thickness of metal washers ranging from 7.8 to 16.0 did not affect the torque coefficient. In addition, the ratio of maximum plastic torque coefficient to maximum elastic torque coefficient, γmax and the ratio of minimum plastic torque coefficient to minimum elastic torque coefficient, γmin, which are elements of the calculation method, tended to increase depending on embedment into timber of metal washers in side-length (diameter) to thickness ratios of 10.0 (washer size 32 [*]×[*]t 3.2  mm), 10.9 (washer size 35 [*]×[*]t 3.2  mm) and 7.8 (washer size 35 [*]×[*]t 4.5  mm). Furthermore, calculated tightening torque values were verified by tightening tests using a digital torque wrench. As a result, <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp</b> force values obtained by experiment agreed with calculated values ranging from minimum clamp force F [...]...|$|E

40|$|Bilateral {{constriction}} of the carotid sinus area by a <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp,</b> with {{reduction of}} the palpable pulse of the sinus and the internal carotid artery, produced a significant, sustained increase in ar-terial blood pressure of unknown patliogenesis in the dog. THE production of a high level, sustainedneurogenic hypertension as a result ofbuffer nerve section is well established. Attempts to produce neurogenic hypertension by successive ligation. of the carotid and ver-tebral arteries (and later developing collaterals) have at best led to a mild, inconstant hyper-tension 1 • 2 similar to that obtained with renal manipulations prior to the classic experiment of Goldblatt. Attempts to confirm the produc-tion of hypertension by the intracisternal injection of Kaolin suspension in dogs have been unsuccessful. 3 ' 4 Ten years ago, one of us (G. E. W.) placed constricting Goldblatt clamps bilaterally on the common carotid arteries (above the thyroid artery) of two renal hypertensive dogs whereby a palpable pulse ratio of 3 : 1 between the artery caudal and oral to the clamp was obtained. These dogs showed increases in mean blood pressure of 25 and 35 mm. Hg, respectively, but the blood pressure returned to previous hypertensive levels {{after a period of}} two weeks, possibly because col-lateral circulation had re-established former pressure-flow relationships in the carotid sinus and internal carotid artery. More recently, Taylor and Page 5 reported that the additive effects of "ischemia " of the brain and me-chanical and thermal stimulation produced neurogenic hypertension lasting for periods o...|$|E
40|$|Bilateral {{constriction}} of the carotid sinus area, {{the immediate}} arterial {{branches of the}} sinus, or (perhaps) the vertebral arteries, and bilateral resection of the carotid sinus produces a significant, persistent hypertension in dogs, the highest levels occurring in the carotid sinus area constricted dogs. Pathogenesis is still unsettled. IN. 1954 our research group reported thatmodest to high level, persistent hyperten-sions could be produced in dogs by bilateral constriction of the carotid sinus area {{by means of a}} <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp</b> which reduced the volume pulse of the sinus and the internal carotid, occipital, and external carotid arteries to ap-proximately one third normal. 1 This report suggested that the hypertension was probably not due to altered carotid sinus function but to altered cerebral hemodynamics. The report summarized previous attempts to produce experimental cerebral hypertension but in-advertently omitted reference to the work of Rosenfeld, who produced a mild hypertension in rabbits by bilateral ligation of the internal and external carotid arteries. 2 Recently hyper-tension produced by bilateral constriction of the carotid sinus area in dogs has been con-firmed in another laboratory and found to be unaffected by bilateral frontal leukotomy or lobectomy. 3 We have continued observations on the hypertensive dogs of our first report, and have produced hypertension in additional dogs by bilateral constriction of the carotid sinus area. We have also studied the effects of bilateral constriction of the internal carotid, occipital, and external carotid arteries above the sinus, of bilateral constriction of the vertebral arteries, and of bilateral resection of the carotid sinus i...|$|E
40|$|When {{describing}} {{the effectiveness of}} a <b>plastic</b> <b>clamp</b> in eliminating the risk of haemorrhage from the umbilical cord, as compared with the ineffective-ness of standard umbilical tape in some 750 o of instances under laboratory conditions, Neligan and Smith (1963) suggested that the use of a rubber band merited further study. This was on account of the clamp's cost, its rather startling appearance in some mothers ' eyes, and the need to remove it before the cord became too gangrenous. During further clinical trials we encountered two cases in which the clamp slipped off the end of the cord stump within an hour or two of being applied. This accident caused no harm to the babies concerned, but caused the manufacturers to improve the design of the clamp's jaws-and accelerated our investigation of the use of a rubber band. D. A. J. Williamson (1963, personal communica-tion) had kindly described to us a method of using a commercial elastic band, as supplied by stationers, which had been used in his unit for some years. We began by investigating this method, with particular reference to the most suitable type of band, its effectiveness when tested in the laboratory, the technique of applying it to the cord, and its clinical use. Results The Elastic Band. Of various samples tested, the most suitable proved to be a flat elastic band made of pure rubber (BB 28). * Its width is 0 - 125 in. (0 3 cm.), and its length when laid flat is I * 5 in. (3 - 75 cm.), giving a circumference of 3 in. (7 5 cm.). When stretched by suspending a weight of 15 oz. (420 g.) the length of different samples increased to a mean of 3 - 3 in. (8 25 cm.) and none snapped after being continuously stretched for up to one month. When * Manufactured by Berrick Bros.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} clamping on the thermodynamics of highly adhesive metal hydride thin films. Using Pd as a model system, we add Ti as an intermediate adhesion layer to increase the interaction with the substrate. We show that Pd/Ti films remain clamped during (de-) hydrogenation while the stress release occurs by means of rearrangement and pile-up of the material. The compressive stress build-up reaches a value of about 1. 5 GPa during hydrogen absorption. The enthalpy of hydride formation and decomposition, measured using Hydrogenography is found to decrease and increase by about 2. 7 and 1. 3 kJ/mol H- 2 respectively, as compared to buckled Pd films. A simple model confirms that {{the change in the}} thermodynamics and the asymmetric expansion of the hysteresis correlate with the mechanical work needed to accommodate the stress induced <b>plastic</b> deformations in <b>clamped</b> Pd/Ti films during the (de-) hydrogenation cycle.

40|$|Walking {{machines}} are mechanical systems that undergo impacts {{and changes in}} dynamic equations and {{can be viewed as}} a subclass of hybrid systems. In this work we focus on a class of planar mechanisms that can locomote through <b>plastic</b> impacts and <b>clamping.</b> This setting retains enough structure to investigate discrete phenomena in locomotion. We use a geometric framework to describe smooth phenomena such as inertial and constraint forces and discrete events such as impacts. In this setting hybrid mechanical control systems are described in terms of a#ne connections and linear jump transition maps. For this class of systems we perform a local controllability analysis. In particular we employ the notion of configuration controllability to identify systems that are able to locomote by clamping. Additionally, we discuss how to adapt smooth motion planning algorithms to this hybrid setting and present some instructive set of gaits.
