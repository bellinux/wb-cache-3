5|$|The <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> at Vassar College in {{the town}} of Poughkeepsie, New York, was the first such program in the United States. Its {{facilities}} were first housed within the school's Calisthenium and Riding Academy which opened in 1866, a year after Vassar's opening in 1865. Alumna Forence Cushing, along with a cohort of other Boston-based alumnae, observed in 1883 that Vassar's <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> was lagging behind those at other recently opened Seven Sisters schools including Wellesley College and Smith College. The New York and Boston alumnae clubs began an attempt to raise $20,000, which they believed to be an adequate sum to pay for a new home for athletics at the school.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{known as}} the Alumnae Gymnasium, the {{building}} was erected {{as a response to}} the perception that Vassar's <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> was falling behind those of other Seven Sisters colleges. Plans for the hall were made, scrapped, and remade as the college and alumnae benefactors struggled to raise sufficient funds. Ultimately, the building was designed by William Tubby and constructed in 1889, signaling a physical decentralization away from the college's Main Building. When it opened, the gymnasium featured a large pool and a variety of other athletic spaces. Vassar's enrollment quickly outgrew the limited space within the building, and it was first expanded and then superseded by Kenyon Hall in the 1930s. The Geology Department moved into the building shortly thereafter.|$|E

Promoted to captain, he requested overseas duty later that year and served in the China-Burma-India Theater for over six months, scouting locations for B-29 bomber bases and was a physical training officer with the 58th Bomber Wing. He was a Special Services officer of the 20th Bomber Command, 20th Air Force in China when it began bombing Japan on June 15. He was ordered to New York, and in late 1944, to Richmond, Virginia. Greenberg served 47 months, the longest of any major league player.|$|E

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> Teacher <b>Education</b> (PETE) <b>programs</b> should {{connect to}} reality of school life with {{collaborative}} and innovative {{efforts to improve}} quality of school <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> Undergraduate <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in the United States have changed considerably {{during the past two}} decades. One of the main changes was the expansion of non-teaching majors (Zeigler, 1988). The reform of undergraduate <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> from single track to multiple was a result of changing employment patterns of students in the <b>programs.</b> Thus, <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in the United States have begun to prepare students in different careers (McBride, 1984). On the other hand, There is an argument over subject matter of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> being closely aligned to sport, games, and fitness activities that <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> should focus on sub-disciplines (i. e. biomechanics, exercise physiology) (Corbin & Eckert, 1990). Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to analyze these different approaches in reforming PETE programs with a critical inquiry for the future...|$|R
500|$|While {{attending}} Biggar Composite School in Biggar, Saskatchewan, Canada, Schmirler started curling in Grade 7 {{as part of}} the school's <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>program.</b> She grew up an athlete, playing volleyball, badminton, and softball. She {{was also}} an avid speed swimmer. She continued to curl on the local scene, participating in the Biggar Curling Club ladies' league in Grade 9. Playing as third on her high school team, she won a provincial championship in Grade 12, when her team went undefeated throughout the season. She continued to curl after graduating from high school, while attending the University of Saskatchewan. While in university, Schmirler made her first appearance in Saskatchewan's provincial playdowns in 1983. After graduating university, Schmirler moved to Regina to take a job at the North West Leisure Centre. She continued to curl, and was given the nickname [...] "Schmirler the Curler" [...] by a supervisor at the facility. In 1987, as a member of Kathy Fahlman's rink, Schmirler won her first provincial championship, sending her to her first national championship, where she and her team finished in fourth place with a 7–5 win-loss record.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1946, the Soviets {{began to}} join {{international}} federations; in 1951 their NOC {{was recognized by}} the IOC, and they began Olympic competition the following year. As few Soviet sports officials were internationally known, the IOC had little alternative than to accept the nominees of the USSR's government if they wished to have Soviet IOC members. The Soviet members were believers in sport, and completely loyal to their nation and to communist ideals. They quickly became {{the leaders of the}} IOC members from behind the Iron Curtain, who voted in accord with the Soviet members. Brundage visited the USSR at Soviet invitation (though at his own expense) in 1954. He deemed the nation's <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> as [...] "creating the greatest army of athletes the world has ever seen," [...] warning (as he would often through the 1950s) that Americans were by comparison soft and unfit. Brundage found his view, often expressed in the press, that physical education and competitive sports made for better citizens, especially in the event of war, more enthusiastically embraced in the Soviet Union than in the United States. According to David Maraniss in his account of the 1960 Rome Games, Brundage's admiration for the Soviet Union's sports programs [...] "in some ways mirrored his response two decades earlier to his encounters with Nazi Germany".|$|E

40|$|Background. Past {{research}} indicates that physical activity {{can contribute to the}} development of children’s self-concept. However, the impact of the quality of school <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> on children’s self-concept has not been properly examined. Aims. This research was designed to answer the key question: is the quality of school <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> correlated with the self-concept of children in grades four to six in Australian provincial schools? Sample. The sample comprised 1, 149 children, from grades 4 to 6 (10 - 12 year olds), at 12 selected Australian provincial schools. Methods. The 1, 149 children answered the Self-Description Questionnaire I (SDQ I) which identifies the levels of children’s self-concept. A program evaluation was also conducted in the 12 schools, to assess the quality of their <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> Results. Results indicated that there was no positive relationship between the quality of school <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> and the levels of children’s self-concept. Conclusion. The variations in the quality of the <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> implemented at the 12 selected primary schools did not affect the children’s self-concept levels as assessed by the SDQ I. Previous studies that demonstrated an improvement in self concept were based on interventions in addition to the normal <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> curriculum. This suggests that specially designed additional programs are needed in order to improve children’s selfconcept. The current <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> curriculum does not have the capacity to achieve a significant change...|$|R

40|$|Kenneth H. Cooper is {{considered}} to be a noted scholar in the field of wellness and fitness. This study explored his contributions to the preventive medicine and wellness movement in community college <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in the United States. It examined Cooper's influence on the development of preventive medicine and wellness from its inception and growth to its impact on changes and factors affecting curriculum in community college programs. A random sample of 436 <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> division directors from the nation's 1, 400 community colleges yielded a 62 % survey response. For purposes of comparison, the sample was stratified into two regions taken fromeast and west of the Mississippi River. Chi-square analysis at the. 01 level of significance found no difference between variables due to geographic region. The findings of this study indicate that Kenneth Cooper's contributions to preventive medicine and wellness in community college <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> curriculum are overshadowed by state and local governing bodies that are the force behind curricular development in the nation's 2 -year community colleges. However, as an individual contributor, Cooper ranks highly in influencing the wellness and <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> curriculum primarily in the areas of aerobic exercise, physical fitness, and cardiovascular disease. The extent of Cooper's impact on community college <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> is recognized by the wide utilization of the 1. 5 mile run test and 12 -minute run test developed by Cooper. Two areas of Cooper's research—antioxidants and spiritual fitness—are not priorities in <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programming.</b> Changes in <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in the past 10 years show an increased emphasis and popularity in aerobic fitness courses.
