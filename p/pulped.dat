50|$|Fluff <b>pulp</b> (also called {{comminution}} <b>pulp</b> or fluffy <b>pulp)</b> {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} <b>pulp</b> made from long fibre softwoods. Important parameters for fluff <b>pulp</b> are bulk and water absorbency.|$|R
50|$|This is the {{condition}} where the <b>pulp</b> is irreversibly damaged. The <b>pulp</b> can not {{recover from the}} insult and damage. For example, decay that has reached the <b>pulp</b> of the tooth introduces bacteria into the <b>pulp.</b> The <b>pulp</b> is still alive, but the introduction of bacteria into the <b>pulp</b> will not allow the <b>pulp</b> to heal and it will ultimately result in necrosis, or death, of the <b>pulp</b> tissue.|$|R

25|$|After sorting or {{screening}} {{to remove}} any physical contaminants from the feedstock, the material is often shredded, minced, and mechanically or hydraulically <b>pulped</b> to increase the surface area available to microbes in the digesters and, hence, increase the speed of digestion. The maceration of solids {{can be achieved by}} using a chopper pump to transfer the feedstock material into the airtight digester, where anaerobic treatment takes place.|$|E
25|$|Green fodders {{are used}} widely for {{intensive}} milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or <b>pulped.</b> Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or trimmings of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, Pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and turnips. Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% {{of the standard}} feed mixture.|$|E
50|$|The {{two major}} classifications of <b>pulp</b> are {{chemical}} and mechanical. Chemical <b>pulps</b> formerly used a sulphite process, but the kraft process is now predominant. Kraft <b>pulp</b> has superior strength to sulphite and mechanical <b>pulps.</b> Both chemical <b>pulps</b> and mechanical <b>pulps</b> may be bleached {{to a high}} brightness.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (a) to investigate the possibilities for increasing the yield of chemical <b>pulp</b> by using two stages of delignification and (b) to evaluate the possibility of replacing the kraft process with a more environmentally benign <b>pulping</b> system. High Kappa number kraft, sodaanthraquinone (AQ) and sodaoctahydrodimethylanthraquinone (ODiMAQ) <b>pulps</b> were produced and then delignified to Kappa number 30 with aqueous solutions of the polyoxometalate Na 4. 9 + 2 [SiV 0. 9 MoW 10. 1 O 40]. <b>Pulp</b> yields and strengths were determined. The properties of these <b>pulps</b> were compared with those of Kappa 30 <b>pulps</b> produced by single-stage kraft, sodaAQ, and sodaODiMAQ <b>pulping.</b> The high Kappa <b>pulps</b> delignified with a polyoxometalate (POM) were significantly higher in yield than were the single-stage <b>pulps.</b> The highest yield two-stage <b>pulp</b> was the POM-delignified kraft <b>pulp.</b> However, all the resulting <b>pulps</b> were somewhat weaker than the single-stage kraft <b>pulp.</b> As the Kappa number of the initial sodaODiMAQ <b>pulps</b> was increased from 65 to 83 and finally 96, the POM delignification of these <b>pulps</b> to Kappa number 30 resulted in a constant level of <b>pulp</b> yield and significantly decreased <b>pulp</b> strength. Strong <b>pulps</b> were nevertheless produced in all cases. SodaODiMAQ delignification to approximately Kappa number 65 followed by POM delignification could be a replacement for kraft <b>pulping...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{viscosity}} of kenaf {{bast fiber}} {{has been found}} to be highly sensitive and variable with different <b>pulping</b> methods; therefore, it is important to choose proper chemicals and conditions for <b>pulping</b> and bleaching of kenaf bast fiber. From several <b>pulping</b> experiments, a nonconventional <b>pulping</b> method with a combination of ammonium oxalate pretreatment followed by soda <b>pulping</b> at normal pressure and then acidic chlorite delignification was developed to obtain high-viscosity <b>pulp</b> (162 centipoise). The optimum level of alkali dosage of soda <b>pulping</b> for high-viscosity <b>pulp</b> was found to be 15 % (on <b>pulp</b> as NaOH). <b>Pulps</b> showed linear relations between viscosity and xylose or glucose contents, but the combination <b>pulping</b> method gave extremely high <b>pulp</b> viscosity, beyond the relations. The highest viscosity <b>pulp</b> from kenaf bast fiber demonstrated a tear index about twofold and a folding endurance 6.2 -fold higher than those of Manila hemp <b>pulp</b> with comparable tensile and burst indexes. The high-viscosity <b>pulp</b> could be used in the production of high-quality currency paper or longevity paper for special uses.|$|R
25|$|The best (but least used) {{method of}} drying coffee is using drying tables. In this method, the <b>pulped</b> and {{fermented}} coffee is spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass {{on all sides of}} the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method.|$|E

They were eaten either by themselves, or <b>pulped</b> and mixed with coconut milk, forming a popular drink called 'otai. Other fruits, such as oranges, lemons, and limes, became popular. Tongans also adopted onions, green onions, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes, and other common vegetables. In the last few decades, Tongan farmers with access to large tracts of land have engaged in commercial farming of pumpkins and other easily shipped vegetables as cash crops.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pulp</b> {{and paper}} {{production}} has three major processing steps: <b>pulping,</b> bleaching, and paper production. The type of <b>pulping</b> {{and the amount}} of bleaching used depend {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the desired qualities of the end product. Sulphite <b>pulping</b> is one of the chemical <b>pulping</b> processes that can be used. It involves chemically <b>pulping</b> the wood using SO 2 adsorbed in a base solution. Sulphite <b>pulping</b> produces a weaker paper than some other types of <b>pulping,</b> but the <b>pulp</b> is less coloured, making it more suitable for printing, often with little bleaching. The production of sulphite <b>pulps</b> (European Commission 2001) is much smaller than the production of kraft <b>pulps</b> and sulphite <b>pulps</b> are more used in special purposes in papermaking rather than being an alternative market <b>pulp</b> grade for kraft <b>pulps.</b> Very little unbleached sulphite <b>pulp</b> is made and the yield is a little higher which can be attributed to the lower pH in the cooking. Not all sulphite <b>pulping</b> and related processes that could result in the emission of significant amounts of NMVOC, SOx, particulates, NOx and CO are included under SNAP Code 040603.

40|$|<b>Pulping</b> is {{the term}} used for the process which {{separates}} wood fibers. Chemical <b>pulping,</b> dissolving the lignin in the wood to create a <b>pulp,</b> is {{the most commonly used}} <b>pulping</b> process. Chemical <b>pulping</b> creates higher sheet strength than mechanical pulping; however, yields 40 to 50 percent <b>pulp,</b> where mechanical <b>pulping</b> yields 95 percent <b>pulp.</b> The two main types of chemical <b>pulping</b> are the more common sulfate <b>pulping</b> (most commonly known as Kraft <b>pulping)</b> and sulfite <b>pulping.</b> Kraft <b>pulping</b> accommodates a variety of tree species, recovers and reuses all <b>pulping</b> chemicals, and creates a paper with a higher sheet strength. Sulfite <b>pulp,</b> however, is easier to bleach, yields more bleached <b>pulp,</b> and is easier to refine for papermaking. The major difference between the two types of chemical <b>pulping</b> is the types of chemicals used to dissolve the lignin. This report will focus mainly on these two types of chemical <b>pulping</b> and bleach plants. <b>Pulp</b> mills are one of the largest emission sources in Washington and a large toxic pollutant emission producer.

Although officially stifled, Akhmatova's work continued to circulate in secret. Akhmatova's close friend, chronicler Lydia Chukovskaya described how writers working to keep poetic messages alive used various strategies. A small trusted circle would, for example, memorise each other's works and circulate them only by oral means. She tells how Akhmatova would write out her poem for a visitor on a scrap of paper to be read in a moment, then burnt in her stove.
