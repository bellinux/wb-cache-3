Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme.

There was a massive improvement in the 2013 Premier Division, with Dundalk finishing in 2nd place, three points behind winners St. Pat's, and they also reached the semi final of the FAI Cup. In 2014, Kenny guided Dundalk to the League title, winning the League of Ireland Cup in the process. He repeated this league and cup double again in 2015, with Richie Towell scoring 25 goals from midfield, <b>pipping</b> Cork City to the title on both occasions. 2015 also saw a win in the FAI Cup, with Dundalk triumphing over Cork City once again. In 2016, Dundalk made history by reaching the playoff round of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League by beating FH and BATE Borisov, where they lost 3–1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw, and dropped into the Europa League as a result. Dundalk became just the second Irish team ever to make the group stages of a European competition, {{and became the first}} Irish side to pick up a point in Europe after Ciarán Kilduff scored an 89th-minute equaliser away to Dutch side AZ Alkmaar in their opening group stage match in a 1–1 draw.

On stage 3, Sagan once more reaped second position after a lone breaker, Toms Skujiņš, made it to the finish a minute before him. On Stage 4, Sagan won the day by powering away from Wouter Wippert and Cavendish on the small incline before the line. As he crossed the finish, Sagan banged his front wheel twice on the tarmac and treated the crowd to a no-footed wheelie afterward to celebrate. On the fifth stage, Sagan came in third position. However, in the ensuing Time Trial in Santa Clarita, Sagan imposed himself on the flat and slightly technical circuit, grabbing the general classification jersey in the process. On the following day's seventh stage climb up Mount Baldy, Sagan lost the overall lead to Julian Alaphilippe, however he put in a surprisingly strong performance to end the day two seconds behind Alaphilippe in the overall standings, and giving him a chance of taking the general classification through time bonuses on the final stage.

Blocking <b>PIP</b> 2 synthesis by inhibiting phosphoinositide- 4 kinase, or stimulating <b>PIP</b> 2 hydrolysis via activation of phospholipase C (PLC), or blocking <b>PIP</b> 2 function with an antibody caused a significant reduction of NMDAR-mediated currents.

These electrophysiological effects were accompanied by changes in NMDAR surface clusters induced by agents that manipulate <b>PIP</b> 2 levels. The <b>PIP</b> 2 regulation of NMDAR currents was abolished by the dynamin inhibitory peptide, which blocks receptor internalization. Agents perturbing actin stability prevented <b>PIP</b> 2 regulation of NMDAR currents, suggesting the actin-dependence of this effect of <b>PIP</b> 2. Cofilin, a major actin depolymerizing factor, which has a common binding sequence for actin and <b>PIP</b> 2, was required for <b>PIP</b> 2 regulation of NMDAR currents.

40|$|Phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP(2)) is an {{abundant}} phospholipid {{that contributes to}} second messenger formation and {{has also been shown}} to contribute to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in all eukaryotic cells. Although the alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms of phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate- 5 -kinase I (<b>PIP</b> 5 KI) all synthesize <b>PIP</b> 2, mammalian cells usually contain more than one <b>PIP</b> 5 KI isoform. This {{raises the question of whether}} different isoforms of <b>PIP</b> 5 KI fulfill different functions. Given the speculated role of PIP(2) in platelet and megakaryocyte actin dynamics, we analyzed murine megakaryocytes lacking individual <b>PIP</b> 5 KI isoforms. <b>PIP</b> 5 KIgamma(-/-) megakaryocytes exhibited plasma membrane blebbing accompanied by a decreased association of the membrane with the cytoskeleton. This membrane defect was rescued by adding back wild-type <b>PIP</b> 5 KIgamma, but not by adding a catalytically inactive mutant or a splice variant lacking the talin-binding motif. Notably, both <b>PIP</b> 5 KIbeta- and <b>PIP</b> 5 KIgamma(-/-) cells had impaired PIP(2) synthesis. However, <b>PIP</b> 5 KIbeta-null cells lacked the membrane-cytoskeleton defect. Furthermore, overexpressing <b>PIP</b> 5 KIbeta in <b>PIP</b> 5 KIgamma(-/-) cells failed to revert this defect. Megakaryocytes lacking the <b>PIP</b> 5 KIgamma-binding partner, talin 1, mimicked the membrane-cytoskeleton defect phenotype seen in <b>PIP</b> 5 KIgamma(-/-) cells. These findings demonstrate a unique role for <b>PIP</b> 5 KIgamma in the anchoring of the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton in megakaryocytes, probably through a pathway involving talin. These observations further demonstrate that individual <b>PIP</b> 5 KI isoforms fulfill distinct functions within cells. 1398...|$|R
40|$|Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (<b>PIP</b> 2) {{has many}} {{essential}} functions and its homeostasis is highly regulated. We previously found that hypertonic stress increases <b>PIP</b> 2 by selectively activating the β isoform {{of the type}} I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 -kinase (<b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ) through Ser/Thr dephosphorylation and promoting its translocation to the plasma membrane. Here we report that hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) also induces <b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ Ser/Thr dephosphorylation, but it has the opposite effect on <b>PIP</b> 2 homeostasis, <b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ function, and the actin cytoskeleton. Brief H 2 O 2 treatments decrease cellular <b>PIP</b> 2 in a <b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ-dependent manner. <b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ is tyrosine phosphorylated, dissociates from the plasma membrane, and has decreased lipid kinase activity. In contrast, the other two <b>PIP</b> 5 K isoforms are not inhibited by H 2 O 2. We identified spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which is activated by oxidants, as a candidate <b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ kinase in this pathway, and mapped the oxidant-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation site to residue 105. The <b>PIP</b> 5 KβY 105 E phosphomimetic is catalytically inactive and cytosolic, whereas the Y 105 F non-phosphorylatable mutant has higher intrinsic lipid kinase activity and is much more membrane associated than wild type <b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ. These results suggest that during oxidative stress, as modeled by H 2 O 2 treatment, Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of <b>PIP</b> 5 Kβ is the dominant post-translational modification {{that is responsible for}} the decrease in cellular <b>PIP</b> 2...|$|R
