25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and {{have an important role}} in explaining laws of nature. Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism <b>presents</b> <b>for</b> his account of laws of nature is not in the case of manifested dispositions (say, a glass dropping on the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it would break).

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if men with malignancy have increased sperm DNA fragmentation compared with men <b>presenting</b> <b>for</b> sperm donation.

Main Outcome Measure(s) : Sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) measured by sperm chromatin assay.

25|$|Starting 2000, Radcliffe won the Stormont Cross Country {{race for}} a third time. Radcliffe then {{finished}} fourth in Durham. Radcliffe then sustained a knee injury in a bizarre way, as she was sidelined after kneeling on the floor writing thank you letters for wedding <b>presents.</b> <b>For</b> the European Cup, Radcliffe joined {{a host of other}} British athletes by pulled out injured. However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned her attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.|$|E

40|$|We {{asked whether}} wolf re-colonization would {{facilitate}} increased growth and reproduction of three browse-sensitive plant species. We hypothesized plant {{size and the}} proportion of reproductive individuals would be lowest in areas with no wolves, intermediate where wolves had been <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 4 - 6 years, and highest where wolves had been <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 12 - 13 years. Two plant species exhibited significantly greater reproduction where wolves were <b>present</b> <b>for</b> 12 - 13 years.
