25|$|Edward, {{like all}} vampires in the Twilight series, {{possesses}} superhuman stamina, senses, mentality, and agility, {{as well as}} a healing factor and night vision. His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable and tougher than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a pliant daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do so out of habit and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular <b>person.</b> <b>Like</b> other vampires, Edward is not able to sleep.|$|E

500|$|Gail Wynand is {{a wealthy}} {{newspaper}} mogul who rose from a destitute childhood in the ghettoes of New York to control {{much of the}} city's print media. While Wynand shares many of the character qualities of Roark, his success is dependent upon his ability to pander to public opinion. Rand presents this as a tragic flaw that eventually leads to his downfall. In her journals Rand described Wynand as [...] "the man who could have been" [...] a heroic individualist, contrasting him to Roark, [...] "the man who can be and is". Some elements of Wynand's character were inspired by real-life newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, including Hearst's yellow journalism and mixed success in attempts to gain political influence. Wynand ultimately fails in his attempts to wield power, losing his newspaper, his wife, and his friendship with Roark. The character has been interpreted as {{a representation of the}} master morality described by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche; his tragic nature illustrates Rand's rejection of Nietzsche's philosophy. In Rand's view, a <b>person</b> <b>like</b> Wynand, who seeks power over others, is as much a [...] "second-hander" [...] as a conformist such as Keating.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} divided into 21 chapters, with each chapter {{switching}} between the points-of-view of the supervillain Dr. Impossible and the superhero Fatale. The narrative is written in the first <b>person,</b> <b>like</b> a memoir, describing the inner monologues of the two protagonists. The dual narrative foils and [...] "blur the distinction" [...] between the superheroes and the supervillain. The language was described as having a [...] "sincere tone of glory" [...] and [...] "boyish indulgence" [...] with [...] "an undercurrent of sadness and a surprisingly human universality". While the story uses standard comic book story elements, like superheroes fighting supervillains, the book is written entirely in prose. The story combines a satire of superhero archetypes and comic book clichés, {{such as the use}} of many superlatives, with realist elements that portray the sometimes mundane lives and everyday challenges of its characters, like coping with cybernetic body parts that weigh far more than a natural body and that react before the brain registers what is happening. Common social situations and psychological issues, like loneliness and trying to connect with a group, are also portrayed. Reviewers identified numerous themes, such as power, greed, fame, ego, loneliness, belonging, and identity.|$|E
