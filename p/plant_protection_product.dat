This concerns in particular details on the application of the <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> (rate, timing, instructions for use, etc.), information on the toxicological profile including potential metabolites and data on the efficacy of the product including resistance risks.

Tebuconazole exerted the strongest suppressive effect on the growth of filamentous fungi, and propiconazole was characterized by the greatest phytotoxic activity against winter wheat seedlings.

40|$|In the EU {{the risk}} of {{leaching}} of plant protection products is assessed {{according to the new}} regulation 1107 / 2009. For the assessment of this risk the FOCUS Groundwater scenarios have been developed. The PEARL model is one of the models {{that can be used to}} calculate the leaching concentration in groundwater for these scenarios. At the national level, the GeoPEARL model is used to assess the 90 th percentile in space of the <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> in its area of use. In this report a description is given of all processes considered to describe the fate of the <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> in the plant-soil system, such as transport in the soil matrix and in the macropore domain of the soil, transformation, volatilisation and sorption in soil, and processes at the plant canopy (volatilisation, penetration into the plant tissue and phototransformation on the plant surface).

40|$|The {{application}} rate of plant-protection products is indicated as a concentration or amount of product per area. Greenhouse crops grow swiftly, and an {{application rate}} {{based on a}} fixed amount of product per hectare can result either in large losses and overdoses when the plants are small or to be insufficient when the plants are fully developed. To solve these problems, the application rates of plant-protection products need to be adapted to the plant mass present in the greenhouse when the spray is applied. Two models were developed to estimate the leaf area based on easily measured geometric data of the vegetation in a greenhouse tomato crop. The model based on the PRV (Plant Row Volume) had that best results. The calculation of the volume application rate from the PRV {{has resulted in a}} reduction of more than 30 % of the quantity of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> sprayed, without decreasing yield. The PRV of a greenhouse tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is an easily measured parameter that enables the estimation of the leaf area index and the use of application strategies adapted to the changes in the plant canopy, saving major amounts of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> used, compared to the conventional system...|$|E

40|$|New {{legislation}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of proper disposal of the residues of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> in farms in the agricultural and horticultural sector, because some of those residues may remain in soil in unchanged form for several years, thus affecting the biodiversity of soil microorganisms. A questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the methods of application and disposal of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> by professional users. Biodiversity of microbial communities in soil at sites contaminated by xenobiotics from point sources was evaluated in a laboratory experiment. The awareness of the users of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> regarding responsible and safe use of approved sprayers and the need to train persons performing protective treatments was satisfactory. However, the respondents demonstrated a low level of environmental awareness, and they often declared that in their farms the residues of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> are disposed of in the same place repeatedly. Such practices reduce the biodiversity of soil-dwelling microbes, in particular, the counts of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In most cases, fungi of the genus Mucor and the species of Fusarium culmorum and Gliocladium roseum did not respond to the presence of the residues of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> in soil...|$|R

The first approved application of Equisetum arvense L. opened Part C of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540 / 2011, which lists the basic substance approved. Although E. arvense {{was described as}} a fungicide extract, subsequent applications like chitosan were related to non-biocide molecules. Consequently, <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> data were collected from research on alternative or traditional crop protection methods. They are notably issued or derived from foodstuffs (plants, plant by-products, plant derived products, substances and derived substances from animal origin). Applications are currently submitted by our Institute, under evaluation at different stages of the approval process or already approved. Remarkably, this Basic Substance category under pesticide EU Regulation was surprisingly designed for these non-biocidal plant protection products. In fact, components described as the “active substance” of most of the actual applications are food products like sugars and lecithin. Basic Substance applications for these foodstuffs are therefore a straightforward way of easily gaining approval for them. Here we describe the approval context and detail the agricultural uses of theses food products as Biological Control Agents (BCAs) or biorationals for crop protection. From all deposited or approved Basic Substance Application (BSA), a proof has been provided that non-biocide and food products via physical barrier or lure effects may be effective plant protection products with an acceptable low profile of concern for public and agricultural safety...|$|E
30|$|Permanent {{excitation}} {{of nerve}} cells {{due to the}} absence of negative regulation is another example of the impact of xenobiotics on one or several control elements of signal transduction. Neurotransmitters in the brain are stimulated via the opening of specific ion channels to allow sodium ions to flow into the nerve cell. If required, this activity is modulated or inhibited by chlorine ions which likewise flow into nerve cells through specific channels. Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane), which formerly was used as a <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product,</b> prevents the influx of these chlorine ions by inhibiting the opening of the relevant ion channels. This results in permanent excitation as mentioned above [9].|$|E
