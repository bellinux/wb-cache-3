40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} "Synthesis of Natural Products Based on Cyclohexadienes" {{consists of}} two chapters. Chapter 1 {{is divided into two}} parts. Part I gives a brief introduction to the structure, synthesis, biosynthesis and biological activities of some naturally occurring <b>phthalides</b> (eg. mycophenolic acid 1, zinniol 2, <b>phthalides</b> 3 & 4). A general strategy for the preparation of highly substituted <b>phthalides</b> is also described. Cycloaddition of 1,s-dimethoxycoclohexa- 1, 4 -diene with dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate(DMAD) followed by an Alder-Rickert reaction gave the diester 5 which upon hydrolysis with KOH and refluxing with acetic anhydride gave the phthalic anhydride 6. Regioselective reductions of the anhydride 6 gave the <b>phthalides</b> 7 and 8. Using a similar strategy the <b>phthalides</b> 11 & 12 were prepared from 2, 6 dimethoxytoluene through the intermediates 9 & 10. The aromatic ethers 13 & 14 upon Birch reduction followed by Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride gave the bicyclic anhydrides 15 & 16 respectively. Attempts to dehydrogenate 15 using variety of conditions failed. But refluxing 15 in nitrobenzene gave a poor yield of 17 which is an important intermediate in the synthesis of mycophenolic acid. Part II describes the first total synthesis of zinniol 2, phthalide- 1 3 & phthalide- 2 4. Thus the diene 18, obtained from 2 -methylcyclohexane- 1, 3 dione, upon Diels-Alder and Alder-Rickert with DMAD gave the diester 19. Prenylation of 19 afforded the diester 20 which was convened into 21 upon hydrolysis and DCC treatment. DIBAL reduction of 20 gave Zinniol 2 which on oxidation provided the <b>phthalides</b> 3 & 4 (7 : 3 ratio respectively). The anhydride 21, on selective reduction, gave the same <b>phthalides</b> in 2 : 8 ratio which could be readily separated and characterized...|$|R

40|$|Based {{on recent}} {{reports that the}} small molecules, isatin and phthalimide, are {{suitable}} scaffolds {{for the design of}} high potency monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, the present study examines the MAO inhibitory properties of a series of <b>phthalide</b> [2 -benzofuran- 1 (3 H) -one] analogues. <b>Phthalide</b> is structurally related to isatin and phthalimide and it is demonstrated here that substitution at C 6 of the <b>phthalide</b> moiety yields compounds endowed with high binding affinities to both human MAO isoforms. Among the nineteen homologues evaluated, the lowest IC 50 values recorded for the inhibition of MAO-A and -B were 0. 096 and 0. 0014 lM, respectively. In most instances, C 6 -substituted phthalides exhibit MAO-B specific inhibition.
