50|$|The {{company was}} relaunched in 1870 as the Blaenavon Iron & Steel Company {{and was one}} of only six south Wales {{ironworks}} that successfully made the change to steel production. By 1878 the company employed 5,000 people but had greatly overreached itself financially and failed amongst tough competition. With financial ruin just around the corner the company was given some respite thanks to the discoveries of Sidney Gilchrist Thomas and Percy Carlyle Gilchrist which enabled the use of the previously uneconomic <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron</b> ore. Their experiments were carried out at Blarnavon between 1877 and 1878.This was short lived as it meant Germany and North America were now able to utilise their own phosphoric ores and ironically accelerated the decline of Blaenavon Ironworks.|$|E

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>irons</b> (i. e. Fe-P alloys containing low phosphorous in {{the range}} 0. 1 to 0. 7 wt. %) containing chromium with/without addition of silicon, prepared by powder forging route was studied in different environments. The various environments chosen were acidic (0. 25 M H 2 SO 4 solution of pH 0. 6), neutral/marine (3. 5 % NaCl solution of pH 6. 8) and alkaline (0. 5 M Na 2 CO 3 + 1. 0 M NaHCO 3 solution of pH 9. 4). The corrosion studies were conducted using Tafel Extrapolation and Linear Polarization techniques. The studies compare electrolytic Armco <b>iron</b> with <b>phosphoric</b> <b>irons.</b> It was observed that silicon improved the resistance to corrosion in all the environments. Corrosion rates were higher in acid medium, minimal in alkaline medium and low in neutral solution...|$|R
50|$|For such {{intricate}} {{detail and}} thin-sectioned castings {{to be produced}} as were done with Berlin iron jewellery, a very pure iron which contained up to 0.7% phosphorus was used. This was done to make the iron slightly more fluid than {{what it would be}} when normally molten. Although this type of <b>phosphoric</b> cast <b>iron</b> is rather hard and brittle, strength is not the main purpose of the metal when it is used in jewellery. The molten iron was cast into metal chill moulds.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{corrosiveness}} of {{phosphoric acid}} during the wet-process concentration is quite complex and dependent on several influencing factors. The factor, {{which has the}} most significant impact, {{is the presence of}} impurities. For example, at a given concentration, the presence of fluorine, calcium oxide, sodium and chlorine in the process will crease the corrosivity of <b>phosphoric</b> acid whereas <b>iron,</b> alumina and magnesium will have the opposite affect. This paper discusses the general aspects of the corrosiveness of phosphoric acid produced via the wet-process method. Additionally, information exploiting the benefits of stainless steel metallic heaters versus graphite will be detailed. Finally, several case references are documented describing twenty years of successful application experience of Sandvik Steel's Sanicro 28 used as a material of construction for metallic heaters for phosphoric acid evaporation...|$|R

40|$|After carbon, {{phosphorus}} is {{the most}} commonly detected element in archaeological iron. The typical <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron</b> range is 0. 1 wt% to 1 wt%P. The predominant source of phosphorus in iron is the ore smelted. Around 60 % of economic UK rock iron ore formations contain over 0. 2 %P. Under fully reducing conditions, both in liquid-state (cast iron) and solid-state bloomery smelting (direct reduction) processes, such rock ores would be predicted to produce <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron,</b> and bog iron ores even more so. Ore-metal-slag phosphorus ratios for bloomery iron are derived here, by means of: laboratory experiments; full-scale experimental bloomery smelting; and analysis of remains from three Medieval and two Late Roman-Iron Age iron production sites in England and the Netherlands. Archaeological ore, slag, metal residues (gromps), and iron artefacts were analysed by metallography, SEM-EDS, EPMA, and XRD. The effects of forging and carburising on <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron</b> were studied by experiment and artefact analysis. The ore to slag %P ratio for solid-state reduction was determined to range from 1 : 1. 2 to 1 : 1. 8. The ore to metal %P ratio varied from 1 : 0. 2 to 1 : 0. 7 - 1. 4, depending on furnace operating conditions. Archaeological <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron</b> and steel microstructures resulting from non-equilibrium reduction, heat treatment, and mechanical processing are presented to define the technology of early <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron.</b> Microstructures were identified {{by a combination of}} metallography and chemical analysis.

Modern concepts of 'quality' and workability are shown to be inapplicable to the archaeological material. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Glyphosate is a worldwide-used {{herbicide}} {{occurring in}} many monitoring campaigns. Efficient technologies are currently unavailable for glyphosate removal from waters. In this work, a SBA- 15 mesoporous silica-based material (Fe-NH 2 -SBA- 15) was synthesized and studied for the adsorption of glyphosate from waters. In {{order to promote}} specific interactions between the sorbent and glyphosate via <b>phosphoric</b> group, <b>iron</b> oxide nanoparticles were encapsulated and a surface functionalization with (3 -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane was accomplished. The adsorption of glyphosate on Fe-NH 2 -SBA- 15 was investigated {{as a function of}} (i) pH, (ii) ionic strength (I), and (iii) adsorbate to adsorbent ratio (C), using a two-level, three-factor experimental design. The experimental design allowed for understanding the effect of the abovementioned variables and for proposing experimental conditions for quantitative removal (pH = 2. 1, I = 1 ⋅ 10 − 2 M and C = 0. 35) under both batch and dynamic conditions. Interaction mechanism between glyphosate and Fe-NH 2 -SBA- 15 sorbent was elucidated by studying the adsorption behavior of sorbents derived from the intermediate stages of synthesis and by desorption tests. Fe-NH 2 -SBA- 15 sorbent can be quantitatively regenerated by 12. 5 mM NaOH, and can be reused at least for five adsorption/desorption cycles.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{optimization}} {{of the composition}} phosphate binders. These binders are used in production of refractories. In this branch, the bauxite is very often used as an aggregate, but it contains tiny particles of iron which arise in milling process. These particles of iron react with the phosphate binder to form hydrogen – it is consequence of the reaction between <b>phosphoric</b> acid and <b>iron.</b> The formed gas causes the formation of bubbles and the deformation of refractories. The goal of this thesis is to find suitable additives {{which can be used}} to stop or to limit the production of hydrogen. Usually used binders were replaced by a model binder to simplify the system and for better understanding. The model binder was prepared in laboratory by dissolving aluminium hydroxide in phosphoric acid. They used pure powdered pentacarbonyl iron instead of tiny iron particles from the milling process. The model binder was modified with using a few inhibitors. The calcimetr was used to measure their influence on the production of hydrogen, as well as measuring concentrated rows of selected inhibitors. These rows are necessary to optimize the inhibitors quantity added in the binder...|$|R
40|$|This project {{presents}} {{a study of}} iron technology in Early Medieval (fifth to eleventh centuries AD) Britain through the examination of iron found in settlement contexts. This is a period characterized by significant cultural, political and social changes. The effect of these changes on iron technology has never been investigated on a large scale. Previous studies on iron focused either on individual sites or on single artefact types, and did not provide any clear multi-region interpretive framework. A longstanding problem has been in identifying the extent of usage of a key alloy: <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron.</b> This research project examined iron assemblages from eight settlement sites of varying size, culture, economic and social status from across Britain. From each settlement a mixed assemblage of iron artefacts was sampled, including edged tools, items of personal adornment, construction materials, and craft tools. Analysis was by traditional archaeometallurgical techniques alongside SEM-EDS elemental analysis. Alloy usage, specifically relating to <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron,</b> was examined and the manufacturing techniques assessed. It was shown that elemental analysis is the only reliable method to determine the presence of phosphorus in iron and demonstrated that the traditional phosphoric indicators as observed during optical microscopy are insufficient. Results were subjected {{to a series of}} comparisons based on settlement size, the inferred social status, and cultural affinities. The results demonstrate the high technological level of iron artefact production across the country. All areas had access to the full range of iron alloys and employed a highly developed range of smithing techniques. <b>Phosphoric</b> <b>iron</b> was a prevalent alloy in this period. Based on these results, a model of the Early Medieval iron industry is generated, suggesting a vibrant economy in which both local and traded irons were significant.

Results showed that out of ten artefacts examined, six were produced in low carbon steel, one from a high carbon steel and three were made from wrought iron. One of the wrought iron armour pieces was fabricated from a <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron,</b> an unusual material for these artefacts. All the steel artefacts exhibited a ferrite-pearlite microstructure. In their manufacture, no attempts had been made at producing martensite by full or slack quenching. All metal fragments contained slag inclusions. The elongated nature of the latter suggested that these artefacts were forged into shape. peer-reviewe...|$|E

The bloom was uncovered in pit No. 551 (pieces of slag and remnants of furnace were found besides the bloom) situated in the area with traces of metallurgical activities. Investigation of the object revealed that the bloom consisted of inhomogeneous phosphorus-rich metal which presumably was not intended for ordinary treatment. The bloom may {{be a result of}} unsuccessful smelting either a semiproduct of a material intended for special purposes. The <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron</b> was used in production of luxury medieval knives for example.

40|$|The {{investigated}} sword {{was lifted}} from the grave No. 723 situated on the acropolis of the Early Medieval stronghold of Mikulčice near by Hodonín. The grave unit was discovered on a small graveyard by the stone foundations of civic palatial building. The sword, which belongs to the Petersen N type, can be dated into the course of last {{three quarters of the}} 9 th century. The sword blade consists of piled steel core and steel (probably but-) welded-on cutting edges (also composed of two or three mutually welded rods).

40|$|Looking at iron slags from Eastern England, {{this thesis}} was {{designed}} to assess the possibility of inferring the ore type in use by the chemical composition of the slag. A number of case studies are examined. The first {{is a group of}} material from the Foulness Valley, East Yorkshire, which is known to be produced from high phosphorus bog ore. This allows direct comparison between this and other assemblages, based on phosphorus content, to infer if bog or bedded ore was in use. Assemblages from Iron Age East Yorkshire, Roman Caistor St Edmund and the Saxon sites of Quarrington and Flixboroughwere examined to infer on ore exploitation and possible metal production. The background examination provides a definition of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>iron</b> based upon its material properties and the parameters which govern the creation of the alloy. Further discussion of ore exploitation and the reasoning behind why smelting sites are more difficult to locate are covered, while the current direction of research is examined. The body of experimental work is discussed with notable case studies drawn upon to demonstrate where the literature concentrates its focus. This allows for the suggestion of future possibilities based upon the impacts of these works. An experimental smelt was carried out in order to inform on the processes and record observations which helped to dictate the choices made on raw material selection. The experimental material was analysed alongside archaeological slags produced from the same ore, and treated {{in the same way as}} the material used in the archaeological case studies. The selection criteria applied to the archaeological assemblages, based on morphology and perceived mass are outlined. A description of the preparation methods for sample examination follows. The physics of electron microscopy are then discussed covering the various effects which govern the generation of the characteristic x-rays which are responsible for the chemical composition data. Each of the case study assemblages are dealt with individually presenting photographs of the pieces before sampling and backscattered electron images of the material. As this is the first scientific analysis conducted upon the Saxon assemblages from Quarrington and Flixborough, the data generated provides critical, new insight into Early Medieval iron production. The data using phase composition and phosphorus content are presented on a site by site basis before being assembled into an overall synthesis which further clarifies the inferences of different ore exploitation. Further comparisons of phosphorus and sulphur content are used to demonstrate the use of the bog ore and Frodingham Ironstone available at Flixborough. The interpretation of the data is then drawn upon for final conclusions and inferences of ore exploitation and the identification of ironstone use at Flixborough which further supports the archaeological and historical evidence for this practice from the 7 th century A.
