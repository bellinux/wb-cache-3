500|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of jus soli (citizenship based on place of birth), the Court held that the Citizenship Clause needed to be {{interpreted}} in light of English common law, which had included as subjects virtually all native-born children, excluding only those who were born to foreign rulers or diplomats, born on foreign public ships, or born to enemy forces engaged in hostile occupation of the country's territory. [...] The court's majority held that the subject to the jurisdiction phrase in the Citizenship Clause excluded from U.S. citizenship only those <b>persons</b> <b>covered</b> by one of these three exceptions (plus a fourth [...] "single additional exception"—namely, that Indian tribes [...] "not taxed" [...] were not considered subject to U.S. jurisdiction). [...] The majority concluded {{that none of these}} four exceptions to U.S. jurisdiction applied to Wong; in particular, they observed that [...] "during all the time of their said residence in the United States, as domiciled residents therein, the said mother and father of said Wong Kim Ark were engaged in the prosecution of business, and were never engaged in any diplomatic or official capacity under the emperor of China".|$|E

Their carriages were stopped and broken; the wheels wrenched off; the glasses shivered to atoms; the panels beaten in; drivers, footmen, and masters, pulled from their seats and rolled in the mud. Lords, commoners, and reverend bishops, with little distinction of person or party, were kicked and pinched and hustled; passed from hand to hand through various stages of ill-usage; and sent to their fellow-senators at last with their clothes hanging in ribands about them, their bagwigs torn off, themselves speechless and breathless, and their <b>persons</b> <b>covered</b> with the powder which had been cuffed and beaten out of their hair. One lord was so long {{in the hands of the}} populace, that the Peers as a body resolved to sally forth and rescue him, and were in the act of doing so, when he happily appeared among them covered with dirt and bruises, and hardly to be recognised by those who knew him best. The noise and uproar were on the increase every moment. The air was filled with execrations, hoots, and howlings. The mob raged and roared, like a mad monster as it was, unceasingly, and each new outrage served to swell its fury.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{government}} subsidizes the employer-based market by an estimated $250 {{billion per year}} (about $1,612 per <b>person</b> <b>covered</b> in the employer market), by excluding health insurance premiums from employee income.
