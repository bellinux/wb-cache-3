25|$|The {{presiding}} officer {{sits in a}} {{chair in}} the front of the Senate chamber. The powers of the presiding officer of the Senate are far less extensive than those of the Speaker of the House. The presiding officer calls on senators to speak (by the rules of the Senate, the first senator who rises is recognized); ruling on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> (objections by senators that a rule has been breached, subject to appeal to the whole chamber); and announcing the results of votes.|$|E
25|$|She also {{presided over}} debates on the constitution, dealing with filibusters and {{numerous}} <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> {{as well as}} discussions over the proposed Energy Security Act, against which the loyal opposition mounted a counter-campaign that culminated in a two-week bell-ringing episode when the Conservatives' Whip refused {{to appear in the}} Commons to indicate that the opposition was ready for a vote. Despite pressure from the government that she intervene to break the deadlock, Sauvé maintained that it was up to the parties to resolve it themselves through negotiation.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Holy See {{was invited}} to observe all open {{meetings}} of the intergovernmental subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly. The Holy See was frequently allowed {{to participate in the}} private negotiations leading to the adoption of the General Assembly's decisions and resolutions. The Holy See was not allowed, however, to co-sponsor draft decisions or resolutions, to make <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> or to exercise the right of reply. If the Holy See wished to circulate written proposals or position papers, it required the assistance of a member state that was willing to present those proposals or papers as its own.|$|E
50|$|A <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> is a {{parliamentary}} motion used {{to remind the}} body of its written rules and established precedents, usually when a particular rule or precedent is not being followed. When a senator raises a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> the presiding officer of the Senate immediately rules on the validity <b>of</b> the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> but this ruling may be appealed to, and reversed by, the whole Senate. Ordinarily, a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> compels the Senate to follow its rules and precedents; however, the Senate may choose to vote down the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order.</b> When this occurs, a new precedent is established, and the old rule or precedent no longer governs Senate procedure. Similarly, {{it is possible to}} raise a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> and state that the standard procedure of the Senate is actually different from what the current rules and precedents suggest. If this <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> is sustained, a new precedent is established, and it controls Senate procedure thenceforth.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> calls {{upon the}} chair to make a ruling. The chair may rule on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> or submit it to the {{judgment}} of the assembly. If the chair accepts the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> it is said to be ruled [...] "well taken". If not, it is said to be ruled [...] "not well taken".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> ends {{when any}} player (or, {{depending}} on local rules, only the dealer, or only the player that called <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>order)</b> announces [...] "end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> order", [...] "point taken", [...] "point of disorder", or [...] "pick your cards up", {{at which point}} the cards are picked back up and play resumes.|$|R
25|$|The Senate {{is led by}} a President and the House by a Speaker whose {{respective}} {{duties and}} prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except {{in the case of}} the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order.</b> As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders.|$|E
25|$|The Government House Leader {{works on}} the government's behalf by {{negotiating}} with the House Leaders of the Opposition parties. This often includes discussion over timetables and may include concessions to demands by opposition parties to ensure quick passage of a bill or opposition support. The position is especially crucial during periods of minority government, when no party has {{a majority in the}} House and the government must rely on the support of one or more Opposition parties to not only pass its legislative agenda but remain in power. The holder of the position must be an expert in parliamentary procedure in order to argue <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> before the Speaker of the House of Commons as well as be a good strategist and tactician in order to outmanoeuvre the opposition parties.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, an {{objection}} {{to a request}} for unanimous consent will compel a vote. While forcing a single vote {{may not be an}} effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece, can be substantial. In addition to objecting to routine requests, senators can force votes through motions to adjourn and through quorum calls. Quorum calls are meant to establish {{the presence or absence of}} a constitutional quorum, but senators routinely use them to waste time while waiting for the next speaker to come to the floor or for leaders to negotiate off the floor. In those cases, a senator asks for unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call. If another senator objects, the clerk must continue to call the roll of senators, just as they would with a vote. If a call shows no quorum, the minority can force another vote by moving to request or compel the attendance of absent senators. Finally, senators can force votes by moving to adjourn, or by raising specious <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> and appealing the ruling of the chair.|$|E

500|$|In 1955, the Tories, {{through a}} {{determined}} filibuster, {{were able to}} defeat amendments to the Defence Procurement Act, which would have made temporary, extraordinary powers granted to the government permanent. Drew led the Tories in a second battle with the government the following year: in the so-called [...] "Pipeline Debate", the government invoked closure repeatedly in a weeks-long debate which ended with the Speaker ignoring <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> as he had the division bells rung. Both measures were closely associated with Howe, which, in combination with his earlier comments, led to Tory claims that Howe was indifferent to the democratic process.|$|E
500|$|Henry Cornelius Burnett (October 25, 1825 – October 1, 1866) was a U.S. Representative {{from the}} state of Kentucky and a Confederate States senator. A lawyer by profession, Burnett had held only one public office—circuit court clerk—before being elected to Congress. He {{represented}} Kentucky's 1st congressional district immediately prior to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Unionist newspaper editor George D. Prentice described Burnett as [...] "a big, burly, loud-mouthed fellow who is forever raising <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> and objections, to embarrass the Republicans in the House".|$|E

2500|$|The Senate also {{experimented with}} {{a rule that}} removed the need to speak {{on the floor in}} order to {{filibuster}} (a [...] "talking filibuster"), thus allowing for [...] "virtual filibusters". [...] Another tactic, the post-cloture filibuster—which used <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> to delay legislation because they were not counted as part of the limited time allowed for debate—was rendered ineffective by a rule change in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|The Speaker of the Senate is {{historically}} responsible for deciding on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> only once risen by another Senator. [...] However, with the 1991 {{amendments to the}} Standing Orders and Guidelines that govern the Senate of Canada, the Speakership has generally begun to assert its right to intervene, where appropriate, without being prompted to do so. [...] Therefore, the Speaker is, broadly speaking, responsible {{for the maintenance of}} order and decorum in the Senate.|$|E

However Labour MPs resented his presence in the Chair and cheered whenever he was succeeded by another Deputy. In October 1961 he announced he would stand down at the next election. When, in December 1961, Touche mistakenly announced an opposition victory in a House of Commons division, a long succession of <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> forced him to adjourn the House for [...] "grave disorder". The Speaker again backed his deputy.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the UN General Assembly {{confirmed}} the Vatican's {{status as a}} Permanent Observer.

It has the right to participate in all meetings open to all Member States, the right to make <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> and to exercise the right of reply, the right to circulate proposals and position papers as official documents, and the right to co-sponsor draft resolutions and decisions. Commenting on its status, Archbishop Celestino Migliore, the then Holy See Permanent Observer to the United Nations, said [...] "We have no vote because this is our choice." [...] He added that the Holy See considers that its current status [...] "is a fundamental step that does not close any path for the future. The Holy See has the requirements defined by the UN statute to be a member state and, if in the future it wished to be so, this resolution would not impede it from requesting it." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{point of}} {{endurance}} the session {{was one of}} the most remarkable on record. The House of Commons sat 154 days and for 1400 hours; some 240 of these hours were after midnight. Only three times since the Reform bill had the House sat for more days; only once, in 1847, had the total number of hours been exceeded and that only by seven, and never before had the House sat so many hours after midnight. On the Coercion bill the House sat continuously once for 22 hours, and once for 41. The debates on the Land bill took up 58 sittings, and the Coercion bill 22. No such length of discussion, Mr. Gladstone told the Queen, (M24) was recorded on any measure since the committee on the first Reform bill. The Reform bill of 1867 was the only measure since 1843 that took as many as 35 days of debate. The Irish Church bill took 21 days and the Land bill of 1870 took 25. Of the 14,836 speeches delivered, 6315 were made by Irish members. The Speaker and chairman of committees interposed on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> nearly 2000 times during the session. Mr. Parnell, the Speaker notes, “with his minority of 24 dominates the House. When will the House take courage and reform its procedure?” After all, the suspension of habeas corpus is a thing that men may well think it worth while to fight about, and a revolution in a country’s land-system might be expected to take up a good deal of time.|$|E
