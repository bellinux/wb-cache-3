Farming covered personal needs, mostly potato, cabbage, beans, beet and less wheat, barley, oat and corn.

50|$|Lobo was an American wolf {{who lived}} in the Currumpaw valley in New Mexico. During the 1890s, Lobo and his pack, having been {{deprived}} of their natural prey by settlers, turned to the settlers' livestock. The ranchers tried to kill Lobo and his pack by poisoning carcasses, but the wolves removed the poisoned pieces and threw them aside. They tried to kill the wolves with traps and by hunting parties but these efforts also failed. Ernest Thompson Seton was tempted by the challenge and the $1000 bounty for Lobo's head, the leader of the pack. Seton tried poisoning five baits, carefully covering traces of human scent, and setting them out in Lobo's territory. The following day all the baits were gone, and Seton assumed Lobo would be dead. Later, however, he found the five baits all in a <b>pile</b> <b>covered</b> by dirt and stones to show his disgust at Seton, for which Lobo was responsible.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} natural wind drying of willow (Salix viminalis) stems in large piles was investigated. A simple drying model was {{developed}} for stems. Large-scale drying experiments were conducted and drying data were statistically analysed. Whether drying {{in a pile of}} willow stems was uniform was investigated. After harvest (between November and April), during storage until August the average pile moisture content was reduced from about 1. 0 to between 0. 2 and 0. 3 kg (water) kg- 1 (DM), which approximates to the equilibrium moisture content. Moisture diffusion within a willow stem is a long-term process which is governed by the relative air humidity and ambient temperature. Evaporation of moisture at the outside of a willow stem is a short-term process which is governed by rainfall, wind and global radiation. Within a single willow stem, during the summer the moisture content becomes more or less uniform. In a pile of willow stems, drying is uniform, except for the top of the pile which forms {{only a small part of}} the <b>pile.</b> <b>Covering</b> the <b>pile</b> is not necessary.

50|$|Dik-diks are monogamous, and {{conflicts}} between territorial neighbors are rare.

Monogamy in dik-diks may be an evolutionary response to predation; surrounded by predators, it is dangerous to explore, looking for new partners. Pairs spend about 64% of their time together.

40|$|Moisture is {{the most}} {{important}} factor influencing the quality and calorific value of fuel wood. Drying models for estimating the optimal storage time based on average moisture change in fuel wood stacks stored outdoors have been developed for different stem wood piles. Models are an easy option for making an estimate of the moisture content of an energy wood pile if compared with sampling and measuring the moisture of samples. In this study, stem wood models were validated against data from forest companies. Fourteen reference <b>piles</b> of <b>covered</b> pine stem wood and 8 piles of uncovered pine stem wood were studied. The results of the validation are promising. The difference between the measured and modelled moisture was on average only 0. 3 % with <b>covered</b> <b>piles</b> and 2. 5 % with uncovered piles. The models presented can be implemented in every location in Finland, because the Finnish Meteorological Institute has a database for interpolated meteorological observations covering the whole country in a 10 km x 10 km grid. For international use, model parameters need to be estimated case by case, but it should also be possible to implement the approach itself worldwide...|$|R

50|$|The first screwpile {{lighthouse}} type {{built in}} the United States was at Brandywine Shoal, Delaware Bay, an area served by a lightship since 1823 and an ordinary straightpile lighthouse which stood briefly there in 1828 but was destroyed by ice. Major Hartman Bache, a distinguished engineer of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, began work in 1848 and completed the task in 1850, at a construction cost of $53,317. Alexander Mitchell served as consultant. The screwpiles were turned by a 4-foot capstan worked by 30 men. To protect the structure from ice floes an ice-breaker consisting of a pier of 30 iron screwpiles 23 feet long and five inches in diameter was screwed down into the bottom and interconnected at their heads above the water reinforcing them together. Subsequently, though, the use of caisson lighthouses proved more durable in locations subject to ice.Screwpile lighthouses were relatively inexpensive, easy to construct, and comparatively quick to build. They became especially popular after the Civil War when the Lighthouse Board adopted a policy to replace inside (bays, sounds, and rivers) light vessels with screwpile lighthouses. Most screwpile lighthouses were made with iron piles, though a few were made with wooden <b>piles</b> <b>covered</b> with metal screw sleeves (these sleeves were probably adopted because they were less expensive and easier to insert into the bottom, plus the sleeve protected the wood from marine-boring invertebrates). The typical screwpile lighthouse was hexagonal or octagonal in plan consisting of a central pile which was set first and then the six or eight perimeter piles were screwed in place around it.|$|R
