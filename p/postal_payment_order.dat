40|$|The study {{offers a}} summary on major <b>postal</b> <b>payment</b> {{services}} in the domestic payment market. In addition to their share based on volume, {{the importance of these}} services lies in that more than one-fourth to one-third of Hungarians does not have a bank account (bank relationship), meaning that for these people <b>postal</b> <b>payment</b> services are basically the only means to handle their payment transactions, to pay their bills, and to collect their pension or social benefits. <b>Postal</b> <b>payment</b> services are unique in that they are provided by a single domestic service provider. The study is fact finding and descriptive in nature, for it takes account of all products featured in <b>postal</b> <b>payment</b> {{services in the}} domestic market, it shows the processes by which they are executed, and - from 1998 - it analyses the turnover of these products and compares it to those of the banks, along with a comparison of demand for <b>postal</b> <b>payment</b> services in Hungary and elsewhere. The study uses this approach to make a contribution to efforts made in the research of payment services in Hungary and to provide information to those interested...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Payment</b> <b>orders</b> are post-contract {{instruments}} {{often used}} to pay fee agreements to agents and usually contain {{conditions for the payment}} to be met such as successful completion of contract requirements. <b>Payment</b> <b>orders</b> with [...] "conditions" [...] {{should not be confused with}} [...] "conditional payment orders." [...] Conditional <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> are pre-contract instruments consisting of a documented fee agreement between the beneficiary and the payer, proof of ability for the payer to pay which is often issued by Swift MT799 to the recipient's bank, and occasionally may include bank instructions for the establishment of a <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> following contract execution. Either <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> or conditional <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> are assumed to be irrevocable unless otherwise stated. <b>Payment</b> <b>orders</b> with conditions may be established after signing of a contract and posting of a letter of credit or other financial instrument with the paying bank but are never put in place prior to contract execution because of the risk that the contract will not materialize.|$|R

Electronic <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> is presented as an institution able to help the Czech judiciary system within the shortened civil procedure by {{the application of the}} computerization of civil procedure.

I provided a brief account of the development and contemporary trends related to the computerization of justice and I approached the individual institutions which I regarded as appropriate to mention {{in order to understand the}} given institution within the whole context. The third chapter deals with reasons for which the institution was implemented into the Czech legal system. I carried out a detail analysis of the explanatory report to the Act introducing the institution of electronic <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> and I made an effort to outline the main reasons for the amendment and to arrange the objectives intended to be achieved by the implementation of the new institution.

50|$|<b>Payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow was a {{practice}} pioneered by Bernard Madoff, {{and the practice}} has long been controversial. However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow, the New York Stock Exchange sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow on its electronic exchange(s).The NYSE is proposing to pay for limit orders {{in order to put}} more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow that pays only for market <b>orders.</b> <b>Payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the tick size and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, <b>payments</b> for <b>order</b> flow were much larger than they became after 2001 when the tick size in U.S. markets fell to one cent. Larry Harris reports that in 1997, 24% of E-Trade's transaction revenue came from <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow, but that by the second quarter of 2001 such payments accounted for only 15% of transaction revenue.|$|R

40|$|Paying {{bills with}} the {{universal}} <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> {{is very common}} in these days. It is used to pay bills in banks, post offices or at home, {{with the use of}} web banks and mobile banks on smart phones. To use the universal <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> in <b>payment,</b> it is necessary to read the data from it and enter the data in program for work with orders. The users of web and mobile banks and bank employees mostly do the data entering manually, by typing every character with their hands, which can be quite time-consuming task. Because the main goal of every bank is to simplify things for its costumers, we decided in cooperation with Banka Koper, to develop a system which would enable simple use of <b>payment</b> <b>order.</b> The system would be able to read the universal <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> data from its image and fill in the program for work with orders, so there would be no need of manually filling the data. This system is presented in this thesis. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we present the universal <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> and look trough some of the existing similar systems and present some of them. In the second part the development of the system and used technologies and methods are presented. In this part, the preprocessing of the image, used to find the fields we are interested in is presented. The optical character recognition of the data inside these fields is also presented in this part. The last part of the thesis looks over results that the system gives us and the future planned work and improvements. ...|$|R

Due to the longer effectiveness of the European <b>order</b> for <b>payment</b> regulation we were able in this work to evaluate experience with its application and the case law. A number of identical features of <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> {{have been identified in}} the work, such as their speed of the procedure, optionality, issue without the hearing of the opposing party and their cancellation after objections against them. Differences have also been identified, mainly in the scope of application, different use in cross-border cases, different demand on the scope of evidence in the proposal for issue, the structure of the procedure as one or a two step and different time limits for filing of objections...|$|R
