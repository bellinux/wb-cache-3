5|$|In 1909, President-elect Taft {{announced}} his intent to nominate Senator Philander C. Knox to be Secretary of State. Shortly after the announcement, the Clause {{emerged as a}} problem that caught those involved by surprise: Knox had been elected to serve a term that would not end until 1911, and during that term Congress had voted to increase executive branch pay. Members of Congress considered reverting the fix after the appointed nominee had resigned and assumed the post so that Knox {{would not have to}} forgo any emoluments. Members of Congress also discussed reverting the salaries of all United States Cabinet members. At the suggestion of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Congress passed a bill reducing only the Secretary of State's salary to the level it had been at before Knox's term began, believing this would cure the problem. The Senate passed the bill unanimously, but there was much more opposition in the U.S. House of Representatives, where the same measure failed to get a required two-thirds vote under a motion to suspend the rules and pass, a procedure normally reserved for uncontroversial matters. After a different <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> was applied, it passed by a 173–115 majority vote and President Roosevelt subsequently signed the bill. On March 4, the first Saxbe fix became effective when the salary of the Secretary of State (but not that of other Cabinet members) was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000. The Senate confirmed all of Taft's Cabinet appointees on March 5, and Knox took office on March 6.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{to his old}} role as Executive Secretary, Truesdale {{pushed the}} board to re-establish Rule 76–1, a <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> {{established}} by the Board in 1976. The rule required that, if {{three members of the}} Board had agreed to a draft opinion and no dissent had yet circulated, the opinion would be issued within two weeks if no dissent was circulated within that time. On September 30, Truesdale formally asked the Board to re-establish the rule, but the Board declined in favor of other approaches to improve the speed with which decisions were issued.|$|E
40|$|The <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> of {{international}} courts {{are key to}} the ability of such courts to adjudicate questions of shared responsibility. These <b>procedural</b> <b>rules,</b> as well as the practice {{of international}} courts, vary widely and have not yet been subject of systematic study. To provide a basis for studying the degree in which international courts can effectively adjudicate claims against multiple responsible actors, this contribution will provide an analytical framework. This framework consists of four elements: a definition of ‘shared responsibility’ and ‘procedural rules of international adjudication’; a typology of <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> that are relevant to judicial handling of questions of shared responsibility; an identification of <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> that are specific to questions of shared responsibility, and of those <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> that are more generally typical for multilateral dispute settlement; and an identification of factors that account for differences between international courts in terms of their ability to handle questions of shared responsibility...|$|R

500|$|His {{popularity}} as governor, and Indiana's {{status as}} a critical swing state, helped him secure the Democratic vice presidential nomination on a ticket with Wilson in 1912 and win the subsequent general election. [...] An ideological rift developed {{between the two men}} during their first term, leading Wilson to limit Marshall's influence in the administration, and his brand of humor caused Wilson to move Marshall's office away from the White House. During Marshall's second term he delivered morale-boosting speeches across the nation during World War I and became the first vice president to hold cabinet meetings, which he did while Wilson was in Europe. As he was president of the United States Senate, a small number of anti-war senators kept it deadlocked by refusing to end debate. To enable critical wartime legislation to be passed, Marshall had the body adopt its first <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> allowing filibusters to be ended by a two-thirds majority vote—a variation of this rule remains in effect.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, Elijah Harper, a Cree from Red Sucker Lake, Manitoba, {{became the}} first [...] "Treaty Indian" [...] in Manitoba to be elected {{as a member of}} the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. In 1990, Harper {{achieved}} national fame by holding an eagle feather as he refused to accept the Meech Lake Accord, a constitutional amendment package negotiated to gain Quebec's acceptance of the Constitution Act, 1982, but also one that did not address any First Nations grievances. The accord was negotiated in 1987 without the input of Canada's Aboriginal peoples. The third, final constitutional conference on Aboriginal peoples was also unsuccessful. The Manitoba assembly was required to unanimously consent to a motion allowing it to hold a vote on the accord, because of a <b>procedural</b> <b>rule.</b> Twelve days before the ratification deadline for the Accord, Harper began a filibuster that prevented the assembly from ratifying the accord. Because Meech Lake failed in Manitoba, the proposed constitutional amendment failed. Harper also opposed the Charlottetown Accord in 1992, even though Assembly of First Nations Chief Ovide Mercredi supported it.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction. By {{virtue of}} Council Regulation No. 1 / 2003, as of 1 st May 2004 the full {{application}} of EC competition law will be entrusted to national competition authorities (hereinafter NCAs) and national courts. The bold reform of EC competition law enforcement adheres {{to the system}} of executive federalism 1 which characterises the EC legal system. The repartition of competences within the Community allocates implementation of Community law mainly at Member States level. Pursuant to Article 10 EC, {{they are responsible for}} the implementation of the measures which have been adopted at Community level for the achievement of the objectives specified in the EC Treaty. Consequently, the attainment of the Community objectives depends very much upon the cooperation of national authorities, which act in accordance with their own national <b>procedural</b> <b>rules.</b> 2 The various national <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> present themselves as conduits through which Community law is implemented and enforced. While as a rule Community law is not designed to alter national <b>procedural</b> <b>rules,</b> the Community legal order cannot afford to leave national <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> untouched when they are liable to hamper the effective application of Community law [...] For reason of space, this contribution intends only to highlight some aspects of Regulation No. 1 / 2003 with regard to which general principles of Community law are able to condition national <b>procedural</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{calls for}} a {{complete}} re-conceptualization of the <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> governing modern litigation. Specifically, it suggests that litigants ought {{to be given the}} opportunity to customize their litigation experience—that <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> should be treated as default rules from which parties can mutually negotiate deviations. Although they are not typically labeled as such, modest examples of customization already occur both within the rules of civil procedure and extra-judicially. This article argues that much greater tailoring is possible, and it suggests three criteria for assessing how much deviation from the current baseline is tolerable. This article argues that a judicial system that presents an opportunity for customized litigation would be more procedurally just, more efficient, and more accessible than one with only a set of non-negotiable <b>procedural</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R
