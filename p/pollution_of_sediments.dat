Treated, but partly also untreated sewage of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland is discharged into Vidy bay (Lake Geneva) resulting in high levels of contamination in this part of the lake. In the present work we have studied the prevalence of multiresistant bacteria and resistance genes in the wastewater stream of Lausanne. Samples from hospital and municipal raw sewage, treated effluent from Lausanne’s wastewater treatment plant (WTP) as well as lake water and sediment samples obtained close to the WTP outlet pipe and a remote site close to a drinking water pump were evaluated for the prevalence of multiresistant bacteria. Selected isolates were identified (16 S rRNA gene fragment sequencing) and characterized with regards to further resistances, resistance genes, and plasmids.

The data coming from the analysis of the collected samples have been utilised to determine the distribution of the contaminants in the whole lagoon area by using a geostatistical method. The distribution of the following contaminants have been estimated: heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, As, Hg and Cu) and organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, polychlorinated biphenyl, hydrocarbons, chlorinated pesticides) in confrontation to the Italian standard limits. Dedicated software, such as Surfer and ArcView, has been applied to produce thematic maps. In particular, Surfer has been utilised, to put in evidence the iso-concentration lines obtained after application of kriging. ArcView, software to implement a Geographic Information System, allowed lying out the contaminant distribution in the real geographic co-ordinates. A statistic analysis of data has been carried out in order to calculate average, variance, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value of the considered variables. The correlation between the contaminants has been computed and the analysis of the principal components of the variables has been carried out. The obtained maps show that the heavy metal pollution (characterised by huge concentrations especially of Cu, As, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) is enhanced in the areas close to the industrial site of Porto Marghera. Furthermore, a relevant chromium contamination has been found in the sediments of the south part of the Venice lagoon, probably coming from to leather industries located in the surroundings the Brenta River now flowing in sea close to the mouth of the same lagoon. The distribution of nickel presents a spot concentration, as ascertained by a singular sample. The contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and hydrocarbons is concentrated in the sediments of the central and south area of the lagoon closer the coastline. Finally, the contamination by chlorinated pesticides increases from the continental border to the coast line {{as a result of the}} constraints in the use of some herbicides, imposed by the Venice rules in last times, which allowed to obtain less contaminant charge drained from the basin surrounding the Venice lagoon.

This might cause the majority of the European surface waters not to reach the aims set by the European water framework directive (WFD). It is thus not astonishing that recently, the assessment of sediment and dredged material gained more and more attention and that new concepts have been developed such as clearly defined Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for sediments and biota. While sediment assessment originally simply based on classical, instrumental methods (e. g. high resolution gas chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS)), these methods due to their lacking information on sediment toxicity today are often connected to ecotoxicological and ecological methods. However, those methods often exhibit relatively unspecific endpoints (e. g. growth inhibition) and thus do not allow for a comparison to concentrations measured via HRGC/HRMS. Because many of the toxic effects of DLCs are mediated via the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and the strengths of activation of the AhR constitutes a specific endpoint of many cell-based in vitro bioassays, these methods are of increasing interest to regulators and risk assessors. Biological equivalent quotients (BEQs) deduced from such assays are directly comparable to toxicity equivalents (TEQs) of HRGC/HRMS analyses. The DioRAMA project is a joint research initiative between the Institute of Environmental Research at the RWTH Aachen University and the Department G 3 of the German Federal Institute of Hydrology in Koblenz. Its main goal was to establish in vitro tools for the assessment of DLCs in sediment and biota to improve current risk assessment approaches. Therefore, the present thesis investigated (1) the sensitivity of various in vitro bioassays, the suitability of certain in vitro assays to be used (2) as regulatory tools, (3) to screen the uptake of DLCs by fish and (4) to be used as prioritizing tools for sediment and soil extracts. (4) Finally, the bioavailability of certain DLCs was investigated. A literature study proved the applicability of various in vitro bioassays for the screening of DLCs in a multitude of complex samples, individual compounds and mixtures. To be capable of screening trace contaminants such as DLCs, in vitro bioassays have to be comparably sensitive like instrumental techniques. The literature data reviled that some of the in vitro bioassays approximated the sensitivity limits of chemical analytical methods (~ 0. 1 pM dioxin) and hence suggests the potential suitability of these assays to be used as additionally regulatory tools. To verify this assumption, three in vitro bioassays (RTL-W 1 EROD, H 4 IIE-luc and H 4 IIE Micro EROD assay) were investigated with regard to their possible implementation into German guidelines for the management of dredged material. Evaluations of intra- and inter-laboratory performance and predicative power of the used bioassays based on extracts of sediments, differently contaminated with DLCs. Except the high sample throughput (RTL-W 1 EROD) and the high linear range (H 4 IIE-luc), the H 4 IIE Micro EROD assay showed the overall best performance among the three assays and had a similar predictive power like HRGC/HRMS analyses. The H 4 IIE Micro EROD assay was highly sensitive and showed a satisfying repeatability and cross-laboratory reproducibility, independent of sample complexity. Hence, the H 4 IIE Micro EROD assay was proven to be highly suitable for the analysis of DLCs and to be used as ptential regulatory tool in the sediment management. In a further study, the uptake of sediment-borne DLCs by common roach, a fish of high ecological relevance, was chemically and bio-chemically investigated using the same differently contaminated sediment samples (see above) as exposure media. Fish was either exposed to black worm - inoculated sediments (dietary eposure) or daily fed with uncontaminated worms. Both chemical and bio-chemical investigations of whole fish extracts predominantly revealed an uptake of sediment-borne DLCs by fish, independent of the sediment DLC contamination degree. BEQs indicated the uptake to be promoted by (1) the suspended matter concentration in the water column and (2) the additional ingestion of feed/sediment (only relevant for the sediment of highest DLC contamination). While this study proved the applicability of the Micro EROD assay for challenging sample matrices such as whole fish homogenates, another study, which chemically and biochemically investigated sediment and soil samples from the river Elbe catchment area, proved the H 4 IIE Micro EROD assays’ applicability to be used as high throughput screening tool for large sample sets. Samples of highest EROD-inducing potential, even though raw extracts (missing clean-up) were investigated, corresponded well to the via HRGC/HRMS detected contamination hotspots along the river. A H 4 IIE Micro EROD assay based limit value was deduced from the DLC concentrations of the river Elbe sediment samples and might point towards a future yes/no-decision-level in German guidelines for dredged material. A final study investigated the bioavailabilty of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A tenax desorption experiment was meant to close the gap between instrumental and toxicological results. It was shown that the cumulative concentrations of PAHs desorbing from the four differently contaminated sediments corresponded well to (1) the initial PAH concentrations in sediments, (2) to the effects observed in fish eggs of D. rerio and (3) to a certain extend to RTL-W 1 BEQs. This indicated the higher contaminated sediments to pose a potentially higher threat to the aquatic environment. The present findings might contribute to future regulatory decisions in a way that in vitro bioassays such as the Micro EROD assay could be implemented into German guidelines for dredged material to be used as an additional quality measure alongside classically used instrumental analysis and this way could significantly improve current sediment assessment strategies...|$|E

Total butyltin concentrations in sediments from the marina {{of the city of}} Gdynia ranged between 130 and 20000 ng Sn/g dry wt. with a mean value of 2900 ng Sn/g. In sediments collected from the marinas located {{in the area of the}} Brave Vistula River Channel BT concentrations ranged between 10 to 15000 ng Sn/g dry wt. with a mean values between 500 and 5500 ng Sn/g, and the innermost sites of each of four marinas were the most polluted. The mean BT concentrations in three-spined stickleback were between 1500 and 3100 ng Sn/g wet wt. and the values followed mean concentrations noted in sediments from the corresponding marina. The pleasure yachts are identified as the main source <b>of</b> BT <b>pollution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> and fish. Tributyltin was a major form of BTs present in sediments (between 24 and 43 %) and in three-spined stickleback (between 54 and 70 %), suggesting a very recent use of marine paints containing TBT in pleasure yachts. Evidently at the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea TBT was continuously used in 1997 in marine paints for boats less then 25 m long...|$|R
