40|$|Depository banks perform two functions: {{extending}} {{credit and}} <b>performing</b> <b>liquidity</b> services. This entails financing loans with demandable deposits. Unfortunately, this leaves the bank vulnerable if depositors decide to quickly withdraw en masse. Deposit insurance has been {{employed as a}} solution to bank runs, but it entails moral hazard costs of its own. Narrow banking is a system under which the two functions are performed by two different sets of firms, such as finance companies (lending) and money market mutual funds (liquidity). If non-bank lenders (NBFIs) can provide stable credit in the face of adverse credit market shocks, narrow banking may provide an escape from the bank run versus moral hazard dilemma. Analysis indicates that, unfortunately, the lending of NBFIs is quite unstable relative to deposit bank credit. JEL Code N 2 2 I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates bank-specific and {{macroeconomic}} {{factors that}} determine the liquidity of Indian banks. To explore the association, we perform OLS, fixed effect and random effect estimates on a data set of 59 banks from 2000 to 2013. Studied bank-specific factors include bank size, profitability, cost of funding, capital adequacy and deposits. GDP, inflation and unemployment are the macroeconomic factors considered. We also <b>perform</b> <b>liquidity</b> trend analysis of Indian banks based on ownership. Findings reveal that bank ownership affects liquidity of banks. Based on panel data analysis, {{we suggest that}} bank-specific (except cost of funding) and macroeconomic (except unemployment) factors significantly affect bank liquidity. These include bank size, deposits, profitability, capital adequacy, GDP and inflation. Further, bank size and GDP {{were found to have}} a negative effect on bank liquidity. On the other hand, deposits, profitability, capital adequacy and inflation showed a positive effect on bank liquidity. Cost of funding and unemployment showed an insignificant effect on bank liquidity. Our paper highlights new facts for enhanced understanding of liquidity in emerging economies like India...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies on}} the role of banks have {{suggested}} that banks took the role of a broker or an asset transformer when <b>performing</b> their <b>liquidity</b> function. The extent of brokerage or asset transformation function was viewed from how banks managed their assets and liabilities. Although studies to illustrate the role of banks are not few, we proposed to characterize the role of the broker and asset transformer. In this sturdy we developed an index to measure the extent {{of the role of the}} bank in an uncertain interest rate and cost of fund environment. By looking at the decision making process involve in granting a loan commitment to existing clients of the banks, we conduct a preliminary sturdy to ensure that the index is operational. The results indicated that the bank perform the role of a broker in a volatile interest rate and high penalty rate environment. The results also suggested that banks perform the role of an asset transformer when the costs of fund are high. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crises are closely connected with spread changes and liquidity issues. After defining and addressing spread considerations, we {{research in this}} paper the topic of liquidity issues in times of economic crisis. We analyse the <b>liquidity</b> effects as <b>recorded</b> on spreads of securities from different markets. We stipulate that higher international risk aversion in times of {{financial crises}} coincides with widening security spreads. The paper then introduces liquidity as a risk factor into the standard value-at-risk framework, using GARCH methodology. The comparison of results of these models suggests {{that the size of}} the tested markets does not have a strong effect on the models. Thus, we find that spread analysis is an appropriate tool for analysing liquidity issues during a financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} an impact {{assessment}} of the consolidation exercise {{on the performance of}} commercial banks in Nigeria. While prior studies focused on the financial performance of banks (with emphasis on profitability), the main thrust of this study was on how the consolidation exercise had affected different areas of commercial banks in Nigeria other than profitability. Secondary data were sourced from the annual accounts and statistical bulletins of the CBN and SEC respectively for the relevant years. The data obtained were analysed by means of sensitivity analysis, in addition to the correlation and regression analyses. The results obtained show that the consolidation exercise had positive impact on the selected variables (Non <b>Performing</b> Loans, <b>Liquidity</b> Ratio, Bank Credit to Private Sector and Bank Capital To Asset Ratio) for this study. Based on the above findings, we recommend among others that while efforts are made by the CBN to sustain the increased capital base of banks, a very sound corporate governance framework and effective risk management systems must be put in place to check the level of non-performing loans which seem to be predominant in the industry. The quality of bank credit to private sector and their recovery procedures should also be improved upon...|$|R

State Bank of Pakistan indicated that during 2008 - 2010 the profitability of banks were improved overall as the liquidity was enhanced during 2003 - 2005. But as per {{the results of this}} research the profitability of banks is decreased after M&A during 2009 - 2011. It is the clear sign to the banks who want to go for M&A transactions that under M&A banks do not <b>performed</b> well.

40|$|FLNG is a {{new type}} of {{floating}} LNG platform which is ship-shaped FPSO hull equipped with LNG storage tanks and liquefaction plants and has been developed as an alternative to long pipelines to LNG liquefaction plant on land for stranded offshore fields. Different to the conventional FPSO, the hydrodynamic performance of the being-proposed FLNG can be significantly affected by the inner-tank liquid sloshing, {{due to the fact that}} LNG <b>performs</b> better <b>liquidity</b> than crude oil. In order to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of FLNG with large hull and high center of gravity, a series of numerical simulations on an FLNG designed by CNOOC and MARIC were conducted with the help of the well-known code WADAM. In addition, corresponding model tests on the same vessel with solid ballast were completed, serving as a verification of the numerical simulations. In order to inspect the sloshing effects of inner tanks on the global motion responses of the FLNG vessel, model tests with liquid ballast were also conducted. Comparisons were made between numerical and experimental results with methods of Fast Fourier Transformation technology and spectral analysis. The numerical simulation results were in good accordance with those of the model tests, which proves the feasibility of the numerical simulations. Furthermore, the effects of the inner tank sloshing on the FLNG hydrodynamic characteristics were summed up. Conclusions obtained from the comparison results would be of significant importance for the design of the FLNG system...|$|R

Evolution of the traded volumes in the continuous market is modelled as a function of factors supposedly <b>performing</b> as key <b>liquidity</b> drivers. This market has steadily grown in number of participants and traded volumes, but still is very far from the levels reached by the most mature European markets (Nord Pool and EEX). Liquidity in the continuous market is favoured by the dominant and fast growing "Over The Counter " (OTC) market, by OTC cleared volumes in the futures market, and by the enrollment of financial agents. Supervision of this market and the regulated forward contracting mechanisms of power and gas in the Iberian Energy Market has been successful. Stronger cooperation between Iberian financial and energy regulators will bring oversight gains, especially for the OTC power market. New Spanish energy derivatives clearing houses and European legislative developments about market integrity and transparency in energy markets will contribute to stronger oversight...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the basic}} goals of {{financial}} management is to provide financial property and capital for running of the firm, {{as well as for}} its development, that means provide optimal firmÂ´s liquidity. To improve liquidity is possible provide through various ways. In present time there is increasing importance of financial planning., where planning of liquidity presents one of its integral part. Therefore I deal in presented paper with possible liquidity improvement through calculation of financial planning in chosen slovac magnesite firm, exploitating and elaborating magnesite raw material. For creating of financial plann of liquidity I chosed to use one of the practical methods - method of financial indexes. Such method presents process of planning optimal liquidity with providing of required rentability. Such plann must provide balance between income and outcome, as well as secure achievment of expected profit. I used tools of financial planning for calculation of possible liquidity improvement in mentioned firm, where present financial situation is characterised by law liquidity, but high rentability. Such position presents transitive crisis situation, therefore firm must create new financial property or decrease liabilities, in order to overcome negative state of <b>liquidity.</b> <b>Performed</b> calculation showed, that change in balance sheet due to the growth of financial property will improve liquidity, rentability will be maintained, therefore firm will be able to transit from crisis situation.

40|$|The asset pricing {{anomalies}} {{have existed}} in the UK stock market for a long time. This thesis aims to study different liquidity measures, liquidity commonality, systematic liquidity risk, different momentum trading strategies, asset pricing risks with momentum, investor behaviours with momentum and the causal link between financial crisis and asset pricing anomalies using various methods and tests. The first empirical chapter examines {{the performance of the}} standard Sharpe- Lintner CAPM, the Fama-French three factor model, and the four factor model of Carhart (1997) both with, and without, the first component of multiple illiquidity measures. The results show that no individual illiquidity proxy outperforms the others, and further that the illiquidity proxies have a systematic common illiquidity component. The results also reveal that the inclusion of the illiquidity factor in the capital asset pricing model plays a significant role in explaining the crosssectional variation in stock returns. The second empirical chapter analyses the relationship between momentum profits and stock market illiquidity. This study finds negative and significant relationship between aggregate market illiquidity and momentum profits. The model applied in this chapter captures significant bounce in varying beta coe cients changing over time. The analysis also indicates that the stocks associated with high <b>liquidity</b> <b>performs</b> better relative to illiquid stocks under systemic shocks. The final empirical chapter investigated momentum anomaly and the hypothesis that individual investors trade differently from institutional investors and significantly overreact to economic shocks, creating destabilising effect in the stock market. The results reveal that stock market ineffi ciency is driven and dominated by individual investors' anchoring and adjustment biases as well as institutional investors' cognitive biases. There are several implications for this work. The findings may be useful for both individual and institutional investors and regulators in similar markets beyond the UK, for example, the other European markets. In this study, we show that abnormal stock performance during liquidity crisis is, in part, predictable, and investors can construct portfolios of stocks that better withstand liquidity shocks. For individual investors, they can maximise their profits by holding momentum portfolios at a short horizon. For institutional investors, they might take advantage of professional expertise in making abnormal profits. Policy makers are expected to pay special attention to the differences in trading by financial institutions and individual investors...|$|R
