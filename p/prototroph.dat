50|$|In genetics, {{a strain}} {{is said to}} be auxotrophic if it carries a {{mutation}} that renders it unable to synthesize an essential compound. For example, a yeast mutant with an inactivated uracil synthesis pathway gene is a uracil auxotroph (e.g., if the yeast Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene is inactivated, the resultant strain is a uracil auxotroph). Such a strain is unable to synthesize uracil and will only be able to grow if uracil can be taken up from the environment. This is the opposite of a uracil <b>prototroph,</b> or in this case a wild-type strain, which can still grow in the absence of uracil. Auxotrophic genetic markers are often used in molecular genetics; they were famously used in Beadle and Tatum's Nobel prize-winning work on the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis.|$|E

Ultraviolet light, N-nitroso-N′-methyl-N-nitrosoguanidine, and N-nitroso-N-methylurethane were {{effective}} mutagens which induced stable auxotrophs. N-nitroso-N-methylurethane produced the largest number and variety of mutants. Nitrous acid and hydroxylamine were ineffective as mutagens although they killed C. albicans. All mutagenic agents employed induced colonial variants, especially small colony forms. The morphology, physiology, and virulence of one methionine and two adenine auxotrophs was {{compared to that of}} the <b>prototroph.</b> The auxotrophs exhibited yeast-like morphology in complex media and had sugar fermentation patterns typical of C. albicans, and all were agglutinated by C. albicans antiserum. Chlamydospore production was absent in the nonpigmented adenine mutant, and the chlamydospores produced by the methionine auxotroph were distorted. Germ tubes were formed in human serum by the auxotrophs and <b>prototroph.</b> Virulence for mice was retained by all auxotrophs but generally at a reduced level.

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium <b>prototrophs</b> {{carrying}} a trpR mutation synthesize tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes constitutively. When feedback inhibition of anthranilate synthetase but not 5 '-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase activity was by-passed by growing cells on media supplemented with anthranilic acid, all trpR <b>prototrophs</b> overproduced and excreted tryptophan. However, {{the rate of}} tryptophan production depended on both the ancestry of the trpR strain {{and the integrity of}} its trpA gene. <b>Prototrophs</b> with trp genes derived from S. typhimurium strain LT 2 produced tryptophan more efficiently than those with trp genes derived from strain LT 7. This strain difference was cryptic insofar as it did not affect the growth rate; it was revealed only as a rate-limiting step in the constitutive biosynthesis of tryptophan in the presence of anthranilic acid, and was due to a lesion in the LT 7 -derived trpB gene. Strains with LT 7 -derived trp genes bearing a deletion in trpA produced tryptophan as readily as LT 2 trpR <b>prototrophs.</b> This indicated that LT 7 -specific 5 -phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase must be aggregated with the trpA gene produce to give an observable reduction of constitutive tryptophan production. The discovery of this strain difference has particular implications for studies involving the activities of trpA and B genes and their products in S. typhimurium and may have general significance for other studies involving different strains of Salmonella...|$|R

An auxotroph requiring histidine was isolated from strain B/r of Escherichia coli (which grows well on minimal medium) after ultraviolet irradiation and layering(1). Some time later, the histidineless strain was irradiated with ultraviolet and subjected to penicillin screening(2, 3) Among the mutants isolated was one requiring serine or glycine in addition to histidine.

40|$|Nine blue {{fluorescent}} mutants of {{the flowering}} plant Arabidopsis thaliana were isolated by genetic selections and fluorescence screens. Each {{was shown to}} contain a recessive allele of trp 1, a previously described locus that encodes the tryptophan biosynthetic enzyme phosphoribosylanthranilate transferase (PAT, called trpD in bacteria). The trp 1 mutants consist of two groups, tryptophan auxotrophs and <b>prototrophs,</b> that differ significantly in growth rate, morphology, and fertility. The trp 1 alleles cause plants to accumulate varying amounts of blue fluorescent anthranilate compounds, and only the two least severely affected of the <b>prototrophs</b> have any detectable PAT enzyme activity.

40|$|Chinese hamster {{cells with}} a lesion in the CAD gene (cell line Urd-A) require {{exogenous}} uridine to survive. Uridine <b>prototrophs</b> could be isolated after introducing two recombinant plasmids containing overlapping fragments of a cloned Syrian hamster CAD gene. In contrast, no uridine <b>prototrophs</b> were obtained after introducing a plasmid containing {{only one of}} the two overlapping fragments. DNA restriction analysis showed that the prototrophic transformants contain a functional CAD gene which was formed by a recombination event in the overlapping region of the two clones. Most of the recombination events involved homologous exchanges, and some of them apparently were reciprocal. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that the donated sequences were integrated at a single chromosomal site which was different in each transformant. These results demonstrate the existence of a recombination system(s) in mammalian cells that can catalyze homologous exchanges.

40|$|Diploids of {{the yeast}} Hansenula wingei are nonagglutinative {{and do not}} form zygotes in mixed {{cultures}} with either sexually agglutinative haploid mating type. However, a low frequency of diploid x haploid cell fusions (about 10 - 3) is detectable by prototrophic selection. This frequency of rare diploid x haploid matings is not increased after the diploid culture is induced for sexual agglutination. Therefore, we conclude that genes that repress mating {{are different from those}} that repress sexual agglutination. ——Six <b>prototrophs</b> isolated from one diploid x haploid cross had an average DNA value (µg DNA per 108 cells) of 6. 19, compared to 2. 53 and 4. 35 for the haploid and diploid strains, respectively. Four <b>prototrophs</b> were clearly cell-fusion products because they contained genes from both the diploid and the haploid partners. However, genetic analysis of the <b>prototrophs</b> yielded results inconsistent with triploid meiosis; all six isolates yielded a 2 : 2 segregation for the mating-type alleles and linked genes. ——Mitotic segregation of monosomic (2 n- 1) cells lacking one homolog of the chromosome carrying the mating-type locus is proposed to explain the rare production of sexually active cells in the diploid cultures. Fusion between such monosomic cells and normal haploids is thought to have produced 3 n- 1 cells, disomic for the chromosome carrying the mating-type locus.

Ninety-three percent of <b>prototrophs</b> were generated by events that did not recombine the molecular markers, indicating that simple conversion accounts {{for the formation of}} most <b>prototrophs</b> and that associated crossovers are much less frequent (~ 0. 07) than estimated previously using more distant flanking markers. This suggests that conversion and crossing over during meiosis may arise from distinct mechanisms or that if, as is widely supposed, conversion and crossing over result from alternate modes of resolution of Holliday junctions then, at least for the am locus of Neurospora, the mode of resolution is strongly biased in favor of retaining the parental association of flanking sequences.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of thymidylate in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be inhibited by antifolate drugs.

That this effect {{is a consequence of}} thymine nucleotide depletion was verified by the finding that provision of exogenous thymidylate eliminates the increased production of Leu+ colonies. DNA hybridization analysis revealed that recombination, including reciprocal exchange, gene conversion and unequal sister-chromatid crossing over, between the duplicated genes gave rise to the induced Leu + segregants. Although gene conversion unaccompanied by crossing over was responsible for the major fraction of leucine <b>prototrophs,</b> events involving reciprocal exchange exhibited the largest increase in frequency. These data show that recombination is induced between directly repeated DNA sequences under conditions of thymine nucleotide depletion. In addition, the results of this and previous studies are consistent with the possibility that inhibition of thymidylate biosynthesis in yeast may create a metabolic condition that provokes all forms of mitotic recombination...|$|R
