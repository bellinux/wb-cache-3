5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more <b>predictive</b> <b>of</b> how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly <b>predictive</b> <b>of</b> the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E

ResultsSensitivity was 100 % for both mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes detection, and specificity was, respectively, 12 % and 33 %, with positive <b>predictive</b> value <b>of</b> 8 % and 11 % and negative <b>predictive</b> value <b>of</b> 100 %. Signs of capsular invasion presented sensitivity of 87 %, specificity of 77 %, positive <b>predictive</b> value <b>of</b> 63 % and negative <b>predictive</b> value <b>of</b> 93 %.

Thus, the true predictability of future h-index is much lower compared to what has been claimed before.|$|E

The estimation of the validity of the two-step process included a sequential correction for range restriction and an estimation <b>of</b> the <b>predictive</b> validity <b>of</b> the process in its entirety. Data were collected from 1, 002 undergraduate students from four cohorts (2006 / 07 – 2009 / 10) at three medical schools in Israel. Results. The <b>predictive</b> validity <b>of</b> the composite of the cognitive measures with respect to Year 1 performance was high, resulting entirely from the <b>predictive</b> validity <b>of</b> the admission test (a standard measure <b>of</b> ability). The <b>predictive</b> validity <b>of</b> the noncognitive measure was moderate. The <b>predictive</b> validity <b>of</b> the process in its entirety was high, its value dependent on the weights given to the cognitive and noncognitive measures. Conclusion. A cognitive admission test has a high predictive validity with respect to Year 1 performance. The addition of a noncognitive measure in the second step does not markedly diminish the <b>predictive</b> validity <b>of</b> the selection process with respect to academic achievement...|$|R
