500|$|King {{was issued}} a three-place grid place penalty by the {{stewards}} {{for his role}} in the collision with Gasly which was served at the season's next race in Austria. He said that it was a [...] "disappointing" [...] conclusion to the race weekend and revealed that he and Gasly discussed the incident and the pair had no issue regarding the matter. Gasly said that his team had hoped for a better result in Monaco but the car's amount of performance was not the reason that his team was unable to score points. He further stated that while he was happy with the behaviour of his vehicle he was afflicted with misfortune: [...] "I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> down and fought my way back, but when you start from so far back on the grid in Monaco scoring points is a hopeless task." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Buren's profile at the Pro Football Hall of Fame states he [...] "lined up as a halfback but played {{more like}} a fullback." [...] He had a rare {{combination}} of strength, speed, and endurance. While not as elusive or nimble as other backs, he preferred to run through tacklers instead of avoid them, and never ran out of bounds if he felt he could pick up extra yards. [...] "There's no trick," [...] {{he said of his}} running style. [...] "When I see I'm gonna be tackled I just <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> down and give 'em the shoulder." [...] He was described as a [...] "deadly tackler", hitting as hard on defense as he did when he carried the ball. His disregard for his own body led to many injuries for both himself and opposing players.|$|E

500|$|In June 2002, {{cast members}} from Holby City and Casualty competed against the EastEnders cast {{for the first}} Sport Relief fundraiser, in a segment dubbed [...] "Sport in the Square". The teams competed in events such as taxi pulling, melon tossing and a beer keg relay. The {{competition}} was televised on BBC One, and the event as a whole raised £10million. In October 2003, BBC One aired a [...] "Kenyon Confronts" [...] documentary by Panorama reporter Paul Kenyon, investigating hospitals run by the Private Finance Initiative. He discovered many problems within the hospitals, which were dramatised by the Holby City cast in specially commissioned scenes. March 2004 saw the station air the documentary [...] "Making It at Holby", {{as part of a}} BBC initiative to develop new acting talent. The documentary followed the casting process of Holby City and Casualty, from the audition stages to the filming of the selected actors' first scenes. Young explained his casting criteria, revealing: [...] "I try to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> into the head of a viewer and ask: do I want to spend three years in the life of this person?" [...] 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon included a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a comical version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] by Madonna. 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Sharon D Clarke, backed by Nadine Lewington, Rakie Ayola and Phoebe Thomas performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, [...] "Respect". On 28 June 2008, Holby City stars competed against their Casualty counterparts in a special charity edition of BBC Two game-show The Weakest Link. Holby City and Casualty cast members united on 20 February 2010, performing a dance rendition of [...] "Jai Ho" [...] for Let's Dance for Sport Relief.|$|E

2500|$|To {{solve the}} problem of {{overpopulation}} in Japan, a plan was announced in Tokyo in 1935 to settle five million Japanese farmers and their families into Manchukuo between 1936 and 1956, and in the first stage of the plan 20,000Japanese families moved to Manchukuo every year, continuing until 1944, when American submarine attacks reduced the shipping available to move colonists into Manchukuo. By 1939, the total Japanese population in Manchukuo was about 837,000men, women, and children; comprising the Japanese who had been brought in as rural colonists plus the Japanese who had come to Manchukuo to work as civil servants, businessmen, and for the South Manchurian Railroad company, which was the largest corporation in Asia at the time, together with their families. To provide farmland for the Japanese settlers, the ethnic Chinese and ethnic Korean farmers already living on the land were evicted {{to make way for the}} colonists. Those farmers who resisted eviction to make way for the Japanese settlers were used by the Kwantung Army for bayonet practice. Furthermore, Manchukuo was meant to be the industrial powerhouse of the Japanese empire, and right from the start, the Japanese started to build factories and mines on a vast scale while the Chinese workers were ruthlessly exploited. The American historian Mark Driscoll described the economic system introduced by Nobusuke Kishi, Manchukuo's Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce between 1935-1939 and a future prime minister of Japan, as a “necropolitical” system where the Chinese workers were literally treated as dehumanized cogs within a vast industrial machine. Behr commented that Puyi knew from his talks in Tianjin with General Kenji Doihara and General Seishirō Itagaki that he was dealing with [...] "ruthless men and that this might be the regime to expect". Puyi later recalled that: [...] "I had <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in the tiger's mouth" [...] by going to Manchuria in 1931.|$|E

But, it's a pity, too," [...] he added, and sighed, shook his head, and took his glass off sadly.|$|R

60|$|So when {{we reached}} Malines, just to satisfy Lady Georgina, I <b>put</b> out <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and inquired of a porter. As I anticipated, he replied {{that there was no}} change; we went through to Verviers.|$|R

60|$|The bed whereon I lay {{indulging in}} these uncomfortable {{reflections}} was near {{an open window}} that looked on to the veranda, through which came an extraordinary sound of groaning and weeping. For a time I {{could not make out}} what it was, but at last I got up and, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> out of the window, stared about. Presently I saw a dim figure kneeling {{on the end of the}} veranda and beating his breast -- in which I recognized Alphonse. Not being able to understand his French talk or what on earth he was at, I called to him and asked him what he was doing.|$|R
