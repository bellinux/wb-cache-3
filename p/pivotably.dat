50|$|An {{improved}} exercising {{device for}} exercising {{the legs of}} a user includes a frame member with a lever arm having one end <b>pivotably</b> attached thereto. The lever arm extends downwardly from {{the portion of the}} frame member to which it is <b>pivotably</b> connected, and a pair of foot-engaging force transferring members are mounted on {{the lower end of the}} lever arm. A cable has one end <b>pivotably</b> connected near the lower end of the lever arm, passes around an eccentrically mounted pulley and has its other end connected to weights. As the user lifts the lower portions of his legs, the lever arm is pivoted to pull the cable and the weights attached thereto, thereby strengthening the knee muscles of the user. The eccentrically mounted pulley varies the resistance to movement of the user's lower legs initially increasing the resistance and then decreasing the resistance in a sinusoidal manner as the lower legs are lifted to pivot the lever arm and lift the weights.
