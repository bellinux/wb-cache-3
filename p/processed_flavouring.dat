Aroma can be derived from amino acids and sugars via the Maillard reaction, from lipid oxidation, or from the thermal breakdown of other components of the food such as ascorbic acid, thiamine, ferulic acid and carotenoids. These pathways are interrelated, and are reviewed in turn, with the emphasis on the Maillard reaction, considering it also as a source of taste compounds and antioxidants, as well as potentially harmful products.

40|$|In {{this review}} article, we {{highlight}} {{the impact of}} models incorporating flavour symmetries on charged lepton <b>flavour</b> violating (LFV) <b>processes.</b> <b>Flavour</b> symmetries provide a natural approach to explain the peculiar mass hierarchies and mixing patterns of the Standard Model fermions. New sources of LFV are generally present in new physics beyond the Standard Model, and flavour symmetries can make distinctive predictions for LFV observables. Their discovery can provide crucial information to distinguish flavour symmetries and new physics scenarios in general. Because of their high sensitivity, we will focus on searches for low-energy LFV processes such as mu [...] > e gamma or mu-e conversion in nuclei but we will also highlight {{the potential impact of}} LFV processes at the LHC. If new physics occurs at a scale accessible by the LHC, the flavour operators they induce could potentially be probed in high detail.

40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} {{is a very}} common analytical technique producing gaseous and volatile compounds. The qualitative analysis of evolved gases from a thermal analyzer is normally performed using a FT-IR and/or a Mass Spectrometer. The actual commercial mass spectrometers used in thermal analysis are based on Electron Impact (EI) as ionization source and quadrupole as mass analyzer. This combination is, of course, the cheapest one, but in particular cases, it becomes a limitation. The correct combination between ion source and mass analyzer could improve selectivity and sensitivity of the analysis of evolved gases, especially when organic volatile compounds are investigated. Investigations of low molecular weight gases such as H 2, CO 2, H 2 O(g), etc. is well performed by the actual commercial instruments, but <b>flavour</b> molecules, <b>process</b> <b>flavours,</b> degradation products or contaminants could be present in so low amounts and with so many other molecules that EI is not the suitable ionization source {{for this kind of}} analysis.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{phenomenology}} of a supersymmetric {{extension of the}} Standard Model with an R-symmetry under which R-charges correspond to the baryon number. This identification allows for the presence in the superpotential of the R-parity violating term λ"U^c D^c D^c without breaking baryon number, which loosens several bounds on this operator while changing considerably the phenomenology. However, the R-symmetry cannot remain exact as {{it is at least}} broken by anomaly mediation. Under these conditions, we investigate the constraints coming from baryon number violating <b>processes</b> and <b>flavour</b> physics and find that, in general, they are lessened. Additionally, we examine recent ATLAS and CMS experimental searches and use these to place limits on the parameter space of the model. This is done for both stop production, which now features both pair and resonant production, and pair production of the first two generations of squarks. Finally, we study the implications this model has on baryogenesis. We find that successful baryogenesis can potentially be achieved, but only at the cost of breaking the R-symmetry by a significant amount. Comment: 48 pages, 25 figures, references adde...|$|R
