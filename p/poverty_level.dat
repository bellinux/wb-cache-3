40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of economic reforms on <b>poverty</b> <b>levels</b> in India during the period 1975 - 2006.

The results display long run equilibrium relationship between the two and the direction of causality flowing from reforms to poverty.

5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance.

25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal <b>poverty</b> <b>level.</b> The federal <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E
