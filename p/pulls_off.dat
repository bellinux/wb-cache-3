In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{decision}} to remove the Kilo from the Olympic programme after the 2004 games, Hoy sought to develop in other events. The first of these was the keirin. This event involves between six and eight riders following a small motorbike (the Derny) around the 250m track for 5.5 laps, as the bike slowly builds up the speed. The bike <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> with 2.5 laps to go and the riders race for the line. Hoy had previously competed at the keirin in various events {{but one of his}} first major successes was at the Manchester round of the World Cup Classics Series in 2007, shortly before the World Championships, where he also won, ahead of his team mate Ross Edgar.|$|E
500|$|In the action-comedy film Red 2 (2013), {{which served}} as a sequel to the 2010 film Red, Zeta-Jones played a seductive Russian double agent, {{alongside}} Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker. She {{was drawn to the}} project, which follows the comic adventures of retired spies, for [...] "the action, the humour, [...] the tongue-in-cheek quality of it". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Justin Lowe remarked that Zeta-Jones [...] "nicely <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> Russian spy Katja's mix of allure and menace", and with a worldwide gross of US$148 million, Red 2 emerged as her most widely seen film since No Reservations.|$|E
500|$|Some Easter eggs {{originated}} from in-jokes {{between members of}} the development team. One example is [...] "Toasty", which {{found its way into}} the game {{in the form of a}} small image of sound designer Dan Forden, who would appear in the corner of the screen during gameplay (after performing an uppercut) and yell the phrase [...] "Toasty!" [...] This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character Smoke when it happened in the Portal stage. In Mortal Kombat 4, Forden would say [...] "Toasty! 3D!" [...] after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series. [...] "Toasty!" [...] is also found in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, appearing randomly after the character <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that title, but brought back for the 2011 Mortal Kombat game.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{his return}} in the first tournament of 2011 he had fallen to makushita #51.

In many ways, this would mirror sekitori Toyonoshima's feat in previous months of bouncing back from a demotion to jūryō for baseball gambling by <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> a championship in that tournament and almost <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> a makuuchi championship in a playoff loss to Hakuhō in the following tournament. Matsutani would attain re-entry to jūryō at a career high #3. He only managed a 7-8 record, but in the following September tournament at jūryō #5 would bounce back with a convincing 11-4 winning tournament.|$|R
500|$|Containing a vague plot, {{the opening}} scene of the clip {{features}} Usher donning a black tank top and dark jeans, while he stands in a field with the sun rising in the background. While performing t'ai chi-inspired dance moves, he begins to pursue his love interest, and appears shirtless {{in front of a}} black backdrop. [...] Appearing alongside his interest in the backdrop scenes, Usher then sings propped on a concrete wall in a dark alley, while he and the woman tease each other, before moving outside on the balcony of a house on top of mountains. The singer performs acrobatic moves, including one in particular in which he does a pull-up onto the roof to kiss his partner. All previous scenes are intercut before culminating with Usher seducing his partner in bed, in racy moments with Usher in nothing but briefs as he <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> her stockings. The final scene sees the singer driving off in a convertible.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times of India, Khan explained that he regretted starring in the 2014 Sajid Khan-directed comedy Humshakals. Co-starring alongside an ensemble cast (Ritesh Deshmukh, Ram Kapoor, Bipasha Basu, Tamannaah and Esha Gupta), Khan portrayed three different characters {{in an attempt to}} [...] "expand my market" [...] and step out of his comfort zone. The Hindustan Times described it as a [...] "dim-witted comedy" [...] and criticised Khan for being [...] "the worst thing about [...]" [...] He next produced and featured in Happy Ending (2014), a romantic comedy directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K. NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee found Khan's character of a struggling writer to be [...] "a breezy rejig of his Hum Tum and Salaam Namaste persona of a decade ago", and noted that [...] "the many collegiate hook-ups and break-ups he <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> in Happy Ending do not look completely at odds with the film's purpose." [...] Both Humshakals and Happy Ending underperformed at the box office.|$|E
500|$|... "The Big Bang" [...] {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics.

[...] While {{he noted that the}} [...] "end of the world" [...] scenario was very common, he said that it had never [...] "been quite so pleasingly complex" [...] and that [...] "even if there are several plot holes, it's difficult to get too worried about them when the story packs such a strong emotional wallop". Den of Geek's Simon Brew also gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "if you were awaiting a simple, easy-to-explain blockbuster of a Doctor Who series finale, you simply didn't get it here. Instead, if you were looking for something really very ambitious, often quite confusing, yet ultimately far more satisfying, then 'The Big Bang' absolutely hit the mark." ...|$|E

500|$|Cole {{described}} it as her favourite song on the album and music critics generally agreed. Tom Ewing of The Guardian called the song Cheryl's [...] "showcase [...] built on dark loops of treated acoustic guitar and building into a claustrophobic dance track. It's as brave and novel a song as anything Cole's group have released." [...] Daniel Wilcox even {{went as far as}} to say the song was [...] "far more interesting and innovative than anything her girl group has done in their entire careers." [...] "3 Words" [...] has been described as [...] "mesmerizing in its listlessness" [...] as well as being [...] "unlike anything Cheryl or Will.I.Am have released" [...] and [...] "to what's currently being played on the radio." [...] It was labeled a standout track by many reviewers, with Killian Fox of The Observer referring to the song as [...] "a slick, sophisticated love song that hints at what this album could have been."(positive) David Balls of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "Snubbing traditional verse-chorus-verse song structure, and beginning with spare acoustic guitar strums, '3 Words' builds slowly towards a throbbing and infectious, if slightly brief, arms-in-the-air climax [...] it's hard to deny that Chez <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> this less-than-obvious offering with aplomb." ...|$|E
500|$|Pramod Thomas of The New Indian Express commented, [...] "Mollywood {{has been}} in an {{experimental}} mode of late. Unfortunately, movies like Loham are many laps behind[...] [...] [...] When Megalomaniac directors decide {{to live in the}} shadow of their past glory, films like Loham happen". Veeyen of Nowrunning.com gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Loham has none of the shine or shimmer that was expected of it. At best it looks like an antique bronze piece that has taken some fine patina all over it", but he praised Mohanlal and Siddique's performances. Parech C. Palicha of Rediff.com commented, [...] "Loham lacks lustre, and is not original at all". Sify praised the performance of Mohanlal and the humour of Siddique and Soubin Saheer but criticized the script, saying, [...] "Loham is about a topical subject, but it is far from engaging". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee said that technically the film is slick with well shot sequences. [...] "Mohanlal is the lifeblood of the movie, and he <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> an easy role by his standards with characteristic panache [...] [...] [...] Loham is not among the best works of director Renjith but is far better than some of his forgettable duds." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{beheading}} game {{appears in}} a number of tales, the earliest being the Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. The challenger in this story is named [...] "Fear", a bachlach (churl), and is identified as Cú Roí (a superhuman king of Munster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology) in disguise. He challenges three warriors to his game, only to have them run from the return blow, until the hero Cú Chulainn accepts the challenge. With Cú Chulainn under his axe, this antagonist also feints three blows before letting the hero go. In the Irish version, the cloak of the churl is described as grey (glas), which may also mean green. In the Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, another similar challenge is issued. In this story, a notable difference is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. The French romances La Mule sans Frein and Hunbaut and the Middle High German epic poem Diu Crone feature Gawain in beheading game situations. Hunbaut furnishes an interesting twist: Gawain cuts off the man's head, and then <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> his magic cloak before he can replace it, causing his death. A similar story, this time attributed to Lancelot, appears in the 13th century French work Perlesvaus.|$|E

Wilson then lifted Melina to her shoulders and dropped her to the mat, while she attempted to <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> her pants, but Melina countered the attack by <b>pulling</b> Wilson's pants <b>off</b> to win the match. Afterward, Michelle stripped Melina and then removed her own clothes, as well.|$|R

The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around." [...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one momentthe judge's final speechI wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves". Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, {{each with its own}} tense rhythm and explosive payoff". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's going to do next. The promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been fulfilled".|$|E
500|$|Sheila Benson, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, stated, [...] "Intelligent, complex and enthralling, Presumed Innocent ... {{is one of those}} rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where the working of the {{machinery}} never shows and after it's over, one runs and reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction." [...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|E

[...] Paula Duffy of HULIQ News described the book as [...] "a juicy tell-all". Dylan Stableford of TheWrap called the book [...] "a must-read" [...] for fans of Conan O'Brien. Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called the book a [...] "definitive history" [...] of the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. Willa Paskin wrote for New York Magazine that Carter, [...] "spoke with enough people involved in the situation to provide an account so detailed, it even includes re-created conversations and dialogue". Neal Justin of Star Tribune commented on the author's neutrality in his writing style, [...] "The next time network TV executives stumble into an ugly behind-the-scenes battle, they should consider hiring Bill Carter to negotiate.

500|$|Krusty's {{appearance}} and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that [...] "The satirical conceit that I {{was going for}} {{at the time was}} that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial, pertaining to a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> a mask, revealing Krusty. [...] In the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as and is confused with Krusty. Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that [...] "at some point, we decided he looked [...] all the time." [...] The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] and [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his [...] "grotesque appearance" [...] is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, [...] "This ain't makeup." [...] In [...] "Bart the Fink", [...] he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.|$|E
