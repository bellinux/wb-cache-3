One {{objective}} of the flight will be to observe the influence of microgravity {{on the development of}} the gravity-sensing organs in the inner ear. These organs contain sensory hair cells covered by a layer of dense stones (otoconia). Gravity and linear acceleration exert forces on these masses, leading to excitation of the nerve fibers innervating the hair cells. If the production of the otoliths is regulated to reach an optimal weight, their development might be abnormal in microgravity. Ground-based control experiments are reported describing the developmental sequence in which both the otoliths and their associated sensory epithelium and the semicircular canals appear and develop. Three-dimensional reconstruction of serial sections through the otic vesicle of newt embryos at stages 31 through 58 demonstrate the first appearance, relative position and growth of the otoliths. Reports of experiments in which fertilized frog eggs were flown on a Russian Cosmos mission conclude that the utricular otolith is increased in volume, whereas the saccular otolith maintains normal size, suggesting that at least in the utricle, the weight of the otolith might be regulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{sand lizard}} (Lacerta agilis) is a rare, elusive and cryptic reptile species of {{conservation}} {{importance in the}} UK. Knowledge of its ecology and behaviour has limited {{the development of a}} reliable and effective methodology for population monitoring; this threatens to compromise conservation effort. The behaviour of sand lizards varies seasonally, with sex and with environmental conditions, none of which are fully understood. This aim of this thesis is to further our ecological knowledge of the sand lizard, specifically by investigating factors which influence the detection probability of this species and through exploration of population monitoring and estimation methods. The detection rate of both male and female lizards in a captive population was found to be heavily dependent on their sex and reproductive stage. The detection probability of males was higher (39 %) before mating than after mating (33 %) : with <b>pre-mated</b> males this was strongly associated with temperature and time of day; and with post-mated males it was linked to changeable conditions with solar radiation values between 200 - 700 Wm- 2. The detection probabilities of females were higher after mating (40 %) than before (25 %) with additional variations in detection rate during and after egg laying. <b>Pre-mated</b> females were most commonly observed basking in a preferred range of ultra-violet light and post-mated they favoured conditions where the ground surface temperature ranged between 17. 5 oC and 27. 5 oC. An intensive capture-mark-recapture study was performed on independent sand lizard populations and pattern matching software was used to assist with the identification of individual sand lizards from their dorsal patterning. The low recapture rate of sand lizards proved problematic and population estimates were generated using Program MARK following amalgamation of the data from each field season: but this nonetheless generated the first estimates of sand lizard populations in the UK, with a maximum mean density of 222 Ha- 2. The survivorship of males was consistently higher than females (0. 67 vs. 0. 26) and the detection rates and populations estimates differed between years. A high number of individuals were encountered only once, resulting in wide confidence limits of abundance estimates for this species. The range of microclimates available within a structurally diverse array of heathland vegetation were quantified and found to be more extensive than previously thought. The range of microhabitats within the preferred temperature range for sand lizards increased from Spring to Summer, so the need for a lizard to be in the open, and thus available for detection decreased. The obstacles encountered when attempting to monitor sand lizards populations arise from the unpredictable nature of the species. Future sand lizard surveys should be conducted at times when the detection probability maximised, as described in this thesis. A national monitoring scheme should steer away from absolute abundance estimates of populations and consider the use of occupancy estimation to monitor our remaining populations.

5000|$|Adequate {{nutrition}} at <b>pre-mating</b> time periods showed {{to have the}} most effect on various reproductive processes in mammals. Increased nutrition, in general, during this time was most beneficial for oocyte and embryo development. As a result, offspring number and viability was also improved. Thus, proper nutrition timing during the <b>pre-mating</b> time is key for development and long-term benefit of the offspring.Two different diets were fed to Florida scrub-jays and breeding performance was noted to have different effects. One diet consisted of high protein and high fat, and the other consisting of just high fat. The significant result was that the birds with the high protein and high fat diet laid heavier eggs than the birds with the rich-in-fat diet. There was a difference in the amount of water inside the eggs, which accounted for the different weights. It’s hypothesized that the added water resulting from the adequate protein-rich and fat-rich diet may contribute to development and survival of the chick, therefore aiding reproductive success.|$|E

40|$|Most {{animals have}} organs that sense gravity. These organs use dense stones (called {{otoliths}} or statoconia), which {{rest on the}} sensitive hairs of specialized gravity- and motion-sensing cells. The weight of the stones bends the hairs {{in the direction of}} gravitational pull. The cells in turn send a coded representation of the grav-ity or motion stimulus to the central nervous system. Previous experiments, in which the eggs or larvae of a marine mollusk (Aplysia californica, the sea hare) were raised on a centrifuge, demonstrated that the size of the stones (or “test mass”) was reduced in a graded manner as the gravity field was increased. This suggests that some control mechanism was acting to “normalize ” the weight of the stones. The experiments described here were designed to test the hypothesis that, during their initial development, the mass of the stones is regu-lated to achieve a desired weight. If this is the case, we would expect a larger-than-normal otolith would develop in animals reared in the weightlessness of space. To test this, freshwater snails and swordtail fish were studied after spaceflight. The snails mated in space, and the stones (statoconia) in their statocysts developed in microgravity. <b>Pre-mated</b> adult female swordtail fish were flown on the Space Shuttle, and the developing lar-vae were collected after landing.

The experiments presented here studied {{the development of the}} otoliths on the ground. Otoliths of living newts, from embryo to adult, were observed in situ with the application of a new X-ray and bio-imaging analyzer system. For the establishment of this method, newts at different developmental stages were used. An imaging plate temporarily stores the X-ray energy pattern at the bio-imaging analyzer. A latent image on the imaging plate was transformed into a digital time series signal with an image reader. Acquired digital information was computed with the image processor. The processed information was recorded on film with an image recorder, in order to visualize it on an enlargement computed radiograph. To analyze development of the otoliths, photo-stimulated luminescence level was detected by an image analyzer, using transmitted X-ray photons. A single clump of otoconia could first be seen at stage 33. Stage- 36 embryos first have distinguishable otoliths, with the utricle in front and saccule behind.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the hypothesis that the spennathecae of spiders affects the sperm precedence patterns in a predictable way (Austad 1984). Spermathecae come in two varieties: cul-de-sac and conduit. Cul-de-sac spennathecae, according to the hypothesis, are supposed to lead to second male sperm priority and conduit to first male sperm priority. The hypothesis was evaluated both directly and indirectly. Direct measurements were made of paternity in two species, Pholcus phalangioides and Tetragnatha montana, both of which are cul-de-sac species. It was found that P. phalangioides complies with the predicted precedence pattern and thus does not disprove the hypothesis. This second male priority pattern was despite a much shorter mating time by second mating males. In T. montana no precedence pattern was found, with equal likelihood of first or second mating males of gaining paternity. There was in T. montana a possible influence of the duration of mating affecting the precedence pattern, with longer mating males gaining a higher paternity no matter what order they mated in. It is discussed {{whether or not this is}} due to sperm loading or genitalic stimulation (Eberhard 1985). Indirect evaluation of the hypothesis included an analysis of mating behaviour in Zygiella x-notata which is a conduit species and was chosen as a comparison to the two cul-de-sac species. In Z. x-notata it was found that there was no difference between mating duration in first and second mating males. Mating persistence is thus the same in first and second mating males, suggesting that the males cannot detect that the female is a denuded resource to second mating males. Hence first male priority may not be a factor in this species. Other indirect methods of evaluating the hypothesis involved charting the incidence of mate-guarding and mating-plugs. The expected pattern of mate-guarding was for conduit species to <b>pre-mate</b> guard and for cul-de-sac species to post-mate guard, because of the predicted sperm precedence patterns associated with the spermathecae. The predicted pattern was not found. In the case of mating-plugs it was predicted that these should be deployed by cul-de-sac species because it is in these species that second males are able to usurp paternity to a large extent. The opposite pattern was found with mating-plugs of various design being utilized by conduit species. It is postulated that mating-plugs are the mechanism by which first male priorities are established in conduit species, where this pattern is found. The absence of plugs in cul-de-sac species is possibly the reason that second males can cuckold. The additional data collected since 1984 reveal that patterns of paternity found in spiders seem to be more complex than was originally assumed by Austad (1984). Spermathecae are species-specific in character and this may reflect a species specificity in sperm precedence patterns. Thus the conduit I cul-de-sac dichotomy may not reflect a useful prediction of paternity patterns. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pre-mating</b> {{behaviors}} {{and the growth}} {{and development of the}} ovaries are controlled by the juvenile hormone-III, which is produced in the corpus allata. The production of this juvenile hormone fluctuates. Patterns of behavior are correlated with the increasing or decreasing rate of the concentration of this hormone. It is possible that the production by the corpus allata may be affected by nervous stimulation or inhibition of the glands. The hormone concentration within the hemolymph may be affected by esterases. Corpus allata activity is also affected by external factors, as it tends to be greater when mating and egg-laying are occurring, but much lower when they are prevented. When activity is lower, egg production is lower.|$|E

Its voice is similar to other avocets, common calls include a fluty clear ‘tuut’ or ‘kluut’ that generally serves as a contact call with a shorter and sharper yelping notes reserved for warning calls.

He took up the first positive reply, a position with H. J. Muller at the University of Texas at Austin, in spite of knowing that Muller was in Russia at the time. It turned out that Muller {{had no intention of}} returning to his position in Texas, and so J. T. Patterson became Crow's supervisor there. Under the influence of Muller, Patterson was starting to switch to Drosophila genetics, having previously worked on the embryology of the armadillo, {{and so it was that}} Crow came to study the genetic isolating mechanisms in the Drosophila mulleri group. This included a combination of doing mating crosses between species and looking for chromosome rearrangements using polytene chromosomes. (Polytene chromosomes are large aggregations of actual chromosomes which, once appropriately stained, facilitate the discovery of chromosome rearrangements through an ordinary light microscope. Polytene chromosomes are mostly found in the salivary glands of some species.)

50|$|Also {{known as}} eusocialityOvary {{activation}} in honeybee workers is inhibited by pheromones from the queen. In the Cape honeybee social parasites {{that are of}} the worker caste enter the colony and kill the resident queen, activate their own ovaries and parthenogenetically produce diploid female offspring (thelytoky) - behaviors that are all linked to a single locus on chromosome 13. The parasites produced queen-like pheromones falsely signally {{the presence of a}} queen suppressing the reproduction of worker's native to the colony and policing or destroying these eggs. Alternative slicing of a gene homologous to the gemini transcription factor of Drosophila controls worker sterility. Knocking out an exon resulted in rapid worker ovary activation. A 9 nucleotide deletion from the normal altruistic worker genome may turn a honeybee into a parasite.As for many eusocial insects, termite workers are totipotent and rarely produce offspring although they are capable of reproduction when the breeding pair dies. Researchers hypothesized that the gene Neofem2, which is involved in cockroach communication, plays a critical role in queen-worker communication. They experimentally took the king or queen out of the colony. Some workers displayed <b>pre-mating</b> head butting behavior and can go on to become reproductive while others did not. However, when the Neofem2 gene was suppressed butting behavior did not occur, indicating that the gene is essential in allowing the queen to suppress worker reproduction. Neofem2 {{may play a role in}} cockroach egg pheromones.Naked mole rats resemble eusocial insects in becoming reversible nonbreeders at birth,. Underground dwelling mole rats having an elaborate division of labor, high densities as colonies mature, high levels of inbreeding and extreme permanent reproductive despotism.

Because little attention has been given to the possibility that <b>pre-mating</b> treatment with morphine may modulate the response to ?-opioid receptor stimulation, another group of animals was submitted to the same acute challenge after abrupt withdrawal from repeated treatment with morphine sulfate during the <b>pre-mating</b> period (5 mg/kg on alternate days for a total of five doses).

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} over consecutive years {{to examine the}} effects of ewe body condition and post-mating nutrition on ovulation rates and embryo survival. Trial 1 used 146 Polypay ewes ranging in age from 5 to 8 years in a 3 x 2 factorial array of <b>pre-mating</b> (high-H, low flushed-LF and low unflushed-L) and post-mating nutrition (high and low) treatments. Trial 2 was a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial array of 60 Polypay and 60 Coopworth x Polypay (C x P) three year old ewes, two <b>pre-mating</b> (H and LF) and two post-mating (high and low) treatments. To estimate timing and extent of embryo loss, two methods of embryo detection were employed during Trial 2. Real-time ultrasound was performed on all ewes at 21, 28, 34 and 45 days post-mating. Blood samples were also collected on these days for analysis of Pregnancy-specific Protein B (PSPB) levels. There was no effect of <b>pre-mating</b> treatment or ewe age on ovulation or conception rates for Trial 1. <b>Pre-mating</b> treatment was significant in Trial 2, with H ewes having higher ovulation rates than LF ewes. <b>Pre-mating</b> treatment, post-mating treatment, ewe age (for Trial 1) and genotype (for Trial 2) had no effect on mean litter size in either trial. Analysis of litter size among ewes with twin and triple ovulations showed <b>pre-mating</b> treatment to be significant among triple ovulators in Trial 1, where L ewes had much lower litter size (1. 86) than LF (2. 37) or H (2. 60) ewes. In Trial 2, post-mating treatment was significant among the ewes with triple ovulations, with ewes on low nutrition having lower litter size (2. 01) than ewes on high nutrition (2. 59). Two-way interactions were significant among twin and triple ovulators in Trial 2. Breed x <b>pre-mating</b> interaction among twin ovulating ewes showed C x P LF ewes to have lower litter size (1. 43) than the H ewes (1. 87), while the opposite was true for Polypay ewes. Pre- x post-mating treatment interaction among triple ovulators showed LF ewes on low post-mating nutrition had lower mean litter size. This effect is largely due to lower litter size in the C x P triple ovulators on low post-mating nutrition. Data available from the ultrasound diagnosis showed little indication of treatment effects on amount or time of embryo loss. Ewes bearing single or multiple embryos differed in PSPB level at day 45, but not at earlier times.

This study was carried out in 4 Iraqi South-central governorates using 596 <b>pre-mating</b> and 628 pregnant buffaloes (during the last two months of gestation). <b>Pre-mating</b> buffaloes were divided randomly into 496 concentrate-supplemented buffaloes (Flushing) and 100 control ones. Additionally, pregnant buffaloes were also divided into 528 concentrate- supplemented buffaloes (Steaming up) and 100 controls. Each buffalo within the flushing and steaming up groups were fed daily on 7 Kg of concentrate diet (13 % crude protein and 1. 70 Mcal of net energy) for 60 days. The control buffaloes were nourished only on low-quality roughages of the area and wheat bran. Higher estrus (+ 15 %, P< 0. 01), pregnancy (+ 23. 8 %, P< 0. 05) and calving rates (+ 30. 8 %, P< 0. 01) were observed in concentrate-supplemented buffaloes as compared with controls.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of hybridization in plants is context dependent {{and can be}} influenced by the local mating environment. We used progeny arrays and admixture and pollen dispersal analyses to assess the relative importance of <b>pre-mating</b> reproductive barriers and the local demographic environment as explanations of variation in hybrid frequency in three mapped hybrid zones of Eucalyptus aggregata and E. rubida. A total of 731 open-pollinated progeny from 36 E. aggregata maternal parents were genotyped using six microsatellite markers. Admixture analysis identified substantial variation in hybrid frequency among progeny arrays (0 - 76. 9 %). In one hybrid zone, hybrid frequency was related to <b>pre-mating</b> barriers (degree of flowering synchrony) and demographic components of the local mating environment (decreasing population size, closer proximity to E. rubida and hybrid trees). At this site, average pollen dispersal distance was less and almost half (46 %) of the hybrid progeny were sired by local E. rubida and hybrid trees. In contrast, at the other two sites, <b>pre-mating</b> and demographic factors were not related to hybrid frequency. Compared to the first hybrid zone where most of the E. rubida (76 %) and all hybrids flowered, in the remaining sites fewer E. rubida (22 - 41 %) and hybrid trees (0 - 50 %) flowered and their reproductive success was lower (sired 0 - 23 % of hybrids). As a result, most hybrids were sired by external E. rubida/hybrids located at least 2 - 3 km away.

40|$|Background: Divergence {{driven by}} female {{preference}} can {{give rise to}} <b>pre-mating</b> isolation more rapidly than post-mating isolation can evolve through the accumulation of allelic incompatibilities. Moreover <b>pre-mating</b> isolation {{may be more effective}} at maintaining morphological differentiation between divergent populations. In the context of Australian rainforest endemic skinks that were historically subjected to refugial isolation, this study examined the following predictions: 1) that assortative female preference is associated with more recent divergence of southern C. rubrigularis (S-RED) and C. rhomboidalis (BLUE), but not with deeply divergent S-RED and northern C. rubrigularis (N-RED); and 2) that upon secondary contact, morphological differentiation is maintained between S-RED and BLUE, whereas N-RED and S-RED remain morphogically indistinguishable. Principal Findings: Female preference trials found no evidence for assortative female preference between N-RED and S-RED, supporting a previous genetic hybrid zone study which inferred post-mating but no <b>pre-mating</b> isolation. In contrast there is evidence for assortative female preference between S-RED and BLUE, with BLUE females preferring to associate with BLUE males, but S-RED females showing no preference.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} research {{examines the}} role of male nuptial coloration in the maintenance of species boundaries of darters (Percidae: Etheostoma). The two main goals were to identify how conspicuous male colors contribute to <b>pre-mating</b> isolation and to determine {{the relative importance of}} such <b>pre-mating</b> isolation in the maintenance of two sympatric species. The focal pair of sympatric species, E. zonale and E. barrenense, allow an examination of conspecific male coloration as a critical factor by which females select mates. According to speciation via sexual selection theory, if species-specific color leads to <b>pre-mating</b> isolation and <b>pre-mating</b> isolation is stronger than other forms of reproductive barriers, then that nuptial coloration {{plays a key role in}} maintaining species boundaries. Although conventional wisdom holds that conspicuous male coloration has evolved to attract conspecific female mates and that species-specific colors serve as a prominent cue maintaining species boundaries, this notion has been explicitly tested only rarely. Importantly, nuptial color may not be driven by female choice; alternatively, color cues may function in male-male competition to improve access to female mates. Therefore it is critical to test the precise role of nuptial coloration in speciation. 	Darters provide an excellent system for examining {{the role of}} nuptial coloration in speciation. Darters comprise the most diverse genus of North American freshwater fish, and nearly every species is characterized by unique nuptial coloration. Multiple darter species co-exist in sympatric populations, indicating that reproductive barriers are tantamount to maintaining these extraordinarily diverse color patterns. 	This doctoral research demonstrates that male coloration plays a role in female choice both within and between the focal species. Additionally, these species exhibit complete behavioral isolation influenced by female preference for conspecific male coloration. I compared the relative strengths of multiple reproductive barriers and found that behavioral isolation is the strongest measured barrier to gene flow between the focal species. These results present empirical evidence for speciation driven by sexual selection and provide insight into the maintenance of diversity among naturally occurring sympatric species.

40|$|Studies of avian {{species have}} shown that {{maternal}} effects mediated by the transfer of egg hormones can profoundly affect offspring phenotype and fitness. We previously demonstrated that the injection of a physiological amount of testosterone (T) in the eggs of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) disrupted the covariation among male morphological traits at sexual maturity and positively affected male mating success. Here, we investigate whether egg T exposure affected adult male circulating T levels {{at the onset of}} the breeding season (reflecting gonadal maturation), and the relationship between circulating T and male traits. Egg T exposure did not affect <b>pre-mating</b> plasma T. T levels were not associated with the expression of secondary sexual and non-sexual traits or socio-sexual behaviour (social rank, overall fighting ability and mating success). However, wattle brightness decreased with increasing circulating T in males hatched from T-eggs (T-males) but not among control males. In dyadic encounters during the peak mating period, control males with higher <b>pre-mating</b> T levels had higher chances of being dominant over other control males. However, higher <b>pre-mating</b> T levels did not predict success in male-male competition in encounters involving T-males. We suggest that the long-term effects of egg T on male phenotype do not originate from differential gonadal maturation according to egg T treatment. Rather, prenatal androgens may have priming effects on functioning of target tissues, translating into differential phenotypic effects according to androgen exposure during embryonic development...|$|E
40|$|High piglet birth {{weights and}} litter {{uniformity}} {{are important for}} piglet survival and piglet performance. Within-litter variation in piglet birth weight is the consequence of within-litter variation in early embryo development, which in turn reflects variation in follicle and oocyte development. Insulin-stimulating diets before mating can influence litter development and uniformity, probably through beneficial effects of insulin on IGF- 1 and follicle development. The first aim of this thesis, therefore, was to study effects of insulin-stimulating diets during the weaning-to-estrus interval (WEI) on plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development, and consequences for embryo, fetal and placental development and uniformity {{at different stages of}} pregnancy in sows. Results of this thesis show that plasma insulin levels during WEI can be effectively enhanced by dietary sugars as dextrose and sucrose (high peaks directly after feeding) and starch (enhanced insulin levels at ~ 4 h after feeding) in a dose-dependent manner. Follicle development and subsequent litter uniformity of embryos (at day 10 of pregnancy) or fetuses and placentas (at day 42 of pregnancy), however, were not affected by insulin-stimulating diets during WEI, nor related to plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels during WEI. Besides effects of <b>pre-mating</b> diets, plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development are also influenced by the <b>pre-mating</b> metabolic state of the sow: in sows with severe body condition loss during lactation, plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development at weaning are suppressed, and restoration of plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development occurs in sows with a prolonged lactation or a prolonged weaning-to-pregnancy interval (WPI). The second aim of this thesis, therefore, was to study effects of these <b>pre-mating</b> conditions related to sow metabolic state on subsequent piglet birth weight and litter uniformity. In this thesis it is shown {{for the first time that}} <b>pre-mating</b> conditions related to sow metabolic state affect subsequent litter uniformity. Litter uniformity at birth was compromised by severe sow body condition loss during previous lactation and improved in sows with a prolonged WPI. Furthermore, it was shown that in (organic) sows with prolonged lactations (6 weeks) and large litters (17. 4 ± 0. 3 piglets), insulin-stimulating diets before mating did not result in improved piglet birth weights or litter uniformity. This may be related to a restored follicle development at weaning in these sows. In these large organic litters, piglet birth weight and litter uniformity were strongly related to piglet survival during lactation. To conclude, results of this thesis confirm that litter uniformity at birth is already (partly) determined during the <b>pre-mating</b> period, likely related to (insufficient) restoration of follicle development. In contrast to previous studies, insulin-stimulating diets during WEI did not improve litter uniformity of embryos, fetuses or placentas and/or piglets in sows. The role of plasma IGF- 1 levels and follicle development at weaning (both related to sow parity and sow body condition loss), and effects of insulin-stimulating diets during lactation, need further study. Finally, although effects of <b>pre-mating</b> nutritional and metabolic conditions on subsequent piglet birth weight and litter uniformity seem only marginal, these marginal effects can have substantial effects on pre-weaning piglet survival...|$|E
40|$|Ovary {{development}} and maturation of Nezara viridula (L.) {{were evaluated by}} examining ovariole morphology and the alterations in the biochemical (protein synthesis related to reproduction) composition of the hemolymph. Quantitative and qualitative protein analyses were performed and ovary structural alterations for the pre-reproductive and reproductive stages were recorded. Total concentration of proteins in female hemolymph gradually increased {{until the end of}} the <b>pre-mating</b> stage, remaining unaltered thereafter. Proteins linked to reproduction (vitellogenins) appeared in the hemolymph 10 days after adult emergence and indicated the end of the <b>pre-mating</b> stage. After mating, total protein concentration in the hemolymph was lower compared to virgin females; vitellogenin levels were similar during most of the observation period. Oocyte {{development and}} maturation were gradual and age dependent. Ten-day-old females had chorionated oocytes ready for fertilization. Mating did not stimulate oocyte development in N. viridula, but the lack of mating activity appeared to have stimulated oocyte resorption in 17 -day-old females.

40|$|Context: Ecological {{speciation}} {{is commonly}} inferred {{with evidence of}} the parallel evolution of <b>pre-mating</b> isolation: individuals from populations in similar environments show higher mating success in laboratory experiments than do individuals from different environments. Critically, this should hold even for mating crosses among populations that are from different locations that represent independent evolutionary lineages. Problem: This prediction may not hold when conserved sexual selection (e. g. good genes benefits) constrains the evolution of mate preferences. In this case, ecological <b>pre-mating</b> isolation may be developing but is difficult to infer using the typical experimental approach. Solution: We show how comparisons of mate preference functions among replicate populations in divergent environments {{can be used to}} reveal subtle signatures of ecological speciation. These functions can then be used to develop predictions of relative mating success in population crosses. Significance: This general approach, based on mate preference functions, facilitates the simultaneous analysis of both pattern and process during ecological speciation...|$|E
40|$|This {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the effect of}} a single dose of (10 mg) dexamethasone administered subcutaneously to TB mares either on the day before or the day of mating. A non treated control group was included. Every mare which had to be mated was included in this study, belonging to either the treated or the non treated control group. We distinguished between foaling, maiden and barren mares. Endometrial oedema and uterine luminal fluid scores before and after the dexamethasone were recorded and the pregnancy rates were examined. The author concluded that a single dose of dexamethasone, on a practical basis administered 24 hours before mating, reduced oedema directly [...] Pregnancy rates might be improved. Older mares are more difficult to get in foal. When treated a day before mating, a significant improvement on pregnancy rate was found in mares older than 16 yrs. Oedema <b>pre-mating,</b> fluid <b>pre-mating</b> and status had no significant effect on pregnancy rate...|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of mating {{isolating}} mechanisms has evolved to avoid mating with close relatives. In mating aggregations that commonly occur in social insects (bees, wasps and ants) sexuals from the same colony can potentially be present, so some type of colony-recognition system {{would be useful to}} avoid inbreeding. In the ant Formica exsecta, colony-specific (Z) 9 -alkene profiles are used by workers to distinguish nest-mates from non-nest-mates, so this information {{has the potential to be}} employed in mating behaviour, i. e. to recognise potential mates, avoid inbreeding and indicate mating status. However, in F. exsecta queens, we found no consistent quantitative or qualitative differences in the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles between males and queens, or any changes associated with mating in queens. Neither did the (Z) 9 -alkene recognition profile appear to be acting as a <b>pre-mating</b> barrier, since successful mating occurred across a {{wide range of}} CHC profiles. The main <b>pre-mating</b> barrier in F. exsecta appears to be the sequential production of males followed by queens coupled with a long mating period, a strategy adopted by many social insects...|$|E
40|$|Clock {{genes that}} pleiotropically control {{circadian}} rhythm {{and the time}} of mating may cause allochronic reproductive isolation in the melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Flies with a shorter circadian period (ca. 22 h of locomotor activity rhythm) mated 5 h earlier in the day than those with a longer circadian period (ca. 30 h). Mate-choice tests demonstrated significant <b>pre-mating</b> isolation between populations with short and long circadian periods. <b>Pre-mating</b> isolation did not occur when the mating time was synchronized between the two populations by photoperiodic controls, indicating that reproductive isolation is due to variations in the time of mating and not any unidentified ethological difference between the two populations. We cloned the period (per) gene of B. cucurbitae that is homologous to the per gene in Drosophila. The relative level of per mRNA in the melon fly exhibited a robust daily fluctuation under light : dark conditions. The fluctuation of per expression under dark : dark conditions is closely correlated to the locomotor rhythm in B. cucurbitae. These results suggest that clock genes can cause reproductive isolation via the pleiotropic effect as a change of mating time...|$|E
