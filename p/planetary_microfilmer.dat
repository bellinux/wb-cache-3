50|$|Microfilmers come in {{two basic}} configurations: {{planetary}} and rotary. A <b>planetary</b> <b>microfilmer</b> takes a snapshot of a stationary document held on a flat surface. While the picture is being taken, the film and the document do not move. In a rotary microfilmer, both the document and the film are moving in sync with one another while the picture is being taken. This allows for quicker filming of the document. Planetary microfilmers typically offer higher image resolution than rotary filmers, and can more readily film larger documents, as well as odd-shaped documents, such as books.|$|E

Ten evaluation parameters were incorporated in two targets PMTA-I and PMTA-II. PMTA-I includes tests for 1) resolution, 2) readability of printed matter, 3) reduction ratio, 4) exposure and processing, 5) full field visual distortion, and finally 6) corner visual distortion. PMTA-II {{was designed to}} evaluate, 7) quatitative distortion, 8) continous tone, 9) evenness of illumination, and 10) alignment of microfilming system...|$|R
