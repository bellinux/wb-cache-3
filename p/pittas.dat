5|$|<b>Pittas</b> are {{medium-sized}} stocky passerines with fairly long, strong legs, short {{tails and}} stout bills. Many are brightly coloured. They spend {{the majority of}} their time on wet forest floors, eating snails, insects and similar invertebrate prey.|$|E
5|$|The melampittas are a family, Melampittidae, of New Guinean birds {{containing}} two enigmatic species. The {{two species}} {{are found in}} two genera, the greater melampitta in the genus Megalampitta and the lesser melampitta in the genus Melampitta. They are little studied and before being established as a family in 2014 their taxonomic relationships with other birds were uncertain, being considered at one time related variously to the <b>pittas,</b> Old World babblers and birds-of-paradise.|$|E
50|$|Some {{authorities}} {{believe that}} the noisy <b>pitta</b> is conspecific with elegant <b>pitta</b> (<b>Pitta</b> elegans) of Indonesia, and/or with the rainbow <b>pitta</b> (<b>Pitta</b> iris) from the Northern Territory but it is usually regarded as forming a superspecies with these two species and with the black-faced <b>pitta</b> (<b>Pitta</b> anerythra) of the Solomon Islands. Not all authorities agree that all these species are related; Erritzoe and Erritzoe (1998) dispute {{the inclusion of the}} rainbow <b>pitta</b> in this superspecies.|$|R
50|$|The German naturalist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller first {{described}} the blue-winged <b>pitta</b> in 1776. It forms a superspecies with the Indian <b>pitta</b> (P. brachyura), fairy <b>pitta</b> (P. nympha) and mangrove <b>pitta</b> (P. megarhyncha). Alternate common names include: lesser blue-winged <b>pitta,</b> the little blue-winged <b>pitta,</b> the Moluccan <b>pitta,</b> the brève à ailes bleues (French), the Kleine Blauflügelpitta (German) and the pita aliazul (Spanish).|$|R
50|$|The superb <b>pitta</b> (<b>Pitta</b> superba) {{is a large}} <b>pitta.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} <b>pittas</b> {{are found in}} South-east Asia. Of the three genera, the large genus Pitta is the most widespread. The two species found in Africa are from this clade, as are the most northerly species (the fairy pitta) and the most southerly (the noisy pitta). The most remote insular endemics are in this group as well, including the black-faced pitta, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands. The <b>pittas</b> of the clade Erythropitta are mostly found in Asia with one species, the Papuan pitta, reaching the north of Australia. The Hydrornis <b>pittas</b> are exclusively Asian. Some <b>pittas</b> have large distributions, like the hooded pitta, which ranges from Nepal to New Guinea, others have much smaller ones, like the superb pitta, which is endemic to the tiny island of Manus in the Admiralty Islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{movements}} of <b>pittas</b> are poorly known and notoriously difficult to study. Bird ringing studies have not shed much light on this, one {{study in the}} Philippines ringed 2000 red-bellied <b>pittas</b> but only recaptured ten birds, and {{only one of these}} recaptures was more than two months after the initial capture. Only four species of pitta are fully or mostly migratory, all in the genus Pitta, the Indian pitta, African pitta, fairy pitta and blue-winged pitta. In addition to these four the northern subspecies of the hooded pitta (cucullata) is a full migrant. Other species make smaller or more local, and poorly understood, movements across small parts of their range, for example the noisy pitta of Australia. The migration of <b>pittas</b> is apparently nocturnal, and <b>pittas</b> migrate in small loose flocks which use the same resting and foraging sites each year.|$|E
25|$|These {{are fairly}} {{terrestrial}} birds of wet forest floors. They eat snails, insects and similar invertebrate prey. <b>Pittas</b> are mostly solitary and lay {{up to six}} eggs in a large spherical nest in a tree or shrub, or sometimes on the ground. Both parents care for the young. Many species of <b>pittas</b> are migratory, and they often end up in unexpected places like house-gardens during migration.|$|E
50|$|The noisy <b>pitta</b> is {{also known}} as the buff-breasted <b>pitta,</b> the lesser <b>pitta,</b> and the blue-winged <b>pitta</b> (<b>Pitta</b> moluccensis is another species known as the blue-winged <b>pitta,</b> which {{sometimes}} leads to confusion in applying their common names). It was also known colloquially as the anvil-bird (after its feeding behaviour), the bobtail and the painted thrush.|$|R
50|$|The black-crowned <b>pitta</b> (Erythropitta ussheri), {{also known}} as the black-headed <b>pitta,</b> black-and-crimson <b>pitta,</b> black-and-scarlet <b>pitta</b> or black-crowned garnet <b>pitta,</b> is a brightly coloured, ground-dwelling, bird species in the <b>pitta</b> family. It is endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo. It was {{described}} by John Gould in 1877, with the type locality recorded as the Lawas River.|$|R
50|$|The fairy <b>pitta</b> {{was first}} {{described}} {{as a member of}} the order Passeriformes and the family Pittidae in 1850. It was originally considered to be the same species as the Indian <b>pitta</b> (P. brachyura), native to India and Pakistan. However, due to differences in plumage, morphology, and vocalization, the fairy <b>pitta</b> was recognized as a separate species in 1996. In contemporary taxonomy, the fairy <b>pitta</b> forms a superspecies with the Indian <b>pitta,</b> mangrove <b>pitta</b> (P. megarhyncha) and blue-winged <b>pitta</b> (P. moluccensis). Among the 30 species of Pittidae worldwide, the fairy <b>pitta</b> is the most northerly and only species breeding in Northeast Asia.|$|R
25|$|The <b>pittas</b> are {{strongly}} territorial, with territories varying {{in size from}} 3000 m² in the African pitta to 10,000m² in the rainbow pitta. <b>Pittas</b> will perform territory defence displays {{on the edges of}} their territories, although fights between rivals have only been recorded once. One such territorial display is given by the rainbow pitta, which holds its legs straight and bows to a rival on the edge of territory, while making a purring call. Displays like this are paired with calls made out of sight of potential rivals; these territorial calls are frequent and can account for up to 12% of a bird's daylight activity. Migratory species will defend non-breeding feeding territories in addition to their breeding ones.|$|E
25|$|Atypically for {{forest floor}} species, the plumage of <b>pittas</b> is often bright and colourful. Only one species, the eared pitta, has entirely cryptic colours in the adults of both sexes. In the same genus, Hydrornis, are three further species with quite drabber than average plumage, the blue-naped pitta, blue-rumped pitta and rusty-naped pitta. Like the other Hydrornis <b>pittas</b> they are sexually dimorphic in their plumage, with the females tending towards being drabber and more cryptic than the males. Across {{most of the}} family the {{brighter}} colours tend {{to be on the}} undersides, with the bright colours on the rump, wings and uppertail coverts being concealable. Being able to conceal bright colours from above is important as most predators approach from above.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pittas</b> {{were first}} {{described}} scientifically by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in his revised 12th {{edition of the}} Systema Naturae. He placed the Indian pitta in the crow family and genus Corvus. Ten years later it {{was placed in the}} thrush family, due to similarities of morphology and behaviour, before being placed in its own genus, Pitta in 1816 by Louis Vieillot. Vieillot was also the first to consider the genus a family in its own right. The family's closest relatives have for a long time assumed to be the other suboscine birds, and particularly the Old World broadbills and asities (formerly treated as two families, now either lumped into one or split into four). A 2006 study confirmed that these were the closest relatives of the <b>pittas.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{species with}} a similar {{appearance}} is the blue-winged <b>pitta,</b> which {{is larger than the}} fairy <b>pitta.</b> The blue-winged <b>pitta</b> has buff crown sides and supercilia, rather than the chestnut of the fairy <b>pitta,</b> brighter upper tail coverts, darker yellowish brown belly, and vivid blue on upper wing coverts.|$|R
25|$|Many {{species of}} pitta are {{threatened}} with extinction. Four {{of these are}} listed as endangered by the IUCN; a further nine species are listed as vulnerable and several more are near-threatened. The main threat to <b>pittas</b> is habitat loss {{in the form of}} rapid deforestation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pittas</b> are diurnal, {{requiring}} {{light in}} order to find their often cryptic prey. They are nevertheless often found in darker areas and are highly secretive, though they will respond to imitations of their calls. They are generally found as single birds, with even young birds not associating with their parents unless they are being fed. Small groups have been observed during migration.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{treatments}} vary as well. A 1975 checklist included six genera, {{whereas the}} 2003 {{volume of the}} Handbook of the Birds of the World, which covered the family, placed all the <b>pittas</b> in a single genus. The family was not well studied using modern anatomical or phylogenetic techniques; two studies, in 1987 and 1990, each used only four species, and comparisons amongst the family as a whole have relied mostly on external features and appearances.|$|E
50|$|The Siau <b>pitta</b> or Siao <b>pitta</b> (Erythropitta palliceps) is {{a species}} of the <b>pitta.</b> It was {{considered}} a subspecies of the red-bellied <b>pitta.</b> It is endemic to Indonesia where it occurs in Siau, and Tagulandang. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The Bismarck <b>pitta</b> or New Ireland <b>pitta</b> (Erythropitta novaehibernicae) is {{a species}} of the <b>pitta.</b> It was {{considered}} a subspecies of the red-bellied <b>pitta.</b> It is endemic to the New Ireland Province in Papua New Guinea.

25|$|<b>Pittas</b> feed in a thrush-like fashion, moving aside {{leaves with}} a {{sweeping}} {{motion of the}} bill. They have also been observed to probe the moist soil with their bills in order to locate earthworms. It {{has been suggested that}} they are able to locate earthworms by smell; a suggestion supported by a study which found that they have the largest olfactory bulb of 25 passerines examined. Some species will also use tree roots and rocks as anvils on which to smash open snails in order to eat.|$|E
25|$|Like most birds the <b>pittas</b> are monogamous breeders, {{and defend}} {{breeding}} territories. Most species are seasonal breeders, timing their breeding to {{occur at the}} onset of the rainy season. An exception to this is the superb pitta, which breeds almost year-round, as the island of Manus which it breeds on remains wet all year. The courtship behaviours of the family are poorly known, but the elaborate dance of the African pitta includes jumping into the air with a puffed out breast and parachuting down back down to the perch.|$|E
25|$|Earthworms {{form the}} {{major part of}} the diet of <b>pittas,</b> {{followed}} by snails in order of importance. Earthworms may however become seasonally unavailable in dry conditions when the worms move deeper into the soil. In addition a wide range of invertebrate prey is eaten, including many insects groups such as termites, ants, beetles, true bugs, and lepidopterans; as well as freshwater crabs, centipedes, millipedes, and spiders. In addition to invertebrates some species, such as the fairy pitta and rainbow pitta, have been recorded feeding on vertebrate prey. These include skinks, frogs, snakes and, {{in the case of the}} fairy pitta, shrews.|$|E

5000|$|Byzantine Greek and Late Latin <b>pitta</b> > pizza, cf. Modern Greek <b>pitta</b> {{bread and}} the Apulia and Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy) <b>pitta,</b> a round flat bread baked {{in the oven}} at high {{temperature}} sometimes with toppings. The word <b>pitta</b> can in turn be traced to either Ancient Greek πικτή (pikte), [...] "fermented pastry", which in Latin became [...] "picta", or Ancient Greek πίσσα (pissa, Attic πίττα, <b>pitta),</b> [...] "pitch", or pḗtea, [...] "bran" [...] (pētítēs, [...] "bran bread").|$|R
5000|$|The {{mangrove}} <b>pitta</b> {{was first}} described by German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel in 1863. Its species name {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek words mega- [...] "large", and rhynchos [...] "beak". It forms a superspecies with the Indian <b>pitta</b> (P. brachyura), fairy <b>pitta</b> (P. nympha) and blue-winged <b>pitta</b> (P. moluccensis). Alternate common names include: Larger blue-winged/Malay <b>pitta,</b> Brève des palétuviers (in French), Große Blauflügelpitta (in German), and Pita de Manglar (in Spanish). There are no recognized subspecies.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} pitta genera has varied considerably, ranging {{from one to}} as many as nine. In his 1863 work A Monograph of the Pittidae Daniel Elliot split the <b>pittas</b> into two genera, Pitta for the species with {{comparatively}} long tails and Brachyurus for the shorter tailed species. Barely two decades later, in 1880/81, John Gould split the family into nine genera, to which he also included the lesser melampitta (Melampitta), where it was kept until 1931 when Ernst Mayr demonstrated it had the syrinx was of an oscine bird. Soon afterwards Philip Sclater's Catalogue of the Birds of the British Museum brought the number back down to three.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pittas</b> are {{generally}} forest birds {{and as such}} are vulnerable to habitat loss caused by rapid deforestation. They can also be difficult birds to survey and are easily overlooked. Four species are assessed to be endangered, and a further nine are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Additionally eight species are listed as near-threatened and one, the Louisiade pitta, is too poorly known to be assessed and is listed as data deficient. The Gurney's pitta was not seen for 34 years between 1952 and 1986, before a small population was discovered in southern Thailand. This small population continued to decline since its rediscovery, and by 2000 it had reached a low of 10 pairs, and was listed as critically endangered. In 2003 the species was found in Burma {{for the first time}} since 1914, and in large numbers, between nine and thirty five thousand pairs. Although the species was considerably less threatened than thought, it is still of considerable conservation concern as deforestation of the habitat in Burma continues. The rapid rate of deforestation in Borneo has pushed the blue-headed pitta, previously considered common and secure as recently as 1996, into the list of species considered vulnerable. <b>Pittas</b> have also been targeted by poachers for the illegal wild bird trade. They are not targeted because of their song, as many songbirds are, and may simply be captured as bycatch from collecting other species, and because of their attractive plumage. According to some trappers they also may end up being eaten for food. On Manus, locals report that predation by snakes, including the brown tree snake, is responsbile for the rarity of the endangered superb pitta, but the snake, which is responsible for a number of extinctions across the Pacific, is native to the island.|$|E
25|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the New Zealand wrens {{has been a}} subject of considerable debate since their discovery, although they have long been known to be an unusual family. In the 1880s, Forbes assigned the New Zealand wrens to the suboscines related to the cotingas and <b>pittas</b> (and gave the family the name Xenicidae). Later, they {{were thought to be}} closer to the ovenbirds and antbirds. Sibley’s 1970 study comparing egg-white proteins moved them to the oscines, but later studies, including the 1982 DNA-DNA hybridization study, suggested the family was a sister taxon to the subocines and the oscines. This theory has proven most robust since then, and the New Zealand wrens might be the survivors of a lineage of passerines that was isolated when New Zealand broke away from Gondwana 82–85 million years ago (Mya), though a pre-Paleogene origin of passerines is highly disputed and tends to be rejected in more recent studies.|$|E
50|$|The green-breasted <b>pitta</b> (<b>Pitta</b> reichenowi) is {{a species}} of bird in the Pittidae family. It {{is one of only}} two <b>Pitta</b> species in Africa, and is found in deep forest of the tropics.|$|R
5000|$|The name pituri for {{the leaves}} chewed as a {{stimulant}} by traditional Aboriginal people has been {{claimed to be}} derived from the <b>Pitta</b> <b>Pitta</b> word [...]though Walter Roth pointed out in 1897 that the word pituri, thus pronounced, was the term used by the neighbouring Yurlayurlanya people, and added that the <b>Pitta</b> <b>Pitta</b> people called it tarembola.|$|R
5000|$|The rainbow <b>pitta</b> (<b>Pitta</b> iris) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the <b>pitta</b> family Pittidae, {{endemic to}} northern Australia.
