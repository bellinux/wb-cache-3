5000|$|At 10:00 in {{the morning}} of February 11, 1986, three or four masked gunmen riding in a Nissan Patrol jeep went to the New Capitol {{building}} in San Jose, Antique. While Evelio Javier was talking to his friends on the steps in front of the capitol building, the masked gunmen opened fire. [...] Time magazine described the scene: Evelio Javier, director of Corazon Aquino's campaign in the remote province of Antique, was sitting on the lawn in front of the capital building, taking a break from a debate over contested votes in his region, when a white vehicle <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> Without warning, a man in a black knit ski mask leaped out and started shooting. Javier jumped up and ran. Zigzagging across the building's broad concrete plaza, he tried to escape the relentless barrage of bullets. At least one hit its mark. Javier stumbled and fell into a small fishpond.Somehow, though, the fleeing man struggled to his feet and staggered across the street. By this time, other gunmen had begun to close in. Two approached from the left. Another, brandishing a [...]45 pistol, appeared in front of a warehouse. Javier ducked into an alley and tried to hide behind an outhouse door. But the masked killer found his prey and finished him off with a burst of gunfire.|$|E
40|$|It was a {{pastoral}} call I {{never want to}} make again. I had {{been up all night}} at a youth lock-in, when I was called to the home of one of my youth, Mary. She had just found her father unconscious on the bathroom floor. Her mother was doing CPR and the ambulance had just <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> but Mary already knew the outcome. Her father was dead. Friends and family slowly flooded their home. Mary had her friends with her in her room. Someone turned on the stereo, hoping for some words to accompany the event. I heard the strains of Bobby Mcferrin crooning out “Don’t Worry, Be Happy ” followed by a loud CRASH, and the sound of breaking glass. Mary had hurled her boom box out the two story window. For her, Mcferrin’s sentiments were more than inopportune or inappropriate; they were offensive. This was not the time for a cheerful song. Mary threw the boom box out her bedroom window because neither the form nor the content of “Don’t Worry, Be Happy ” matched, or expressed, her grief. Instead, her actions affirmed another popular lyric: “When All Hope is Gone, Sad Songs Say So Much. ” 1 In other words, when one is grieving, perhaps a more somber tune better fits, and thus articulates, one’s emotions. This truism is not new to the psalmist, for th...|$|E

Paternalism is a common phenomenon, one we probably encounter more often than we realize. Even though we do not always realize them as such, thoughts and judgments on paternalism are employed in decisions we make in day-to-day situations about how to treat people. An investigation of this liberty-limiting principle, then, should be of practical interest to everyone, not just philosophers interested in theory. I will investigate the subject of paternalism by looking at a variety of definitions and examples, exploring the autonomy-based antipaternalist positions of Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill, and finally, incorporating the ideas of Christine Korsgaard, a neo-Kantian philosopher, on personal identity into an argument for a Kantian version of respect for autonomy. Finally, I will present some general guidelines for paternalistic interference that can be applied practically...|$|R

Throughout the video, the pair is seen to have a pillow fight; play laser tag, Guitar Hero and slot cars; and throw a frisbee. The video also features Carey in various revealing outfits. The video begins with a small Compu Nerd Volkswagen, parodying Geek Squad, <b>pulling</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of Carey's large manor. As the employee introduces himself, Carey flippantly refers {{to him as a}} [...] "CompuNerd", and asks him to follow her to the broken computer. As he attends to it, Carey removes her robe, and enters her large closet, leaving McBrayer to begin his fantasy with her. The first scene is of Carey wearing a tight pink number, laying seductively on the bed, as the computer employee plays with an electric guitar. He joins her on the bed, and she begins playfully spanking him as the two enter a pillow fight. Another scene is interspersed, of Carey sporting a mini silver dress, with tall socks and heels, flaunting her body. The fantasy then adapts to a new scenery, of the pair dressed in medieval clothing, while walking a unicorn, followed by the duo in a large room in the mansion, racing electronic cars. As they proceed to play laser tag, they are shown outside, laying on a picnic bed, with Carey dressed in a [...] "naughty school girl outfit". They both get up, and begin to throw a frisbee, before relocating in front of the main stairwell in the mansion. The final scenes of the fantasy are of Carey, wearing a shortened red gown, standing atop the staircase, and McBrayer climbing on his knees while carrying flowers. All the scenes begin to fade, with the last being Carey feeding him by hand by the refrigerator, as he wakes up with Carey, now dressed, poking him. She tells the employee that security will let him out when he is finished, and leaves him while he is still fantasizing about her.|$|R
