40|$|To solve {{congestion}} problems facing many hospitals in developing countries, <b>baby</b> <b>cots</b> are being eliminated and mothers {{are made to}} sleep on the same bed with their new-born babies; a practice known as co-sleeping. The work presented here seeks to reduce risks of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and suffocation associated with co-sleeping by employing the formal engineering design process to develop a portable, safe and cost effective <b>baby</b> <b>cot.</b> The cot is attachable to the mother’s bed, has four movement restrictors to regulate the movement of the baby within a given range and a hard surface mattress {{to ensure the safety of}} the baby. There are ventilation ports provided to keep the temperature within the cot comfortable. The design can be modified to be used by older babies and may be mounted on a collapsible stand where space limitations are not critical...|$|R

While the effect of poor indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in office buildings has been vastly studied, very limited empirical studies on the effect of different environmental factors in daycare centres is available. In this study, the indoor air quality within <b>baby</b> <b>cots</b> of a Dutch daycare centre was studied in detail. Besides an extensive literature survey, actual measurements were performed at a daycare centre especially the effects of type and location of <b>baby</b> <b>cots</b> on the perceived indoor environmental quality. Analysis of the results obtained from this study shows indoor air quality levels in daycare centres requires more attention. The intention of this research is to come forward with some guidelines based on the lessons learned...|$|R

50|$|A bedside sleeper is a {{bassinet}} or <b>baby</b> <b>cot</b> that {{attaches to}} the parents bed, allowing newborns to sleep next to their parents safely. This {{is a form of}} safe co-sleeping, and has little risks associated with SIDS, unlike bedsharing. Bedside sleepers are a key component of rooming-in, which is a practice followed in hospitals to keep the baby by the mother’s bed, giving her time to establish a stronger bond with her baby.|$|R

On 18 October 1990, Folbigg put Patrick to bed. Craig Folbigg was awakened by the sounds of his wife screaming and found her standing at the <b>baby's</b> <b>cot.</b> He noticed the child wasn't breathing and attempted to revive him by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An ambulance was called and Patrick was taken to hospital. Patrick would later be diagnosed to be suffering from epilepsy and cortical blindness.|$|R

[...] "Just ’cause you’ve got some freaky {{offspring}} you wanna pin it on me?" [...] he asks. However his curiosity is aroused and he asks to see the [...] "spooky kid". Once at the house he leans over to peer into the <b>baby's</b> <b>cot,</b> only to reel back with a smashed and bloody nose for his trouble. This temporarily pushes the baby up in Lucy's estimation and she gazes lovingly at him, until the face in the cot turns into that of Hercules.|$|R

One, the Lovebug, a ladybird-shaped gadget designed to be clipped onto a <b>baby's</b> <b>cot</b> or child's pushchair - was singled out as a particular cause for concern, because of the likelihood that parents would trust it to keep mosquitoes away, and their children would be hurt as a result.

60|$|Two {{or three}} months went by, and though the baby was still a baby, the kitten was fast {{becoming}} a cat, and one evening when, as usual, the nurse came to look for her, {{to put her in}} the <b>baby's</b> <b>cot,</b> she was nowhere to be found. What a hunt there was for that kitten, to be sure! The servants, each anxious to find her, as the queen was certain to reward the lucky man, searched in the most impossible places. Boxes were opened that would hardly have held the kitten's paw; books were taken from bookshelves, lest the kitten should have got behind them, drawers were pulled out, for perhaps the kitten might have got shut in. But it was all no use. The kitten had plainly run away, and nobody could tell if it would ever choose to come back.|$|R
40|$|Purpose ??? This paper explores how PSS {{may create}} value in {{consumer}} markets in urban environment and how consumers value PSS beyond a narrow focus on functionality. Design/ methodology/approach ??? Within {{a case study}} of a use orientated PSS based on baby products, we conducted ten ethnographic interviews of current users of the scheme. Findings ??? Our data gives evidence that some of these products are important possessions for consumers??? identity construction. In contrast with highly visible products such as push-chairs, however, <b>baby</b> <b>cots</b> and car seats are seen by consumers from a more utilitarian perspective. Practical implications ??? The design of a PSS provision around products which are highly symbolic is problematic because of a need to fully understand the complex symbolism and hedonic value consumers attribute to these products. Originality /value ??? We fill a gap in PSS research by adopting a constructivist perspective to explore the multidimensional value consumers co-create around a baby products PSS...|$|R

30|$|A {{hotel that}} engages in {{innovation}} activities {{is able to}} intensify barriers to imitation, keep it portfolio ahead of the competitors and established a long-term competitive advantage. New products according to (Chang et al., 2011); Gallouj and Weinstein (1997), are goods and services that vary notably in their uniqueness or intended uses formally created by the firm. As stated by Dzhandzhugazova et al. (2016), lack of innovations in the hospitality industry leads to poor performance or exit of businesses. In most hotels, innovation is exhibited either through the service provided or in processes. The only way hotel industry can continue to grow is when managers invest in innovation {{to meet the needs}} of customers. Competing for new customers among hotels is high and a repeat business is always desired due to the perishable nature. The impressions registered in the mind of the customer about the hotel begin long before the customer walks through the door (Chang et al., 2011; Irimiea, 2012). These impressions are from a good innovative website that is easy to navigate, quality photos showing the facilities available, clear instructions including drawings, nearby points of interest, customers’ special needs such as handicapped accessible rooms, <b>baby</b> <b>cot</b> and etc.|$|R

5000|$|The {{story is}} set in mid-19th century Siam, during the era of King Mongkut and {{at the height of}} the Rattanakosin Dynasty, when Siam was plagued with wars with its {{neighboring}} kingdoms. Mak (Mario Maurer) was drafted to serve in a war, forcing him to leave behind his pregnant wife Nak (Davika Hoorne) at the town of Phra Khanong, not far from Central Bangkok. He was wounded during a battle and sent to a medical camp, where he met fellow soldiers Ter, Puak, Shin and Aey, who later became his best friends after he had saved them from certain death. Meanwhile, in Phra Khanong, Nak struggled alone painfully to give birth to the baby; she calls out for help, but she is too weak to be heard. Shortly after, rumors started circulating the village that Nak had died in labor and was now a ghost of a very powerful form haunting the house. The villagers in the neighborhood then heard her singing lullabies to her baby, terrifying them and forcing them to cower in fear. When Mak and his friends arrive back in Phra Khanong in the evening, they find the town completely silent. The five soon arrive at Mak and Nak's house during the night, and Mak introduces Nak to them. As it is now too dark to continue traveling, Mak's friends decide to stay. The following day, the men visit the village market but are shunned by the fearful community. A drunk villager attempts to shout out a warning to Mak but is forced down and hushed by her son. Mak's four friends then discuss what they had heard, but dismiss the rumors as ridiculous. Shin, however, while he was sent to fetch Mak, saw that the house was a dilapidated wreck that hadn't been maintained for months, that the <b>baby</b> <b>cot</b> that Mak and Nak's son, Dang, was supposed to be sleeping in, was rocking by itself, and then he saw Nak extending her arm to an unnatural length to retrieve a dropped lime under the house. The following day, Ter discovers a decomposed corpse behind the house wearing the exact same ring as Nak. The drunk villager who had also tried to warn them earlier also turned up mysteriously drowned. Soon, all four friends are convinced that she is a ghost. The friends then try numerous methods to convince Mak of the news, including a game of charades, and come within inches of being murdered by Nak, with only Mak's presence preventing her from doing so, and she scares them away. Worse, Mak dismisses all of their warnings, proclaims that they are no longer his friends, and kicks them out of their accommodations.|$|R

She's always avoided the chop but that might all change now she's dragged Warren back. You know what they say, if looks could kill". Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Daily Post said, of Mandy, [...] "she was sexually abused by her father and held hostage by her psychotic best friend, she lost half her family in tragic circumstances and her <b>baby</b> in a <b>cot</b> death, so you could forgive Hollyoaks's Mandy Richardson if she sometimes wished a superhero would come and whisk her away".|$|R

Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one," [...] she told the Daily Mirror. [...] "But Ronnie is a soap character {{and she is not}} necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it." [...] On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented [...] "in an offensive manner" [...] because it [...] "appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a <b>baby</b> through <b>cot</b> death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: [...] "Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world." ...|$|R

When Diana has her baby inside the cave, Brianna (who was trying to rescue her) set the newborn baby on the Gaiaphage because she became hypnotized by the Gaiaphage's powers, due to which she thought she was setting the <b>baby</b> on a <b>cot.</b> The Gaiaphage swarmed over the baby and manifested itself inside it and the baby became a five-bar mutant. Diana then names the child Gaia, even though she later thought she wanted to name her something like 'Sally', 'Chloe' or 'Melissa', but she felt compelled to call her Gaia at that time, which most likely happened due to the powers of the baby. In Light, she punches Little Pete and also makes an adult climbing the FAYZ wall from the outside appear inside the FAYZ and rips his arm off for food and later beheads him to provide a new body for Drake, who was taken out by Diana. Gaia has no special power of her own, but she can use any mutant's power in the FAYZ as if it were her own, but only {{as long as they are}} alive, because in Light, she prefers to kill normal humans before she kills those with powers, and she also loses her ability to travel faster when she kills Brianna, who had that power.|$|R
