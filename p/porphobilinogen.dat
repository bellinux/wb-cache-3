Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (<b>porphobilinogen</b> synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E

50|$|A Swedish study {{indicated}} that approximately 90% of cases of acute intermittent porphyria are due to a mutation in the HMBS gene that causes decreased amounts of the enzyme, {{and to a lesser}} degree by a mutation that causes decreased activity of each enzyme molecule. Under normal circumstances, heme synthesis begins in the mitochondrion, proceeds into the cytoplasm, and finishes back in the mitochondrion.

Porphyrins are synthesized from glycine and succinyl CoA, which condense to give δ-aminolevulinate.
