40|$|Emergences of {{computers}} and information technological revolution made tremendous changes {{in the real world}} and provides a different dimension for the intelligent data analysis. Well formed fact, the information at right time and at right place deploy a better knowledge. However, the challenge arises when larger volume of inconsistent data is given for decision making and knowledge extraction. To handle such imprecise data certain mathematical tools of greater importance has developed by researches in recent past namely fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, rough Set, formal concept analysis and ordering rules. It is also observed that many information system contains numerical attribute values and therefore they are almost similar instead of exact similar. To handle such type of information system, in this paper we use two <b>processes</b> such as <b>pre</b> <b>process</b> and post <b>process.</b> In <b>pre</b> <b>process</b> we use rough set on intuitionistic fuzzy approximation space with ordering rules for finding the knowledge whereas in post process we use formal concept analysis to explore better knowledge and vital factors affecting decisions.

40|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} process vary in {{the degree}} to which they attempt to deal with different complicating aspects of diagnosis such as relative importance of symptoms, varied symptom pattern and the relation between diseases them selves. Based on decision theory, in the past many mathematical models such as crisp set, probability distribution, fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set were developed to deal with complicating aspects of diagnosis. But, many such models are failed to include important aspects of the expert decisions. Therefore, an effort has been made to process inconsistencies in data being considered by Pawlak with the introduction of rough set theory. Though rough set has major advantages over the other methods, but it generates too many rules that create many difficulties while taking decisions. Therefore, it is essential to minimize the decision rules. In this paper, we use two <b>processes</b> such as <b>pre</b> <b>process</b> and post process to mine suitable rules and to explore the relationship among the attributes. In <b>pre</b> <b>process</b> we use rough set theory to mine suitable rules, whereas in post process we use formal concept analysis from these suitable rules to explore better knowledge and most important factors affecting the decision making.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{heuristic}} method which {{is applied to}} solving the mixed <b>process</b> <b>signal</b> separation problem is presented. Based on a stochastic searching technique, the proposed method performs simultaneously the estimation of the demixing and corresponding second moment (covariance) matrices so as to separate mixed <b>process</b> <b>signals</b> arising from several original sources. It hinges on one of state-of-theart evolutionary algorithms, termed differential evolution (DE) that is particularly devised for continues optimization. In the context of signal separation, the presented method could seek efficiently and reliably the optimal estimate of the demixing matrix for the mixed <b>process</b> <b>signals,</b> such as including autoregressive (AR) series, step change in process mean, and Gaussian noises. Following the proposed approach, the blind signal separation framework can be posed as a nonlinear mixed signal problem, where only the demixing matrix appear as unknowns.

40|$|Information {{technology}} {{revolution has}} brought a radical {{change in the way}} data are collected or generated for ease of decision making. It is generally observed that the data has not been consistently collected. The huge amount of data has no relevance unless it provides certain useful information. Only by unlocking the hidden data we can not use it to gain insight into customers, markets, and even to setup a new business. Therefore, the absence of associations in the attribute values may have information to predict the decision for our own business or to setup a new business. Based on decision theory, in the past many mathematical models such as naïve Bayes structure, human composed network structure, Bayesian network modeling etc. were developed. But, many such models have failed to include important aspects of classification. Therefore, an effort has been made to process inconsistencies in data being considered by Pawlak with the introduction of rough set theory.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to explore {{possibilities}} of implementing low-cost instruments such as spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes by applying Digital Alias-free Signal Processing (DASP) techniques. For most of signal processing tasks where traditional DSP is applied the information of bandwidth of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is required to be known. Here the sampling rate is decided {{to be at least}} twice the actual bandwidth of the signal. However, there are cases where the exact bandwidth information of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is unknown or the reconstructibility of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is not needed. Then this demand on sampling rates leads to oversampling of the analysed signal. Review of literature shows that application of DASP is an ideal solution on this issue. In comparison with traditional DSP, DASP does not require the exact bandwidth information of the signal and can still <b>process</b> the analysed <b>signals</b> for different signal processing tasks at lower sampling rates such as sub-Nyquist, even sub-Landau rates. Therefore the work reported in this thesis concentrates on the investigation of DASP techniques for reducing the costs of contemporary instruments.

30|$|The wavelet {{transform}} (WT) [15, 16] {{is an effective}} technique {{that can be used}} to analyze both time and frequency contents of the signal. However, WT uses some fixed basis mother wavelets, independent of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal,</b> which makes it non-adaptive. Another successful method for feature extraction, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [17], represents the non-linear and non-stationary signal in terms of modes that correspond to the underlying signal. EMD is a data-driven approach that does not use a fixed set of basis functions, but is self-adaptive according to the <b>processed</b> <b>signal.</b> It decomposes a signal into finite, well-defined, low-frequency and high-frequency components known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) or modes.|$|R
