30|$|The use of {{recycled}} and innovative materials has also received an increasing attention {{due to their}} capability of limiting the environmental burden exerted by infrastructures equipped with them: the use of secondary materials, in fact, avoids the recourse to virgin materials and therefore prevents their depletion. Huang et al. [17], for instance, applied the LCA methodology to an asphalt-paving project at London, Heathrow and discussed the possibility to use waste glass, incinerator bottom ash, and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) as substitute for natural aggregates. They found {{that the use of}} RAP produces the lowest environmental impact compared with the other two alternatives. Specifically, the recycled materials were found to reduce the <b>primary</b> <b>bitumen</b> by approximately 7  % and the amount of natural aggregates by approximately 30  %.|$|E

The paper presents rheological properties (G*, δ, ν*) determined and compared for four bituminous binders (unmodified and polymer modified bitumen) at temperature 46 – 60 (80) °C and dynamic viscosity at temperature 130 – 190 °C (Brookfield viscometer). On {{the basis of}} viscosity results {{it is possible to}} set optimal production and compaction temperatures. Elastic and viscous behavior of binder in the middle temperature is determined in rheometers. The higher value of complex modulus, the stiffer bitumen binder is able to resist deformation. The greater content of elastic components (e. g. polymer in bitumen) varies mainly elastic-viscous properties of <b>primary</b> <b>bitumen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{generation}} is undoubtedly {{in the focus}} of research on conventional and unconventional oil and gas. Of particular interest is {{the understanding of the}} chemical and isotopic composition of hydrocarbon gases, and the alternation of original porosity and permeability of shales with increasing thermal maturity. However current knowledge of petroleum formation cannot fully explain some phenomena observed in sedimentary basins and pyrolysis experiments. The relative depletion of methane in pyrolysis gas compared with natural gas, the abnormally low values of Rock-Eval Hydrogen Indices (HI) in source rocks and the difficulty in integrating atomic H/C ratios and Rock-Eval hydrogen indices indicate that some processes in kerogen cracking are still not understood. The liberation of H 2 during the pyrolysis of source rocks, largely ignored in previous research, has a significant effect on hydrogen mass balance during kerogen decomposition and hydrocarbon formation. This thesis is focused on the systematic investigation of H 2 and methane release from sedimentary carbonaceous rocks in the open- and closed-system pyrolysis experiments. The samples analyzed comprise immature and mature source rocks with different kerogen types, organic matter richness and sulfur contents. Samples were pyrolyzed at different heating rates and in open and closed systems. The results from open system non-isothermal pyrolysis experiments up to a final temperature of 1200 °C show that H 2 and CH 4 generation do not proceed simultaneously. For coals the H 2 pyrograms show single and broad peaks while for shales complex patterns are observed. For both, coals and shales, molar yields of H 2 are always much higher than the corresponding CH 4 yields, with molar H 2 /CH 4 ratios ranging from 3. 5 to 12. Similar to CH 4 yields the molar H 2 yields correlate well with the TOC values of the samples, indicating a purely organic origin of H 2. One implication {{of this study is that}} the Rock-Eval HI, based only on hydrocarbon yields, largely underestimates the “true” hydrogen content of source rocks because it disregards H 2 liberation from organic matter. In closed system (MSSV) non-isothermal pyrolysis experiments up to final temperatures from 400 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min, H 2 yields were much lower than in open systems while CH 4 yields were much higher. Here the H 2 yields were found to depend strongly on the degree of filling of the reaction vessels. This is taken as an indication of temperature- and partial pressure-dependent reactions of hydrogen atoms/radicals or molecules from primary cracking reactions with residual matter and <b>primary</b> <b>bitumen.</b> Compared to other shales, the immature lacustrine Condor Shale from Australia with very low sulfur content exhibited the highest TOC-normalized H 2 yields and the lowest hydrocarbon yields during closed system pyrolysis. This indicates that sulfur content and H 2 S formation have a significant effect on H 2 and hydrocarbon liberation. To investigate the interdependence of the liberation of H 2 S and H 2 the Condor Shale and two Cretaceous marlstones from southern Lebanon (Hasbayya) with high organic sulfur contents were subjected to MSSV pyrolysis up to temperatures from 350 to 600 °C at 1 °C/min. While the pyrolysis of the Condor Shale produced no H 2 S, this gas was the main component liberated from the sulfur-rich Hasbayya samples up to a temperature of 450 °C. In the pyrolysis gases of both Hasbayya samples the H 2 S/H 2 molar ratios decreased significantly up to 600 °C. Also the H 2 S/CH 4 molar ratio decreased continuously and dropped to values less than 1 at pyrolysis temperatures above 475 °C. During the pyrolysis of the sulfur-rich kerogen more hydrogen was liberated as H 2 S than as CH 4 and H 2 at temperatures below 475 °C. At higher temperatures hydrogen release occurred mainly as CH 4. Thus, besides the pyrolytic H 2 liberation in sulfur-rich source rocks, H 2 S liberation plays a significant role in the hydrogen mass balance and should be reconsidered in future studies...|$|E

50|$|While the <b>primary</b> {{distinction}} between <b>bitumen</b> and pyrobitumen is solubility, the thermal processes driving the molecular cross-linking also decrease the atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon from greater than one {{to less than}} one and ultimately to approximately one half. It should also be understood that both solubility and atomic H/C ratios form a continuum, and most solid bitumens have both soluble and insoluble components. The {{distinction between}} pyrobitumen and residual kerogen in a mature source rock is based on microscopic evidence of fluid flow within the rock fabric and is usually not determined.|$|R
40|$|Solid bitumens {{found in}} {{carbonate}} rocks of the Shiwan Dashan basin, south China, are suggested {{to have been}} matured under high pressure and moderate temperature conditions. These bitumens have differ-ent geochemical characteristics from thermally matured bitumen: very high bitumen reflectance (ROB) values and compact molecular structures (bigger size of crystal nucleus, more layer number of aromatic cycle, lower lamellar distance and so on) {{in spite of the}} chemical components reflecting lower thermal maturity. Therefore these are named as compressively matured bitumen. The geochemical characteristics of the compressively matured bitumens result from increase in its crystalline degree (grain size) under high pressures, not at high temperatures. The compressively matured bitumens retain chemical composi-tion, molecular evolution parameters (associated with their chemical components) and hydrocarbon-pro-ducing potential similar to those of thermally less mature bitumens. High temperature and high pressure experiments proved that pressure and temperature have similar effect on the maturation indices, such as ROB values and molecular structures. The above contrasting geochemical characteristics can be used to distinguish the compressively matured bitumens from thermally matured bitumens. However, the maturity estimated by the ROB val-ues of <b>primary</b> anisotropic <b>bitumens</b> in the lower Triassic (T 1) carbonate rocks of the Shiwan Dashan basin, south China, is much higher than that estimated by RO, according to the published relationships between ROB and RO. Gao and Chen (1998) suggested that the difference in maturation pressure could have caused these different types of bitumens. This study was conducted to under-stand the origin of these bitumens based on the structural and optical characters and results of high pressure and high temperature experiments...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafines are {{predominantly}} delaminated colloidal clays with dimensions < 0. 9 um that exist naturally in oil sands and are released during conditioning of surface-mined ores. Critical concentrations of these ultrafines and the cations present in process water {{are capable of}} forming flocculated structures with a very high water holding capacity. During <b>primary</b> separation of <b>bitumen</b> these ultrafines are detrimental to recovery {{as a result of}} increased slurry viscosity as well as through slime coating of released bitumen. Disposition into tailings ponds eventually produces mature fine tailings (MFT) as a result of thixotropic gel formation that entraps coarser solids. The ultrafines concentration of ~ 3 wt% observed in MFT coincides with the critical gelation concentration determined for suspensions of ultrafines in salt solutions with cationic concentration representative of that in pond water. This observation accounts for 100 % of the water holding capacity of MFT and also explains why virtually no water is released once an MFT gel state has been formed. Here, we review earlier research in this area and identify the harmful effects of ultrafines in some current problematic ores. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
