40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to check the effect of the use of a <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> on the clogging process of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands by means of dynamic modelling. The hydraulic submodel was based on series as well as parallel branched complete stirred tanks of equal volume. The model was validated with data obtained from 2 identical experimental wetlands, which had a surface area of 0. 54 m(2) and a water depth of 0. 30 m, and that were monitored over a period of 5 months. One of the wetlands was fed with settled urban wastewater, whereas the other with the same wastewater, but previously treated with a <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>treatment.</b> In the model, pore volume reduction depends on the growth of bacteria and on solids retained. The effluent concentrations of COD and ammonium in both experimental wetlands were very similar in all the conditions tested, and therefore the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> did not improve the removal efficiency. The model indicated that after 120 days of operation in some regions of the wetland fed with settled wastewater the porosity decreased in a 17 %, whereas in the other wetlands it only decreased as much as 6 %.

Four metallic coagulants (ferric chloride, fer-ric sulphate, aluminium polychloride and aluminium sul-phate) with doses ranging between 50 and 300 mg L– 1 and two polyelectrolytes (high-density anionic and cationic rea-gents) with doses from 2 to 12 mg L– 1 were tested. Neither an adequate type of coagulant nor an optimal dose could be found. The removal of contaminants was measured as total and dissolved chemical oxygen demand (COD). Soluble COD removal efficiencies were low, from 0 to 47 %, with a 4 % average value only. These low values of organic material removal were attributed to the particular characteristics of the Merida {{landfill leachate}} (low suspended solids concentra-tion), so even with sweep-floc coagulation (300 mg L– 1 dose) only low COD removal efficiencies were obtained. A study of the suspended particle size distribution of the leachate was conducted in order to explain the poor performance. The particle size distribution ranged from 0. 375 to 948. 2 µm, with an average value of 22. 97 µm.

Polymers, which are long chains of high molecular weight and high charge, when added to water begin to form longer chains, allowing removing numerous particles of suspended matter.

40|$|A novel chemico-kinetic {{disintegration}} {{model has}} been applied to study the cooperative relationship between <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> and supplementary wet-state milling of biomass, as an efficient process route to achieve high enzyme accessibility. Wheat straw, Miscanthus and short-rotation willow were studied as three contrasting biomass species, which were subjected to controlled hydrothermal pretreatment using a microwave reactor, followed by controlled wet-state ball-milling. Comparative particle disintegration behaviour and related enzyme digestibilities have been interpreted on the basis of model parameters and with evaluation of textural and chemical differences in tissue structures, aided by the application of specific material characterisation techniques. Supplementary milling led to a 1. 3 ×, 1. 6 × and 3 × enhancement in glucose saccharification yield after 24 h for straw, Miscanthus and willow, respectively, following a standardised 10 -min hydrothermal treatment, with corresponding milling energy savings of 98, 97 and 91 % predicted from the model, compared to the unmilled case. The results confirm the viability of pretreatment combined with supplementary wet-milling as an efficient process route. The results will be valuable in understanding the key parameters for process design and optimisation and also the key phenotypical parameters for feedstock breeding and selection for highest saccharification yield...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The most {{important}} nutrients in controlling water quality are: carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. They {{are essential to}} the growth of all living organisms. These are the nutritional pillars of bacteria, fish, trees and humans. Unfortunately, when a water body or plan becomes rich in these nutrients, particularly phosphorus, this causes some organisms such as algae to grow in abundance which makes the environment ugly. These algae are usually undesirable and may inevitably cause changes in pH, dissolved oxygen, colour and turbidity of the water environment, hence the environment becomes eutrophic and its color turns to green. To address and solve the eutrophication issue, the amount of phosphorus discharged into the receiving milieu must be reduced; and this constitutes the main purpose of our research. We proceeded so as to make a physico-chemical phosphorus removal from urban waste water. The <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> is based on looking for and finding the optimal dose of the various added coagulants. The aim of our work is to confirm the efficiency of the chemical treatment through use: lime, ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate as coagulant for this treatment. Index Terms—Nutrient, phosphorus, algae, eutrophication...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{landfilling}} {{has emerged}} as the most widely employed method for municipal solid waste disposal especially in ASEAN countries. However, due to the presence of refractory compounds in stabilized landfill leachates which results in the inefficiency of biological treatment methods, other alternatives such as <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> methods are being look into and adsorption method seems promising. Nevertheless, the raw materials used for the preparation of adsorbents in the industry are usually non-renewable materials thus resulting in high operational costs. Therefore, present study evaluates the ability of palm oil mill effluent sludge (POMES) derived biochar in the treatment of chemical oxygen demand (COD), color and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH 3 -N) from stabilized landfill leachate obtained from Sahom landfill located in Kampar, Perak, Malaysia using response surface methodology (RSM) technique. It was found that the removal efficiency of the leachate pollutants by POMES biochar is highly dependent on the production process such as temperature and holding time. In this study, 44. 26 % of COD, 70. 20 % of color and 30. 56 % of NH 3 -N were removed from stabilized landfill leachate via optimized biocharat 452 °C temperature and 66 minutes of holding time...|$|R
