While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> on the case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, {{while trying}} to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies {{unconscious}} in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses {{that he was the}} one who put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he is laughing.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E

500|$|On April 22, 1947, Skelton was {{censored by}} NBC two minutes into his radio show. When {{he and his}} {{announcer}} Rod O'Connor began talking about Fred Allen being censored the previous week, they were silenced for 15 seconds; comedian Bob Hope was given the same treatment once he began referring to the censoring of Allen. Skelton forged on with his lines for his studio audience's benefit; the material he insisted on using had been edited from the script by the network before the broadcast. He had been briefly censored the previous month {{for the use of}} the word [...] "diaper". After the April incidents, NBC indicated it would no longer <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> for similar reasons.|$|E
500|$|The Chinese-language press {{reported}} on rumours that Chinese officials had approached high-level executives at TVB and CableTV, asking {{them not to}} broadcast the ceremony live on their channels; executives affirmed their plans to broadcast—scheduling for the event was immutable.

An editorial in the South China Morning Post said: [...] "this heavy-handed reaction [...] is counterproductive to [...] image and the respect it wants as a peaceful superpower.

The CMJ New Music Report gave Spit {{a positive}} review: [...] "the teenage babes in Ontario, Canada's Kittie will scratch and claw their way into the dark recesses of your hearts thanks to their debut, the smashing 'n' stomping Spit". The Washington Post criticized the album: [...] "All four members of this Canadian metal-punk band are women, which is still a novel (though certainly not unique) lineup for a headbanging ensemble. Too bad that's virtually the quartet's only distinguishing feature". The review concluded, [...] "After four or five of these pounding rockers, Kittie becomes a bore." [...] Exclaim! also criticized the album: [...] "Guidance Counsellor's advice: <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> and stay in school". NME gave the album a four-out-of-ten rating: [...] "Like kindred spirits System of a Down, Kittie want to give you the impression that they're just too tasty to fuk wit, too unhinged to view as normal folk, too pierced for the mainstream." [...] Spit was number 24 on Metal Descent's [...] "25 Best Alternative Metal Albums" [...] list, and [...] "Brackish" [...] was on Fuse's [...] "19 Best Nu-Metal Hits of All Time" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

2500|$|A {{test track}} for a tracked {{hovercraft}} system was built at Earith near Cambridge, England. It ran southwest from Sutton Gault, sandwiched between the Old Bedford River {{and the smaller}} Counter Drain to the west. Careful examination of the site will still reveal traces of the concrete piers used to support the structure. The actual vehicle, RTV31, is preserved at Railworld in Peterborough and {{can be seen from}} trains, just south west of Peterborough railway station. The vehicle achieved [...] on 7 February 1973 but the project was cancelled a week later. The project was managed by Tracked Hovercraft Ltd., with Denys Bliss as Director in the early 1970s, then axed by the Aerospace Minister, Michael Heseltine. Records of this project are available from the correspondence and papers of Sir Harry Legge-Bourke, MP at Leeds University Library. Heseltine was accused by Airey Neave and others of misleading the House of Commons when he stated that the government was still considering giving financial support to the Hovertrain, when the decision to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> had already been taken by the Cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|On January 8, 1979 NBC moved Jeopardy! from 10:30a.m. to noon, {{the time}} slot the {{original}} series had occupied and {{done well in}} for many years. However, the television climate in 1979 was much different {{than it was in}} the 1960s and early 1970s. The 12:00p.m. hour was one that network affiliates often chose to pre-empt in favor of showing other programming such as a midday local newscast or a syndicated offering such as another game show or a talk show. In markets that did air Jeopardy! at noon, the show found itself losing the ratings battle against The $20,000 Pyramid on ABC and The Young and the Restless on CBS. NBC decided to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> on the revived Jeopardy! series shortly after the move, and its 108th and final episode aired on March 2, 1979. Its place on the schedule was taken by Password Plus, which at the time had been airing at 12:30p.m., and the cancellation allowed NBC to expand their top rated soap opera, Another World, to ninety minutes from sixty.|$|E
