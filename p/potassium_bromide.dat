The influence of n-amyl alcohol at gold and nickel electrodes and naphthalene at gold, platinum, silver and nickel electrodes was investigated by means of an impedance bridge method. In the case of amyl alcohol at gold and nickel electrodes, the capacity potential curves do not reveal significant changes such as the capacity minimum at the point near about the potential of zero charge and adsorption-desorption peaks at extreme polarizations as observed with mercury electrodes. The results of capacitance measurements in the presence of naphthalene at platinum, gold, nickel (activated) electrodes indicate that it is not adsorbed contrary to the radiotracer observations of Bockris, Green and Swinkles.

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of water absorbing/releasing of 4 A Molecular sieve desiccant was primarily investigated by weighting method.

The saturated water absorbing capability of Zeolte desiccant increase with the increasing environmental humuidity. The water absorbing rate of sacked Molecular sieve desiccant is only 1 / 6 of the essential value. After water absorbing capability is saturated, relative humidity equilibrium exists between the environment and Molecular sieve desiccant, and the humidity of Molecular sieve desiccant varies in the range of 6. 1 - 31. 9 %.

As a profound difference in approach to common speciation extraction techniques, in which a set of operationally defined mercury fractions is obtained, the K value obtained in this work represents a thermodynamical parameter feasible for further mathematical processing.

40|$|The authors {{present the}} design and {{preliminary}} results {{of the performance of}} a hybrid chemical/mechanical, low-lift (20 C) heat pump. Studies have indicated that this heat pump has several advantages over the traditional single fluid vapor compression (reverse Rankine) heat pump. Included in these benefits are: 1) increased COPc due to the approximation of the cycle to the Lorenz cycle and due to the availability of the heat of solution, along with the heat of vaporization, to provide cooling; and 2) ease of variation in system cooling capacity by changing the fluid composition. The system performance is predicted for a variety of refrigerant-absorbent pairs. Cooling capacity is determined for systems operating with ammonia as the refrigerant and lithium nitrate and sodium thiocyanate as the absorbents and also with water as the refrigerant and magnesium chloride, <b>potassium</b> hydroxide, lithium <b>bromide,</b> sodium hydroxide, and sulfuric acid as the absorbents. Early indications have shown that the systems operating with water as the refrigerant operate at 2 - 4 times the capacity of the ammonia-refrigerant-based systems.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the conditions of}} spectral change, several experiments were performed. The spectrum change was not observed when anthracene, before being embedded in KBr, was irradiated with UV in He of 4.0 × 104 Pa (300 Torr). In the case of irradiation in air, the spectral features did not change, although the color of anthracene became yellowish. It has been observed that yellow anthraquinone is formed by irradiation {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Nevertheless, the spectrum of the yellowish sample does not correspond with anthraquinone. The spectral evolution was completely duplicated with the irradiation of anthracene embedded in KCl or NaCl. Namely, <b>potassium</b> and <b>bromide</b> do not affect the formation of dianthracene. When anthracene and KBr were mixed and irradiated with UV before being made into a pellet under pressure, the spectral change was negligible. Accordingly, the pressure in forming the pellet is a clue to the spectral evolution. To form a KBr pellet, the mixture of anthracene and KBr powders was pressed at 6 × 103 kg/cm 2. It is known that the formation of dianthracene is accelerated depending on the domain structure of anthracene crystals (Ramdas et al., 1980). Actually, formation of dianthracene in KBr pellets has been previously reported using bulk anthracene crystals with similar trends even in nanometer sized anthracene grains (Bernas et al., 1966; Chandross and Ferguson, 1966). Since the crystal structure of anthracene may be fragile because it is a molecular crystal, pressing will reduce the crystallinity of anthracene grains. However, the absorption features attributed to the anthracene molecule were not changed after it was embedded in the KBr pellet. Similar spectral changes were observed even when the pressure for pressing the KBr pellet was as low as 7.5 × 102 kg/cm 2. When a similar irradiation experiment was performed on other PAHs, such as phenanthrene, naphthacene (tetracene), pentacene, pyrene, chrysene and coronene, no alteration of the spectral features was observed except for anthracene, even when xenon white light was irradiated.|$|R
