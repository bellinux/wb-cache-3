50|$|To {{ensure the}} {{determinism}} required, most real-time Ethernet standards enforce a master-to-slave-only method of communications. This can {{conflict with the}} need for a node in the system to exchange data efficiently with a node other than the network master. The conventional method to achieve this in a master-slave network is to pass data from one slave node to the master, where it is reissued to one or more different slaves. For example, if several servo drives on a network are to be synchronized to a signal from another drive on the network, the master must fetch the signal from this drive and reissue it to all other drives on the network. Disadvantages to this method are that delays are induced due to the multiple cycles required, and the master’s processing load is increased as it must actively participate in the function, although it contributes nothing. Since no data is destroyed in a Sercos III telegram, data to and from any slave can be accessed by another node on the network without any additional cycle delay or master intervention. Additionally, as telegrams pass each node twice in a cycle (for both topology types), a node can even have the opportunity to access data supplied by a subsequent node. Two <b>peer</b> <b>communication</b> methods are defined in the Sercos III specification: Controller to Controller (C2C) for multiple masters to communicate with one another, and Cross Communication (CC) for multiple slaves.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} attract {{qualified}} candidates {{and to play}} a competitive role {{in the battle for}} talent, organizations employ principles of active employer branding management (Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004; Edwards, 2010). Specifically, organizations try to communicate to existing and prospective staff the attractiveness and unique aspects of their organization as an employer. A company’s reputation and the ability to attract good candidates, however, are not solely dependent on information that is spread by the organization. Also <b>peer</b> <b>communication</b> has been identified as an important recruitment-related information source (Van Hoye & Lievens, 2009). Before applying, potential candidates turn to family, friends and peers for information about job vacancies and employers (Wanberg, Kanfer,& Banas, 2000). Information about the selection procedure, however, has also been found {{to play an important role}} in attracting applicants (Chapman, Uggerslev, Carroll, & Piasentin, 2005). In this study we suggested that <b>peer</b> <b>communication</b> about the selection procedure may influence applicants’ attitudes (i. e., test anxiety and test motivation) towards this selection procedure, through the formation of interpersonal and distributive justice expectations. Test anxiety and motivation may bias performance (e. g., McCarthy & Goffin, 2004; Proost, Derous, Schreurs, Hagtvet, & De Witte, 2008, Schmit & Ryan, 1992), resulting in lower validity of test results and possibly wrongful rejection of qualified applicants. Especially in tight labor markets where organizations struggle to attract high potential staff, missing out on potentially valuable staff should be avoided (Carless & Imber, 2007. The hypotheses were addressed in an experiment. The results of the moderated hierarchical regression analyses supported most of our hypotheses. <b>Peer</b> <b>communication</b> about interpersonal justice shaped applicants’ interpersonal justice expectations which in turn were negatively related to applicants’ test anxiety and positively to test motivation. <b>Peer</b> <b>communication</b> about distributive justice shaped applicants’ distributive justice expectations, which in turn were positively related to applicants’ test motivation. Distributive justice expectations, however, were not negatively related to test anxiety. A significant mediating effect was found of interpersonal justice expectations on the relationship between <b>peer</b> <b>communication</b> about interpersonal justice and test anxiety. Also, a significant mediating effect was found of distributive justice expectations on the relationship between <b>peer</b> <b>communication</b> about distributive justice and test motivation. The study supports the suggestion that applicants’ justice expectations are an explanatory mechanism in the relationship between <b>peer</b> <b>communication</b> and test attitudes. This study demonstrates that organizations should become more aware of the important role <b>peer</b> <b>communication</b> about the selection procedure can play to attract personnel. Organizations may not be able to control what will actually be shared about the selection process, but they can make sure that employees have no reason to talk negatively about the selection process to potential applicants by implementing a selection process that is fair and respectful. Applicants who feel reassured by the expectations that they will be treated fairly and with respect may be able to show their true potential during a selection procedure and may enhance the organizations’ chance of hiring best qualified staff. status: publishe...|$|E
