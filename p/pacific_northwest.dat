In the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest,</b> the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.|$|E

5|$|In North America, it {{is found}} mainly in areas east of the Mississippi River, but similar {{mushrooms}} also occur in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest,</b> the Southwest, and Texas. Its range also stretches south into Mexico. They are ecologically mycorrhizal, and habitats include hardwood forests and coniferous forests.

It is primarily eastern in distribution but also reported in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest,</b> the Southwest, and Texas (with an apparent association with pecan trees).|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the Spruce Production Division {{continued}} long after the unit was demobilized. Not only did the division dramatically increase the production of forest products for the war effort, but the transportation network that it built helped open up <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest</b> forests to greater use in the decades that followed. In addition, the division's work rules became the standard for logging and sawmill operations throughout the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest</b> well into the 1930s.|$|E

Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} Industrial Workers of the World, the union that was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest.</b> After studying the situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest</b> to support United States war production.|$|E
5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest</b> {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest</b> and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E

Pacific Oceanic tectonic plates have plunged below the North American Plate in this part of North America for hundreds of millions of years. Heat from these subducting plates has fed scores of volcanoes in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia over at least the past 30 million years (see Geology of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest)</b> and is also responsible for activities in the Lassen {{volcanic area}}.|$|E
