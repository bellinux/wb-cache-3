Vacant space was let to businesses, but the enormous complex was only ever partially occupied after Bass left. Vulnerable to damage and poorly maintained, fires started in 1969 and 1976, the latter resulting major damage to three of the malthouses. Some of the space was used for chicken-rearing by G. W.

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>malting</b> was introduced, in which the barley is aerated and the {{temperature}} carefully controlled, accelerating the germination. Large malting floors were no longer necessary, but power consumption was high, so floor malting held on well into the twentieth century. Only a handful of traditional malting floors are still in use.|$|E

The name stemmed from Mr. Nunnemacher's acquisition of the American manufacturing rights to equipment that originated from Nicholas Galland, a Frenchman, and a German named Julius Henning.|$|E
50|$|Steeping is {{the start}} of the active malting process, steep water is added to cover the grain and the grain {{moisture}} content increases from around 12% to between 40 and 45%. In a modern <b>pneumatic</b> <b>malt</b> house, the grain is alternatively submerged (wet stand) and then drained (an air rest) for two or three cycles to achieve the target grain moisture content and chit count.|$|R
