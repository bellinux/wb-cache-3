5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt {{and the other}} upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E

Sukarno ordered Sudirman to return to Yogyakarta as well, but Sudirman refused to let the Dutch withdraw without a fight; he considered the TNI to now {{be strong enough to}} defeat the dispirited Dutch. Although he was promised medicine and support in Yogyakarta, Sudirman refused to return to the political leadership, whom he considered acquiescent to the Dutch. He only agreed to return after receiving a letter, although sources disagree on its sender. On 10 July, Sudirman and his group returned to Yogyakarta, where they were greeted by thousands of civilians and warmly received by the political elite there. The reporter Rosihan Anwar, who was present when the letter was delivered, wrote in 1973 that [...] "Sudirman had to return to Yogyakarta to avoid any <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rift among the republic's top leaders".|$|E
500|$|Several viewers {{outside the}} film industry, such as evangelical pastors and commentators, argued that Frozen {{promotes}} normalization of homosexuality, while others {{believed that the}} main character, Elsa, represents a positive image of LGBT youth, viewing the film and the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} coming out. These claims were met with mixed reactions from both audiences and the LGBT community. Writing for Film International, Robert Geal has argued that while the film offers a superficially progressive vision of homosexuality, it perpetuates conservative notions about sexuality and gender; whereas Elsa's female homosexuality is rendered visually pleasurable to a male gaze, male transgressions of heterosexuality are coded in various negative ways. When asked about <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> homosexual undertone in the film, Lee said, [...] "We know what we made. But at the same time I feel like once we hand the film over, it belongs to the world, so I don't like to say anything, and let the fans talk. I think it's up to them."

After three art directors were rejected by the band and pressing was behind schedule, Green Day asked the help of Chris Bilheimer, a friend of Armstrong who had done covers for another group signed by Warner Bros. Records, R.E.M. Having just the album title to work on, Bilheimer had some ideas, with the one that went through being inspired by a photograph Bilheimer saw, where a politician’s poster had had his face removed. He felt the image was [...] "striking" [...] and seemed to fit the band by featuring [...] "a typical middle-age male, corporate politician American kind of guy, and someone had completely taken his identity away through vandalism." [...] Following that line of thought, Bilheimer took an encyclopedia picture of men in suits and ties and put colored circles reading [...] "nimrod." [...] on their faces, [...] "using that to take away the people's identity". The back cover had the same being done to a yearbook Bilheimer found in a Los Angeles bookstore, [...] "from the era of the Leave it to Beaver 1950's idyllic America", with the label [...] "break down that image of people’s <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> happy polite idyllic society."

Togo had suffered from international isolation during the latter phase of President Eyadema's rule due to the widespread belief that he had rigged elections and employed violence against the opposition; the 2005 election, which followed Eyadema's death, served to only amplify those concerns, but afterward Eyadema's son made a concerted effort to project a better image internationally.

2500|$|Research {{shows that}} consumers' broad general <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country, {{including}} of its national characteristics, {{economic and political}} background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country. For example, a global survey carried out by Nielsen, reported that [...] Country of origin image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant {{of whether or not}} someone buys a product. Its effect is strongest on consumers who don't know much about the product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for [...] "low involvement" [...] product categories such as shampoo and candy.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, Australia {{was in the middle of}} a [...] "resources boom", which once again meant that Western Australia's {{economic}} contribution to the Australian economy was at a high point. <b>Perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disproportionately low share of federal resources relative to economic contribution fanned a further wave of secessionist-leaning rhetoric. For example, at the 22 October 2008 Vista Public Lecture, former Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, said that the case for a secessionist movement is only strengthened while the Commonwealth government continues to exploit the State's resource-rich economy and fails to share the prosperity evenly. He argued that, at the time, Western Australia accounted for 35% of the nation's export income yet most of the revenue is used to strengthen the [...] "financial muscle growing in Canberra". The state has approximately 9–10% of the nation's population, generates over 10% of the Good and Services Tax revenue, but received only 6% of what was being distributed. Court said that if the then-current Federation path continues, then by the year 2020, Western Australia would be receiving only 5% of what would be distributed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The former Premier said he was not advocating secession but stressed that the financial imbalance required addressing and that [...] "the time to do so is now".|$|E
60|$|We spoke earlier of {{two ways}} of {{classifying}} particulars. One way collects together the appearances commonly regarded as a given object from different places; this is, broadly speaking, the way of physics, leading {{to the construction of}} physical objects as sets of such appearances.

In the particular case where the place concerned is a human brain, the perspective belonging to the place consists of all the <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain man at a given time.

6000|$|Following out {{an ingenious}} idea of his own, Ezekiel called {{the next day}} on the Demorests, and in some occult fashion {{obtained}} an invitation to stay under their hospitable roof during his sojourn in Buenaventura. Perfectly aware that he owed this courtesy more to Joan than to her husband, {{it is probable that}} his grim enjoyment was not diminished by the fact; while Joan, for reasons of her own, preferred the constraint which the presence of another visitor put upon Demorest's uxoriousness. Of late, too, there were times when Dona Rosita's naive intelligence, which was not unlike the embarrassing <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bright and half-spoiled child, was in her way, and she would willingly have shared the young lady's company with her husband had Demorest shown any sympathy for the girl. It was in the faint hope that Ezekiel might in some way beguile Rosita's wandering attention that she had invited him. The only difficulty lay in his uncouthness, and in presenting to the heiress of the Picos {{a man who had been}} formerly her own servant. Had she attempted to conceal that fact she was satisfied that Ezekiel's independence and natural predilection for embarrassing situations would have inevitably revealed it. She had even gone so far as to consider the propriety of investing him with a poor relationship to her family, when Dona Rosita herself happily stopped all further trouble. On her very first introduction to him, that charming young lady at once accepted him as a lunatic whose brains were turned by occult, scientific, and medical study! Ah! she, Rosita, had heard of such cases before. Had not a paternal ancestor of hers, one Don Diego Castro, believed he had discovered the elixir of youth. Had he not to that end refused even to wash him the hand, to cut him the nail of the finger and the hair of the head! Exalted by that discovery, had he not been unsparingly uncomplimentary to all humanity, especially to the weaker sex? Even as the Senor Corwin! ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{of course}} {{impossible}} to determine, in such cases, how far the preacher, having conscientiously {{made up his mind}} on the subject by foregoing thought, and honestly desiring to impress his conclusion on his congregation, may think his object will be best, and even justifiably attained, by insisting on all that is in favor of his position, and trusting to the weak heads of his hearers not to find out the arguments for the contrary; fearing that if he stated, in any proportionate measure, the considerations on the other side, he might not be able, in the time allotted to him, to bring out his conclusion fairly. This, though I hold it an entirely false view, is nevertheless a comprehensible and pardonable one, especially in a man familiar with the reasoning capacities of the public; though those capacities themselves owe half their shortcomings to being so unworthily treated. But, on the whole, and looking broadly at the way the speakers and teachers of the nation set about their business, there is an almost fathomless failure in the results, owing to the general admission of special pleading as an art to be taught to youth. The main thing which we ought to teach our youth is to see something,--all that the eyes which God has given them are capable of seeing. The sum of what we do teach them is to say something. As far as I have experience of instruction, no man ever dreams of teaching a boy to get to the root of a matter; to think it out; to get quit of passion and desire in the process of thinking; or to fear no face of man in plainly asserting the ascertained result. But to say anything in a glib and graceful manner,--to give an epigrammatic turn to nothing,--to quench the dim <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feeble adversary, and parry cunningly the home thrusts of a strong one,--to invent blanknesses in speech for breathing time, and slipperinesses in speech for hiding time,--to polish malice to the deadliest edge, shape profession to the seemliest shadow, and mask self-interest under the fairest pretext,--all these skills we teach definitely, as the main arts of business and life. There is a strange significance in the admission of Aristotle's Rhetoric at our universities as a class-book. Cheating at cards is a base profession enough, but truly it would be wiser to print a code of gambler's legerdemain, and give that for a class-book, than to make the legerdemain of human speech, and the clever shuffling of the black spots in the human heart, the first study of our politic youth. Again, the Ethics of Aristotle, though containing some shrewd talk, interesting for an old reader, are yet so absurdly illogical and sophistical, that if a young man has once read them with any faith, it must take years before he recovers from the induced confusions of thought and false habits of argument. If there were the slightest dexterity or ingenuity in maintaining the false theory, there might be some excuse for retaining the Ethics as a school-book, provided only the tutor were careful to point out, on first opening it, that the Christian virtues,--namely, to love with all the heart, soul, and strength; to fight, not as one that beateth the air; and to do with might whatsoever the hand findeth to do,--could not in anywise be defined as [...] "habits of choice in moderation." [...] But the Aristotelian quibbles are so shallow, that I look upon the retention of the book as a confession by our universities that they consider practice in shallow quibbling one of the essential disciplines of youth. Take, for instance, the distinction made between [...] "Envy" [...] and [...] "Rejoicing at Evil" [...] ([Greek: phthonos] and [Greek: epichairekakia]), in the second book of the Ethics, viz., that envy is grieved when any one meets with good-fortune; but [...] "the rejoicer at evil so far misses of grieving, as even to rejoice" [...] (the distinction between the good and evil, as subjects of the emotion, being thus omitted, and merely the verbal opposition of grief and joy caught at); and conceive the result, in the minds of most youths, of being forced to take tricks of words such as this (and there are too many of them in even the best Greek writers) for subjects of daily study and admiration; the theory of the Ethics being, besides, so hopelessly untenable, that even quibbling will not always face it out,--nay, will not help it in exactly the first and most important example of virtue which Aristotle has to give, and the very one which we might have thought his theory would have fitted most neatly; for defining [...] "temperance" [...] as a mean, and intemperance as one relative extreme, not being able to find an opposite extreme, he escapes with the apology that {{the kind of person who}} sins in the other extreme [...] "has no precise name; because, on the whole, he does not exist!" ...|$|E
