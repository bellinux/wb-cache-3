40|$|Widespread {{application}} of cochlear implants {{is limited by}} cost, especially in developing countries. In this article we present a design for a low-cost but effective cochlear implant system. The system includes a speech processor, four pairs of transmitting and receiving coils, and an electrode array with four monopolar electrodes. All implanted components are passive, reducing to a minimum the complexity of manufacture and allowing high reli-ability. A four-channel continuous interleaved sampling strategy {{is used for the}} speech processor. The processor and transmission link have been evaluated in tests with a subject previously implanted with the Ineraid electrode array and <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector.</b> A pro-totype of the link, consisting of four pairs of transmitting and external receiving coils, was used, with the outputs of the receiving coils directed to four intracochlear electrodes through the <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector.</b> The subject achieved speech reception scores with the prototype system that were equivalent to those achieved with a standard laboratory implementation of a continuous interleaved sampling processor with current-controlled stimuli. (Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1998; 118 : 235 - 41,) The cochlear implant is the only medical interventio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Visual {{prostheses}} {{have been}} shown to be efficacious in the restoration of basic visual percepts to patients with profound vision loss from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Previous implants have been located in either the epiretinal, subretinal or intra-scleral spaces of the eye. Bionic Vision Australia has conducted a pilot clinical trial of a novel suprachoroidal implant. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability, safety and basic efficacy of the device. Methods: Three subjects with end-stage retinitis pigmentosa (bare light perception) were implanted with a prototype silicone and platinum suprachoroidal array containing 20 stimulating electrodes, which could be directly stimulated via a <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector.</b> Intraocular array position was monitored over an 18 -month period with weekly fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Lead wire and <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector</b> stability were monitored using monthly X-ray and biannual computerized tomography (CT) imaging. Device efficacy was assessed using psychophysical methods, and assessment of performance in basic visual function tests such as the Basic Assessment of Light and Motion (BaLM), Berkeley Rudimentary Vision Test (BRVT), tumbling E and Landolt C tests. Results: From image analysis, both the intraocular array and extraocular connections remained in a stable position with respect to anatomical landmarks in the retinal plane. There was no damage to the devices, and the only device-related serious adverse events related to superficial skin infection around the <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector,</b> which settled with topical or systemic antibiotics and no intraocular sequelae. All electrodes remained connected during the 18 -month period. All three subjects perceived phosphene percepts, although there were significant differences in optimal stimulation parameters between them. All patients performed better with the device on than off for the laboratory based visual function tests, including achieving scores of between 72 % and 100 % on the light localisation subtest of the BaLM when the device was on. Conclusions: The suprachoroidal implant location is safe and provides excellent device stability. Visual function test performance was improved with device on vs. device off. As device efficacy and longevity is dependent on a stable electrode-tissue interface, suprachoroidal implantation appears a promising option for visual prostheses...|$|E

40|$|Electron {{bombardment}} ion thrusters used as ion {{sources have}} demonstrated a unique capability to vary {{the surface morphology}} of surgical implant materials. The microscopically rough surface texture produced by ion beam sputtering of these materials may result in improvements in the biological response and/or performance of implanted devices. Control of surface roughness may result in improved attachment of the implant to soft tissue, hard tissue, bone cement, or components deposited from blood.

40|$|A {{technology}} {{base for}} optically-coupled systems was developed that permits in-vivo transmission of biomedical signals across the skin. By complete implantation of sensors and instrumentation electronics, problems with <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connectors</b> were eliminated. Optical power and signal transmission was accomplished with smaller and lighter implant structures than previously achieved with radio frequency (RF) coupling techniques. This is particularly valuable {{in the field}} of neuroprosthetics, because {{it may be possible to}} implant an optical telemeter directly on the surface of the brain to make mechanically stable connections to microelectrode arrays for neuroelectric recordings. Miniature optical power panels (2. 5 mm x 2. 5 mm) were developed from arrays of photodiodes. Infrared light of 880 nm wavelength was effective for delivering power across the skin. Panels composed of silicon photodiodes were 14 % efficient a...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{in this report}} were to use the ion beam sputtering technique to produce surface textures on polymers, metals, and ceramics. The morphology of the texture was altered by varying both the width and depth of the square pits which were formed by ion beam erosion. The width of the ribs separating the pits were defined by the mask used to produce the texture. The area of the surface containing pits varies as the width was changed. The biological parameters {{used to evaluate the}} biological response to the texture were: (1) fibrous capsule and inflammatory response in subcutaneous soft tissue; (2) strength of the mechanical attachment of the textured surface by the soft tissue; and (3) morphology of the epidermal layer interfacing the textured surface of <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connectors.</b> Because the sputter yield on teflon ribs was approximately an order of magnitude larger than any other material the majority of the measurements presented in the report were obtained with teflon...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This study {{investigated}} the use of planar, silicon-substrate microelectrodes for chronic unit recording in the cerebral cortex. The 16 -channel microelectrodes consisted of four penetrating shanks with four recording sites on each shank. The chronic electrode assembly included an integrated silicon ribbon cable and <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector.</b> In a consecutive series of six rats, 5 / 6 (83 %) of the implanted microelectrodes recorded neuronal spike activity {{for more than six}} weeks, with four of the implants (66 %) remaining functional for more than 28 weeks. In each animal, more than 80 % of the electrode sites recorded spike activity over sequential recording sessions during the postoperative time period. These results provide a performance baseline to support further electrode system development for intracortical neural implant systems for medical applications.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the surgical results and effects of continuous support with the permanent Jarvik- 2000 left ventricular assist device (LVAD). We report the early outcomes. BackgroundA shortage of transplant donors necessitates the testing of alternative treatments. The Jarvik- 2000 is an axial flow pump with a <b>percutaneous</b> retro-auricular power <b>connector,</b> designed for permanent use. MethodsPatients with severe heart failure (HF), unsuitable for heart transplantation or conventional LVAD support, were offered implantation. The surgical approach included a left lateral thoracotomy. The device was implanted into the left ventricular apex on femoro-femoral bypass. It is set to allow pulsatile flow with an aortic valve opening. Anticoagulation is adjusted {{the same as for}} patients with a heart valve. ResultsBetween May 2001 and August 2001, we implanted the Jarvik- 2000 in two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in one with cardiac amyloidosis, all with severe HF (cardiac index 1. 8 ± 0. 3 l/m 2 per min). One patient required preoperative inotropic support. All patients did well, with no repeat operations or infections. Patients received 4. 3 ± 3. 2 packed red blood cells and were intubated at 14 ± 3 h, and the intensive care unit stay was 7. 0 ± 0. 5 days. The cardiac index increased from 3. 7 ± 1. 5 l/min per m 2 at 8, 000 rpm to 5. 9 ± 2. 9 l/min per m 2 at 12, 000 rpm. All patients currently have mild hemolysis not requiring transfusion. The following postoperative events were recorded: a transient ischemic attack with complete recovery, a short re-intubation due to ventricular arrhythmia, loss of consciousness with a battery change while standing, knee-joint effusion after ergometry training, a minor wound problem and a short hospital re-admission due to dehydration. Patients were discharged home after 49 ± 7 days; one has returned to work. All quality-of-life scores have improved. ConclusionsThe permanent Jarvik- 2000 appears safe. It can be used for dilative or restrictive disease. The Jarvik- 2000 might prove a valid option for the long-term treatment of patients with severe HF...|$|R
40|$|A new hearing therapy {{based on}} direct {{acoustic}} cochlear stimulation {{was developed for}} the treatment of severe to profound mixed hearing loss. The device efficacy was validated in an initial clinical trial with four patients. This semi-implantable investigational device consists of an externally worn audio processor, a <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector,</b> and an implantable microactuator. The actuator is placed in the mastoid bone, right behind the external auditory canal. It generates vibrations that are directly coupled to the inner ear fluids and that, therefore, bypass the external and the middle ear. The system is able to provide an equivalent sound pressure level of 125 dB over the frequency range between 125 and 8000  Hz. The hermetically sealed actuator is designed to provide maximal output power by keeping its dimensions small enough to enable implantation. A network model is used to simulate the dynamic characteristics of the actuator to adjust its transfer function to the characteristics of the middle ear. The geometry of the different actuator components is optimized using finite-element modeling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Neuroscience and neuroprosthetic {{devices are}} in-creasingly {{in need of}} more compact less {{invasive}} 3 -D electrode arrays for interfacing with neural tissue. To meet these needs, a folding 64 -site 3 -D array architecture has been developed. The microstructure, in which four probes and two platforms are fabri-cated as a single planar unit, results in a low-profile (< 350 -μm) narrow-platform (0. 604 -mm 2 silicon footprint) implant for corti-cal use. Signals are routed from 177 -μm 2 iridium sites through polysilicon lines to the probe back end and then across 4 -μm-thick parylene-encased electroplated-gold folding lead transfers to the associated platform. Three levels of interconnect with a 10 -μm minimum pitch are utilized for the 32 leads that traverse the platforms. After rapid microassembly, micromachined latches are used to fasten the folded device. Two flexible parylene cables with gold leads at a 20 -μm pitch are monolithically integrated with the probes to minimize tethering and avoid any need for lead bonding within the array, and these cables carry the neural signals to a remote circuit module or <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector.</b> With thin (∼ 15 -μm) boron-doped shanks at a ∼ 200 -μm pitch, the array displaces only 1. 7 % of the 0. 64 -mm 2 instrumented tissue area, assuming a 100 -μm recording range. Neural signals were recorded in vivo from the guinea pig auditory cortex.

40|$|Neural probes are {{important}} tools in detecting and studying neuron activities. Although {{people have been}} working on neural probe development for a long time, the current neural probes (including metal-wire probes and silicon neural probes) are still far from being satisfactory. An ideal neural probe array should have good biocompatibility, high-density electrodes with high signal-to-noise ratio, flexible cables for interconnections, integrated electronics, and even integrated actuators to track neuron movement. The work of this thesis focused on applying parylene technology to neural probes development to make a new generation of neural probes with better functions. With the properties of high electrical resistivity, mechanical flexibility, biocompatibility, low coefficient of friction, and an easy deposition/etching process, parylene is a good material for neural probe applications. In this thesis, we have designed, fabricated, and characterized a new parylene neural probe with a long, flexible parylene cable for a neural prosthesis system. Parylene layers are first used on the silicon probe shank with multiple electrodes as insulation and protective layers. And long parylene flexible cables are first monolithically integrated with silicon neural probes. A 96 -electrode high-density, 3 -D neural probe array for chronic implantation has been demonstrated. Different types of electrolysis actuators (including a silicon diaphragm actuator and a parylene balloon actuator) have been made and tested. The research on electrolysis-based actuators shows their great potential to be used for movable neural probes. Compared with the traditional silicon neural probes (e. g., the Michigan probes, the Utah electrode arrays), our microfabricated neural probes have much longer and stronger probe shanks (8 or 12 mm long, able to penetrate the human pia) and much longer flexible parylene cable (about 7 or 12 cm, long enough to go through a <b>percutaneous</b> <b>connector</b> and the human skull). At the same time, our new probe arrays are shown to have better biocompatibility (being totally covered with parylene material), lower stress, better penetration ability, and greater flexibility for making high-density 3 -D arrays and for use in chronic neural signal recording implantation. ...|$|E
