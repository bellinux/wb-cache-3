Recognition of this value among natural resource agencies and organizations is evidenced by programs such as the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative and Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which provide technical assistance and cost sharing to farmers for converting their land to pasture. While these programs have encouraged many farmers to adopt grazing best management practices, the marketplace often acts as an even more powerful force for change in agriculture. Where cost-sharing and other incentives may not be effective, a premium for grass-fed milk could convince more farmers to consider a pasture-based system.

40|$|Eco-certification of {{food and}} other {{agricultural}} products has been promoted {{as a way of}} making markets work for sustainability. Certification programs offer a price <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> <b>producers</b> who invest in more sustainable practices. The literature on the impacts of certification has focused primarily on the economic benefits farmers perceive from participating in these schemes. These benefits, however, are often subject to price variability, offering only a partial explanation of why farmers join and stay in certification programs. We evaluated the potential of the Rainforest Alliance certification program to foster more resilient social-ecological systems in the face of globalization. Using the case of Santander, Colombia, and a pair-based comparison of 86 households to effectively produce a robust counterfactual, we showed that certification provides important environmental benefits, while improving the well-being of farmers and their communities. Furthermore, the study showed that price premiums are only one of many elements defining the success of certification, particularly important for motivating farmers to join, but less so to explain retention and upgrading. The case of Colombian coffee growers illustrates how the connections between local social-ecological systems and larger global forces can produce more sustainable livelihoods and land uses...|$|E

40|$|Biotech grains hold {{great promise}} for both {{producers}} and consumers but {{a thorough understanding}} of the value chain will be vitally important in realizing that potential. Biotech grains with input traits not approved for all uses can pose a serious problem for the grain handling and processing industry as they move through the value chain. This problem occurs because there is no premium to cover added costs of segregation and handling input trait grains after harvest. In the case of Starlink the manufacturer is currently providing a defacto <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> <b>producers</b> and elevators to make the channeling effort effective. Output trait grains not approved for all uses may also create a problem if due care is not used. However the existence of a premium over the market price for commodity grain provides a positive incentive to create a separate and distinct logistics channel for these products. Experience with Starlink indicates that attempting to channel a product that is not acceptable for all uses without a premium can inflict significant uncompensated costs on the output side of the value chain. These costs may include market discounts and are typically incurred by firms who do not receive any meaningful gain from the sale of the trait. ...|$|E
40|$|Certification {{programs}} has been employed in many agricultural products {{as a means}} to encourage and communicate compliance with standards associated with various attributes, such as organic, fair-trade, GMO free, and eco- friendly, among others. Such programs further seek to provide added value, through a price <b>premium,</b> <b>to</b> <b>producers</b> and supply chain actors associated with the label. In this paper, we review a number of global labeling and certification programs that could add value for coffee farms in India through the promotion of conservation and environmental protection. We provide results from a survey conducted on a sample of coffee farms in Coorg district, India to assess their awareness and perceptions related towards certified coffee and environmental conservation in general. Survey results illustrate strong positive associations with the environment by coffee planters, particularly among certified and organic producers. However, price premiums for certified and organic coffee are relatively small. While the potential of conservation-oriented certification for coffee in Coorg could be relatively limited outside of a few individual-level niches, branding Coorg more generally as a conservation-oriented region could hold promise, lever- aging and personalizing the uniqueness of the natural offerings from Coorg and tapping into burgeoning associations with place and region in India.

40|$|Niche {{markets of}} {{agricultural}} products are experiencing rapid growth. One such niche market is organic pork. Organic pork production {{is a relatively}} new and expanding segment of the pork industry. Similar to some other niche markets, it has also experienced rapid growth (Organic Trade Association). It is well known that the cost of organic pork production is greater than for traditional pork production due to increased feed costs and decreased swine performance. The industry has dealt with this by paying <b>premiums</b> <b>to</b> induce <b>producers</b> <b>to</b> produce the organic product. However, it is not clear on what level or how the premiums should be paid <b>to</b> <b>producers</b> <b>to</b> provide an incentive to produce and market a steadier flow of product throughout the year. With premium structures currently used for organic pork production there are more hogs being produced using summer farrowing than with winter farrowing. This uneven pig flow causes instability of supply and creates product flow problems throughout the industry. This instability can lead to problems of slaughter capacity scheduling and/or utilization as the industry grows and matures. Also, at certain time periods the demand for fresh organic pork products may not be met. During other times, the availability of fresh organic pork may exceed demand. These issues create problems for a developing industry, which is attempting to establish and maintain a reliable consumer base...|$|R

We hypothesize that democratic governments have political incentives to adopt the FIT because it improves environmental quality, promotes rural development, and distributes electricity generation profits from large utilities <b>to</b> independent <b>producers.</b> We analyze global data on FIT adoption, 1990 - 2012, and find that the association between democratic regime type and FIT adoption overwhelms all other covariates.

Fair trade, which is based on price <b>premiums</b> <b>to</b> support agricultural <b>producers</b> and workers in the Global South, has enjoyed tremendous sales growth in the past decade. Will consumers also pay a price <b>premium</b> <b>to</b> improve the conditions of those engaged in agriculture closer to home? To address this question, consumer willingness to pay for food embodying a living wage and safe working conditions for farmworkers was assessed with a national survey in the United States. The question format was a discrete choice (yes/no) response to one of four randomly selected price <b>premiums,</b> as applied <b>to</b> a hypothetical example of a pint of strawberries. Multilevel regression models indicated that respondents were willing to pay a median of 68 % more for these criteria, with frequent organic consumers and those who consider the environment when making purchases most willing to pay higher amounts. Although the results should be interpreted with caution, given the well-known gap between expressed attitudes and actual behaviors, we conclude that there is a strong potential market opportunity for domestic fair trade.

Complaints include: general illness, unpleasant odor, headaches, and property devaluation. However, state and national law requires all CAFO's to have some form of waste storage facility. These facilities, mainly lagoons, increase the potential of pollution and run-off into streams and other water sources.

These include policy implementation instruments, changed values and attitudes, healthy nutrition policies, supply chain bottle necks, <b>premium</b> prices (<b>to</b> <b>producers),</b> successful procurement strategies and certification procedures. This work {{is based on a}} two-step survey concerning the Italian school food service system. Initially questionnaires were submitted to a qualified group of 50 producers and 50 caterers (managers of national and international companies of food service for school, local administrators who manage food services for the schools). The results of the questionnaires have subsequently been the basis to plan in-depth interviews with few decision makers who could represent both caterers and producers. The aim of this second step being to view how identified problems could be solved. The results show how the understanding and the acceptance of the organic food concept among the catering staff is crucial for the degree of success in each step of public organic procurement. The introduction of organic food in serving outlets needs appropriate support (such as qualification of key actors and a specific financial support). Other key aspects in this regard are laws and regulations promoting the procurement of quality food, policy interventions tackling more than one aspect of the problem, education programs, calls for tenders, negotiated procurement contracts and quality standards...|$|R

Studying gene interactions and pathways that affect IMF might unveil causative physiological mechanisms and inform genomic selection, leading to increased accuracy of predictions of breeding value. To study gene interactions and pathways, a gene network was derived from genetic markers associated with direct measures of IMF, other fat phenotypes, feedlot performance, {{and a number of}} meat quality traits relating to body conformation, development, and metabolism that might be plausibly expected to interact with IMF biology. Marker associations were inferred from genomewide association studies (GWAS) based on high density genotypes and 29 traits measured on 10, 181 beef cattle animals from 3 breed types. For the network inference, SNP pairs were assessed according to the strength of the correlation between their additive association effects across the 29 traits. The co-association inferred network was formed by 2, 434 genes connected by 28, 283 edges. Topological network parameters suggested a highly cohesive network, in which the genes are strongly functionally interconnected. Pathway and network analyses pointed towards a trio of transcription factors (TF) as key regulators of carcass IMF: PPARG-C 1 A, HNF 4 G, and FOXP 3. Importantly, none of these genes would have been deemed as significantly associated with IMF from the GWAS. Instead, a total of 313 network genes show significant co-association with the 3 TF. These genes belong {{to a wide variety of}} biological functions, canonical pathways, and genetic networks linked to IMF-related phenotypes. In summary, our GWAS and network predictions are supported by the current literature and suggest a cooperative role for the 3 TF and other interacting genes including CAPN 6, STC 2, MAP 2 K 4, EYA 1, COPS 5, XKR 4, NR 2 E 1, TOX, ATF 1, ASPH, TGS 1, and TTPA as modulators of carcass and meat quality traits in beef cattle...|$|R
