25|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the European {{settlers}} in Texas, the plant peyote (<b>peyotl</b> in Nahuatl) had become a popular hallucinogenic among tribes in the Rio Grande Valley as well as parts of West Texas and Chihuahua. Tribes in the area included the Carrizo Coahuiltecan and later the Lipan and Mescalero Apache, and even the Karankawa and the Caddo tribes. The plant came to be used for both recreational and ritual usage. Its hallucinogenic effects were regarded with suspicion among the Spaniards and the drug was never widely used outside the Native American communities.|$|E

50|$|The cactus {{known as}} <b>peyotl,</b> or more {{commonly}} peyote (Lophophora williamsii), has a rich history of use in Mesoamerica. Its use in northern Mexico among the Huichol {{has been written}} about extensively. It is thought that since peyote only grows in certain regions of Mexico, the Aztecs would receive dried buttons through long-distance trade. Peyote was viewed as being a protective plant by the Aztec. Sahagún suggested that the plant is what allowed the Aztec warriors to fight as they did.|$|E

A chemical of inter mediate structure, 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenethylamine (DMPEA, I b), lacks one of nlethoxyl groups of mescaline. Interest in his base was kindled by the observation of its presence in the urine of schizo phrenic patients, but not in that of normal subjects (Friedhoff and Van Winkle [6]. This chemical is most probably not an endo genous psychotogen, for evaluation of it in human subjects by Hollister and Friedhoff [8] and Shulgin et al.

The use of opium, cocaine, dawamesk also became a sort of caricatural form in many of his works from Cuttlefish (Mątwa) up to the novel The Only Way Out (Jedyne wyjście). The aim of my work is to try to answer several questions: In what way does the author’s interest in the addiction of Unwashed Souls (Niemyte dusze) fit into the 19 th and 20 th century debate between doctors, writers and European artists? Can Witkacy’s literary and dramatic work demonstrate that he was familiar with publications on pharmacology (published in Germany and France in the 20 s) and also with the authors who were writing about drugs in the 19 th and 20 th century? How does his prohibitionist point of view fit with his historiosophy? Can Narcotics be considered a literary work? I have also tried to determine the anonymous sources quoted by Witkacy and co-authors of Narcotics, B. Filipowski and S. Glass (pen name of Dezydery Prokopowicz) ...|$|E
40|$|Antonin Artaud, {{author of}} the famous "The Theatre and Its Double" {{and the concept of}} Theatre of Cruelty, arrived in Mexico in 1936 with the intent of {{revising}} the paradigm of Western theatre by emphasizing its strong connection with life forces. Artaud considered theatre to be a spiritual and healing practice for both the performer and the audience while creating a shift in consciousness. His journey took him {{to the land of the}} Tarahumara Indians in the Sierra Madre, where he participated in the annual sacred <b>Peyotl</b> ceremony conducted by powerful shamans. Artaud’s ethno-poetic account of their cosmology confirmed his visionary statements on theater. Alongside contemporary anthropology and indigenous spirituality, the artist believed in shaping identity via ritual performances. His narratives reaffirm his earlier opinions of man’s position in the universe and his call for a change of consciousness which could occur, in his opinion, through theatrical performance. While most scholars considered his provocative artistic project to be madness, I argue that Artaud’s avant-garde political and artistic opinions align with the politics of modern anthropology and performance, which draw conclusions from experience, participation and from mere observation. His memory of the Tarahumara rituals inspired multiple ethno-poetical narratives and an understanding of the human drama that he explored until his death twelve years later. His poetics invite his readers to have a sensory perception of the work and to embrace the magical time of the ritual. 	My dissertation topic deals with the literary aspects of Artaud’s textuality on Tarahumara dance rituals. My research explores the theatrical elements of Artaud’s poetic language in "Tutuguri, The Rite of the Dark Sun," a poem he created for a radio play “To Have Done with the Judgment of God. ” In my conclusions, I argue that the author performs his poetry like a ritual; in other words, he uses language in a performative manner, and the page functions like a scene of writing where physical senses and movements are greatly emphasized. I argue that his writing is similar to a ritualized performance where gestures and sounds accompany words like an incantation. Based on their myth of creation, the Tutuguri is a rite of prayers and requests where natives accompany the sun in its course until dawn. In conclusion, the poem suggests that human identity is defined by its mobility and circularity. French StudiesDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.
