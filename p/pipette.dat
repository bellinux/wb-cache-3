Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} loose patch clamp {{on a cell}} membrane, the <b>pipette</b> is moved slowly towards the cell, until the {{electrical}} resistance of the contact between the cell and the <b>pipette</b> increases to a few times greater resistance {{than that of the}} electrode alone. The closer the <b>pipette</b> gets to the membrane, the greater the resistance of the <b>pipette</b> tip becomes, but if too close a seal is formed, and it could become difficult to remove the <b>pipette</b> without damaging the cell. For the loose patch technique, the <b>pipette</b> does not get close enough to the membrane to form a gigaseal or a permanent connection, nor to pierce the cell membrane. The cell membrane stays intact, and the lack of a tight seal creates a small gap through which ions can pass outside the cell without entering the <b>pipette.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{one form}} of such an {{automated}} system, a pressure differential is used to force the cells being studied to be drawn towards the <b>pipette</b> opening until they form a gigaseal. Then, by briefly exposing the <b>pipette</b> tip to the atmosphere, {{the portion of the}} membrane protruding from the <b>pipette</b> bursts, and the membrane is now in the inside-out conformation, {{at the tip of the}} <b>pipette.</b> In a completely automated system, the <b>pipette</b> and the membrane patch can then be rapidly moved through a series of different test solutions, allowing different test compounds to be applied to the intracellular side of the membrane during recording.|$|E

25|$|Whole-cell {{recordings}} involve recording currents {{through multiple}} channels simultaneously, over the membrane {{of the entire}} cell. The electrode is left in place on the cell, as in cell-attached recordings, but more suction is applied to rupture the membrane patch, thus providing access from {{the interior of the}} <b>pipette</b> to the intracellular space of the cell. This provides a means to administer and study how treatments (ex. drugs) can affect cells in real time. Once the <b>pipette</b> is attached to the cell membrane, there are two methods of breaking the patch. The first is by applying more suction. The amount and duration of this suction depends on the type of cell and size of the <b>pipette.</b> The other method requires a large current pulse to be sent through the <b>pipette.</b> How much current is applied and the duration of the pulse also depend on the type of cell. For some types of cells, it is convenient to apply both methods simultaneously to break the patch.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{filling the}} patch <b>pipette</b> might match the ionic {{composition of the}} bath solution, {{as in the case}} of cell-attached recording, or match the cytoplasm, for whole-cell recording. The solution in the bath solution may match the physiological extracellular solution,the cytoplasm, or be entirely non-physiological, depending on the experiment to be performed. The researcher can also change the content of the bath solution (or less commonly the <b>pipette</b> solution) by adding ions or drugs to study the ion channels under different conditions.|$|E

50|$|Plastic Pasteur <b>pipettes</b> {{are often}} used in biology where most media are aqueous and solvent {{resistance}} is not important. (Most organic solvents, such as hexane and acetone cannot be used in plastic Pasteur <b>pipettes</b> as the solvent can dissolve the plastic.) The <b>pipettes</b> are also hard to wash and are usually discarded with other biohazard waste after each use.|$|R
25|$|For this method, the <b>pipette</b> {{is sealed}} onto the cell {{membrane}} {{to obtain a}} gigaseal, while ensuring that the cell membrane remains intact. This allows the recording of currents through single, or a few, ion channels contained in the patch of membrane captured by the <b>pipette.</b> By only attaching to {{the exterior of the}} cell membrane, there is very little disturbance of the cell structure. Also, by not disrupting the interior of the cell, any intracellular mechanisms normally influencing the channel will still be able to function as they would physiologically. Using this method it is also relatively easy to obtain the right configuration, and once obtained it is fairly stable.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} inside-out configuration, the <b>pipette</b> is {{attached}} to the cell membrane as in the cell-attached mode, forming a gigaseal, and is then retracted to break off a patch of membrane {{from the rest of the}} cell. Pulling off a membrane patch often results initially in the formation of a vesicle of membrane in the <b>pipette</b> tip, because the ends of the patch membrane fuse together quickly after excision. The outer face of the vesicle must then be broken open to enter into inside-out mode; this may be done by briefly taking the membrane through the bath solution/air interface, by exposure to a low Ca2+ solution, or by momentarily making contact with a droplet of paraffin or a piece of cured silicone polymer.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference {{lies in the fact that}} when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the <b>pipette</b> solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the <b>pipette</b> solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E

40|$|Glass microelectrodes (also called <b>pipettes)</b> {{have been}} a {{workhorse}} of electrophysiology for decades. Today, such <b>pipettes</b> are made from glass capillaries using a programmable puller. Such instruments heat the capillary using either a metal filament or a laser and draw out the glass using gravity, a motor or both. <b>Pipettes</b> for patch-clamp recording are formed using only heat and gravity, while sharp electrodes for intracellular recording {{use a combination of}} heat, gravity, and a motor. The procedure used to make intracellular recording <b>pipettes</b> is similar to that used to make injection needles for a variety of applications, including cRNA injection into Xenopus oocytes. In general, capillary glass < 1. 2 mm in diameter is used to make <b>pipettes</b> for patch clamp recording, while narrower glass is used for intracellular recording (outer diameter = 1. 0 mm). For each tool, the puller is programmed slightly differently. This video shows how to make both kinds of recording <b>pipettes</b> using pre-established puller programs...|$|R

25|$|Some {{capillary}} techniques provide also {{a chamber}} like arrangement, however, {{there is no}} filter between the cells and the test substance. Quantitative results are gained by the multiwell type of this probe using 4-8-12-channel pipettes. Accuracy of the <b>pipette</b> and increased number of the parallel running samples is the great advantage of this test.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of an outside-out patch begins with a whole-cell recording configuration. After the whole-cell configuration is formed, the electrode is slowly withdrawn from the cell, allowing a bulb of membrane to bleb out from the cell. When the electrode is pulled far enough away, this bleb will detach from the cell and reform as a convex membrane {{on the end of}} the electrode (like a ball open at the electrode tip), with the original outside of the membrane facing outward from the electrode. As the image at the right shows, this means that the fluid inside the <b>pipette</b> will be simulating the intracellular fluid, while a researcher is free to move the <b>pipette</b> and the bleb with its channels to another bath of solution. While multiple channels can exist in a bleb of membrane, single channel recordings are also possible in this conformation if the bleb of detached membrane is small and only contains one channel.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} the loose seal is that the <b>pipette</b> that is used can be repeatedly removed from the membrane after recording, and the membrane will remain intact. This allows repeated measurements {{in a variety of}} locations on the same cell without destroying the integrity of the membrane. This flexibility has been especially useful to researchers for studying muscle cells as they contract under real physiological conditions, obtaining recordings quickly, and doing so without resorting to drastic measures to stop the muscle fibers from contracting. A major disadvantage is that the resistance between the <b>pipette</b> and the membrane is greatly reduced, allowing current to leak through the seal, and significantly reducing the resolution of small currents. This leakage can be partially corrected for, however, which offers the opportunity to compare and contrast recordings made from different areas on the cell of interest. Given this, {{it has been estimated that}} the loose patch technique can resolve currents smaller than 1 mA/cm2.|$|E

25|$|Many patch clamp {{amplifiers}} {{do not use}} true {{voltage clamp}} circuitry, but instead are differential amplifiers that use the bath electrode to set the zero current (ground) level. This allows a researcher to keep the voltage constant while observing changes in current. To make these recordings, the patch <b>pipette</b> is compared to the ground electrode. Current is then injected into the system to maintain a constant, set voltage. However much current is needed to clamp the voltage is opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to the current through the membrane.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} further {{classify}} {{the extent of}} dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 ÂµL of liquid stimulus is presented to the anterior and posterior tongue using a <b>pipette,</b> soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs. In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.|$|E
25|$|In the inside-out method, a {{patch of}} the {{membrane}} {{is attached to the}} patch <b>pipette,</b> detached {{from the rest of the}} cell, and the cytosolic surface of the membrane is exposed to the external media, or bath. One advantage of this method is that the experimenter has access to the intracellular surface of the membrane via the bath and can change the chemical composition of what the surface of the membrane is exposed to. This is useful when an experimenter wishes to manipulate the environment at the intracellular surface of single ion channels. For example, channels that are activated by intracellular ligands can then be studied through a range of ligand concentrations.|$|E

Current injection is often paired with patch clamp recordings in order to observe current modulation due to various experimental factors.|$|E
25|$|Bubble flow meters: A simple, yet highly {{accurate}} way {{to measure}} flow rates involves timing movement of bubbles of soap film up glass tubes between marks of known volume. The glass tube is connected at the bottom (for push systems) or at the top (for pull systems) to the air stream. A small rubber <b>pipette</b> bulb attached {{at the base of}} the tube acts as both a reservoir and delivery system for the soap bubbles. Operation is simple. First, wet the glass surface along the path bubbles travel (e.g., press the bulb so that copious amounts of soap are pushed up the glass by the air flow) to provide a virtually friction-free surface. Second, pinch the bulb so that one clean bubble is produced. With a stopwatch in hand, record the time required for the bubble to travel between marks on the glass. Note the volume recorded on the upper mark (e.g., 125 = 125ml), divide the volume by the time required to travel between marks and the result is the flow rate (ml/s). These instruments can be purchased from a variety of sources, but they may also be constructed from appropriate-sized, glass volumetric pipettes.|$|E
