40|$|AbstractThe use {{of digital}} {{forensics}} tools has become common in typical crime investigations involving computing and communication devices.

Cryptographic Hash Functions (CHFs) are used by digital forensic tools to ensure the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> during the acquisition and analysis <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> These tools make the use of the CHFs during the acquisition process to ensure that the created image <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> is accurate. The CHFs that are currently in use are serial in nature and can be time consuming when working with the large data sets.

We discuss the use of the parallel algorithm in the image creation process and compare the results with the existing sequential methods...|$|R

Turning on native impacts the performance of the server. Generally, the native audit trails of databases do not provide sufficient controls to enforce separation of duties; therefore, the network and/or kernel module level host based monitoring capabilities provides a higher degree of confidence for forensics and <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The dissenting judges, led by Karakatsanis J, {{would have}} allowed the appeal. They found the search unconstitutional, holding that warrantless search of a cell phone {{incident}} to arrest is prima facie unreasonable, as it is not authorized by law. The dissenting judges found a high expectation of privacy in cell phones, recognizing the immense data storage and retention capabilities of modern cell phones, the volume of metadata generated by cell phones, {{and the possibility that}} a search of a cell phone might access data stored in the cloud, not on the cell phone itself. The dissenting judges noted the law enforcement objectives set out by the majority but suggested that they would be more fairly balanced with privacy interests given a modification of the common-law framework allowing warrantless cell phone searches incident to arrest only in exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances would require of law enforcement a [...] "reasonable basis to suspect a search may prevent an imminent threat to safety or... reasonable grounds to believe that the imminent loss or destruction of evidence may be prevented by a warrantless search". Under the dissenting judges' modification, the objective of protecting officer safety would justify a warrantless search only if the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the phone had been used to generate a threat to his safety. Likewise, the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> objective would justify a warrantless search only in those cases where it was reasonable to believe that evidence was being destroyed and that a cell phone search could prevent this destruction. In any other, non-exigent circumstances, the dissenting judges held that a warrant would be required for the search.|$|E

Evidence is anything that tends logically to prove or disprove a fact at issue in a judicial case. Evidence essentially consists of oral evidence, documentary evidence and real evidence. The value of evidence cannot be underestimated as evidence can make or break a case.

Prior research suggests that incorporation could increase evidence recovery, result in better <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> and enhance chain of custody. Examination of baseline survey data and a specific cross-regional analysis seeks to discover how/if these methods are being utilized within crime scene investigation. Baseline results are compared with follow-up interviews from a small sample of agencies to examine relationships between criminal investigation and forensic anthropology. Discussion is focused on how the disciplines could be incorporated, and provides recommendations for training and education in interdisciplinary methods.
