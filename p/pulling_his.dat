5|$|A {{bartender}} {{is working}} at a saloon, serving drinks to customers. After he fills a stereotypically Irish man's bucket with beer, Carrie Nation and her followers burst inside. They assault the Irish man, <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> hat over his eyes and then dumping the beer over his head. The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the cash register. The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the start of}} the second-half Hearts were awarded a penalty kick. Kujabi fouled Suso by <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> jersey and catching his heel, but television replays showed that the foul had taken place outside the penalty area. Hibs were also reduced to ten men as Kujabi received his second yellow card, resulting in a red. Danny Grainger converted the penalty, which was also his first goal for Hearts. Soon afterwards, Ryan McGowan scored with a header after Hibs keeper Brown had initially saved from Stephen Elliott. Skácel finished the scoring with another shot from just outside the box to make it 5-1 for Hearts.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} {{fit for the}} final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> {{hamstring}} during the semi-final and playing {{with the aid of}} a painkiller injection. Despite being far less dominant than in previous matches, he still tested Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel and was able to set up a few chances for his teammates. The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title in one of the most upsetting moments in World Cup history.|$|E

5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Edward became {{close to}} Piers Gaveston. Gaveston {{was the son}} of one of the King's {{household}} knights whose lands lay adjacent to Gascony, and had himself joined Prince Edward's household in 1300, possibly on Edward I's instruction. The two got on well; Gaveston became a squire and was soon being referred to as a close companion of Edward, before being knighted by the King during the Feast of Swans in 1306. The King then exiled Gaveston to Gascony in 1307 for reasons that remain unclear. According to one chronicler, Edward had asked his father to allow him to give Gaveston the County of Ponthieu, and the King responded furiously, <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> son's hair out in great handfuls, before exiling Gaveston. The official court records, however, show Gaveston being only temporarily exiled, supported by a comfortable stipend; no reason is given for the order, suggesting that it may have been an act aimed at punishing the prince in some way.|$|E
5|$|Higgins sued Lucas and Gladys City Oil, Gas and Manufacturing Company for royalties, {{using the}} basis that the second lease was invalid because the first lease had not yet expired when the second was enacted. After the parties settled out of court, Higgins formed the Higgins Oil and Fuel Company located {{at the center of}} Spindletop. This company was {{vulnerable}} to takeover bids due to Higgins' over-zealous land prospecting, which enabled the lumber baron and businessman John Henry Kirby to overtake his ownership in 1902 by purchasing his shares of the company for $3 million. Higgins maintained his leasing rights to his land, and would establish the Higgins Standard Oil Company. He later established other wells with various investors, with an eccentric habit of <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> interests out, leaving the majority of the profits for others.|$|E

5|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Loxton bowled only one over, which was a maiden, before <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> groin while trying to attain more pace, as the hosts were bowled out for 71. He was unable to bat or bowl again in the game as Australia replied with 101 and then removed the hosts for 89 to leave themselves a target of 60 for victory. Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31, effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat, before scraping home without further loss, although both batsmen at the crease survived chances. Due to his injury, Loxton was rested {{for the next two}} matches against Surrey at The Oval in London and Cambridge University. Australia won both matches by an innings.|$|E
5|$|The Ulstermen {{eventually}} rouse, {{one by one}} at first, {{and finally}} en masse. The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps {{his side of the}} bargain and yields to him, <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.|$|E
5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} the couch for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean his room and while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} tour in which Manson began using stilts. The band also began their {{signature}} bizarre looks during these concerts as well, by shaving their eyebrows, and donning makeup and sexually suggestive clothes (with Manson wearing jock straps to <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> pants down and tucking his penis between his legs, and with Ramirez beginning his traditional kinderwhore cross-dressing gimmick).|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match was}} a {{two out of}} three falls match between Steve Austin (accompanied by Col. Robert Parker) and Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. They went back and forth for most of the match. After Austin missed an axe handle elbow drop, Rhodes {{performed}} a clothesline and a scoop powerslam. Parker climbed onto the apron, and Rhodes sent Austin into him. Austin fell over the top rope outside the ring, and Rhodes lost the first fall via disqualification. Rhodes continued to attack Austin, and performed mounted punches. Austin pulled him down, and pinned Rhodes with a roll-up while <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> tights to win the match and the title. This match was notable for the lights in the arena going out briefly during the second fall, shortly before the finish.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of May, Sato's troops were starving. He {{considered}} that Mutaguchi and the HQ of Japanese Fifteenth Army were taking little notice of his situation, as they had issued several confusing and contradictory orders to him during April. Because the main attack on Imphal faltered around {{the middle of}} April, Mutaguchi wished 31st Division or parts of it {{to join in the}} attack on Imphal from the north, even while the division was struggling to capture and hold Kohima. Sato considered that Fifteenth Army headquarters were issuing unrealistic orders to his division without proper planning or consideration for the conditions. Nor did he believe that they were exerting themselves to move supplies to his division. He began considering <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> troops back to allow for resupply.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight crew}} did not acquire any visual ground {{references}} before the approach was started. The aircraft started its final descent for landing too early. The aircraft had descended to 280 feet above ground when the terrain awareness and warning system sounded in the cockpit. The captain ordered a go-around and the autopilot was turned off. The first officer put {{the nose of}} the aircraft up for 4 seconds and the thrust levers were set to go-around power. The aircraft pitched up to 12.3° nose up and the flight crew raised the landing gear and flaps. Shortly thereafter the co-pilot started making nose down inputs which caused the aircraft to pitch-attitude to reduce to 3.5° nose down. (The co-pilot could have been focused on the aircraft's speed, rather than its altitude.) The go-around pitch attitude was not maintained and the instructions from the flight director were not followed. (The report says that fatigue could {{have played a role in}} causing the first officer to focus solely on the airspeed.) The captain and the first officer were making inputs to the aircraft's side stick at the same time (although the dual inputs were not sufficient to trigger a dual-input warning). This action appears to be intended to provide assistance by the captain to fly the aircraft. This action led to confusion on who was flying the aircraft. The ground proximity warning system sounded as the aircraft lost more height and the co-pilot responded with a sharp nose-down input. Then the captain took control of the aircraft without warning, via the side stick priority button and maintained the nose-down input, while the first officer was simultaneously pulling back on his own side stick. Two seconds before impact with the ground the aircraft was at 180 feet. The captain was also <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> side stick fully back, suggesting both pilots were aware of the aircraft's impending collision with the ground.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich Körner (36 victories) also {{recognised}} this as unique: [...] "Shooting {{in a curve}} (deflection shooting) is {{the most}} difficult thing a pilot can do. The enemy flies in a defensive circle, that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, but if he does that, his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} by the Liberals involved PedroI's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation {{was in the}} hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. PedroI also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: [...] "It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that my blood is the same color as that of the Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{injuries}} to several Yankees' starters in 2007, Hughes was called up in April. Hughes made his major league debut on April 26 against the Toronto Blue Jays. In [...] innings, he allowed four runs on seven hits, earning his first career loss. In his second major league start on May 1 against the Texas Rangers, he was maintaining a no-hitter through [...] innings before <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> left hamstring while facing his future teammate [...] Mark Teixeira. Mike Myers later allowed a hit, but Hughes earned his first career win. After the game, {{he was placed}} on the disabled list (DL). He returned on August 4 against the Kansas City Royals, allowing six runs in [...] innings and earning a no-decision in a 16–8 victory. In his final start of the year, on September 27 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, he allowed one run in a season-high seven innings and earned the win in a 3–1 victory. In 17 starts for the Yankees, Hughes had a 5–3 record, a 4.46 ERA, and 58 strikeouts in [...] innings pitched. He was the second-youngest American League (AL) player in 2007.|$|E
500|$|After his seven-triple season, {{his speed}} began to {{decrease}} {{and he could}} no longer regularly score triples due to <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> quadriceps during the 1962 season. Killebrew moved to left field, where he started off the season slowly. He hit under [...]200 in both April and June, and because of this Killebrew was not selected to play in either 1962 All-Star Game, the last season he was not named an All-Star before 1972. On July 18 in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Killebrew and Bob Allison became the first teammates since 1890 to hit grand slams in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first. Over the course of the season, Killebrew hit 48 home runs, 126 RBIs, and had 107 walks, all career highs at the time. No one else in the AL managed even 40 home runs and he also led the league in RBIs. Killebrew's 48 home runs also broke the franchise record {{for the second year in}} a row. Not all of his stats were positive; Killebrew's batting average dropped from [...]288 in 1961 to [...]243 and he struck out a career-worst 142 times, leading the AL.|$|E
