Further, Kompare can apply a <b>patch</b> <b>file</b> which was created this way to an original file A and, in this manner, recompute the contents of the corresponding file B. This is a comfortable utility for passing a corrected version of a file to a friend who already has an older version of the same file, because only the (relatively small) <b>patch</b> <b>file</b> has to be delivered and the receiver can generate the corrected file by applying the patch to the original file.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of data differencing is the diff utility, which produces line-by-line differences of text files (and in some implementations, binary files, thus being a general-purpose differencing tool). Differencing of general binary files goes {{under the rubric of}} delta encoding, with a widely used example being the algorithm used in rsync. A standardized generic differencing format is VCDIFF, implemented in such utilities as Xdelta version 3. A high-efficiency (small <b>patch</b> <b>files)</b> differencing program is bsdiff, which is based on bzip2 compression, demonstrating the close connection between differencing and compression.|$|R

50|$|The MS-DOS version, {{developed}} by Eurocom {{and published by}} GameTek, was released in May 1995 in North America and Europe. There are secret commands to use each character's original color scheme, as well as attacks that {{were removed from the}} 3DO version due to memory constraints. The option menus have custom settings (such as enabling and disabling parallax scrolling) that allows the game to be played with low hardware specifications. The biggest change is the game's resolution; the game is played with a resolution of 320x200 on AT/PC-compatible machines and, since the graphic data is ported straight from the arcade version, all of the characters appear large due to the narrow screen size. Because of this, the distance between both fighters {{at the beginning of a}} match is slightly narrower than in the arcade version. There were many glitches in the initial shipments of the DOS port, such as characters landing and recovering normally after landing from a jump if they're knocked out in mid-air with a basic attack. A <b>patch</b> <b>file</b> was distributed that corrected these glitches, which were later fixed in version 1.5 of the retail release. A <b>patch</b> <b>file</b> for version 1.6 was released as well. The music has been remixed as well, although the arrangements are different from the ones used in the 3DO soundtrack.|$|R

The patched version of the UL is used to extract semantics to KR mapping rules, including default rules for where gaps occur in the external resources. This paper focuses on unifying lexical resources for verbs. ...|$|R

However, HFS was not widely introduced until it {{was included in the}} 128K ROM that debuted with the Macintosh Plus in January 1986 along with the larger 800 KB floppy disk drive for the Macintosh that also used HFS. The introduction of HFS was the first advancement by Apple to leave a Macintosh computer model behind: the original 128K Macintosh, which lacked sufficient memory to load the HFS code and was promptly discontinued.|$|R

Both methods have their advantages, as well as their disadvantages.|$|R
