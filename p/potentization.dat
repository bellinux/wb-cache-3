40|$|Introduction: Lack of {{accuracy}} and uniformity of impact {{have been the}} limitations of the ancient and current methods of <b>potentization.</b> Non-standardized electromechanical potentizers are in use across industry. It is very important that within each manufacturing process, the number of succussions should remain constant as well as the impact given (force exerted) is quantified. The author proposes to give importance to the force parameters in <b>potentization</b> and quantify the impact of <b>potentization.</b> Materials and Methods: The author develops electromechanical potentizer with certain specifications such as arm length, weight, and angle at which the arm drops at the base. The machine was operated with specific instructions given in the machine operation manual. The force parameters were calculated and standardized. Results: Torque is measured to quantify the impact of the force applied in <b>potentization.</b> The magnitude of torque is to be calculated by the force applied, length of the lever arm connecting the axis to the point of force application, and angle between the force vector and the lever arm. In this case, torque was calculated to be = 40. 43 Nm. Since ten strokes are given, torque applied at every potency is calculated as 40. 43. Conclusion: Necessity for the documentation of force parameters used in the process of <b>potentization</b> has been identified, and a tool is developed to demonstrate it...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{time-dependent}} functions {{describing the}} change of the concentration of the solvent S(t) and the homeopathic active substance A(t) during the decimal and centesimal dilution are derived. The function S(t) is a special case of the West-Brown-Enquist curve describing the ontogenic growth, hence the increase in concentration of the solvent during <b>potentization</b> resembles the growth of biological systems. It is proven that the macroscopic S(t) function is the ground state solution of the microscopic non-local Horodecki-Feinberg equation for the time-dependent Hulthen potential at the critical screening. In consequence the <b>potentization</b> belongs to the class of quasi-quantum phenomena playing an important role both in the biological systems and homeopathy. A comparison of the model proposed with recently performed experiment on delayed luminescence of the homeopathic remedy will be also made. Comment: 11 pages, 1 table, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|Homoeopathic {{medicine}} {{has been one}} of the world′s most widely practiced alternative therapies. However, that the potency of a homoeopathic medicine increases with dilution followed by succussion (together termed as <b>potentization)</b> has thrown challenges to the scientific community at large. A recent hypothesis, advanced by us and others, is that due to the process of <b>potentization,</b> the size of the constituent particles decreases and eventually reaches nanodimension. This decrease in size with increase in potency has been verified by scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering studies. The increase in potency is manifested in its increased effect on membrane fluidity. The change in potency also leaves its signature on Ultraviolet-Visible spectra, Fourier transform infrared radiation spectra and Raman spectra. We have taken one step further to carry this nano-dimensional property of homoeopathic medicine and put it into several technical applications. And in so doing, we have connected the important, old, un-quantifiable effects with the latest quantifiable technology and opened up an era of applications with more possibilities...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} tenets of homoeopathy {{is the concept of}} <b>potentization,</b> and yet it con-tinues {{to be one of the}} major stumbling blocks to widespread acceptance of the discipline. As a basis for further discussion this paper pro-vides a br ief h istor ical background to the subject and reviews some approaches adopted by homoeopaths in publications principal ly aimed at the consumer. The teach ings of Hahnemann and la ter homoeopaths Samuel Hahnemann discusses <b>potentization</b> in the Organon, Aphorism 269. For its own special purpose and by its own special procedure, never tried before my time, homoeopa-thy develops the inner, spirit-like medicinal powers of crude substance to a degree hither to unheard of and makes all of them exceedingly, even immeasurably, penetratingly effective and helpful, even those substances that in the crude state do not have the slightest medicinal effect on the human organism. l George V i thou lkas, in his book Homoeopathy: Medicine of the New Man, enthuses about the discovery and efficacy of <b>potentization.</b> To this day, it is not exactly known how Hahnemann came upon the procedure (of diluting medicines to avoid toxic effects); most likely, it arose from his knowledge of chemistry and alchemy. In any case, he simply submitted each dilution to a series of vigorous hakes (or 'suc-cussions', as he called them) and discovered that progressive dilutions were then not only less toxic but also more potent. Hahnemann had found a solution to a problem that had occupied medical men throughout history. He had beaten the problem of the 'side effect ' of drugs. 2 Vithoulkas concludes that this phenomeno...|$|E

40|$|Background: Homeopathy is a time-tested two-century old {{empirical}} {{system of}} healing. Homeopathic medicines are prepared through a characteristic {{process known as}} <b>potentization,</b> where serial dilutions are performed with strong strokes at each step of dilution. Homeopathy is controversial because most medicines do not contain one single molecule of the corresponding starting-substance. Aim: To investigate a possible nanoscience mechanism of action of homeopathic medicines. Methodology: Ultra-pure samples were prepared and were examined under scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) along with selected area nanodiffraction (SAD) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Also trace element analysis (TEA) for silicon was performed. Results: Homeopathic medicines showed not to be Ã¢â‚¬ËœnothingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but exhibited nanoparticles and conglomerates of them, which had crystalline nature and were rich in silicon. Conclusions: During the violent strokes involved in <b>potentization,</b> information arising from the serially diluted starting-substance might be encrypted by epitaxy on silicon-rich crystalline nanoparticles present in the resulting homeopathic medicine. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœsizeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of the information encrypted on nanoparticles might vary together with the degree of dilution. As homeopathic medicines exhibit healing effects, these nanoparticles along with the interfacial water on their surface might carry this information - which biological systems are able to identify - to the target. As various forms of silica are known to interact with proteins and cells of the immune system, homeopathy might represent a nanomedicine system. Possible confirmation, however, requires further research in materials and interfacial water...|$|E

We applied simple nonparametric tests for comparing treated and control groups: {{it seems to be}} a significant stimulating effect when seeds are treated with the 45 th decimal potency of As 2 O 3.

40|$|Background Apart from {{compulsory}} {{lectures on}} classical homeopathy (CH), traditional Chinese medicine/acupuncture, neural therapy and anthroposophically extended medicine (AEM), our institute at the University of Bern offers several optional practical courses for medical students. The {{aim of this}} course during autumn 2011 and spring 2012 was to discuss basic research, observational and clinical studies {{in the fields of}} CH and AEM, so that students i) learned how to read and appraise scientific publications, ii) learned how complementary medicine can be investigated with scientific methods, and iii) were able to form their own opinion about the possible specific effects and effectiveness of homeopathically potentised substances. Methods Introductory lectures on AEM, CH and study design were given to 12 second year medical students. The students appraised 12 research articles and presented the results in class, followed by discussions with experts in the fields of basic and clinical research from our institute. A company producing homeopathic remedies was visited and students could practise <b>potentization</b> procedures and trituration. At the end of the course, students compiled posters with arguments in favour of and against specific effects and effectiveness as well as their own conclusions. The course was evaluated using a written questionnaire with closed and open questions. Results Previous knowledge about CH and AEM was scarce among the students. It slightly increased during the course, and the course itself fostered their interest on the topic. This course was chosen by most students, because they were genuinely interested in the topic (and not because other courses they had wanted to visit were fully booked). The students especially valued the discussions, the various perspectives presented to them, and experiencing a <b>potentization</b> process. Conclusion Medical students were interested to learn more about homeopathically potentised substances. The contradictory study results made {{it difficult for them to}} form their own opinion. Apart from appraising articles, the students would have liked to meet and talk to patients...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20 th century, {{homeopathy}} became the most widespread alternative to conventional medicine in Sweden, although it was practised almost exclusively by laymen. In July 1951, news spread that certain manufacturers of homeopathic remedies had skipped part of the <b>potentization</b> process and had sold pure sugar pills under the false claim that they were homeopathic remedies. Directors and other company employees were sentenced for fraud and tax evasion. According to Swedish medical authorities, homeopathy had finally been revealed as the quackery they had always declared it to be. Homeopathy’s social and cultural associations at this time – belief and religious faith as well as criminal activities – facilitated the pronouncement of the end of this kind of healing. Homeopathy vanished from both Swedish pharmaceutical legislation and the discursive level in society. The homeopathic “pill scandal” can be seen as an important symbolic turning point in the process of modernisation of health care in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Among homeopaths {{the common}} idea about a working hypothe-sis for homeopathic effects {{seems to be}} that during the <b>potentization</b> process, “information ” or “energy ” is being {{preserved}} or even enhanced in homeo-pathic remedies. The organism is said to be able to pick up this information, which in turn will stimulate the organism into a self-healing response. Ac-cording to this view, the decisive element of homeopathic therapy is the rem-edy which locally contains and conveys this information. I question this view for empirical and theoretical reasons. Empirical research has shown a repeti-tive pattern in fundamental and clinical research alike: There are many anom-alies in high-dilution research and clinical homeopathic trials which will set any observing researcher thinking. No single paradigm has proved stable enough in order to produce repeatable results independent of the researcher. I conclude that the database is too weak and contradictory to substantiate a local interpretation of homeopathy, in which the remedy is endowed with causal-information irrespective of content. I propose a non-local interpreta-tion to understand the anomalies along the lines of Jung’s notion of syn-chronicity and make some predictions following this analysis...|$|E
40|$|Background: A double-blind, randomized, {{placebo-controlled}} Homoeopathic Pathogenetic Trial (HPT) of Nanocurcumin {{was conducted}} using the accepted guidelines, Ethical Committee approval, and scientific documentation. The standardized <b>potentization</b> method was adopted {{to enhance the}} quality of the pathogenetic trial. Various statistical calculations were used for evaluation of the symptoms. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} conduct an HPT of Nanocurcumin 6 X, a nano-substance in dilution. Materials and Methods: The drug Nanocurcumin 6 X was proved through double-blind, placebo-controlled method. The trial was done in 6 X potency on 30 healthy  provers who were screened by their pretrial medical examinations and routine laboratory investigations. Of 30 provers, 7 were on placebo and 23 were on drug. Medicine was prepared according to the principles of trituration given in Homoeopathic Pharmacopeia of India.

The objectives of the experiments were to examine if potentized nanodilutions (PNDs) have effects on different stages of seed development of pea aiming at the development of a plant model. Copper was chosen as stress factor as its excess is toxic and affects seed development. The experiments show {{for the first time that}} potentized nanodilutions (PNDs) of metallic copprer have biological effects on pea seed development which are similar to the effect of copper (water solutions of CuSO 4). The results, also, show that PNDs can stimulate response for overcoming the stress applied to seeds...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about finding out why minors are visiting pubs, {{and what it}} is that determines which pubs they opt to visit. To catch this, a {{qualitative}} approach is applied, specifically Fo-cus group interviews. There are interviews with a total of 10 informants. The informants come from two different schools in Gothenburg. There are six boys and four girls. Everyone is 17 years old. The earlier research on the subject is, for instance, why people are visiting pubs, why young people drink alcohol, what music means for young people, and why young people are staying in public spaces. The theoretical conceptions and also keywords are: Social identity, Social identity processing, <b>Potentization,</b> Symbolic capital, Symbols, Experience capital and Group culture. The results shows that social interaction is the most essential factor for pub visits, many per-sons describe it as a meeting place. Moreover {{it turned out that the}} alcohol aspect and also the excitement are two important factors for pub visits. To “pick up” and the music had also cer-tain importance, but it was diminutive. The pubs that you choose to visit are, for instance, those which are cheap and where the age of the audience is akin your own. Furthermore, it depends on your mood.

40|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{reported}} statistically significant and clinically relevant effects of homeopathic preparations. We applied ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy {{to investigate the}} physical properties of homeopathic preparations and to contribute {{to an understanding of}} the not-yet-identified mode of action. In previous investigations, homeopathic preparations had significantly lower UV light transmissions than controls. The aim of this study was to explore the possible effects of external factors (UV light and temperature) on the homeopathic preparations. Homeopathic centesimal (c) dilutions, 1 c to 30 c, of copper sulfate (CuSO 4), decimal dilutions of sulfur (S 8), 1 x to 30 x, and controls (succussed <b>potentization</b> medium) were prepared, randomized, and blinded. UV transmission was measured at six different time points after preparation (from 4 to 256 days). In addition, one series of samples was exposed to UV light of a sterilization lamp for 12 h, one was incubated at 37 °C for 24 [*]h, and one was heated to 90 °C for 15 [*]min. UV light transmission values from 190 or 220 [*]nm to 340 [*]nm were measured several times and averaged. After each exposure, UV transmission of the homeopathic preparations of CuSO 4 was significantly reduced compared to the controls, particularly after heating to 37 °C. Overall, the nonexposed CuSO 4 preparations did not show significantly lower UV transmission compared to controls; however, the pooled subgroup of measurements at days 26, 33, and 110 yielded significant differences. UV light transmission for S 8 preparations did not show any differences compared to controls. Our conclusion is that exposure to external factors, incubation at 37 °C in particular, increases the difference in light transmission of homeopathic CuSO 4 preparations compared to controls...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} homoeopathic Arsenicum album potencies were investigated in-vitro, using a {{continuous cell line}} (MT 4), pre-intoxicated with arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3), and then treated with succussed and unsuccussed homoeopathic potencies, 6 CH, 30 CH and 200 CH. This study aimed to verify the homoeopathic law of similars and to determine whether potencies diluted beyond Avogadro’s constant had physiological effects on cells; whether various potencies would cause different effects {{as suggested by the}} concept of hormesis; whether succussed and unsuccussed homoeopathic potencies had different effects on the cells; and to establish whether a biotechnological method could be used to evaluate the above. As 2 O 3 was used to pre-intoxicate and the MTT assay was used to measure the percentage cytotoxicity and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of the cells. The homoeopathic potencies of Arsenicum album (6 CH, 30 CH and 200 CH) were prepared by either succussing or allowing to diffuse for 30 s. After pre-intoxication of the MT 4 cells with the IC 50 As 2 O 3 and treatment with succussed and unsuccussed Arsenicum album (6 CH- 200 CH), the cell viability increased with increasing potency from 81 % to 194 % (over 72 h). The treatments and the times of exposure were found to be statistically significant determinants of cell viability, whereas succussion did not cause any significant variation in the results. The study provided evidence that a biotechnological method (namely cell viability) may be used to scientifically evaluate the physiological effects of homoeopathic potencies on human cells; it confirmed that the homoeopathic potencies did have therapeutic effects; and that succussion was not required in the <b>potentization</b> method in order to produce a curative remedy...|$|E
40|$|Background&# 13; &# 13; Several {{series of}} {{experiments}} from our research group have shown ultraviolet (UV) light transmission of homeopathic preparations to slightly but significantly differ from controls. We now investigated whether visible and near infrared spectroscopy were also useful for exploring properties of homeopathic preparations. &# 13; &# 13; Materials and methods&# 13; &# 13; Homeopathic preparations of copper sulfate (CuSO 4), hypericum and sulfur (S 8) were produced in 30 sequential steps of 1 : 100 dilutions (c-preparations). As controls, succussed <b>potentization</b> medium was used. Transmission of the samples from 190 - 1100 nm was measured 4 times on 5 days with a double beam Shimadzu UV PC 1601 spectrophotometer. To correct for the daily variations of the spectrophotometer, transmission of the samples at each nm was divided by the average transmission of the controls. Median transmissions of the samples were calculated for the ranges of 190 - 340 nm (near and middle UV), 340 - 640 nm (visible light without red), and 640 - 1100 nm (red and near infrared). Differences in the median transmission between potency levels from 6 c to 30 c were determined using Kruskal-Wallis and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests. &# 13; &# 13; Results&# 13; &# 13; Differences in transmissions of the various potency levels were more pronounced in the UV range than in the visible or red/near infrared range. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences for homeopathic preparations of CuSO 4, hypericum and S 8 in the UV range (p= 0. 032, 0. 008, 0. 009, respectively) and of S 8 in the visible range (p= 0. 026). &# 13; &# 13; Jonckheere's test showed a tendency towards ascending medians with ascending potency levels for CuSO 4 in the UV range (p= 0. 080).

40|$|Antibiotic Feed Additives (AFA) {{have been}} used to prevent many {{bacterial}} infections during weaning of livestock. The use of these AFA’s resulted in the development of multiresistant bacterial strains and was therefore banned by the European Union. The United States also restricted the use of these feed additives considerably. Many scientists have started to search for alternatives in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of bacterial infections. Plants {{have been used}} traditionally by resource poor {{people all over the world}} to treat many infections. Diarrhoea not only causes many problems in the high intensity production of livestock but also leads to many human deaths. A large number of plants {{have been used to}} treat diarrhoea in humans and animals. Several authors have selected one or two species based on traditional use to evaluate in depth. In this project several different relevant parameters of 53 plant species used traditionally to treat diarrhoea were investigated in order to develop a model that would identify the species with the highest chance of delivering a useful antibacterial product. Antibacterial activities against two pathogens important in diarrhoea (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) were positive parameters in selecting species. Because tannins frequently have antibacterial activity, but are not useful as prophylactic agents due to their effect on production, high tannin content was considered to be a negative indication. Cellular toxicity was also used as a negative parameter at a later stage. In addition to the in vitro assays there are also other parameters to be investigated to evaluate the potential use of plants. The influence of season of collection was determined on the antibacterial activity and tannin content of acetone leaf extracts of five plant species traditionally used to treat diarrhoea. They were Acacia karroo, Acacia sieberiana var. woodii, Peltophorum africanum, Trichilia emetica and Ziziphus mucronata. The antibacterial activity varied depending on the season of collection with the best activity generally in the months of late summer to autumn (January to April). The activity of Acacia karoo against E. coli was best in the month of April (MIC = 0. 11 mg/ml (TA = 332 ml/g)) and against S. aureus in the month of March (MIC = 0. 06 mg/ml (TA = 334 ml/g)). Acacia sieberiana subsp. woodii extracts had the best activity against E. coli (MIC = 0. 10 mg/ml (TA = 303 ml/g)) in March against S. aureus in April (MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml (TA = 303 ml/g)). <i. Peltophorum africanum extracts were most active against E. coli in February (MIC = 0. 05 mg/ml (TA = 1188 ml/g)) and against S. aureus in February and March (MIC = 0. 04 mg/ml (TA = 1188 ml/g and 1075 ml/g)). Trichilia emetica extracts were generally not very active against the bacterial strains (best activity: MIC = 0. 22 mg/ml (TA = 74 ml/g) against E. coli in May and MIC = 0. 28 mg/ml (TA = 26 ml/g) against S. aureus in December). Ziziphus mucronata was most active against both bacterial strains and in May (E. coli: MIC = 0. 10 mg/ml (TA = 589 ml/g); S. aureus: MIC = 0. 04 mg/ml (TA = 1099 ml/g)). The tannin content varied in the extracts as well. The antibacterial activity however did not seem to be directly correlated to the tannin content. Another important parameter in the use of plant species is to determine the interspecies variation of plants based on genetic or environmental influences. Leaves from 42 plants of Combretum molle were collected at different locations during the same season. The average MIC against E. coli was 0. 227 mg/ml. The low standard deviation of 0. 07 indicates that there was very little variation in activity. The average value against S. aureus was 0. 399 mg/ml with a slightly higher standard deviation of 0. 16. However due to the fact that the samples from different areas extracted different amounts, the total activity varied. The tannin assays revealed that there was with one exception no correlation between the antibacterial activity and the tannin content. So it can be safe to assume that genetic variation does not influence the activity too much at least in C. molle leaves Fifty three plant species traditionally used to treat diarrhoea in published literature were then ranked using a novel system in order to determine which species had the most potential value. Ranking was based on the lowest MIC value against E. coli, lower activity against S. aureus (to limit selecting for general metabolic toxins), low tannin concentration and high extract yield. From this ranking, five plants were chosen to investigate their potential value further: Acacia sieberiana var. woodii (E. coli: MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 108 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 108 ml/g; Yield = 14 mg), Albizia adianthifolia (E. coli: MIC = 0. 14 mg/ml, TA = 239 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 04 mg/ml, TA = 765 ml/g; Yield = 34 mg), Deinbollia oblongifolia (E. coli: MIC = 0. 17 mg/ml, TA = 158 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml, TA = 338 ml/g; Yield = 27 mg), Spirostachys africana (E. coli : MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 300 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 09 mg/ml, TA = 438 ml/g; Yield = 38 mg) and Tetradenia riparia (E. coli : MIC = 0. 09 mg/ml, TA = 214 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 149 ml/g; Yield = 20 mg). None of the plants contained any tannin. The next step towards the recommendation of a plant for the development of a commercial product was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the selected five species. The following values were obtained: Acacia sieberiana var. woodii LC 50 = 0. 026 mg/ml, Albizia adianthifolia LC 50 = 0. 068 mg/ml, Deinbollia oblongifolia LC 50 = 0. 078 mg/ml, Spirostachys africana LC 50 = 0. 025 mg/ml and Tetradenia riparia LC 50 = 0. 028 mg/ml. Deinbollia oblongifolia (for its low LC 50 value) and Spirostachys africana (for its good antibacterial activity and total activity) were potentized by removing inactive compounds through solvent-solvent fractionation. The antibacterial activity against E. coli was increased this way (MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml for Deinbollia oblongifolia (chloroform fraction) and MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml for Spirostachys africana (chloroform fraction)) The LC 50 values for both chloroform fractions were determined (LC 50 = 0. 188 mg/ml for Deinbollia oblongifolia and LC 50 = 0. 062 mg/ml for Spirostachys africana). The selectivity index (SI) was also determined and proved that the <b>potentization</b> was indeed successful (Deinbollia oblongifolia SI = 2. 35 compared to a value of 0. 45 for the crude extract; Spirostachys africana SI = 0. 78 compared to a value of 0. 19 for the crude extract). Based on these values, the chloroform fraction of Deinbollia oblongifolia was chosen as the less toxic one with similar activity and a higher selectivity index to be worked on further. One of the active compounds was isolated and evaluated for its activity against E. coli (MIC = 0. 74 mg/ml) The LC 50 value of 0. 042 mg/ml indicated that the activity of the extract was a result of synergism rather than being due to a single active compound (the selectivity index (SI) was 0. 06 compared to the values of 0. 45 for the crude and 2. 35 for the potentized extract). The plant extracts should of course be as effective against pathogenic strains as they were against the ATCC strains and so the extracts and pure compound of Deinbollia oblongifolia were tested for their activity against four different pathological E. coli strains. The results showed that the crude extract and the fraction were as active as in the preliminary screening results against only one of the four pathological strains. The pure compound on the other hand was more active against all four pathological strains than against the ATCC strain. The next step was to test the safety of the extracts of Deinbollia oblongifolia in mammals. Unfortunately neither the crude extract nor the chloroform fraction of Deinbollia oblongifolia could be used safely in a living organism or in an isolated organ study. A part of the problem may have been caused by the vehicle used in the study despite reports in the literature that an acetone water mixture is safe to use. In general all the species investigated had good antibacterial activity against E. coli this supports the traditional use of these species although we used acetone as extractant rather than the water used traditionally. There were major differences in antibacterial activity over a season indicating that mature leaves were more active than young leaves before senescence started. At least in the case of Combretum molle there was little difference in the antibacterial activity of many plants collected at different locations during the same season. The results obtained in this study could be useful in further studies to develop extracts that can be used to control diarrhoea in animals. Possibly more emphasis should be put on the difference in activity towards E. coli and S. aureus to eliminate the presence of general metabolic toxins. Such an approach would lead to a different priority order for species to examine. A major first step would probably be to test the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of selected species.
