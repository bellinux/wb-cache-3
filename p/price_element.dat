The most common {{reason for this is that}} the page {{is delivered}} with client-side JavaScript that will produce on-going dynamic behavior after the page is rendered. For example, if rolling the mouse over a 'Buy now' link is meant to make the price, elsewhere on the page, become emphasized, JavaScript code can do this, but JavaScript needs to identify the <b>price</b> <b>element,</b> wherever it is in the markup. The following markup would suffice: [...] Another example is the Ajax programming technique, where, for example, clicking a hypertext link may cause JavaScript code to retrieve the text for a new price quotation to display in place of the current one within the page, without re-loading the whole page. When the new text arrives back from the server, the JavaScript must identify the exact region on the page to replace with the new information.|$|E
40|$|Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) {{for wind}} {{generation}} has some unusual features making it {{different from other}} REFIT schemes around the world. By utilising an annual floor <b>price</b> <b>element</b> the scheme presents an option value to the contract holder, which to date has gone unnoticed or unvalued in the market. By employing an option pricing framework, this paper has quantified {{for the first time}} in the public domain the expected costs and value of the Irish REFIT support scheme for wind generation. While the cost of the REFIT scheme to the electricity consumer appears to be lower than the cost of schemes in other countries, significant inefficiencies exist as a result of the structure of the scheme. The Irish REFIT scheme is contrasted with a single Fixed Price support scheme and the analysis suggests that the Fixed Price scheme can provide a similar or greater incentive to the wind sector at half the cost to the end electricity consumer, and may also prove more compatible with consumers desire to reduce inter-year electricity portfolio cost volatility...|$|E
40|$|The report {{tries to}} find out the {{differences}} in the pricing and promotion policies (if any) in the in-store (offline) and the online channels of retail. The report will discuss the emergence of the internet as a medium of retail and the affect that has had on the price and promotion elements of the traditional marketing mix model. Emergence of the internet is affecting every aspect of our lives. By making internet as a medium to sell things, companies have brought about a revolution in the retail sector. With the increasing demands of the customers, catering to them is not possible by the traditional marketing mix model. This requires the marketing policies to be revamped accordingly to be effective in the new business scenario with understanding the customer behaviour as the focus. The report will talk in detail about the pricing policies of the companies that want to move into online retailing be it pure e-retailers or brick-and-click companies. It is important for such companies to know about the affect of internet on the <b>price</b> <b>element</b> and the factors which they should keep in mind while framing the online retail pricing policies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the pricing of offerings {{in an industrial}} context. The purpose of this thesis is to give {{suggestions on how to}} develop the pricing of products and services in the case company. The main research question is: What changes and upgrades are needed towards successful product and service pricing in the case company? The objective is to identify the elements relevant to the pricing of offerings, to estimate how suc-cessfully the elements are implemented in the case company, and to give suggestions for the case company on how to develop their product and service pricing as part of sales. In this research, a constructive research approach was used where the empirical data were collected through semi-structured interviews and observations. The theoretical part of the study {{examines the}} relevant <b>elements</b> in the <b>pricing</b> literature. Based on the litera-ture review an initial framework for service pricing was built to direct the analysis of the empirical data. The empirical part of the research studied the <b>pricing</b> <b>elements</b> de-rived from both the case company’s pricing practices and from previous literature. The main findings of the research were that the case company is considering all of the <b>pricing</b> <b>elements</b> identified in the literature. There were also three new <b>pricing</b> <b>elements</b> found in the empirical research which emerged from interviews and observation rounds. The most important <b>pricing</b> <b>elements</b> proposed for development due to their current weak implementation were: the IT systems, pricing guidelines, and cost estimation. Al-so other improvement needs were identified concerning the other <b>pricing</b> <b>elements</b> and, therefore, a three step process is suggested, to cover the promotion of all the <b>pricing</b> <b>elements</b> needing development in the future.

It is found that manufacturing and consuming of steel products would be a key indicator to measure and evaluate economic and industrial performance of a country. Nowadays, countries with the large natural oil and gas resources (e. g. Iran) attempt to select an alternative economic approach to utilize the resources in steel manufacturing rather than export the raw natural resources. While steel products have an enormous consumption market in the world, having the national and international consumption markets is still challenging. The aim of this research is to investigate and identify the effects of marketing mix elements on steel industry export. To this end, a case study conducted on export of Iran’s steel products in the trading-industry marketing views. According to the marketing mix elements approach, 30 variables were studied.

40|$|The {{success of}} the garment and textile {{industry}} has contributed immensely to a culture of mass consumption. In 2011 Norway accounted for 16. 2 billion NOK worth of clothing imports (Garberg, 2012), with households spending 23, 618 NOK on clothing and foot wear yearly(SSB, 2012). However, the industry s indiscretions towards ethics and the environment have been seemingly ignored by consumers. In {{order to understand the}} reasons why consumption practices remain unaltered towards sustainable consumption, this study aims to present factors that shape and explain clothing consumption patterns in Oslo. The knowledge, awareness level and attitude of consumers towards their ecological foot print are also presented. The study was conducted with a total of 25 participants ranging from consumers to fashion designers, authors and project managers. Interviews were conducted over a three month period and all them took place in Oslo. The key findings of the study showed that consumers were not able to consume clothing sustainably due to two major factors: lack of information and price. Owing to the lack of transparency of the production line as well as the geographical separation of the manufacturing process from the location of the consumer, consumers have access to very little information about the conditions under which their clothing was made. The <b>price</b> <b>element</b> also {{played a key role in}} the deterring of consumption of sustainable clothing. As the sustainable fashion designers incurred higher costs they offered higher prices than their established competitors such as H&M & Zara, which provide lower quality but cheaper and trendy clothing. The paper further goes on to show that the onus of sustainability cannot be said to solely rely on the consumer. The government also has a key role to play in this endeavor. The government can reduce consumption in various ways, one of the proposed ways to discourage bulk and frequent buying is by increasing the taxes on fast fashion clothing brands. This money can then be used to subsidize the sustainable fashion designers clothes. The government can also run financed national level campaigns aimed at informing the public on various topics related to sustainability and clothes. All these efforts combined by all the stakeholders will help move the Norwegian consumption pattern to that of a more sustainable level through the consumption of higher quality clothing at lower frequency...|$|E

40|$|M. Com. (Marketing Management) Despite the {{extensive}} research {{undertaken in the}} subject area of services marketing, not much {{research has been conducted}} in the internal marketing area, specifically in the South African context. This study attempted to address this subject and focused on seven internal marketing mix elements (internal product, internal price, internal promotion, internal distribution, internal people, internal process and internal physical evidence) and their influence on the satisfaction of graduate development employees within retail banks in South Africa. Further to this, the link between employee satisfaction and affective commitment was explored due to its impact on employee productivity. The growth of the service sector worldwide has led to services being considered {{as one of the most}} important sectors in the world. The contribution of the South African service sector to GDP was 68. 1 % in 2012, where the financial services sector in South Africa has already overtaken the manufacturing sector as the largest contributor to GDP. The financial service sector contributed 22 % in 2008. Given the homogeneity within the retail banking industry, there is very little differentiating the banks, and imitation of any innovation is inevitable. For this reason a market-driven strategy that enables retail banks to deliver superior quality is essential as service quality is the only real differentiator and key to building a competitive advantage. Given its employees who create the service experience, the employee as the internal customer becomes the organisation’s most valuable asset. For this reason, retail banks in South Africa have been placing an increased focus on recruiting at the graduate level leading to the establishment of Graduate Development Programmes (GDPs). These banking GDPs are specifically designed to help graduates succeed in complex environments and to build the talent pipeline by providing an in-depth training programme. However one of the biggest challenges faced by banks is the satisfaction and retention of their GDP employees. Banks generally experience high attrition rates amongst this group of employees mainly due to job dissatisfaction which impacts service quality provided to external customers, and which increases the organisation’s costs. An internal marketing programme aimed at employees could enhance employee satisfaction which in turn could enhance employee levels of affective commitment resulting in higher retention rates. Satisfied employees will go the extra mile to serve external customers and in this manner service quality can be improved. In order to investigate the influence of the internal marketing mix on employee satisfaction and test the relationship between employee satisfaction and affective commitment, an empirical investigation was conducted. The primary research objective of the study was to investigate the influence of the internal marketing mix on employee satisfaction from GDP employees’ perspective in order to enhance their satisfaction at retail banks with graduate development programmes in South Africa. In addition to this, the relationship between satisfaction and affective commitment was explored. A census approach was applied to the study using a person administered and an electronic survey method. All retail banks with graduate development programmes were invited to participate in the study of which three agreed to participate. Of the 360 graduates, 64 employees agreed to participate in the study. Regression analysis was used to test the relationships proposed in the study. The internal promotion and internal physical evidence scales were discarded due to poor construct validity, internal distribution emerged as a two-factor solution and was split into collaborative culture and organisational structure, and the internal <b>price</b> <b>element</b> was not regarded as statistically significant. From the study, the internal marketing mix elements that influenced employee satisfaction to come to fore included internal product, collaborative culture, organisational structure, internal people and internal process. The outcome of the regression analysis showed that employee satisfaction is influenced by internal product, collaborative culture, organisational structure, internal people and internal process. In addition to this, it was concluded that employee satisfaction influences affective commitment. Based on these outcomes, recommendations were made to retail banks for the implementation of a formal internal marketing mix through for example the implementation of the internal people element. Retail banks would be able to ensure that supervisors are easily accessible and providing constant ongoing feedback, a benefit which was identified as the most important contributor to GDP job satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to gain an {{understanding}} of consumer preferences and mind-set regarding the transition to using renewable energy. Design/methodology/approach – The approach taken is an experimental design of messaging (conjoint analysis). Findings – The study uncovered different segments of individuals, with different mind-sets, needing different types of messaging. Results show what marketing messages might best work to interest consumers in the transition to renewable energy. The study revealed two different mind-set segments among respondents. The first segment comprised residents who preferred a gradual transition toward using 80 percent renewable energy, and 20 percent conventional energy, with no specific transition time span, and with no tax increases. The second segment comprised residents who preferred a five year, fixed-time plan for the conversion to renewable energy sources (RES), along with service plans, and an accompanying “money back” guarantee. Research limitations/implications – The study did not include the testing of <b>pricing</b> <b>elements</b> to the messaging about the transition to “green” process. Thus, insights concerning the interaction of financial concerns with mind-sets in the transition to “green” are yet to be studied. Practical implications – After identifying the segment to which each individual belongs, data permit the creation of a “typing tool” to identify segment membership, thus allowing more targeted and effective messaging when building awareness and demand for green power. Originality/value – This is a pioneering study that looks at the “mind” of the customer, to investigate how different ideas and messaging drive the consumer's comfort level regarding the use of RES, and the future of their energy consumption and transitional needs.
