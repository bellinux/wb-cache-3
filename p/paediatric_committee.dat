40|$|Introduction: Status epilepticus (SE) is a lifethreatening {{neurological}} emergency. SE lasting {{longer than}} 120 min and not responding to first-line and second-line antiepileptic drugs {{is defined as}} 'refractory' (RCSE) and requires intensive care unit treatment. There is currently neither evidence nor consensus to guide either the optimal choice of therapy or treatment goals for RCSE, which is generally treated with coma induction using conventional anaesthetics (high dose midazolam, thiopental and/or propofol). Increasing evidence indicates that ketamine (KE), a strong N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, may be effective in treating RCSE. We hypothesised that intravenous KE is more efficacious and safer than conventional anaesthetics in treating RCSE. Methods and analysis: A multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-profit, sequentially designed study will be conducted to assess the efficacy of KE compared with conventional anaesthetics {{in the treatment of}} RCSE in children. 10 Italian centres/ hospitals are involved in enrolling 57 patients aged 1 month to 18 years with RCSE. Primary outcome is the resolution of SE up to 24 hours after withdrawal of therapy and is updated for each patient treated according to the sequential method. Ethics and dissemination: The study received ethical approval from the Tuscan <b>Paediatric</b> Ethics <b>Committee</b> (12 / 2015). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} immunisations for preterm infants is controversial. Because of the {{statement}} by the British <b>Paediatric</b> Association/Joint <b>Committee</b> on Vaccination and Immunisation Liaison group that immunisations should normally begin {{three months after the}} date of birth, the records of all infants born in 1984 and currently (June 1986) resident in the London Borough of Newham were studied to find out if this recommendation was being implemented. Subjects were divided into groups by birth weight and where possible by gestational age. Cumulative uptakes by age of any component of the first and third triple immunisations, and of the pertussis component, were plotted separately. Comparison of uptake of the first course showed a considerable initial delay for infants weighing less than 2000 g at birth compared with heavier babies, but by 18 months the coverage was almost identical. This difference was not evident for the third course. A similar delay was apparent when infants of 37 weeks' gestation or less were compared with babies born at full term, though recording of gestational age was incomplete. Final overall uptake was poor for all groups. Differences among groups in numbers consenting were not an important factor. Informing those responsible for giving the immunisations of these findings has stimulated their interest in improving practice by implementing the recommendations...|$|R
40|$|In 1979 and 1980 the Canadian <b>Paediatric</b> Society's Nutrition <b>Committee</b> {{published}} guidelines for professionals counselling mothers of infants on feeding practices. The practices in 1984 - 85 of mothers in Toronto were determined for {{comparison with the}} practices identified in a similar study conducted in Toronto and Montreal in 1977 - 78 to ascertain if practices had changed in favour of the recommendations. Between July 1984 and February 1985, 404 metropolitan Toronto mothers of infants were interviewed. Compared with the 1977 - 78 group of mothers, more of the 1984 - 85 mothers had chosen to breast-feed and fewer had stopped breast-feeding in the first month. As well, fewer of the 1984 - 85 infants had been fed unmodified cow's milk in the first 6 months of life and introduced to solid foods before 4 months of age. We conclude that major changes in infant feeding practices had occurred since 1977 - 78 and that the 1984 - 85 practices corresponded closely to the infant feeding guidelines...|$|R
40|$|A {{workshop}} organised by the European Medicines Agency involved assessors {{and experts}} {{present in a}} Nonclinical Working Group evaluating juvenile animal studies for Paediatric Investigation Plans {{in collaboration with the}} <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Safety Working Party of the Committee for Human Medicinal Products. The objective of the workshop was to analyse which juvenile animal studies proposals were received and agreed by the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee,</b> to check consistency and how to apply the existing European guideline on juvenile animal studies. A comparison of main organ system development in man vs. animal species was presented to guide the review and to support species selection and protocol design. An analysis of juvenile animal studies included in finalised PIP's was also presented. Out of 109 paediatric investigation plans finalised between November 2008 and March 2009, 43 included one or more juvenile animal studies. In most cases the preferred species was the rat; one species only was requested to be studied (20 / 22), but in a minority two species were required (2 / 22). When deciding on the characteristics of the juvenile animal studies, such as age of animals at study start, the age of the children targeted by the medicine was considered. It is expected that the increasing experience gained by Applicants and Regulators will allow further refining the criteria for these juvenile animal studies. Further research on this topic is highly encouraged in the European Regulatory framework...|$|E
40|$|New European {{legislation}} {{has the potential}} to have an enormous impact on how paediatric medicines are studied and used N ew European Union (EU) paedia-tric regulations to encourage more research on children’s medicines became law on 26 January 2007. 1 The main proposals are as follows. First, there will be incentives to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to test products for use in children. Secondly, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) will host an expert <b>paediatric</b> <b>committee</b> to oversee and assess paediatric investigation plans for developing medicines for children. Thirdly, a European clinical trials network will be set up to foster collaboration on paediatric studies throughout the EU. Fourthly, medicines licensed for paedia-tric use should be sold with a special label indicating that fact. This {{legislation has}} the potential to have an enormous impact on how pae-diatric medicines, both old and new, are studied and used. Is this good news for Europe’s 140 million children...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{document}} is to provide general information about mIBG scintigraphy in cancer patients. The guidelines describe the mIBG scintigraphy protocol currently used in clinical routine, but do not include all existing procedures for neuroendocrine tumours. The guidelines should therefore not be taken as exclusive of other nuclear medicine modalities {{that can be used}} to obtain comparable results. It is important to remember that the resources and facilities available for patient care may vary from one country to another and from one medical institution to another. The present guidelines have been prepared for nuclear medicine physicians and intend to offer assistance in optimizing the diagnostic information that can currently be obtained from mIBG scintigraphy. The corresponding guidelines of the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) and the Dosimetry, Therapy and <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> of the EANM have been taken into consideration, and partially integrated into this text. The same has been done with the most relevant literature on this topic, and the final result has been discussed within a group of distinguished experts...|$|E
40|$|Paediatric surgery {{services}} in Dublin are currently provided by four consultant paediatric surgeons (including one vacant post - Professor Guiney) in three hospitals - Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, the Children's Hospital, Temple Street and Tallaght Hospital. Outside of Dublin, consultant general surgeons perform non-specialist paediatric surgery {{and almost all}} neonatal surgery and specialist paediatric surgery is referred to the paediatric surgeons in Dublin. Paediatric urology in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin {{is provided by the}} four paediatric surgeons who have commitments to the hospital. In Temple Street Hospital, paediatric urology services are provided by two consultant adult urologists with an interest in paediatric urology. In Tallaght Hospital, paediatric urology services are predominantly provided by one of the paediatric surgeons and toa lesser extent by one of the adult urologists who has a designated special interest in paediatric urology. The three separate paediatric surgery units each producing an on-call service are supported by a complement of 20 junior doctors. Due to the fragmented nature of the service, recognition for higher specialist training has been limited in the past. The committee has been informed by the Irish paediatric surgeons group that the Specialist Advisory <b>Committee</b> (<b>Paediatric</b> Surgery) in two visitations to Dublin recently have criticised the division of specialist paediatric surgery in terms of training of paediatric surgeons. While a review of these matters is outside the remit of this committee, its recommendations if implemented should lead to improved training...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guideline}} is to offer to the nuclear medicine team a framework, which could prove helpful in daily practice. This guideline contains information related to the procedure and indications of measurement of glomerular filtration rate using blood samples in children. The present document is inspired by {{the report of the}} Radionuclides in Nephrourology Committee on renal clearance (1), but contains information more specifically adapted to the European practice e. g. the choice of tracer. This guideline summarises the views of the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Association of Nuclear medicine. It should be taken in the context of ”good practice ” of nuclear medicine and local regulation. II Background information and definitions Renal clearance of a substance can occur by two processes: glomerular filtration or tubular secretion. Of these processes, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is probably the most representative parameter of renal function. It is relatively constant under standard conditions, and, as opposed to tubular secretion, is independent of the urine flow. This guideline is exclusively devoted to the determination of GFR. The passive process of glomerular filtration can be quantified by measuring the clearance rate of a substanc...|$|E

It should be taken in the context of “good practice ” of nuclear medicine and local regulation. II Background information and Definitions Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is an aralkylguanidine noradrenaline analogue which, once iodinated with 131 I or 123 I, enables successful imaging of neuroectodermally derived tumours, including neuroblastoma and phaeochromocytomas [2 - 6] although other tumours, such as paragangliomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas, carcinoid tumours, Merkel cell tumours of the skin, and metastases of these tumours, have been shown to take up MIBG [7, 8].

40|$|This European Respiratory Society {{task force}} has {{reviewed}} {{the evidence for}} paediatric medicines in respiratory disease occurring in adults and children. We describe off-licence use, research priorities and ongoing studies. Off-licence and off-label prescribing in children is widespread and potentially harmful. Research areas in asthma include novel formulations and regimens, and individualised prescribing. In cystic fibrosis, future studies will focus on screened infants and robust outcome measures are needed. Other areas include new enzyme and antibiotic formulations and the basic defect. Research into pneumonia should include evaluation of new antibacterials and regimens, rapid diagnostic tests and, in pleural infection, antibiotic penetration, fibrinolytics and surveillance. In uncommon conditions, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, congenital pulmonary abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, drugs indicated for other conditions (e. g. dornase alfa) are commonly used and trials are needed. In neuromuscular disorders, the beta-agonists may enhance muscle strength and {{are in need of}} evaluation. Studies of antibiotic prophylaxis, immunoglobulin and antifungal drugs are needed in immune deficiency. We hope that this summary of the evidence for respiratory medicines in children, highlighting gaps and research priorities, will be useful for the pharmaceutical industry, the <b>paediatric</b> <b>committee</b> of the European Medicines Agency, academic investigators and the lay publi...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guideline}} is to offer to the nuclear medicine team a framework, which could prove helpful in daily practice. This guideline contains information related to the indications, acquisition, processing and interpretation of direct radioisotope cystography (DRC) in children. The present document is inspired by {{the desire of the}} EANM and the American Society of Nuclear Medicine to have guidelines for most nuclear medicine procedures (1). This guideline summarises the views of the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. The guideline should be taken in the context of "good practice " and any local/national rules, which apply to nuclear medicine examinations. II Background and Definition Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common abnormality found in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). In children with UTI different authors suggest an incidence of VUR between 22 % to 52 % (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). With growth and maturation of the vesicoureteral junction up to 79 % of VURs disappear spontaneously (6, 7). VUR is more common in siblings of patients with VUR (8, 9) and in children of parents with documented VUR (10).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guideline}} is to offer to the nuclear medicine team a framework, which could prove helpful in daily practice. This guideline contains information related to the indications, acquisition, processing and interpretation of Indirect radioisotope cystography (IRC). The present document is inspired by {{the desire of the}} EANM and the American Society of Nuclear Medicine to have guidelines for most nuclear medicine procedures. [1] However this guideline contains information more specifically adapted to the European practice. This guideline summarises the views of the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. II Background and Definition Cystography is undertaken most commonly to detect vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] The generally accepted reference method is the radiological micturating cystogram (MCU) although the direct catheter isotope cystogram (DIC) is as sensitive as and has a lower radiation burden than the MCU [2]. The indirect radionuclide cystogram (IRC) offers the possibility of detecting VUR without a bladder catheter, and allows micturition to be studied under physiological conditions [8, 9, 10]. With MCU and DIC both the filling and micturition phases can be studied, however only the micturition phase may be studied with the IRC [11, 12, 13, 14]. IRC may be undertaken in any child, however it is easier when the child is toilet trained i. e. over 3 years of age. The IRC is done following...|$|E
40|$|Aims In the EU, {{development}} of new medicines for children should follow a prospectively agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP). Finding the right dose for children is crucial but challenging due to the variability of pharmacokinetics across age groups and the limited sample sizes available. We examined strategies adopted in PIPs to support paediatric dosing recommendations to identify common assumptions underlying dose investigations and the attempts planned to verify them in children. Methods We extracted data from 73 PIP opinions recently adopted by the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Medicines Agency. These opinions represented 79 medicinal development programmes and comprised a total of 97 dose investigation studies. We identified the design of these dose investigation studies, recorded the analyses planned and determined the criteria used to define target doses. Results Most dose investigation studies are clinical trials (83 of 97) that evaluate a single dosing rule. Sample sizes used to investigate dose are highly variable across programmes, with smaller numbers used in younger children (< 2 years). Many studies (40 of 97) do not pre-specify a target dose criterion. Of those that do, most (33 of 57 studies) guide decisions using pharmacokinetic data alone. Conclusions Common assumptions underlying dose investigation strategies include dose proportionality and similar exposure−response relationships in adults and children. Few development programmes pre-specify steps to verify assumptions in children. There is scope {{for the use of}} Bayesian methods as a framework for synthesizing existing information to quantify prior uncertainty about assumptions. This process can inform the design of optimal drug development strategies...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pharmaceutical {{industry}} {{is no longer}} allowed to develop new medicines for use in adults only, as the 2007 Paediatric Regulation requires children to be considered also. The plans for such paediatric development called Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs) are subject to agreement by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> (PDCO). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the key characteristics of oral paediatric medicines in the PIPs and the changes implemented as a result of the EMA/PDCO review. METHODS: All PIPs agreed by 31 December 2011 were identified through a proprietary EMA-database. PIPs were included if they contained an agreed proposal to develop an oral medicine for children 0 to 11 years. Information on the therapeutic area (EMA classification system); target age range (as defined by industry) and pharmaceutical characteristics (active substance, dosage form(s) as listed in the PIP, strength of each dosage form, excipients in each strength of each dosage form) was extracted from the EMA website or the EMA/PDCO assessment reports. RESULTS: A hundred and fifty PIPs were included corresponding to 16 therapeutic areas and 220 oral dosage forms in 431 strengths/compositions. Eighty-two PIPs (37 %) included tablets, 44 (20 %) liquids and 35 (16 %) dosage forms with a specific composition/strength that were stored as a solid but swallowed as a liquid e. g. dispersible tablets. The EMA/PDCO review resulted in an increase of 13 (207 to 220) oral paediatric dosage forms and 44 (387 to 431) dosage forms with a specific composition/strength. For many PIPs, the target age range was widened and the excipient composition and usability aspects modified. CONCLUSION: The EMA/PDCO review realized an increase in the number of requirements for the development of oral dosage forms and a larger increase in the number of dosage forms with a specific composition/strength, both targeting younger children. Changes to their pharmaceutical design were less profound...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Since 2007, it is {{mandatory}} for {{the pharmaceutical companies}} to submit a Paediatric Investigation Plan to the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> at the European Medicines Agency for any drug in development in adults, and it often leads {{to the need to}} conduct a pharmacokinetic study in children. Pharmacokinetic studies in children raise ethical and methodological issues. Because of limitation of sampling times, appropriate methods, such as the population approach, are necessary for analysis of the pharmacokinetic data. The choice of the pharmacokinetic sampling design has an important impact on the precision of population parameter estimates. Approaches for design evaluation and optimization based on the evaluation of the Fisher information matrix (M(F)) have been proposed and are now implemented in several software packages, such as PFIM in R. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this work were to (1) develop a joint population pharmacokinetic model to describe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug S and its active metabolite in children after intravenous drug administration from simulated plasma concentration-time data produced using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) predictions; (2) optimize the pharmacokinetic sampling times for an upcoming clinical study using a multi-response design approach, considering clinical constraints; and (3) evaluate the resulting design taking data below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) into account. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles were simulated in children using a PBPK model previously developed with the software SIMCYP(®) for the parent drug and its active metabolite. Data were analysed using non-linear mixed-effect models with the software NONMEM(®), using a joint model for the parent drug and its metabolite. The population pharmacokinetic design, for the future study in 82 children from 2 to 18 years old, each receiving a single dose of the drug, was then optimized using PFIM, assuming identical times for parent and metabolite concentration measurements and considering clinical constraints. Design evaluation was based on the relative standard errors (RSEs) of the parameters of interest. In the final evaluation of the proposed design, an approach was used to assess the possible effect of BLQ concentrations on the design efficiency. This approach consists of rescaling the M(F), using, at each sampling time, the probability of observing a concentration BLQ computed from Monte-Carlo simulations. RESULTS: A joint pharmacokinetic model with three compartments for the parent drug and one for its active metabolite, with random effects on four parameters, was used to fit the simulated PBPK concentration-time data. A combined error model best described the residual variability. Parameters and dose were expressed per kilogram of bodyweight. Reaching a compromise between PFIM results and clinical constraints, the optimal design was composed of four samples at 0. 1, 1. 8, 5 and 10 h after drug injection. This design predicted RSE lower than 30 % for the four parameters of interest. For this design, rescaling M(F) for BLQ data had very little influence on predicted RSE. CONCLUSION: PFIM was a useful tool to find an optimal sampling design in children, considering clinical constraints. Even if it was not forecasted initially by the investigators, this approach showed that it was really necessary to include a late sampling time for all children. Moreover, we described an approach to evaluate designs assuming expected proportions of BLQ data are omitted...|$|E
