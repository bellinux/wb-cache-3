50|$|Yale Law School (often {{referred}} to as Yale Law or YLS) is the law school of Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. Established in 1824, Yale Law offers the J.D., LL.M., J.S.D., M.S.L., and Ph.D. degrees in law. The school's small size and prestige make its admissions process the most selective of any law school in the United States. Whereas less than 1 in 10 applicants are offered admission, roughly 8 in 10 admits ultimately matriculate, which marks the best yield rate among the top U.S. law schools. Yale Law has been ranked the number one law {{school in the country}} by U.S. News and World Report every year since the magazine began <b>publishing</b> <b>law</b> school rankings. Widely considered to be the preeminent law school in the nation, {{it is one of the}} most prestigious law schools in the world.|$|E
40|$|The RION project (financed by BMBF) aims at {{improving}} Computer & Law (C&L) teaching in Germany while implementing Web-based media. For the fluid and interdisciplinary field of C&L, educational material is very scarce. Furthermore, educational cultures differ {{according to the}} divers affiliations of C&L. Therefore, the RION platform will present a variety of documents online, which have not been accessible an the Web before. However, <b>publishing</b> <b>law</b> collections online can only be one step to improve C&L teaching. Therefore, RION is {{trying to develop a}} didactical conception for the new platform, the main focus being an cooperative, practice-oriented learning and gender mainstreaming. Due to the diversity and the constraints given in the project, the RION team does not look for the "ideal platform", but instead tries to tailor promising elements of possible C&L online learning. In this text, the example of JurMOO, which we tested in C&L teaching, is used to demonstrate this...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} model of scholarly publishing uses the copyright {{system as a}} lever to induce commercial publishers and printers to disseminate the results of scholarly research. Recently, {{we have seen a}} number of high-profile experiments seeking to use one of a variety of forms of open access scholarly publishing to develop an alternative model. Critics have not quarreled with the goals of open access publishing; instead, they 2 ̆ 7 ve attacked the viability of the open access business model. If we are examining the economics of open access publishing, we shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t limit ourselves to the question whether open access journals have fielded a business model {{that would allow them to}} ape conventional journals in the information marketplace. We should be taking a broader look at who is paying what money (and comparable incentives) to whom, for what activity, and to what end. Are either conventional or open access journals likely to deliver what they 2 ̆ 7 re being paid for? Law journal publishing is one of the easiest cases for open access <b>publishing.</b> <b>Law</b> scholarship relies on few commercial publishers. The majority of law journals depend on unpaid students to undertake the selection and copy editing of articles. Nobody who participates in any way in the law journal article research, writing, selection, editing and publication process does so because of copyright incentives. Indeed, copyright is sufficiently irrelevant that legal scholars, the institutions that employ them and the journals that publish their research tolerate considerable uncertainty about who owns the copyright to the works in question, without engaging in serious efforts to resolve it. At the same time, the first-copy cost of law reviews is heavily subsidized by the academy to an extent that dwarfs both the mailing and printing costs that make up law journals 2 ̆ 7 chief budgeted expenditures and the subscription and royalty payments that account for their chief budgeted revenues. That subsidy, I argue, is an investment in the production and dissemination of legal scholarship, whose value is unambiguously enhanced by open access publishing...|$|E
