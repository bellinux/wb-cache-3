5|$|Foliot {{was mainly}} {{a force for}} {{moderation}} in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was <b>pointed</b> <b>and</b> effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of ad cautelam, which was {{an appeal to the}} papacy against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's tactic of ad cautelam was ridiculed by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.|$|E
5|$|Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) {{was hired}} for the film, having {{previously}} worked on Alien 3. ADI founders Tom Woodruff, Jr. and Alec Gillis also had {{experience working with}} Stan Winston on Aliens. ADI based their designs and modifications of the Alien creatures on the film's script, which included the creatures having pointed tails for swimming, making their head domes and chins more <b>pointed,</b> <b>and</b> establishing them to appear more vicious using techniques of camera angles and shot duration. After receiving the director's approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of teeth, uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type of teeth, found {{near the front of}} the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype is represented by the canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about twice the size of the other maxillary teeth), more <b>pointed,</b> <b>and</b> more constricted at the base. The second type of teeth, which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E

5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are <b>pointed</b> <b>and</b> very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have streamlined, {{spindle-shaped}} {{bodies with}} reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly {{shaped by the}} maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to be fewer in number (especially incisors and back molars), are <b>pointed</b> <b>and</b> cone-shaped, and lack carnassials. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as a pervasive militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most <b>pointed</b> <b>and</b> high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|The Atlantic torpedo has {{a nearly}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc 1.2 times {{as wide as}} it is long, with a thick and nearly straight front margin.

5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, <b>pointed,</b> <b>and</b> falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E
