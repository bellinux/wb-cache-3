40|$|Regenerative chatter is a {{self-excited}} vibration {{that can occur}} during milling, which shortens the lifetime of the tool and results in unacceptable surface quality. In this paper, an improved semidiscretization method for modeling and simulation with variable <b>pitch</b> and variable <b>helix</b> milling is proposed. Because the delay between each flute varies along the axial depth of the tool in milling, the cutting tool is discrete into some axial layers to simplify calculation. A comparison of the predicted and observed performance of variable <b>pitch</b> and variable <b>helix</b> against uniform <b>pitch</b> and uniform <b>helix</b> milling is presented. It is shown that variable <b>pitch</b> and variable <b>helix</b> milling can obtain larger stable cutting area than uniform <b>pitch</b> and uniform <b>helix</b> milling.

The convex combination of these three points is a point inside the triangle, and represents their center of effect (ce). This interior point, CM(0), represents the C major chord in the spiral array model. Similarly, keys may be constructed by the centers of effect of their I, IV, and V chords.|$|E

Five models of the three-dimensional finite element (0. 8 [*]mm pitch, 1. 6 [*]mm pitch, 2. 4 [*]mm pitch, double-threaded, and triple-threaded implants) in three types of bone were created using Pro/E, Hypermesh, and ABAQUS software. The study had three groups: Group 1, different pitches (Pitch Group); Group 2, same compactness but different helix angles (Angle Group); and Group 3, same helix angle but different compactness (Compact Group). Implant micromotion was assessed as the comprehensive relative displacement. We found that vertical relative displacement was affected by thread <b>pitch,</b> <b>helix</b> angle, and compactness. Under vertical loading, displacement {{was positively correlated with}} thread pitch and helix angle but negatively with compactness. Under horizontal loading in D 2, the influence of <b>pitch,</b> <b>helix</b> angle, and compactness on implant stability was limited; however, in D 3 and D 4, the influence of <b>pitch,</b> <b>helix</b> angle, and compactness on implant stability is increased.

40|$|We study {{mechanical}} vibrations in milling with non-uniform <b>pitch</b> {{and variable}} <b>helix</b> tools. The process is modeled by a periodic delay differential equation with distributed delay, which takes into account, for example, the nonlinear cutting force behavior, {{the effect of}} runout, and the exact delay distribution due to the unequally spaced flutes. We present a new method for {{the identification of the}} chatter stability lobes from the linearized system that is based on the multifrequency solution. We give detailed remarks on the truncation of the resulting infinite dimensional matrices and the efficient numerical implementation of the method. Cutting tests for steel milling with a customary end mill with non-uniform <b>pitch</b> and variable <b>helix</b> angle and a conventional end mill with uniform <b>pitch</b> and constant <b>helix</b> angle are performed. The numerical and experimental results coincide well. They reveal a significant increase of the limiting depth of cut for the variable helix tool compared to the conventional tool.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the {{external}} force, torque, temperature, confinement, and excluded volume interactions (EVIs) on the stability of the helical configuration of an intrinsically straight semiflexible biopolymer inside a cylindrical cell. We find that to stabilize a helix, the confinement from both ends of the cell is more effective than a uniaxial force. We show that under a uniaxial force and in absence of confinement from bottom of the cell, a stable helix is very short. Our results reveal that to maintain a low <b>pitch</b> <b>helix,</b> a torque acting {{at both ends of the}} filament is a necessity, and the confinement can reduce the required torque to less than half making it much easier to form a stable helix. Moreover, we find that thermal fluctuations and EVIs have little impact on the stability of a helix.

40|$|Proper tension {{maintenance}} in the cytoskeleton {{is essential}} for regulated cell polarity, cell motility, and division. Non-muscle myosin IIB (NMIIB) generates tension along actin filaments in many cell types, including neuronal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells. Using a three-bead optical trapping assay, we recorded NMIIB interactions with actin filaments {{to determine if a}} NMIIB dimer cycles along an actin filament in a processive manner. Our results show that NMIIB is the first myosin II to exhibit evidence of processive stepping behavior. Analysis of these data reveals a forward displacement of 5. 4 nm and, surprisingly, frequent backward steps of − 5. 9 nm. Processive stepping along the long <b>pitch</b> <b>helix</b> of actin may provide a mechanism for disassembly of fascin-actin bundles. Forward steps and detachment are weakly force-dependent at all forces, consistent with rate-limiting and force-dependent ADP release. However, backward steps are nearly force-independent.

40|$|The {{ductility}} of HSC beams {{is enhanced}} {{through the application}} of helical reinforcement located in the compression region of the beams. The diameter and pitch of helix are important parameters controlling the level of ductility enhancement of over reinforced high strength concrete beams. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the effect of helix pitch and diameter on the beam behaviour through testing 10 helically confined full scale beams. Two groups of five beams each had exactly the same geometry and reinforcement; with the only differences being the diameter and pitch of the helices. For one group the helix was made of 8 mm diameter bars and the second of 12 mm diameter bars. The helix pitches were 25, 50, 75, 100 and 160 mm. Beams’ cross section was 200 x 300 mm, with a length of 4 m and a clear span 3. 6 m subjected to four point loading, with emphasis placed on the mid-span deflection. The main results indicate that the helical effectiveness is negligible when the helical pitch is 160 mm (helix diameter) and the displacement ductility index increases as the helical pitch decreases. Finally, considerable displacement ductility is revealed for beams confined with 25 mm <b>pitch</b> <b>helix</b> in both the 8 mm and 12 mm helix bar diameter...|$|E
40|$|The {{recording}} of polarization gratings in films of a cholesteric liquid crystalline polymer with different <b>helix</b> <b>pitch</b> was studied in detail. For this purpose, the cholesteric {{mixture of the}} nematic azobenzene-containing copolymer with a chiral-photochromic dopant was prepared. The utilization of such mixture has made possible to realize dual optical photorecording in one system, first due to the phototuning of the <b>helix</b> <b>pitch</b> by UV light and second the polarization grating recording process by exposure with polarized visible light. The diffraction efficiency strongly depends on the cholesteric <b>helix</b> <b>pitch</b> and films thickness: the increase of the confinement ratio d/p (where d, film thickness; p, <b>helix</b> <b>pitch)</b> results in growth of the diffraction efficiency. Comparison of the induction of polarization gratings in cholesteric, nematic (copolymer without chiral dopant), and amorphous (nonannealed) cholesteric films revealed that only the cholesteric films were characterized by significant oscillations in the diffraction efficiency signal {{as well as by}} the presence of the maximum in the first-order diffraction efficiency in the initial stage of the grating recording process. It was found that in addition to the polarization grating surface relief gratings (SRGs) were also formed in the studied systems, however, the amplitude of the SRG inscribed in the cholesteric films was lower (approximate to 20 nm) compared to the grating amplitude obtained in nematic films (approximate to 60 nm). Moreover, increasing <b>helix</b> <b>pitch</b> resulted in a decrease of the SRG amplitude.

Frank energy stability A similar result using the method of Frank energy stability in the twist of cholesteric liquid crystal was given by Kiselev and Sluckin [PRE 71 (2005) ], where the free twist number determines the equilibrium value of the cholesteric liquid crystals (CLC) pitch of the helix.

Results were compared to smooth copper-nickel tubes. Steam at about 21 kPa (3 psia) was condensed on the outside surface of each enhanced tube, horizontally mounted {{in the center of}} a dummy tube bank. Each tube was cooled on the inside by water at velocities of 2. 7 to 7. 6 m/sec (3 to 25 ft/sec). The overall heat transfer coefficient was determined from experimental data. The inside heat transfer coefficients were determined using the Wilson plot technique. Friction factor in the enhanced section was determined from the cooling water pressure drop. Enhanced geometries (utilizing <b>pitch,</b> <b>helix</b> angle and groove depth) were found to improve the corrected overall heat transfer coefficient by as much as 2 times that for smooth tubes.

In the filaments the monomers are strongly connected along the genetic helix with weaker connections following the long <b>pitch</b> <b>helix.</b> The long axis of the monomer lies roughly perpendicular to the filament axis.

By comparing maps from decorated thin filaments with those from decorated actin, we demonstrate that tropomyosin is bound to the inner domain of actin {{just in front of the}} myosin binding site at a radius of approximately 40 A. A small change in the azimuthal position of tropomyosin, as has been suggested by others to occur during Ca 2 +- mediated regulation in vertebrate striated muscle, appears to be insufficient to eclipse totally the major site of interaction between actin and myosin...|$|E

40|$|Regenerative chatter is a {{self-excited}} vibration {{that can occur}} during milling and other machining processes. It leads to a poor surface finish, premature tool wear, and potential damage to the machine or tool. Variable <b>pitch</b> and variable <b>helix</b> milling tools have been previously proposed to avoid the onset of regenerative chatter. Although variable pitch tools have been considered in some detail in previous research, this has generally focussed on behaviour at high radial immersions. In contrast there has been very little work focussed on predicting the stability of variable helix tools. In the present study, three solution processes are proposed for predicting the stability of variable <b>pitch</b> or <b>helix</b> milling tools. The first is a semi-discretisation formulation that performs spatial and temporal discretisation of the tool. Unlike previously published methods this can predict the stability of variable <b>pitch</b> or variable <b>helix</b> tools, at low or high radial immersions. The second is a time-averaged semi-discretisation formulation that assumes time-averaged cutting force coefficients. Unlike previous work, this can predict stability of variable helix tools at high radial immersion. The third is a temporal-finite element formulation that can predict the stability of variable pitch tools with a constant uniform helix angle, at low radial immersion. The model predictions are compared to previously published work on variable pitch tools, along with time-domain model simulations. Good agreement is found with both previously published results and the time-domain model. Furthermore, cyclic-fold bifurcations were found to exist for both variable <b>pitch</b> and variable <b>helix</b> tools at lower radial immersions...|$|R
40|$|Background in psychophysics. Psychophysical {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} the human brain has a natural preference for harmonic sounds and relationships between musical tones. Even naïve listeners are able to distinguish harmonic from inharmonic musical intervals and, under many conditions, the pitches of octaves are confused even though their fundamental frequency differs by a factor of two. Our psychophysical investigations in Mongolian gerbils have shown that animals can also learn to differentiate musical intervals. Background in neurophysiology. In order to understand pitch perception and the neuronal basis of harmonicity, we have to understand how neurons in the central auditory system process acoustic signals. It has been demonstrated that temporal processing mechanisms in the auditory brainstem are essential for these fundamental aspects of musical perception. Neurophysiological {{experiments have}} revealed that the periodicity of signal envelopes is crucial for the perception of pitch. Neuronal representations of envelope periods, which reflect the superposition of partials of harmonic sounds in the cochlea, are analysed by temporal correlation mechanisms in the central auditory system. These mechanisms also include processing of resolved partials. Aims. In this paper we attempt to explain pitch perception and our preference for harmonic sounds {{on the basis of the}} temporal neuronal analysis and the spatial representation of pitch information in the brain. Conclusions. As a result of cochlear analysis, frequency is mapped along a tonotopic axis in all auditory brain areas. Similarly, as a result of temporal analysis, periodicity is mapped from the midbrain to the auditory cortex. In each case, tonotopic and periodotopic axes are orthogonal to each other. One may say that spectral information, as an important aspect of timbre, is mapped along a first neural axis, periodicity (pitch) is mapped along the second neural axis of the auditory system. Finally, as a result of temporal analysis, neurons in the auditory midbrain show preferences for harmonically related sounds. The major function of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), which seems to have a structure reminiscent of the <b>pitch</b> <b>helix</b> of music psychology, appears to be to control and suppress these harmonic responses. ...|$|E
40|$|Antenna {{design has}} grown more {{stringent}} and difficult {{over the years}} as the world becomes strictly a wireless environment. The inherent tradeoffs that exist between gain, radiation pattern, bandwidth, and physical size and the multiple parameters that must be considered make antenna design a lengthy and tedious process. Methods have been devised which automate this complex process of antenna optimization through the use of genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. Genetic algorithms are capable of handling a large number of design parameters and work for optimization problems that have discontinuous or non-differentiable multi-dimensional solution spaces, making them ideal for antenna optimization. In the present work, a genetic algorithm has been used for size reduction in microstrip patch antennas and design tradeoff optimization between beamwidth and gain in helical antennas. A method for reducing the size of microstrip patch antennas by up to 75 % by removing rectangular and circular slots from the metal of the microstrip patch is presented. A solid patch antenna that resonates at 10 GHz is forced to resonant at 6 GHz through the removal of the different shaped slots. Given the number and shape of the slots, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the size and location of the slot on the patch. The designs are obtained by interfacing the genetic algorithm and Ansoft High Frequency System Simulator (HFSS) and validated through design, construction, and testing. High gain, with broad half-power beamwidths (HPBW) is traditionally extremely difficult to achieve due to the inherent tradeoff between the two. A genetic algorithm has been applied to design a helical antenna with a gain of 10 dB and HPBWs of 60 degrees. In order to achieve this, three physical parameters of the helix have been changed, namely the <b>pitch,</b> <b>helix</b> radius, and the ground plane geometry. The second objective is to create an antenna that displays different HPBWs in the two radiation planes. This could be extremely useful in many communication environments and there is yet no existing method to achieve this. The genetic algorithm produced a helical antenna that shows a 19 degrees difference in HPBW between the two radiation planes, while still displaying a 7 dB gain and low side lobes. Numerical Electromagnetic Code 4 (NEC 4) is used, and a method of communication between MATLAB and NEC 4 has been developed to make the genetic algorithm optimization possible...|$|E
