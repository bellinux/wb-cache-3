5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and <b>Planetary</b> <b>Camera</b> 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation.

The response of the facsimile camera, which was selected for the Viking lander missions to Mars, to a radiant point source is formulated and shown to result in a statistical rather than deterministic signal.

The probability of detecting the resultant statistical signals in photosensor and preamplifier noise and the associated probability of false alarms are also determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{rotational}} {{state of}} a planet or satellite bears crucial physical information on the body's dynamical evolution and deep internal structure. For planets or satellites in a Cassini state the obliquity (the angle between the rotational and orbital angular momentum) and physical librations, combined with the measurement of the second degree coefficients of the gravity field, could provide {{the value of the}} moments of inertia and reveal the existence of a fluid core (as in the case of Mercury). As ground measurements by means of radar or optical observations are usually not sufficiently accurate and long-life landers have rarely been available, one must rely on orbiting spacecraft for building a body-fixed frame and linking it to a celestial inertial frame. This paper presents a method for estimating the obliquity by comparing image pairs of surface landmarks, taken by an orbiter at different positions along the body's orbit. The algorithm estimates the vectorial angular velocity, thus providing a body-fixed reference frame. While optical imaging is preferred due to the high angular resolution of <b>planetary</b> <b>cameras,</b> for bodies with a thick atmosphere one has to rely on SAR data. This work presents the result of the estimation of Titan's obliquity and length of day using a combination of SAR imaging of surface landmarks and precise spacecraft positioning of the Cassini spacecraft. We show that the Cassini data provide the pole position and length of day with an accuracy suitable for geophysical interpretation. The main results are a non-synchronous rotation and a pole position compatible with the occupancy of a Cassini state...|$|R

5|$|Tau Ceti {{has been}} a target of a radial {{velocity}} planetary searches. As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever-more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11m/s measured over a five-year time span. This result excludes the presence of hot Jupiters, and probably excludes any planets with minimum mass {{greater than or equal}} to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and <b>Planetary</b> <b>Camera</b> was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's resolving power.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the launch}} of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) the {{secondary}} mirror of the telescope has been moved several times in order to collimate the telescope and also to define a position of best focus. In addition to these moves the focus position changes over time because of water desorption by the graphite epoxy in the metering truss. The authors report here the focus history of the telescope based on a knowledge of the mirror moves made and an analysis of desorption monitoring data obtained by the Faint Object Camera (FOC) in the F/ 96 mode and of the routine calibration data obtained by the Wide Field and <b>Planetary</b> <b>Cameras.</b> Focus values are extracted using two different methods. In the first method the distance between the center of the point spread function (PSF) and the shadows of the pads supporting the HST primary mirror are related to the focus error. In the second method an analytical formula for the PSF with variable aberration coefficients is fitted to the data. Focus positions derived from the two methods show good agreement. The data show that a desorption of about 83 microns has taken place since Aug. 16, 1990. The desorption has clearly not leveled off as expected from the trend of the earlier data. Long term variations of the secondary mirror position of approximately 3 - 15 microns from the 'best' focus position have been observed. Variations of the order of 2 - 5 microns over an orbital period have also been noted. Focus changes resulting from secondary mirror movements greater than approximately 5 microns changes the point spread function significantly and makes deconvolution and quantitative measurements difficult...|$|R

500|$|Because {{of the way}} the HST's {{instruments}} were designed, two different sets of correctors were required. The design of the Wide Field and <b>Planetary</b> <b>Camera</b> 2, already planned to replace the existing WF/PC, included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate charge-coupled device (CCD) chips making up its two cameras. [...] An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way, and so required an external correction device.|$|E

WF/PC was a high-resolution {{imaging device}} primarily intended for optical observations. It {{was built by}} NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and incorporated a set of 48 filters isolating spectral lines of particular astrophysical interest.

500|$|Following the crew's wake up, {{they set}} to work {{preparing}} for the mission's first spacewalk. Grunsfeld and Feustel suited up {{with the assistance of}} their EVA counterparts, Massimino and Good, and the spacewalk officially began when the two switched their suits to battery power at 12:52 UTC. At the start of the spacewalk, Feustel provided managers on the ground with a visual inspection report on the particulate matter seen earlier around the WFC3 box, reporting to the ground team that [...] "I don't really see any of those particles...It's almost imperceivable. I can see some few particles {{on the front of the}} W-SIPE, little, whitish, grey looking, real small. It's low density, too." [...] After getting their tools and equipment for the EVA set up, Grunsfeld and Feustel removed the old Wide Field and <b>Planetary</b> <b>Camera</b> 2, which was installed in 1993 during the telescope's first servicing mission, and replaced it with the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Feustel initially had trouble removing the bolts from the old camera, which after over fifteen years in space required more torque to remove than expected. After multiple attempts, managers on the ground decided to have Grunsfeld get a contingency torque limiter from the airlock, which would allow Feustel to apply more force without exceeding a specific point, but the bolt would still not release. The concern was that the bolt would shear, and the camera would be unable to be removed should that happened. Finally, managers approved Feustel to remove the limiter, and apply as much force as he safely thought it would take to release the bolt, which was successful.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-weight stereo <b>camera</b> concept for <b>planetary</b> exploration. The <b>camera</b> uses three CCD lines within the image plane of one single objective. Some {{of the main}} features of the camera include: focal length- 90 mm, FOV- 18. 5 deg, IFOV- 78 (mu) rad, convergence angles-(+/-) 10 deg, radiometric dynamics- 14 bit, weight- 2 kg, and power consumption- 12. 5 Watts. From an orbit altitude of 250 km the ground pixel size is 20 m x 20 m and the swath width is 82 km. The CCD line data is buffered in the camera internal mass memory of 1 Gbit. After performing radiometric correction and application-dependent preprocessing the data is compressed and ready for downlink. Due to the aggressive application of advanced technologies {{in the area of}} microelectronics and innovative optics, the low mass and power budgets of 2 kg and 12. 5 Watts is achieved, while still maintaining high performance. The design of the proposed light-weight camera is also general purpose enough to be applicable to other planetary missions such as the exploration of Mars, Mercury, and the Moon. Moreover, it is an example of excellent international collaboration on advanced technology concepts developed at DLR, Germany, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, USA...|$|R

The observations will be made on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula monitoring the post-peak activity of the Perseids during a one-week period around the August New Moon (14 th to 21 st). Two SPOSH cameras will be deployed in two remote sites in high altitudes for the triangulation of meteor trajectories captured at both stations simultaneously. The observations during this time interval will give us the possibility to study the poorly-observed postmaximum branch of the Perseid stream and compare the results with datasets from previous campaigns which covered different periods of this long-lived meteor shower. The acquired data will be processed using dedicated software for meteor data reduction developed at TUB and DLR. Assuming a successful campaign, statistics, trajectories and photometric properties of the processed double-station meteors will be presented at the conference.
