5|$|Maynard James Keenan (born James Herbert Keenan; April 17, 1964), often {{referred}} to by his initials MJK, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, actor, and winemaker. He {{is best known as}} the vocalist for the rock bands Tool, A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle,</b> and Puscifer.|$|E
5|$|The discography of American {{alternative}} rock supergroup A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle</b> {{consists of}} three studio albums, two compilation albums, one extended play, one video album, nine singles, one promotional single and ten music videos. A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle</b> {{is the brainchild of}} Billy Howerdel. After hearing demos of Howerdel's music, Maynard James Keenan, the lead singer of Tool, offered his services as vocalist. Howerdel agreed, and the band formed in 1999. They were then joined by bassist/violinist Paz Lenchantin, guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, formerly of Failure, and drummer Tim Alexander, formerly of Primus. Soon after entering the studio to record their first album, Alexander was replaced by Josh Freese of The Vandals. Mer de Noms was released in May 2000, selling 188,000 copies its debut week. The band embarked on a number of headlining tours {{all over the world to}} promote the album which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) one month after its release, and platinum just four months later.|$|E
5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a <b>perfect</b> <b>circle,</b> but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E

5|$|The band's 2009 summer tour {{began on}} July 18 in Commerce City, Colorado, at the Mile High Music Festival. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and {{a show on}} August 22 for the Epicenter Festival in Pomona, California. Their Tool Winter Tour played dates across the U.S. and Canada in January and February 2012. The band played at Ozzfest Japan on May 12, 2013. Meanwhile, Tool members have pursued their own musical projects. Keenan has toured {{extensively}} with Puscifer, which he describes as involving a series of musical ideas {{he did not have}} an opportunity to explore with Tool or A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Activity began {{slowing down}} for the band by late 2000, with Keenan {{returning}} to Tool to finish the recording {{of what would be}} their next album, Lateralus. Keenan returned to A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle</b> to tour from January to March 2001, until returning to Tool again for the rest of 2001 to release and tour in support of Lateralus. Initial plans were for Howerdel to collaborate long-distance on writing new A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle</b> material with Keenan while he toured with Tool, by sending ideas back and forth to one another, though Keenan found it too difficult to balance both, eventually lessening his role while he focused on Tool. Efforts continued through mid-2002, with Howerdel primarily focusing on writing new material while sporadically working with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese. By June 2002, Van Leeuwen estimated that about 80% of the instrumental material was completed while they waited for Keenan's return. However, lineup changes and disagreements on the album's direction would lead to the album not being released for over a year. Both Lenchantin and VanLeeuwen had both been working on solo material during the band's downtime, and then moved on to join other bands. Lenchantin would leave to join Billy Corgan's new start-up band Zwan in April 2002, while Van Leeuwen began touring Queens of the Stone Age shortly after. Ex-Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White, formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez, replaced Lenchantin on bass in January 2003. Shortly after, VanLeeuwen permanently left the band, and long-time band collaborator Danny Lohner filled in temporarily as the second guitarist for wrapping up the album.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} December 2008, Keenan had {{mentioned}} that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new material for A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle,</b> although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of {{the view of the}} public through mid-2010. On September 2010, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums - Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive - notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material {{was in a state of}} flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle</b> material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.|$|E

5|$|Auf der Maur {{promoted}} the album with an almost-constant tour across Europe, the United Kingdom and North America during 2004. The seven-leg tour commenced on January 30, 2004 and concluded on December 4. The 151-date tour included support from A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle,</b> Mínus, The Living Things, The Offspring, The Polyphonic Spree, The Von Bondies, Matthew Good and H.I.M. amongst others. During the tour, Auf der Maur performed at various summer festivals including Curiosa in the United States, Pukkelpop in Belgium, Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands, Reading Festival, Leeds Festival in the United Kingdom, and Independents Day Festival in Italy. During the entire tour, Auf der Maur published photography from the shows on her official web site.|$|E
5|$|Triton and Nereid are unusual {{irregular}} {{satellites and}} are thus treated separately from the other five irregular Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets. Firstly, they are the largest two known irregular moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost {{an order of magnitude}} larger than all other known irregular moons. Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's being over an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid {{has one of the most}} eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton's orbit is a nearly <b>perfect</b> <b>circle.</b> Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly <b>perfect</b> <b>circle</b> with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E
50|$|Lohner can {{frequently}} {{be found}} contributing to movie scores with fellow Nothing Records alumni Charlie Clouser and Clint Mansell. Additionally, he does remixes for various artists under the pseudonym Renholdër (an in-joke anagram of Re: D. Lohner). This {{began as a}} result of the song of the same title, which appeared on A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle's</b> debut album Mer de Noms. Contrary to popular belief, Lohner did not work on this song but was later told by guitarist Billy Howerdel that the song was about him. He has appeared in all of A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle's</b> albums to date in one form or another and has also appeared on stage with the band.|$|R
50|$|The geocentric and {{geodetic}} longitude {{have the}} same value. This {{is true for the}} Earth and other similar shaped planets because their latitude lines (parallels) can be considered in much more degree <b>perfect</b> <b>circles</b> when compared to their longitude lines (meridians).|$|R
50|$|The first {{planetary}} model {{without any}} epicycles {{was that of}} Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) in 12th century Andalusian Spain, but epicycles were not eliminated in Europe until the 17th century, when Johannes Kepler's model of elliptical orbits gradually replaced Copernicus' model based on <b>perfect</b> <b>circles.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Finally in 2005, an extended-play CD single (44 minutes) was released, {{featuring}} two tracks from forthcoming studio album plus {{a version}} of A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle's</b> [...] "Weak & Powerless" [...] and four tracks from Mastermind's extensive concert repertoire recorded live in the studio in 2005.|$|R
40|$|Many artifacts, such as wheel-produced ceramics, are {{intended}} to be axially symmetric.

25|$|Jeordie White {{was invited}} to return to play with A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle</b> for their Fall and Winter 2010 Tour in North America, which sold out on all 14 dates scheduled, and {{continued}} to play with them until at least 2011.|$|E
25|$|The stone circle {{consists}} of thirteen stones {{and has a}} diameter of 11.4 metres. The stone circle is not a <b>perfect</b> <b>circle,</b> but is a ring with a flattened east side (13.4 metres north-south by 12 metres east-west). The stones have an average height of three metres. The ring covers an area of 124 square metres. This is quite small compared to similar circles, including the nearby Callanish II which is 2.5 times as large.|$|E
25|$|During this hiatus, Alexander {{released}} two albums {{with the}} band Laundry and performed with Blue Man Group, A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle,</b> and Born Naked, among others. Claypool explored the jam band scene with Oysterhead (featuring friend Trey Anastasio of Phish and Stewart Copeland of the Police) and his own Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade (featuring both Huth and Lane). He also collaborated with Brain, Buckethead and Bernie Worrell in the group Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains.|$|E
60|$|The circle broke--as {{all such}} <b>perfect</b> <b>circles</b> of levity must break-- and sent its author, Michael, flying, as by {{centrifugal}} force, far away {{against the blue}} rails of the gate.

500|$|Keenan {{has a son}} named Devo H. Keenan (born 1995) {{who sang}} backing vocals on A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle's</b> Thirteenth Step, and was later {{credited}} as the cellist on Ashes Divide's Keep Telling Myself It's Alright. He also gave a solo cello performance for Keenan's 50th birthday celebration concert, [...] "Cinquanta".|$|R
5000|$|Heads are not <b>perfect</b> <b>circles,</b> {{and they}} are not perfect ovals either. You can think of them as kind of egg-shaped, with the tapered end toward the bottom.

25|$|After departing the band, {{he played}} two live shows with California punk metal band Mondo Generator, and auditioned {{for the role}} of second guitar in Queens of the Stone Age, which he lost to Troy Van Leeuwen of A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle.</b> He also auditioned for a spot as bass player (after Jason Newsted's departure) in Metallica, but lost out to former Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bassist Robert Trujillo, which is {{documented}} briefly in their film, Some Kind of Monster.|$|E
25|$|Arizona {{also has}} many singers and other musicians. Singer, {{songwriter}} and guitarist Michelle Branch is from Sedona. The late Chester Bennington, the former lead vocalist of Linkin Park, and mash-up artist DJ Z-Trip are both from Phoenix. One of Arizona's better known musicians is shock rocker Alice Cooper, who helped define the genre. Maynard James Keenan, {{the lead singer}} of the bands Tool, A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle,</b> and Puscifer, calls the town of Cornville his current home.|$|E
25|$|The True Poets of Zwan, {{commonly}} {{known simply as}} Zwan, was an American alternative rock supergroup that was formed by members of The Smashing Pumpkins, Slint, Tortoise, Chavez, and A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Circle.</b> Zwan was formed in late 2001 by Billy Corgan, lead singer and guitarist of the Smashing Pumpkins after they disbanded in December 2000. The band released only one album, Mary Star of the Sea, in 2003, before breaking up acrimoniously that same year during their world tour to promote the album.|$|E
