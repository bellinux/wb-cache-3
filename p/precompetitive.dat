40|$|Motivation Traditionally, {{conflicts}} {{between public and}} corporate collaborators concern aspects of confidentiality, publishing, intellectual property rights (IPRs) and ownership 1. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are knowledge-based relationships; hence the management of intellectual property (IP) is of critical importance. The initial knowledge of each partner brought in the partnership, i. e. the background IP, is a crucial starting point for collaboration. Further, {{the management of the}} knowledge created by the partnership throughout the project, i. e. foreground IP, depends on many practical decisions, such as whether or not an idea is protected, where the IP protection is pursued, how exclusive rights are deployed, by whom and for which purpose 2. The different expectations of and approach to IP by the various stakeholders must be taken into account. The need is high for stakeholders to work together, get rid of unrealistic, outmoded and conflicting expectations of IP from multiple stakeholders 1; 3. There is a lot of uncertainty about the approach towards IP management. The optimal model for promoting innovation with respect IPRs of the collaborators has not been defined yet 3. In-depth insights in the impact of various IPRs rules applied in PPPs, is urgently needed. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate to what extent IPR rules vary across (<b>precompetitive)</b> PPPs. This study will serve to further explore the impact of the variation of various IPR rules in order to develop best practices for further optimizing collaborative efforts and to engage stakeholders in sharing objectives and develop common approaches to address the aspects of IP 3; 4. Research questions 1) To which extent do IPR rules vary across <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs? 2) What is the impact of the variation of IPR rules across <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs? Research methodology Comparative analysis of IPRs documents (IP policies, IP guidelines, IP principles and Grant Agreements/Project Agreements templates) related to <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs. Abstract The pharmaceutical sector faces major challenges in the discovery and development of new drugs and therapies. New approaches and insights with respect to novel or existing compounds are hardly needed. Based on the principle that knowledge development is enhanced through sharing of ideas and resources, R&D projects at the <b>precompetitive</b> level are increasingly conducted in public-private partnerships (PPPs). Such <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs are presented through multifaceted partnering models and reflect heterogeneity of partners with different, often conflicting objectives and cultures. It is not surprising that intellectual property rights (IPRs), so crucial in pharmaceutical R&D, play a pivotal role in safeguarding partner’s interests, and that IPRs and trust issues take a crucial part of the negotiation process 5 - 12. The open nature of the so-called <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs complicates agreements with respect to IPRs. The empirical study identifies IPRs concepts used in life sciences <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs and explores the variation of those concepts across <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs. IPRs principles, policies, guidelines, grant agreements and project agreements of 19 <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs have been analyzed. Key concepts such as background IPRs, foreground IPRs, (co-) ownership, access rights and IPRs management are compared. Some <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs allow a certain degree of flexibility during negotiations on IPRs whereas others require partners to stick clearly at restrictive contractually defined IPRs. The executive office of a <b>precompetitive</b> PPP can be an intermediary, but in a few cases it has an active role as partner with equal rights in terms of ownership. Ownership of background IPRs remains with the original owner in 8 of the PPPs investigated. The other PPPs did not include specific guidance on the ownership rights to background IPRs. In terms of foreground IPRs, 8 PPPs assign ownership of new inventions to the idea generator(s), 3 PPPs claim foreground ownership and in 1 case, the partners and the PPP are co-owners of foreground IP. The rules on access rights to background IPRs vary between royalty-free access versus access on ‘fair and reasonable conditions’. Access rights to foreground IPRs cover much more possibilities. The IPRs management is heavily context specific; there is no ‘one size fits all’. In <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs, some projects are only focused on training, education and basic information sharing, whereas other projects are aimed at evolving towards a proof-of-concept stage, wherein access to background IPRs and development of foreground IPRs can implicate the progression of the process. Depending on the scope, the objectives and expected outcome of the project, certain project agreements require very clear and upfront specified grant IPRs clauses, whereas other projects may include more general grant IPRs clauses, leaving room for possible IPRs negotiations further in the project development. For <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs acting as information sharing platforms, flexibility in the IPRs policy might be of key importance 12; 13. A stepwise approach whereby open source templates guide initial knowledge exchange, followed by a ‘closure’ step after which IPRs could be contractually defined once the project becomes more specific, could increase trust and clear early IPRs issues, offering beneficial solutions for both public and private stakeholders. status: accepte...|$|E

Results revealed that {{on the night before}} competition athletes slept well under the recommended target of eight hours of sleep for healthy adults, with almost 70 % of athletes experiencing poorer sleep than usual. It was found that anxiety, noise, the need to use the bathroom and early event times were amongst the most commonly reported causes of disrupted sleep in athletes on the night prior to competition. The negative moods of fatigue and tension were both significantly negatively correlated with <b>precompetitive</b> relative sleep quality (r = − 0. 28, P = 0. 004, r = − 0. 21, P = 0. 030, respectively) and total sleep time (r = − 0. 23, P = 0. 023, r = − 0. 20, P = 0. 044, respectively). Additionally, tension was positively correlated with number of awakenings (r = − 0. 20, P = 0. 045). Vigour was seen to be significantly positively associated with relative sleep quality (r = 0. 24, P= 0. 013). The relationships between relative sleep quality and fatigue, tension and vigour accounted for approximately 4 − 5 % of the variance in mood scores. Disrupted sleep did not demonstrate any significant relationship with relative sporting performance.

PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine <b>precompetitive</b> and competitive nutritional intake and anxiety levels of collegiate softball athletes and to compare athletes’ nutritional intake to the current sport nutrition recommendations. METHODS: Twenty division III college-level softball players recorded their food intake on the day before a game (<b>precompetitive)</b> and on the day of that game (competitive). From these records total caloric and macronutrient intake were determined using nutritional analysis software. On both days each participant used biofeedback equipment for one 3 -minute session to determine time spent on three levels of coherence.

40|$|The Ph. D. project {{assesses the}} role of {{intellectual}} property (IP) in (<b>precompetitive)</b> Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the biomedical sector. Biopharmaceutical enterprises face major challenges, such as increased competition, falling research and development (R&D) budgets, increasing regulatory hurdles, accelerating technological complexity, future patent cliffs, and declining number of promising projects in their drug pipelines. Interdisciplinary, translational research for drug development requires collaboration between stakeholders from industry and academia. A shared objective is to translate basic biological research into therapies serving patients. Industry realizes the potential of combining different ideas, skills, and expertise in technologically demanding areas and is increasingly tapping into early-phase research conducted at universities and {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} specializing in biotechnology (biotech SMEs). In addition, sharing knowledge with competitors at the precompetitive—and even at a competitive—stage is increasingly considered to be both relevant and viable. Taking into account the multifaceted partnering model of (<b>precompetitive)</b> PPPs and the heterogeneity of partners—including their often conflicting missions, objectives, and cultures—it is not surprising that IP plays a pivotal role and that IP and trust issues are part of the negotiation process. The general introduction of the Ph. D. project provides an overview of the pharmaceutical market and the strategic redirection of pharmaceutical firms towards collaboration. The general introduction further provides a background on the wider legal framework wherein PPPs operate (e. g. competition law), particularly the various IPRS that come into play when discussing <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs. An overview of what IPRS are is given: the concept of IP, the different forms of IP protection, as well as the rights attached to the IP. In biomedical projects, different types of IP protection can be sought, depending on the intellectual creation. The most common type of IPRs protection for inventions is patents, but also other forms of IP protection are used, such as copyright, sui generis database rights or protection of trade secrets. Part 2 explains the concept of life science R&D <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs. <b>Precompetitive</b> PPPs can help speed up the drug-development process by stimulating competitors to collaborate in the pre-discovery phase. The <b>precompetitive</b> PPP model is situated in the upstream research phase of the drug development cycle, and the characteristics of such model differ from the PPPs situated further in the downstream development process, such as Product Development PPPs and Product Access PPPs. <b>Precompetitive</b> PPPs aim to solve basic research questions and to generate technology platforms, research tools, and predictive models to advance knowledge about disease pathways. Such activities precede the market exploitation phase and offer opportunities to reduce throughput time and risks associated with such predevelopment phases. Part 3 investigates the difference in stakeholders’ motives for participation, their expectations and objectives. It is important to emphasize that the motives for participation and the expectations of different stakeholder groups differ. It was shown that various stakeholders, such as academia and SMEs, are reluctant regarding Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in PPPs and that IPRS management could pose a hurdle for participation. The question of IP will likely remain a matter of debate, and the success of PPPs depends on the attitude and expertise of the participants. Instead of considering <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs as collaborative models, wherein exclusive rights are offered at bargain prices, stakeholders need to become aware that the value of <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs lies in the opportunity to scout for and network with the best scientists. Collaboration will {{be the only way to}} generate valuable knowledge. In Part 4, an analysis of Intellectual Property (IP) policies deployed within <b>precompetitive</b> biomedical PPPs revealed a variety of practices. IP frameworks differ in terms of openness (access/use) as well as explicitness. Depending on the nature of the research and the feasibility of an appropriation oriented (business) strategy, the type of IP framework or ‘knowledge sharing strategy’ differs. PPPs wherein downstream research results (drugs and diagnostic tests) are the primary focus opt for an IP sharing strategy wherein access to foreground IPRS and freedom-to-operate are permission constrained and preferably negotiated with the consortium partners only (Partnership-focused strategy). PPPs wherein upstream research results (research tools and platform technologies) or poverty-related and neglected diseases (PRNDs) specific downstream products are focused are more likely to adopt an IP framework that allows sharing IPRS with a broad research community (Open Collaboration strategy). Hybrid strategies, with preferred public release of research results unless patenting is necessary to secure market access or to engage the commercial partner towards further investments, become deployed when either model is sufficient to proceed the project. As both models imply benefits and drawbacks, we argue for a contingency perspective rather than a ‘one best way’ of organizing IP within PPPs. A second level of variation pertains to the explicitness or clarity of the IP policies. The majority of the IP policies lacks basic information on IP concepts such as definitions of background IP and foreground IP, and rules on ownership thereof, access thereto and use thereof. Even when knowledge is shared in the broadest possible way, IP, access and user rights need to be addressed explicitly in order to proceed effectively. Transparency and clear guidelines for IP management are crucial for trust creation amongst the partners in the consortium. Part 5 provides an overview of the practice of IP management in <b>precompetitive</b> PPP projects. Six Case Studies were performed at the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), world’s largest biomedical PPP: project outputs and outcomes, with a focus on IP and business opportunities of six consortia were analyzed. It was demonstrated that in early-phase research, patent applications are not the main source of IPRS outcomes. The six Case Studies have revealed that besides foreground IP and business opportunities, many other extremely valuable assets were developed. The consortium partners developed unique scientific and managerial insights. For the pharmaceutical companies to share non-confidential, and more importantly, and new to the sector, confidential data with consortium partners, which are considered future competitors, valuable tools were developed to guarantee interoperability between partners. They established experiences in knowledge transfer, construed databases, adopted diverse templates, knowledge sharing mechanisms, trust-based agreements and models, applicable bilaterally, within and between consortia as a whole. Such assets offer an enormous potential for new consortia, for the IMI itself, as well as for regulatory, clinical and healthcare practices in general aimed at accelerating the delivery of improved therapy to society. The mindset within the consortia reflects an open attitude towards sharing between profit and non-profit institutes to speed up innovation and eventually market access. Inter-IMI project collaborations having certain degrees of synergy create opportunities for future value creation and have the potential to extend IMI’s projects deliverables. To maximize IMI’s long term impact and treasure those valuable results, time has come to design means for optimal exploitation of the different types of assets, and to guarantee the sustainability of research tools and databases generated. To conclude, a general discussion and recommendations for sustainable <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs are provided in Part 6 of the Ph. D. project. It is recommended for biomedical (<b>precompetitive)</b> PPPs to optimize their functioning to 1) foster IP as a tool for collaboration in PPPs, not as the centerpiece of the partnership, 2) consider <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs as a scouting platform for future collaborations, 3) provide clear and transparent guidelines for managing IP, 4) assure (wide dissemination of) best practices, 5) conduct more research in PPP performance evaluation, 6) consider a stage-gate process, 7) implement the honest broker model, 8) anticipate a sustainability plan, 9) provide an overview of the PPP landscape, 10) set up PPPs for unmet medical needs, and 11) exchange information on the legal framework to ease global research demand. status: publishe...|$|E
