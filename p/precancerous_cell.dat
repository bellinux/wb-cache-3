Paradoxically, young women diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after giving birth have a higher risk of dying from their disease. These seemingly opposing effects have been largely attributed to mammary epithelial stem cell differentiation and <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, respectively, induced by pregnancy-associated hormonal changes.

Here, we isolated single intestinal crypts derived from normal tissue or from adenomas of Apcmin/+ mice, expanded them minimally in vitro as organoids, and performed exome sequencing to identify point mutations that had been acquired in vivo at the single-cell level. SNSs, most of them being CpG-to-TpG substitutions, were at least ten times more frequent in adenoma than normal cells.

However, the early activation of these pathways, which are linked to how the body’s cells consume and break down sugar, also raise the concern that certain conditions such as gestational diabetes and prediabetes, where the body produces more sugar, might stimulate <b>precancerous</b> <b>cells</b> promoting a conversion into cancerous cells.

It is an important statistical problem to separate sporadic abnormalities from those {{that may not be}} sporadic and that may have some biological significance. We discuss a modeling strategy for genomic aberration data which allows us to to infer combinations of aberrations that together increase the chance that a <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell</b> will have a descendant tumor lineage.

40|$|Interactions between {{pregnancy}} {{and breast cancer}} are complex and paradoxical. Epidemiological data show that nulliparity and late full-term pregnancy increase breast cancer risk. By contrast, early full-term {{pregnancy and}} multiparity {{are thought to be}} the most effective means of decreasing lifetime breast cancer risk. Paradoxically, young women diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy have a higher risk of dying from their disease. Moreover, there is a transient increase in risk of breast cancer in the first three to four years after pregnancy. After breast cancer treatment, {{there is no evidence that}} pregnancy increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Thus, it is not contraindicated in women previously treated for breast cancer and free of recurrence. Various physio-pathological mechanisms are involved in the protective effect of pregnancy, like cellular differentiation of mammary cells, mammary gland involution, circulating anti-mucin antibody and excretion in the milk of breast carcinogens. In the past, unfavorable effects of pregnancy were mainly attributed to <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation induced by pregnancy-associated hormonal changes. However, recent studies suggest that the remodeling of cellular microenvironment and extracellular matrix during pregnancy and involution may contribute to enhanced invasive and metastatic potential of breast carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{stage in}} tumorigenesis {{is the ability}} of a <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell</b> to escape natural anticancer signals imposed on it by neighboring cells and its microenvironment. We have previously characterized a system of intercellular induction of apoptosis whereby nontransformed cells selectively remove transformed cells from coculture via cytokine and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) signaling. We report that irradiation of nontransformed cells with low doses of either high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha-particles or low-LET gamma-rays leads to stimulation of intercellular induction of apoptosis. The use of scavengers and inhibitors confirms the involvement of ROS/RNS signaling and of the importance of transformed cell NADPH oxidase in the selectivity of the system. Doses as low as 2 -mGy gamma-rays and 0. 29 -mGy alpha-particles were sufficient to produce an observable increase in transformed cell apoptosis. This radiation-stimulated effect saturates at very low doses (50 mGy for gamma-rays and 25 mGy for alpha-particles). The use of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) neutralizing antibody confirms a role for the cytokine in the radiation-induced signaling. The system may represent a natural anticancer mechanism stimulated by extremely low doses of ionizing radiation...|$|E

40|$|The {{circadian}} {{control of}} cell Proliferation and Differentiation {{has been studied}} principally in rat liver. The comparison between the differentiation by hepatic enzymes and the division by the cell cycle under various experimental conditions (postnatal maturation, regeneration after partial hepatectomy, adrenalectomy, corticosterone treatments etc.) leads to the following conclusions: Under physiological conditions, proliferation and differentiation activities present a mutually exclusive relationship with a specific circadian rhythm. For both functions, the circadian variation of corticosterone {{plays the role of}} synchronizer, each evening (peak) it induces the synthesis of tissue specific enzymes in G 0 cells and simultaneously inhibits the DNA synthesis in cycling cells. The same parameters have been studied during the different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis induced by Diethylnitrosamine (DEN). After initiation alone, (DEN for 2 weeks) circadian control is unchanged and <b>precancerous</b> <b>cells</b> are not able to reach malignancy. Promotion (DEN for 6 weeks) consists of disturbing the circadian synchronization to liberate the selective growth of initiated <b>precancerous</b> <b>cells.</b> This proliferation advantage favours the accumulation of chromosomal aberrations including those implicated in malignant transformation: i. e. activation of oncogenes or inhibition of antioncogenes.

40|$|While modern {{treatments}} {{have led}} to a dramatic improvement in survival for pediatric malignancy, toxicities are high and a significant proportion of patients remain resistant. Gene transfer offers the prospect of highly specific therapies for childhood cancer. “Corrective ” genes may be transferred to overcome the genetic abnormalities present in the <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell.</b> Alternatively, genes can be introduced to render the malignant cell sensitive to therapeutic drugs. The tumor can also be attacked by decreasing its blood supply with genes that inhibit vascular growth. Another possible approach is to modify normal tissues with genes that make them more resistant to conventional drugs and/or radiation, thereby increasing the therapeutic index. Finally, {{it may be possible to}} attack the tumor indirectly by using genes that modify the behavior of the immune system, either by making the tumor more immunogenic, or by rendering host effector cells more efficient. Several gene therapy applications have already been reported for pediatric cancer patients in preliminary Phase 1 studies.

40|$|This study {{develops}} a novel cervical precancerous detection system by using texture analysis of field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FE-SEM) images. The processing scheme adopted in the proposed system focused on two steps. The {{first step was to}} enhance cervical cell FE-SEM images in order to show the precancerous characterization indicator. A problem arises from {{the question of how to}} extract features which characterize cervical precancerous cells. For the first step, a preprocessing technique called intensity transformation and morphological operation (ITMO) algorithm used to enhance the quality of images was proposed. The algorithm consisted of contrast stretching and morphological opening operations. The second step was to characterize the cervical cells to three classes, namely normal, low grade intra-epithelial squamous lesion (LSIL), and high grade intra-epithelial squamous lesion (HSIL). To differentiate between normal and precancerous cells of the cervical cell FE-SEM images, human papillomavirus (HPV) contained in the surface of cells were used as indicators. In this paper, we investigated the use of texture as a tool in determining <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell</b> images based on the observation that cell images have a distinct visual texture. Gray level co-occurrences matrix (GLCM) technique was used to extract the texture features. To confirm the system’s performance, the system was tested using 150 cervical cell FE-SEM images.

40|$|Cancer cells metabolize glucose at {{elevated}} {{rates and}} have a higher sensitivity to glucose reduction. However, the precise molecular mechanisms leading to different responses to glucose restriction between normal and cancer cells are not fully understood. We analyzed normal WI- 38 and immortalized WI- 38 /S fetal lung fibroblasts and found that glucose restriction resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis in WI- 38 /S cells, whereas it induced lifespan extension in WI- 38 cells. Moreover, in WI- 38 /S cells glucose restriction decreased expression of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) and increased expression of p 16 INK 4 a. Opposite effects {{were found in the}} gene expression of hTERT and p 16 in WI- 38 cells in response to glucose restriction. The altered gene expression was partly due to glucose restriction-induced DNA methylation changes and chromatin remodeling of the hTERT and p 16 promoters in normal and immortalized WI- 38 cells. Furthermore, glucose restriction resulted in altered hTERT and p 16 expression in response to epigenetic regulators in WI- 38 rather than WI- 38 /S cells, suggesting that energy stress-induced differential epigenetic regulation may lead to different cellular fates in normal and precancerous cells. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms of a nutrient control strategy that may contribute to cancer therapy as well as antiaging approaches. —Li, Y., Liu, L., Tollefsbol, T.

Another group received a subsequent intoxication with carbon tetrachloride by inhalation (approximately 200 doses) and another one was overloaded with riboflavin (25 parts/ 10 (6) in drinking water). The frequency of hepatomata was almost equal in the aflatoxin and aflatoxin-carbon tetrachloride group. It was lowere in the riboflavin-aflatoxin group. In these 3 groups cirrhosis was never present in neoplastic livers. Megalocytosis was the first lesion observed. All tumoral livers had previous or concomitant megalocytosis. This modification was about as frequent, intense and widespread in aflatoxin-CCl 4 and aflatoxin groups but appeared much earlier, as did the first hepatoma, in the aflatoxin-CCl 4 group. It was less frequent, less intense and less widespread in the riboflavin-aflatoxin group than in the aflatoxin group. There was also a lower frequency of hepatomata in the riboflavin-aflatoxin group, but the difference was not significant due to the too small number of animals involved. The facts are not a proof of the existence of an obligatory link between megalocytosis and carcinogenesis since a slight megalocytosis was observed in the riboflavin group not affected by the neoplastic process. However, the simplest explanation of our results would be to consider that the potential tumour cells are located among the megalocytic cells, without admitting that every megalocyte is obligatorily a <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell.</b> CCl 4 seems to act in shortening the time of appearance of megalocytosis.

40|$|Globally, {{cervical}} cancer ranks third among cancers affecting women (Arbyn et al., 2013). In the United States, approximately 12, 000 women are diagnosed with {{cervical cancer}} and approximately 4, 000 women die yearly (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Papanicolaou (Pap) screening {{is an effective}} means of detecting <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell</b> changes of the cervix with early cervical cancer diagnosis carrying a 91 % five-year survival rate (Gonzalez et al., 2012). The purpose of this evidence-based practice project was to identify interventions that increase adherence to cervical cancer screening and to implement best practices to reduce unnecessary deaths related to late diagnoses of cervical cancer. Rogers’ (2003) Diffusion of Innovation and Pender’s (2011) Health Promotion Model guided this project. Multimodal community educational presentations were held monthly for three consecutive months at a health center in northern Indiana. Cervical cancer knowledge and intent for screening were compared through pre- and post- presentation questionnaires. Paired-samples t tests were calculated via SPSS to compare pre- and post- intervention total scores of knowledge and preand post- intervention scores of Pap screening intent. Mean scores of knowledge and Pap screening intent both increased however, the difference was not statistically significant. The percentage of clinic patients with completed Pap smears remained relatively constant prior to, during, and after the educational intervention. The results of this DNP project indicated that among females ages 21 - 65 years, multi-modal educational presentations did not significantly impact cervical cancer knowledge, screening intentions, or Pap smear rates over a 3 -month period as compared with the previous standard of care. However, participants reported a sense of unity within the group and an enlightened sense of purpose in sharing the importance of cervical cancer screening with other women.

40|$|Trichloroethylene (TCE) is {{a common}} {{contaminant}} of groundwater {{as a result of}} poor disposal practices of the past. As a consequence, this solvent is the focus of many clean-up operations of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. TCE is carcinogenic in both mice and rats, but at different sites, the liver and kidney, respectively (NCI 1976; NTP 1988; NTP 1990). Liver tumor induction in mice has been the tumor most critical from the standpoint of environmental regulation (Bull 2000). Under the proposed cancer risk guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 1996), identifying the dose-response behavior of key events involved in carcinogenic responses can be used for developing alternative risk assessments. A major difficulty in developing alternative approaches for TCE is the fact that three of its metabolites are capable of inducing liver cancer in mice (Bull et al. 1990; Daniel et al. 1992; DeAngelo et al. 1999; Pereria 1996). Two of these metabolites have distinct modes of action, dichloroacetate (DCA) and trichloroacetate (TCA). The third metabolite, chloral hydrate, is probably active {{as a result of its}} conversion to one or both of these two metabolites. Ordinarily, the first approach to assigning causality to a metabolite in tumorigenesis would be an attempt to measure its concentration in the body and associate that with tumorigenic concentrations observed when the compound is itself administered. This can be done with relative ease with TCA. However, it has been more difficult with DCA since blood levels of this metabolite after exposure to carcinogenic doses of DCA fall rapidly below detection limits (Kato-Weinstein et al. 1998; Merdink et al. 1998). Mutations in the ras protooncogene have been used to determine if distinct patterns of DNAsequence alterations can provide indications of the type of DNA damage that might be produced by carcinogens. The presence of ras mutations in chemically-induced tumors was suggested as a means o f determining whether a chemical was genotoxic (Wiseman et al. 1986). However, the 7 discovery that spontaneous tumors also contain this oncogene indicated that this assumption may not be correct (Fox and Watanabe 1985). Several non-genotoxic carcinogens have been shown to produce tumors with a H-ras mutation frequency considerably below those that result spontaneously (Maronpot et al. 1995). Among these chemicals are a class called peroxisome proliferators, of which TCA and TCE are members. DCA and TCE were found to induce tumors with similar H-ras mutation spectra (Anna et al. 1994), whereas only limited data have been available on TCA (Fereira-Gonzalez et al. 1995). Thus, a major focus of this research was to evaluate whether the pattern and frequency of H-ras mutations in TCE-induced tumors could be explained by the same parameters in tumors induced by the metabolites TCA or DCA. The present project was organized around three interrelated objectives: The first objective addressed the pharmacokinetic questions regarding the formation and elimination of DCA and TCA in mice administered TCE and whether levels of these metabolites may account for the tumors induced by TCE. The second objective was to investigate potential molecular mechanisms by which TCA and DCA may, in the absence of directly causing mutations, promote the clonal growth and expansion of <b>precancerous</b> <b>cell</b> populations within mouse liver. The third objective was to investigate whether the genotype of tumors induced by TCA and DCA can be used to establish the relative roles of these metabolites in TCE-induced cancer. In particular, the focus of the latter studies was to compare the incidence and spectra of mutations in the H-ras gene (codon 61) to determine if the reported similarities in the genotype of DCA- and TCE-induced tumors have a causal relationship...|$|E
