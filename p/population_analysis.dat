25|$|In {{species or}} <b>population</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{for example in}} {{conservation}} work, PCR primers which amplify microsatellites in one individual or species can work in other species. However, the risk of applying PCR primers across different species is that null alleles become likely, whenever sequence divergence is too great for the primers to bind. The species may then artificially {{appear to have a}} reduced diversity. Null alleles in this case can sometimes be indicated by an excessive frequency of homozygotes causing deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations.|$|E

25|$|The Somali-born {{population}} of the UK includes {{a disproportionate number of}} females in comparison with the general <b>population.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of data from the Labour Force Survey by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggests that 61 per cent of the Somali-born population in 2006/07 was female. Of the 101,370 Somali-born residents of England and Wales recorded by the 2011 Census, 57,042 (56.3 per cent) were female. The equivalent figure for the UK as a whole from the previous census, held in 2001, was 54 per cent. Expressed as a sex ratio, the 2011 figure suggests that there were 78 Somali-born men per 100 Somali-born women, compared to the overall sex ratio for England and Wales of 97 men per 100 women.|$|E
25|$|The last {{population}} estimate before Hurricane Katrina was 454,865, as of July 1, 2005. A <b>population</b> <b>analysis</b> {{released in}} August 2007 estimated {{the population to}} be 273,000, 60% of the pre-Katrina population and an increase of about 50,000 since July 2006. A September 2007 report by The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center, which tracks population based on U.S. Postal Service figures, found that in August 2007, just over 137,000 households received mail. That compares with about 198,000 households in July 2005, representing about 70% of pre-Katrina population. More recently, the Census Bureau revised upward its 2008 population estimate for the city, to 336,644 inhabitants. In 2010, estimates showed that neighborhoods that did not flood were near or even greater than 100% of their pre-Katrina populations.|$|E

The remaining 27 per cent were classified as having [...] "other qualifications". The IPPR note that {{it is often difficult}} to classify foreign qualifications, and hence a higher proportion of foreign-born populations are classified in this category than the UK-born population.

2500|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that mastodons probably disappeared from North America about 10,500 years ago {{as part of a}} mass extinction of most of the Pleistocene megafauna that is widely believed to have been a result of human hunting pressure. The latest Paleo-Indians entered the [...] Americas and expanded to relatively large numbers 13,000 years ago, and their hunting may have caused a gradual attrition of the mastodon <b>population.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of tusks of mastodons from the American Great Lakes region over a span of several thousand years prior to their extinction in the area shows a trend of declining age at maturation; this is contrary to what one would expect if they were experiencing stresses from an unfavorable environment, but is consistent with a reduction in intraspecific competition that would result from a population being reduced by human hunting.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlow cytometric {{analysis}} {{enables the}} simultaneous single-cell interrogation of multiple biomarkers for phenotypic and functional identification of heterogeneous <b>populations.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of polychromatic data {{has become increasingly}} complex with more measured parameters. Furthermore, manual gating of multiple <b>populations</b> using standard <b>analysis</b> techniques can lead to errors in data interpretation and difficulties in the standardization of analyses. To characterize high-dimensional cytometric data, we demonstrate the use of probability state modeling (PSM) to visualize the differentiation of effector/memory CD 8 + T cells. With this model, four major CD 8 + T-cell subsets can be easily identified using the combination of three markers, CD 45 RA, CCR 7 (CD 197), and CD 28, with the selection markers CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, and side scatter (SSC). PSM enables the translation of complex multicolor flow cytometric data to pathway-specific cell subtypes, the capability of developing averaged models of healthy donor <b>populations,</b> and the <b>analysis</b> of phenotypic heterogeneity.

40|$|Abstract. We {{summarise}} {{the contributions}} of empiricists, modellers, and practitioners {{in this issue of}} Biodiversity and Conservation, and highlight the most important areas for fu-ture research on species survival in fragmented landscapes. Under the theme ‚Äòuncertainty in research and management‚Äô, we highlight five areas for future research. First, we know little about the effects of density dependence on the viability of metapopulations, a requirement for fragmented landscapes. Second, successful early attempts suggest that it is worth developing more rigorous calibration methods for <b>population</b> viability <b>analysis</b> with spatially explicit, individual-based models. In particular, the balance between model complexity, ease of calibra-tion, and precision, needs to be addressed. Third, we need to improve methods to discriminate between models, including alternatives to time-series approaches. Fourth, when our ability to reduce model uncertainty is weak, we need to incorporate this uncertainty in <b>population</b> viability <b>analysis.</b> Fifth, <b>population</b> viability <b>analysis</b> and decision analysis can be integrated to make uncertainty an explicit part of the decision process.
