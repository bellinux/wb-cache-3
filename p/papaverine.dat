This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
25|$|In the Bischler–Napieralski {{reaction}} an β-phenylethylamine is acylated and cyclodehydrated by a Lewis acid, such as phosphoryl chloride or phosphorus pentoxide. The resulting 1-substituted 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline {{can then}} be dehydrogenated using palladium. The following Bischler–Napieralski reaction produces <b>papaverine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{alkaloids}} {{and other}} derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; {{the best example}} is the smooth-muscle relaxant <b>papaverine.</b> Noscapine is a marginal case as it does have CNS effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.|$|E
25|$|Codeine, or 3-methylmorphine, is an {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum var. album, a plant in the papaveraceae family. Opium poppy has been cultivated and utilized throughout human history {{for a variety of}} medicinal (analgesic, anti-tussive and anti-diarrheal) and hypnotic properties linked to the diversity of its active components, which include morphine, codeine and <b>papaverine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Natural opiates: {{alkaloids}} {{contained in}} the resin of the opium poppy, primarily morphine, codeine, and thebaine, but not <b>papaverine</b> and noscapine which have a different mechanism of action; The following could be considered natural opiates: The leaves from Mitragyna speciosa (also known as kratom) contain a few naturally-occurring opioids, active via Mu- and Delta receptors. Salvinorin A, found naturally in the Salvia divinorum plant, is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist.|$|E
25|$|Isoquinoline is a heterocyclic {{aromatic}} organic compound. It is {{a structural}} isomer of quinoline. Isoquinoline and quinoline are benzopyridines, which {{are composed of}} a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. In a broader sense, the term isoquinoline is used to make reference to isoquinoline derivatives. 1-Benzylisoquinoline is the structural backbone in naturally occurring alkaloids including <b>papaverine.</b> The isoquinoline ring in these natural compound derives from the aromatic amino acid tyrosine.|$|E
25|$|Opium {{contains}} two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine {{are the main}} psychoactive constituents. Isoquinolines such as <b>papaverine</b> and noscapine have no significant central nervous system effects, and are not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is {{responsible for most of}} its harmful effects such as lung edema, respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates mu opioid receptor in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to drug tolerance or physical dependence. Chronic opium addicts in 1906 China or modern-day Iran consume an average of eight grams of opium daily.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier showed {{at the end}} of the 18th {{century that}} organic {{substances}} consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He went quickly focus on the isolation of these substances, often because they had an interesting pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially alkaloids and glycosides. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including codeine, morphine, noscapine, thebaine, and <b>papaverine)</b> from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. Already in 1805 was morphine isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Sertürner and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with acetic anhydride produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, Eugène Chevreul isolated from animal tissue cholesterol, a crystalline substance that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1820 was strychnine, an alkaloid was isolated.|$|E
2500|$|Opium {{tincture}} {{is useful}} as an analgesic and antidiarrheal. [...] Opium enhances the tone {{in the long}} segments of the longitudinal muscle and inhibits propulsive contraction of circular and longitudinal muscles. [...] The pharmacological effects of opium tincture are due principally to its morphine content. [...] The quantity of the <b>papaverine</b> and codeine alkaloids in opium tincture {{is too small to}} have any demonstrable central nervous system effect.|$|E
2500|$|Opiates {{contain the}} {{narcotics}} morphine, codeine, and <b>papaverine</b> which provide pain relief. Opiates activate μ-opioid receptors {{in the brain}} which alter the brain's perception of sensory input, alleviating pain and sometimes inducing pleasure for a short time period. When intravenously administered, opiates can relieve neuropathic pain but only for a time between 4 and 24 hours. After this time window, the pain returns and the patient must be treated again. Although this method of treatment has been proven to reduce pain, the repetitive use of opiates has also been linked to the activation of the brain's reward system and therefore poses a threat of addiction. Heavy doses of opiates can also cause constipation, and respiratory depression. [...] More common side effects include light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, itching, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. [...] The potential destruction opiates can cause have drawn many doctors and patients away from their use.|$|E
2500|$|Opium (poppy tears, {{with the}} {{scientific}} name: Lachryma papaveris) is the dried latex {{obtained from the}} opium poppy (scientific name: Papaver somniferum). Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as <b>papaverine</b> and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch ("score") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word [...] "meconium" [...] (derived from the Greek for [...] "opium-like", but now {{used to refer to}} infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made {{from other parts of the}} opium poppy or different species of poppies.|$|E
