It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{the actual}} {{building}} began with the laying of a foundation stone on 27 April 1840 by Barry's wife Sarah near the north-east corner of the building. A major problem for Barry came with the appointment on 1 April 1840 of the ventilation expert Dr David Boswell Reid. Reid, whom Barry described as '..not profess to be thoroughly acquainted with the <b>practical</b> <b>details</b> of building and machinery' would make increasing demands that affected the building's design, leading to delays in construction, and by 1845 Barry refused to communicate with Reid except in writing. A direct result of Reid's demands was {{the addition of the}} Central Tower, designed to act as a giant chimney to draw fresh air through the building.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{earliest}} published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, {{including the first}} mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no <b>practical</b> <b>details.</b> Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it. An Armenian inventor, Hovannes Adamian, also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him, and was patented in Germany on March 31, 1908, patent № 197183, then in Britain, on April 1, 1908, patent № 7219, in France (patent № 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent № 17912).|$|E

25|$|Bacon {{has been}} called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the {{possibility}} of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the <b>practical</b> <b>details</b> of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories- history, poesy, and philosophy- which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of the Josephine Lawrence began 11 September 1943. The U.S. Army Transportation Corps (TC) had {{the lead in the}} {{conversion of}} the ships to Corps of Engineers specifications and then turned over to the Engineers for operations. The converted ship had been promised by TC for 15 January 1944 almost on the schedule required by the European command. Delays, shortages of materials, workers and intense competition from other requirements pushed that date even further into February and then 19 April 1944. On initial test operation the TC found the generators it had specified were insufficient and replacement was required. The Corps of Engineers crews had been trained ashore separately from the ships and thus had to join the ships to learn the <b>practical</b> <b>details.</b> The Junior N. Van Noy, the first of the port repair ships to be ready, sailed from Mobile, Alabama in late April with an Engineers crew sent from Fort Belvoir to Philadelphia for final preparation before deployment overseas.

25|$|In 1990, under {{different}} titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to twisted nematic field effect LCDs (TN- and STN- LCDs). One approach {{was to use}} interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To {{take full advantage of}} the properties of this In Plane Switching (IPS) technology further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various <b>practical</b> <b>details</b> of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E

30|$|One {{appealing}} way to {{deal with}} ambiguous theory is to use a Bayesian approach that explicitly allows uncertainty about the relevance of potential predictors and does not force a binary choice between inclusion and exclusion. Bayesian regression combines the data with a prior distribution for the model’s parameters by using Bayes’ theorem to derive a posterior distribution for the parameters and for predictions made with the model. As the amount of data increases, the posterior means converge to the least squares estimates. The computations can be challenging, but have now become <b>practical.</b> <b>Detailed</b> examples can be found in [41 – 43].|$|R
