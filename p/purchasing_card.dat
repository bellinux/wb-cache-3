5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. This sentiment was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for <b>purchasing</b> <b>card</b> packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck of the draw. Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E

5000|$|One hurdle in the A/P pcard payment {{conversion}} is supplier enablement. This {{is often}} referred to as <b>purchasing</b> <b>card</b> supplier enablement or pcard supplier enablement. Every supplier must be contacted and informed of the payment change from check to the <b>purchasing</b> <b>card,</b> even if the supplier is already a <b>purchasing</b> <b>card</b> supplier. Some banks offer help in the conversion process (<b>purchasing</b> <b>card</b> supplier enablement) and other software companies provide technology to make the conversion efficient and easy for the financial institution, client, and supplier. According to a joint industry survey, “In terms of impeding an organization’s card program growth, 61% of end-user respondents reported that suppliers’ resistance to (or non-acceptance of) card payments is, at a minimum, somewhat of a problem. Not surprising, the transaction acceptance fee factor is overwhelmingly the number-one reason suppliers give end-users for resisting or not accepting card payments. Further, nearly 50% of respondents stated they sometimes or frequently encounter suppliers that impose a surcharge in conjunction with card acceptance. End-users employ varying approaches in response to the challenges; for example, educating suppliers on the benefits of card payments—a task that is often completed by program management and/or procurement staff." ...|$|E

In a recent <b>purchasing</b> <b>card</b> application these tests identified a <b>purchasing</b> <b>card</b> transaction for 3,000,000 Costa Rica Colons.

These high-level tests include tests related to Benford's Law and possibly also those statistics known as descriptive statistics. These high-tests are always followed by more focused tests to look for small samples of highly irregular transactions. The familiar methods of correlation and time-series analysis {{can also be used to}} detect fraud and other irregularities. Forensic analytics also includes the use of a fraud risk-scoring model to identify high risk forensic units (customers, employees, locations, insurance claims and so on). Forensic analytics also includes suggested tests to identify financial statement irregularities, but the general rule is that analytic methods alone are not too successful at detecting financial statement fraud.|$|E

According to the 2005 <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Card</b> Benchmark Survey Results (Palmer and Gupta, 2007), traditional <b>purchasing</b> <b>card</b> transactions below $2000 grew 1.4% from 2003 to 2005.

40|$|The Government <b>Purchase</b> <b>Card</b> Program {{introduced}} <b>purchase</b> <b>cards</b> {{to streamline}} the acquisition of items and services under $ 2, 500. <b>Purchase</b> <b>cards</b> {{have proved to be}} extremely efficient, with some estimates putting the savings for the Government at $ 75 per transaction. Unfortunately, the Government has failed to maintain effective controls over cardholders and this has led to systemic abuse, preventing the Government from realizing the full potential of the <b>purchase</b> <b>card</b> program. There are three main problems with the current scheme. First, cardholders are ignoring internal controls, resulting in purchases that supervisors cannot verify as consistent with procurement regulations. Second, the proliferation of cardholders has also led to a lack of control. In some agencies, {{one out of every four}} employees carries a <b>purchase</b> <b>card,</b> making it difficult to accurately supervise spending. Finally, cardholders do not receive enough training before being authorized to spend taxpayer money. This paper recommends a thorough overhaul of the <b>purchase</b> <b>card</b> program. The GAO has recommended several initiatives, including; pre-approval of <b>purchase</b> <b>card</b> transactions; establishment of documentation requirements; and a reduction in the number of cardholders. In addition to adopting these recommendations, the Government must improve its relationships with financial institutions and take advantage of the data-mining software those institutions have available. The Government should also learn from the private sector by implementing a policy of stringent oversight, to include daily and monthly spending limits; blocks on specific categories of expenditure; and “ 24 / 7 monitoring” of spending. These improvements would allow the Government to truly benefit from this efficient method of procurement...|$|R
