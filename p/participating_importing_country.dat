40|$|In this {{working paper}} we model {{the case of}} an {{international}} non-renewable resource monopolist as a dynamic game between a monopolist and <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> governments, and we investigate whether a tariff on resource imports can be advantageous for the consumers of the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> when the monopolist sets the price and the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> governments act in a non-cooperative way. We find that a tariff is advantageous for the consumers even when there is no commitment to the trade policy, although the part of the rent that can be reaped by the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> decreases substantially with the number of <b>importing</b> <b>countries.</b> The optimality of the tariff in our dynamic game is {{explained by the fact that}} through the tariff the governments of the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> can influence the dynamics of the accumulated extractions and hence the extraction costs and the evolution of the monopolist price.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model {{the case of}} an {{international}} non-renewable resource monopolist as a differential game between the monopolist and the governments of the <b>importing</b> <b>countries,</b> and we investigate whether a tariff on the resource importations can be advantageous for the <b>importing</b> <b>countries.</b> We find that the results depend crucially on the kind of strategies the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> governments can play and on whether the monopolist chooses the price or the extraction rate. For a price-setting monopolist it is shown that the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> cannot use a tariff to capture monopoly rents if they are constrained to use open-loop strategies, even if the governments sign a tariff agreement. This result is drastically modified if the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> in the tariff agreement use Markov (feedback) strategies. For a quantity-setting monopolist the nature of the game changes and an open-loop tariff is advantageous for the <b>importing</b> <b>countries.</b> Moreover, in this case the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> in a tariff agreement enjoy a strategic advantage which allows them to behave as a leader. tariffs, tariff agreements, non-renewable resources, depletion effects, price-setting monopolist, quantity-setting monopolist, differential games, open-loop strategies, linear strategies, Markov-perfect Nash equilibrium, Markov-perfect Stackelberg equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{variables}} on the feed grain sector of six <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> were investigated in this study. The six countries were Greece, Israel, Japan, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. A simultaneous model with six equations {{was used to}} explain the domestic price of feed grains in the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> and the quantity of feed grains <b>imported</b> by the <b>country.</b> Other endogeneous variables in the model were the price of livestock, the production of livestock products, the demand for livestock products, {{and the size of}} the livestock inventory in the <b>importing</b> <b>country.</b> The simultaneous model for each <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> allows the government of the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> to control the domestic price of feed grains through the government’s manipulation of trade barriers for feed grains. Because of the existence of trade barriers, the domestic price of feed grains is allowed to differ from the cost of importing feed grains.

40|$|The author {{argues that}} trade {{diversion}} based on tariff preferences can be welfare-reducing {{because there is}} a tradeoff between improved resource allocation and a loss in terms of trade - where the latter loss equals the lost tariff revenue of the <b>importing</b> <b>country.</b> With trade diversion based on rent-transferring quotas such as voluntary export restraints (VERs), however, there is no such tradeoff. On the contrary, not only does the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> improve its resource allocation but it also improves its terms of trade. So for the <b>importing</b> <b>country,</b> trade diversion under VERs is unambiguously beneficial. For exporting countries outside the regional trading bloc there is an unambiguous loss. They continue to sell the VER constrained quantity in the <b>importing</b> <b>country,</b> but at a reduced price. Therefore, they unambiguously lose on their trade in VER-constrained products from the creation of a regional trading bloc.

Based on a simple partial equilibrium model with an export monopoly, we show that the preferable choice between free trade and a time-consistent tariff policy depends on the market size of the <b>importing</b> <b>country.</b> More specifically, if the market size is larger than a certain level, the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> prefers free trade to the time-consistent tariff policy. However, because a free trade policy is not credible {{in the presence of a}} time lag, the government of the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> requires international organizations and rules such as GATT/WTO as commitment devices.

For the case of a competitive market it is found that the optimal policy is a constant tariff if extraction is costless. However, with depletion effects, the optimal tariff must ultimately be decreasing. For the case of a monopolistic market the results depend crucially on the kind of strategies the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> governments can play and on whether the monopolist chooses the price or extraction rate. For a price-setting monopolist it is shown that the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> cannot use a tariff to capture monopoly rents if they are constrained to use open-loop strategies, even if the governments sign a tariff agreement.

Three different policy instruments of the <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> are examined, namely a price instrument (tariff) and two quantity instruments (discount and import quota).
