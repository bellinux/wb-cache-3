5|$|The {{large size}} of flocks {{can also cause}} problems. Common {{starlings}} may be sucked into aircraft jet engines, {{one of the worst}} instances of this being an incident in Boston in 1960, when sixty-two people died after a turboprop airliner flew into a flock and <b>plummeted</b> into the sea at Winthrop Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests <b>plummeted</b> and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans. When Taraki realized {{the degree of}} popular dissatisfaction with the reform he quickly abandoned the policy. However, the land reform was gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area impacted by the reform is unclear.|$|E
5|$|During his presidency, Endara {{abolished}} the Panamanian military {{and replaced it}} with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates. His administration was marked by internal fighting and corruption scandals, and his popularity <b>plummeted.</b> He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto PÃ©rez Balladares on September 1, 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Like Twisters, ProSlide <b>Plummets</b> are body flumes. However, they {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} drop only, followed by a long, flat segment to help riders decelerate. Often over 70 feet tall, <b>Plummets</b> are frequently the tallest ProSlide slides in a water park. The first <b>Plummets</b> opened in 1987 at Aquapar Magog in Quebec and Six Flags America, respectively; as of 2007, ProSlide has installed 227 <b>Plummets.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 836, Abu'l-Aghlab {{launched}} fresh attacks. A Muslim force {{seized the}} fortress known in Arabic as Qastaliasali (probably Castelluccio on the island's northern coast), but were driven {{away by a}} Byzantine counter-attack. The Muslim fleet, under al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, raided the Aeolian Islands and seized a number of forts on the northern coast of Sicily, most notably Tyndaris. In the meantime, another cavalry raid was dispatched against the region of Etna and was so successful that the price for Byzantine captives <b>plummeted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{the album}} did not fare well, failing {{to make the}} top 20 in either the UK or United States. Instead, the album debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard 200 on 17 July 1993, and quickly <b>plummeted</b> to No. 192 in seven weeks before falling off the chart completely. The album saw {{slightly}} better chart placings in Europe, where it peaked at No. 5 in Austria, and No. 15 in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have <b>plummeted</b> since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were {{particularly}} affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy <b>plummeted.</b> Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops <b>plummeted.</b> The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 <b>plummeted</b> to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E
5|$|Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily sortie rate <b>plummeted</b> from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values <b>plummeted,</b> and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{shareholders}} filed a $40 billion lawsuit {{after the}} company's stock price, which achieved {{a high of}} US$90.75 per share in mid-2000, <b>plummeted</b> to less than $1 {{by the end of}} November 2001. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that <b>plummeted</b> in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E

In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in South Dakota and Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on to}} win in a landslide victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had <b>plummeted</b> as the election grew closer.|$|E
5|$|Movies {{were popular}} in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over {{a billion people}} in 1942, 1943 and 1944. By 1934, German {{regulations}} restricting currency exports {{made it impossible for}} American film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films <b>plummeted,</b> as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{historical}} note, the Jewish {{community has}} figured centrally {{in the history}} of Transylvania, and in that of the wider region. They were a substantial and increasingly vibrant presence in Cluj in the modern era, contributing significantly to the town's economic dynamism and cultural flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the community comprised a significant share of the town's population during the interwar eraâbetween 13 and 15 percentâthis figure <b>plummeted</b> {{as a consequence of the}} Holocaust and emigration; by the 1990s only a few hundred Jews remained in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E

5|$|Ramsey was {{replaced}} by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch <b>plummeted.</b> Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich slipped down to the Second Division in 1964, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games â one of the worst-ever defensive records in English senior football. Milburn quit after just one full season and {{was replaced}} by Bill McGarry in 1964. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant Sammy Chung in the 1967â68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers. McGarry left to manage Wolves and {{was replaced by}} Bobby Robson in January 1969.|$|E
5|$|The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report {{suggested}} that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, Fitzgerald <b>plummeted</b> to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to flood and founder.|$|E

The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production <b>plummeted</b> to 150â200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. There are eight restaurants {{in the city and}} four hotels â the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. Nablus' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions.
