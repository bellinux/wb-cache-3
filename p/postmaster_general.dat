5|$|In October 1994, Kizirian {{was honored}} {{by his own}} Atwood-Bucci Detachment of the U.S. Marine Corps League. The tribute was {{attended}} by Providence Mayor Vincent Cianci, Senator John Pastore, and Rhode Island governor Bruce Sundlun with letters read from <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> Marvin Runyon.|$|E
5|$|Because Republicans {{controlled}} neither {{house of}} Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge {{did not believe}} Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession. Ignoring James Murray Mason's contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian Montgomery Blair as <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General.</b> He also voted against a resolution to remove {{the names of the}} senators from seceded states from the Senate roll.|$|E
50|$|While {{both the}} Post Offices of England and Ireland had two <b>postmasters</b> <b>general,</b> in Ireland the assent {{of only one}} was {{required}} for decisions {{as opposed to the}} assent of both being necessary in England. Besides confirming the monopoly for carrying letters in Ireland and giving the right to establish a four-mile limit penny post in Dublin, one of the <b>postmasters</b> <b>general's</b> duties was to measure the post roads in Ireland. During the time the <b>Postmasters</b> <b>General</b> of Ireland existed profits in the Irish office increased from £15,000 in 1786 to £108,000 in 1831.|$|R

5|$|Charles Anderson Wickliffe (June 8, 1788 – October 31, 1869) was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky. He {{also served}} as Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, the 14th Governor of Kentucky, and was {{appointed}} <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> by President John Tyler. Though he consistently identified with the Whig Party, he was politically independent, and often had differences of opinion with Whig founder and fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|Following the November 1861 election, Davis {{announced}} the permanent cabinet in March 1862. Benjamin moved again, to Secretary of State. George W. Randolph of Virginia {{had been made}} the Secretary of War. Mallory continued as Secretary of the Navy and Reagan as <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General.</b> Both kept their positions throughout the war.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Republican convention, Taft and Roosevelt had {{discussed}} which cabinet officers would stay on. Taft kept only Agriculture Secretary James Wilson and <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> George von Lengerke Meyer (who was {{shifted to the}} Navy Department). Others appointed to the Taft cabinet included Philander Knox, who had served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Attorney General, as the new Secretary of State, and Franklin MacVeagh as Treasury Secretary.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> of the Irish Free State {{issued an}} {{invitation}} to firms in Dublin and London on 1 February 1922 for the submission of designs for a permanent definitive stamp issue, and by March several designs had been submitted. The following companies and printers provided essays: Dollard Printing House Ltd., Hely Ltd., Perkins Bacon & Co., and O'Loughlin, Murphy & Boland.|$|E
5|$|The current design, {{depicting}} a basketball over a hoop and basket, was first awarded in 1977 still under its original name, which was changed {{in honor of}} former NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien who served from 1975 to 1984.

5|$|Wickliffe {{campaigned on}} behalf of the Whig ticket of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler in the presidential {{election}} of 1840. Wickliffe and Tyler were friends, having shared a room when they were both in Congress. When Harrison's death elevated Tyler to the office of president, Tyler appointed Wicklilffe as <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General,</b> a choice that angered Clay supporters in the party. Wickliffe served in Tyler's administration until March 1845.|$|E
5|$|Harding chose pro-League Charles Evans Hughes as his Secretary of State, {{ignoring}} {{advice from}} Senator Lodge and others. After Charles G. Dawes declined the Treasury position, Harding asked Pittsburgh banker Andrew W. Mellon, {{one of the}} richest men in the country; he agreed. Harding appointed Herbert Hoover as United States Secretary of Commerce. RNC Chairman Will Hays was made <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General,</b> then a cabinet post; he would leave after a year in the position to become chief censor to the motion picture industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Truman {{was named}} Missouri's {{director}} for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) {{at the request of}} <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.|$|E

5|$|In the 1964 Government led by Harold Wilson, Benn was <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General,</b> {{where he}} oversaw {{the opening of}} the Post Office Tower, then the UK's tallest building, and the creations of the Post Bus service and Girobank. He {{proposed}} issuing stamps without the Sovereign's head, but this met with private opposition from the Queen. Instead, the portrait was reduced to a small profile in silhouette, a format that is still used on commemorative stamps.|$|E
5|$|President Tyler {{appointed}} Wickliffe as <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> following Wickliffe's term as governor. While {{aboard a}} steamship in 1844, he was stabbed {{by a man}} who was later found to be insane. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe on a secret mission to report on British and French intents with regard to annexing Texas and to assess the feasibility of the United States undertaking such an action. Wickliffe's participation in this endeavor further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{handed the}} ACLU two key {{victories}} in 1957, in Watkins v. United States and Yates v. United States, {{both of which}} undermined the Smith Act and {{marked the beginning of}} the end of communist party membership inquiries. In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including Lamont v. <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> (in which the plaintiff was Corliss Lamont, a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.|$|E

5|$|As {{provisional}} {{president in}} 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of Georgia {{was the first}} Secretary of State and Christopher Memminger of South Carolina became Secretary of the Treasury. LeRoy Pope Walker of Alabama was made Secretary of War, after being recommended for this post by Clement Clay and William Yancey (both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves). John Reagan of Texas became <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General.</b> Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana became Attorney General. Although Stephen Mallory was not put forward by the delegation from his state of Florida, Davis insisted {{that he was the}} best man for the job of Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{reporting}} the election result, newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker would soon call another election and seek a majority. Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton (who would soon become <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> under Diefenbaker) predicted {{on the evening}} of June 10 that there would soon be another election, in which the Tories would do much better in Quebec. The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and Diefenbaker called a snap election. On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.|$|E
5|$|In May 1871, Grant ordered {{federal troops}} to help marshals in arresting Klansmen. That October, Grant {{suspended}} habeas corpus {{in part of}} South Carolina and sent federal troops {{to enforce the law}} there. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan's power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record numbers. That same year, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan in June 1873; civil rights prosecutions continued throughout Grant's second term but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Additionally, Grant's <b>Postmaster</b> <b>General</b> John Creswell, using his patronage powers, integrated the postal system and appointed African American postmasters across the nation.|$|E
