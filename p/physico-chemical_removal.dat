40|$|AbstractInnovative {{processes}} for treating industrial wastewater containing heavy metals often involve technologies for reduction of toxicity {{in order to}} meet technology-based treatment standards. This article reviews the recent developments and technical applicability of various treatments for the removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewater. A particular focus is given to innovative <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>removal</b> processes such as; adsorption on new adsorbents, membrane filtration, electrodialysis, and photocatalysis. Their advantages and limitations in application are evaluated. The main operating conditions such as pH and treatment performance are presented. Published studies of 94 cited references (1999 – 2008) are reviewed. It is evident from survey that new adsorbents and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied and widely applied for the treatment of metal-contaminated wastewater. However, in the near future, the most promising methods to treat such complex systems will be the photocatalytic ones which consume cheap photons from the UV-near visible region. They induce both degradation of organic pollutants and recovery of metals in one-pot systems. On the other hand, from the conventional processes, lime precipitation has been found {{as one of the most}} effective means to treat inorganic effluent with a metal concentration of > 1000 mg/L. It is important to note that the overall treatment cost of metal-contaminated water varies, depending on the process employed and the local conditions. In general, the technical applicability, plant simplicity and cost-effectiveness are the key factors in selecting the most suitable treatment for inorganic effluen...|$|E
40|$|Modifiedß-casein {{forms were}} {{prepared}} with acid/alkaline phosphatase. The choice between acid and alkaline phosphatases was {{critical for the}} <b>physico-chemical</b> properties ofß-casein. <b>Removal</b> of phosphoryl groups fromß-casein via alkaline phosphatase increased the retention time measured using RP-HPLC and did not change the second-derivative UV spectra. Moreover, the pI value shifted to neutral pH and the solubility decreased, especially at the alkaline pH range. ß-Casein modified enzymatically via alkaline phosphatase formed a foam with volume and stability similar to that formed with intact one. In turn, a dramatic decrease in foam stability was found forß-casein modified via acid phosphatase. Chromatographic, spectral and electrophoretic results suggest proteolytic acivity of acid phosphatase preparation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The most {{important}} nutrients in controlling water quality are: carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. They {{are essential to}} the growth of all living organisms. These are the nutritional pillars of bacteria, fish, trees and humans. Unfortunately, when a water body or plan becomes rich in these nutrients, particularly phosphorus, this causes some organisms such as algae to grow in abundance which makes the environment ugly. These algae are usually undesirable and may inevitably cause changes in pH, dissolved oxygen, colour and turbidity of the water environment, hence the environment becomes eutrophic and its color turns to green. To address and solve the eutrophication issue, the amount of phosphorus discharged into the receiving milieu must be reduced; and this constitutes the main purpose of our research. We proceeded so as to make a <b>physico-chemical</b> phosphorus <b>removal</b> from urban waste water. The physico-chemical treatment is based on looking for and finding the optimal dose of the various added coagulants. The aim of our work is to confirm the efficiency of the chemical treatment through use: lime, ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate as coagulant for this treatment. Index Terms—Nutrient, phosphorus, algae, eutrophication...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{disposal}} is {{a serious}} problem in Moroccan rural area. Discharged with high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen can result in eutrophication of receiving waters. Biological processes are the most adapted alternative to the needs of these areas, such as the Multi-Soil-Layering (MSL) system. The process of rural wastewater treatment by MSL, which is an innovative system used {{for the first time in}} Morocco, was studied by modelling the relationships between a set of environmental factors and total phosphorus removed, based upon 153 sampling. Three MSL pilot plants, constructed in three 36 cm × 30 cm × 65 cm plastic boxes, were continuously fed with domestic wastewater, with different hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 250, 500 and 1000 l/m 2 /day. This study was to investigate and quantify the effect of parameters affecting biological and <b>physico-chemical</b> phosphate <b>removal</b> from wastewaters in this system, using neural networks (NNs) and multiple regression analysis (MRA). The results show the influence of the hydraulic loading rate (HLR), Hydrogen potential (pH), phosphorus load (PL), nitrite (NO 2 [...] N), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5), and the Nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 –-N) in the phosphorus removal with a contribution of 36, 16, 15, 12, 9, 7 and 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} and interest towards {{the use of}} constructed floating wetlands for (waste) water treatment is emerging as more treatment opportunities are marked out, and the technique is applied more often. To evaluate {{the effect of a}} floating macrophyte mat and the influence of temperature and season on <b>physico-chemical</b> changes and <b>removal,</b> two constructed floating wetlands (CFWs), including a floating macrophyte mat, and a control, without emergent vegetation, were built. Raw domestic wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant was added on day 0. Removal of total nitrogen, NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N, P, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon and heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) was studied during 17 batch-fed testing periods with a retention time of 11 days (February-March 2007 and August 2007 -September 2008). In general, the CFWs performed better than the control. Average removal efficiencies for NH 4 -N, total nitrogen, P and COD were respectively 35 %, 42 %, 22 % and 53 % for the CFWs, and 3 %, 15 %, 6 % and 33 % for the control. The pH was significantly lower in the CFWs (7. 08 +/- 0. 21) than in the control (7. 48 +/- 0. 26) after 11 days. The removal efficiencies of NH 4 -N, total nitrogen and COD were significantly higher in the CFWs as the presence of the floating macrophyte mat influenced positively their removal. Total nitrogen, NH 4 -N and P removal was significantly influenced by temperature with the highest removal between 5 A degrees C and 15 A degrees C. At lower and higher temperatures, removal relapsed. In general, temperature seemed to be the steering factor rather than season. The presence of the floating macrophyte mat restrained the increase of the water temperature when air temperature was > 15 A degrees C. Although the mat hampered oxygen diffusion from the air towards the water column, the redox potential measured in the rootmat was higher than the value obtained in the control at the same depth, indicating that the release of oxygen from the roots could stimulate oxygen consuming reactions within the root mat, and root oxygen release was higher than oxygen diffusion from the air...|$|R
