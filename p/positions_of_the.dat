Though she had {{originally}} been equipped with 21 five-inch (127mm)/51 cal guns to defend against enemy destroyers, this number was reduced to 12 in 1918, due to the overly wet bow and stern <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other nine.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the central}} <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal {{household}} became little else than honorary titles bestowed upon the greatest families, {{and not necessarily}} even dependent on attendance at court. In Flanders, by the thirteenth century, the offices of constable, butler, steward and chamberlain had become the hereditary right of certain high noble families, and held no political significance.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010 {{a treaty}} was made between Russia and Norway fixing the {{boundary}} between the Svalbard archipelago and the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. Increased interest in petroleum exploration in the Arctic raised interest in a resolution of the dispute. The agreement takes into account the relative <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archipelagos, rather than being based simply on northward extension of the continental border of Norway and Russia.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the oldest}} fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the {{measurement}} of the positions of celestial objects.

The advance secured the valley, threatened Glamoč and brought the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road, the Cetina valley and the Vrlika field within Croatian artillery range. The Croatian forces sustained losses of 4 killed, 15 seriously wounded and 19 slightly injured during Operations Leap1 and2.|$|E

40|$|Precise object {{manipulation}} by a robot requires precise knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot endeffector {{relative to}} the object. By the so-called eye-to-hand coordination, both <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object and <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot {{relative to the}} camera are determined. In practice, usually <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot base to camera is calibrated in advanced and <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot endeffector relative to the base is calculated by forward kinematics with joint angle confgurations. For the robots working in the human environment, they are constructed with lightweight {{in order to increase}} security, which achieves lower stiffness than industrial robots. Thus, <b>the</b> reached <b>position</b> <b>of</b> robot-effector deviates from its commanded <b>position.</b> <b>The</b> work <b>of</b> this thsis is to develop a method based on the image processing to minimize deviations and thus to estimate <b>the</b> real <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot endeffector in real time. Thus, the robot end-effector can be guaranteed to precisely grip the target object...|$|R

5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E

5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E
5|$|Buses for routes 37, 47 and X47 between Edinburgh and Penicuik were branded as Penicuik City Link, {{with blue}} uppers and roofline, and the <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red and madder on the {{skirting}} transposed.

However, the other vehicles in Penicuik City Link colours were repainted into the new madder and white livery with a turquoise mint coloured roof and the name Pen-Y-Cog. This is to celebrate {{the history of the}} area as Pen-Y-Cog is the original name for Penicuik. These buses were de-branded in 2014 due to high fuel consumption of the B7TL's used and the 37/47/X37 is now worked by standards liveries Volvo B9TL's.|$|E
