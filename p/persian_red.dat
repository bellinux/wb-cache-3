Historically European vermilion often included adulterants including brick, orpiment, iron oxide, <b>Persian</b> <b>red,</b> iodine scarlet—and minium (red lead), an inexpensive and bright but fugitive lead-oxide pigment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1920, Dzerzhinsky sent Blumkin to the Iranian {{province}} of Gilan, on the Caspian Sea, where the Forest Party {{under the leadership of}} Mirza Koochak Khan had established a secessionist government called the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic. On 30 May 1920, Blumkin, with his penchant for intrigue, fomented a coup d'état which drove Koochak Khan and his party from power and replaced them with the Bolshevik-controlled Iranian Communist Party. The new government, nominally headed by Kuchak Khan's second-in-command, Ehsanollah Khan, was dominated by the Russian Commissar, Abukov. He commenced a series of radical reforms which included the closing of mosques and confiscating money from the rich. Blumkin became chief of the General Staff of the <b>Persian</b> <b>Red</b> Army. An army was raised with the intention of marching on Tehran and bringing Persia under the Red Banner.|$|E

40|$|The {{catastrophic event}} of red tide has {{happened}} in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman from late summer 2008 to spring 2009. With its devastating effects, the phenomenon shocked all the countries located in the margin of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and caused considerable losses to fishery industries, tourism, and tourist and trade economy of the region. In the maritime cruise carried out by the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman Ecological Research Institute, field data, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and algal density were obtained for this research. Satellite information was received from MODIS and MERIS and SeaWiFS sensors. Temperature and surface chlorophyll images were obtained and compared with the field data and data of PROBE model. The results obtained from the present research indicated that with the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HAB), the Chlorophyll-a and the dissolved oxygen contents increased in the surface water. Maximum algal density was seen in the northern coasts of the Strait of Hormuz. Less concentration of algal density was detected in deep and surface offshore water. Our results show that the occurred algal bloom was the result of seawater temperature drop, water circulation and the adverse environmental pollutions caused by industrial and urban sewages entering the coastal waters in this region of the <b>Persian</b> Gulf,This <b>red</b> tide phenomenon was started in the Strait of Hormuz and eventually covered about 140, 000 km 2 of the Persian Gulf and total area of Strait of Hormuz and it survived for 10 months which is a record amongst the occurred algal blooms across the world. Temperature and chlorophyll satellite images were proportionate to the measured values obtained by the field method. This indicates that satellite measurements have acceptable precisions and they can be used in sea monitoring and modeling...|$|R
40|$|Undersown {{cover crop}} species {{introduced}} for weed management purposes should ideally combine adequate weed suppression with only marginal negative competitive {{effects on the}} main crop. The aim {{of this research was}} to identify the growth characteristics of clover species that determine weed suppressive ability and competitive ability against the main crop. In addition, the variation in these characteristics among clover species was determined, to identify whether species selection is {{an important component of the}} optimization of living mulch systems. In 2001, a field experiment was conducted in which weed suppression and competitive ability against leek of eight clover types was determined. Based on the results, three contrasting clover types were selected and their weed suppressive ability was further investigated in a field experiment conducted in 2002. Results of both experiments were related to growth characteristics that were simultaneously determined and described in a previous paper. Correlation analysis showed that the competitive effect of clover on transplanted leek was strongly correlated with maximum canopy height, indicating that yield reduction was mainly caused by competition for light. Subterranean clover, being the shortest species, gave inadequate weed suppression, whereas all other species were found to provide at least reasonable weed suppression. Subterranean clover reduced individual leek plant dry weight more strongly (60 %) than expected based on its canopy height. Indications were found that this clover species was hindering the uptake of nitrogen by leek. Clover species with superior weed suppression, like <b>Persian</b> clover, <b>red</b> clover, alsike clover, berseem clover and crimson clover also gave the strongest negative effect on dry matter accumulation of leek (reductions between 70 % and 90 %). White clover was found to give the best compromise between adequate weed suppression and mild yield reduction, though also with this species reduction in leek plant dry weight was still 60 %. It was concluded that for optimization of systems that introduce clover species as a weed suppressing cover crop species selection is important element, though additional management to restrict the competitive effect on the main crop remains a requirement...|$|R
5000|$|Carla Lavatelli's sculptures {{reside in}} many {{prominent}} museum and private collections across the United States and Europe, {{as well as}} in public and communal spaces and university campuses. Notable examples include her first abstract work, Ginko Biloba (1971), carved from <b>red</b> <b>Persian</b> travertine, which is located in the Phillips Collection in Washington DC. The work had been gifted to the Phillips by Lavatelli in 1974,on the occasion of her exhibition there the same year. Other important works include Stele For a Prayer (1971), a monolithic work in white Carrara marble and slate in the collectin of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Her carved stone and silver jewelry, which she called [...] "Sculptures to Wear" [...] are {{in the collection of the}} Minneapolis Institute of Arts.Several versions of Lavatelli's large-scale abstract sculpture in bronze and stainless steel, 1 ½ (1969-70), are in the museum collections of American universities, including Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA and Brown University in Providence, RI. Originally installed on the Stanford campus in front of the law school, the sculpture was restored in 1996 by Lavatelli and relocated to Fairchild Chapel. At Brown, 1 ½ has been on view in front of the brutalist high-rise Science Library building since it was installed there in 1975. Bill Van Siclen, an arts writer for the Providence Journal, remarked in a 2007 article that Lavatelli’s 1 ½ resembled a “giant chrome-plated engine part,” and that “had she not become a sculptor, the Italian-born Lavatelli clearly had a future as a sports car designer.”In 1978, Lavatelli was commissioned to install a spherical bronze sculpture in a newly created pond at the Botanical Gardens in Freiburg, Germany, which she titled Golden Pond, and which is still on view. During the 1990s, she presented several temporary and permanent site-specific installations, including [...] "happenings" [...] involving paper and reed sculptures in Pistoia, Italy and New York City. In 1995, the town of Mougins, France commissioned her to create a stone bench installation with a fountain set into a rough-hewn travertine for the plaza of the Place du Banc des Amis off the Rue d'Eglisse. [...] She was presented with the town's honorary Gold Medal upon its unveiling in 1995.|$|R
