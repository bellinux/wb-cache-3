40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A computational investigation into the development of surface topographies subjected to energetic particle bombardment has been undertaken. Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and on-the- y kinetic Monte Carlo (otfKMC) techniques were employed and di erent bombardment conditions were considered. Surface topography development is of interest due to applications such as ion etching, {{which can be used}} in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. Crater formation on a HfO 2 -MgO interface system was investigated using a variety of methods. Initially single atom and cluster bombardments were performed, highlighting the radiation tolerance of the interface system. Subsequently, swift heavy ion bombardment of the interface was considered using a MD thermal spike model and an electron stripping with recombination model. Both models gave similar results to those seen experimentally: hillocks forming on the surfaces over the impact points of the ions; and ion tracks forming around the paths of the ions in the material. Hillock heights and sputtering yields were shown to increase linearly with the electronic stopping force of the bombarding ion, for the range of systems we considered. Bullet impacts on armour <b>plating</b> (<b>SiC)</b> have been simulated using MD. The bullet was modelled by a hard sphere that was forced into the substrate to the target depth. Both 4 H and 6 H SiC polytypes were considered with di erent bullet sizes and speeds. The 4 H system resulted in the displacement of less atoms and also a much lower sputtering yield than for the similar 6 H system. However dislocations were seen to propagate through the 4 H system but not the 6 H one. A large amount of sputtering was observed in the higher speed 6 H simulations, with the ejection of many big clusters of atoms. These clusters generally had a high temperature (around 1, 500 K) with speeds typically in excess of 1, 000 m/s. Surface topography development by way of multiple impacts on Au was investigated using two di erent methodologies. Initially a traditional, MD based, methodology was used to model Au self bombardment of the high index f 3 11 0 g surface, which has been shown to produce interesting features. The disadvantage of this type of method is that MD cannot simulate time scales long enough to allow di usion between impacts. The MD method was shown to lead to a build up of defects in the systems: a result of the artificially high dose rate. An improved method was then used to model Ar and Au bombardment of both f 0 1 0 g and f 3 11 0 g Au surfaces. This hybrid MD-otfKMC technique enabled realistic time scales to be achieved. MD was used to model the ballistic phase while otfKMC was used to model di usion between events. The erosion rate of the surface was shown to be almost linear with time while the roughness of the surface was shown to oscillate: indicative of the healing process that occurs between bombardment events...|$|E

30|$|In this study, the {{performance}} of silicon nanowires for the harnessing of solar thermal energy was evaluated experimentally. Measurements of the optical properties of silicon nanowire arrays were conducted. Drying experiments of a porous <b>SiC</b> <b>plate</b> were carried out to investigate the enhancement of the solar thermal energy harvested and utilized by the silicon nanowire arrays. The {{results showed that the}} drying rate of the porous <b>SiC</b> <b>plate</b> covered by the silicon nanowire plate was greater than that with the plain silicon. Theoretical estimations of the fraction of solar irradiation energy absorbed by the drying system (<b>SiC</b> <b>plate</b> covered by silicon or silicon nanowire plate) were carried out using the thermal radiation theory and measurement of the optical properties of the silicon and silicon nanowire arrays, respectively. The theoretical results suggest that use of the silicon nanowire array leads to a 17.8  % increase in the overall harvest of solar thermal energy. These results can be utilized to evaluate hybrid solar energy systems such as silicon-based solar cells and solar heaters with silicon nanostructures to improve both the photovoltaic and solar thermal efficiency simultaneously.|$|R

At the interface between Si(l) and the BN substrate, a discontinuous Si 3 N 4 layer is believed to form and might retard the dissolution of BN into molten silicon. The BN substrate is regarded as being the most suitable substrate for supporting a molten silicon drop during surface tension measurements, due to the large contact angle and low contamination.

40|$|We propose an {{experiment}} {{for measuring the}} effective Casimir pressure between two parallel <b>SiC</b> <b>plates</b> with aligned nuclear spins. The prospective constraints on an axion-neutron coupling constant for both hadronic and GUT axions are calculated using the process of one-axion exchange. For this purpose, a general expression for the additional pressure arising between two polarized plates due to the exchange of one axion between their constituent fermions is derived. We demonstrate that only the polarization component perpendicular to the plates contribute to the pressure. The obtained pressure can be both repulsive and attractive {{depending on whether the}} polarizations of both plates are unidirectional or directed in opposite directions. It is shown that although the constraints on an axion-electron coupling obtained in the case of magnetized plates are not competitive, the constraints on an axion-neutron coupling found for plates with polarized nuclear spins are of the same order of magnitude of those obtained previously for the GUT axions alone using the process of two-axion exchange. The proposed experiment allows also to strengthen the presently known constraints on the axion-neutron coupling constants of GUT axions by using both processes of one- and two-axion exchange.

40|$|The {{fracture}} strength of silicon carbide (<b>SiC)</b> <b>plate</b> deposits produced by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) was determined from room-temperature to 1500 C using a standard 4 -point flexural test method (ASTM Cl 161). CVD SiC materials produced by two different manufacturers are {{shown to have}} only slightly different flexural strength values, which appear to result from differences in microstructure. Although CVD deposition of SiC results in a textured grain structure, the flexural strength was shown to be independent of the CVD growth direction. The orientation of machining marks was shown {{to have the most}} significant influence on flexural strength, as expected. The {{fracture strength}} of tubular forms of SiC produced by CVD deposition directly onto a mandrel was comparable to flexural bars machined from a plate deposit. The tubular (o-ring) specimens were much smaller in volume than the flexural bars, and higher strength values are predicted based on Weibull statistical theory for the o-ring specimens. Differences in microstructure between the plate deposits and deposits made on a mandrel result in different flaw distributions and comparable strength values for the flexural bar and o-ring specimens. These results indicate that compression testing of o-rings provides a more accurate strength measurement for tubular product forms of SiC due to more representative flaw distributions...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{different}} {{amounts of}} titanium hydride were blended with commercial pure (CP) titanium to fabricate titanium parts using conventional powder metallurgy and container-less Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). Titanium composites reinforced with SiC particulates {{have also been}} prepared. In order to restrict the detrimental reactions between SiC and Ti during the fabrication, electroless nickel plating has been applied {{on the surface of}} SiC. Four different routes have been employed to produce the Ti specimens from Ti/TiH 2 mixture through Sintering-HIP techniques. Route 1 : Ti/TiH 2 mixture was vacuum-sintered at 1200 °C for 120 min and then HIP was employed at 1000 °C for 120 min under 150 MPa. Route 2 : Vacuum-sintering was performed at 1200 °C for 90 min, followed by HIP at 1000 °C for 90 min, under 150 MPa. Route 3 : Vacuum-sintering was accomplished at 1100 °C for 90 min and followed by HIP at 1000 °C for 90 min under 150 MPa. Route 4 included vacuum-sintering at 1100 °C for 90 min, followed by HIP at 1000 °C for 90 min under 100 MPa. It was found that the densification and hardness of the blended Ti parts increased with increasing amounts of TiH 2 added. The grain refinement of the product was also achieved {{as a result of the}} TiH 2 addition. Containerless HIP of pure Ti (500 mesh) cannot be carried out at a temperature lower than 1100 °C because of the presence of surface connecting porosity. When pure Ti with a size of 250 mesh was used, a temperature of more than 1200 °C was required for containerless HIP. This illustrated the advantageous effect of TiH 2 blending. In addition, the compacts of large size particles required a higher sintering temperature to reach the same density as that of compacts using finer powders. Route 4 has been identified as the optimized processing route for fabrication of Ti products via Sinter-HIP. Moreover, the hardness of the final products was increased as TiH 2 was added, owing to the grain size refinement and improved densification. Unfortunately, electroless Ni <b>plating</b> of <b>SiC</b> reinforcement was found to be of little use. When nickel layer was deposited on SiC, reactions still exists between SiC and Ti. But the reaction zone was smaller compared to those without Ni coating on SiC. This may be attributed to the dissolution of Ni into Ti matrix at high temperature; hence the effect of protection was lost...|$|R
40|$|HycycleS was a {{cooperation}} of nine European partners and further non-European partners and {{aimed at the}} qualification and enhancement of materials and components for key steps of solar and nuclear powered thermochemical cycles for hydrogen generation from water. The focus of HycycleS was the decomposition of sulphric acid (H 2 SO 4) which is the central step of the sulphur-based family of those processes. Emphasis was put on materials and components for H 2 SO 4 evaporation, decomposition, and sulphur dioxide separation. The suitability of materials and components was emonstrated by decomposing H 2 SO 4 and separating its decomposition products in scalable prototypes. Silicon Carbide (SiC) turned out as the material of choice for the components facing the most corrosive environment of the process: the sulphuric acid evaporator and decomposer. Candidate catalysts for the high temperature reduction of sulphur trioxide have been screened and analysed. CreFe mixed oxide (Fe 0. 7 Cr 1. 3 O 3) was the most promising material among the ones examined. Based {{on the use of}} the highlighted construction and catalyst materials prototype decomposers have been developed and tested. The successful fabrication and testing of a large size heat exchanger/reactor prototype composed of <b>SiC</b> <b>plates</b> shows promise with respect to its use for H 2 SO 4 composition in the SI and HyS cycle. A solar specific decomposer prototype was developed, realised and successfully tested on sun in a solar furnace. A novel approach of using dense oxygen transport membranes, made from complex ceramics, for oxygen removal from the H 2 SO 4 decomposition product in order to shift the equilibrium in favour of increased decomposition was investigated. The membranes stability and suitability for carrying out this separation was investigated experimentally.

40|$|Ion {{implantation}} and diffusion couple {{experiments were}} used to study silver transport through and release from CVD silicon carbide. Results of these experiments show that silver does not migrate via classical diffusion in silicon carbide. Silver release is, however, likely dominated by vapor transport through cracks in SiC coatings. The results of silver ion implantation in silicon carbide and subsequent annealing at 1500 Ê»C place an upper limit on the silver diffusion coefficient in SiC of 5 x 10 - 21 m 2 /s, a value which is roughly 6 orders of magnitude less than the previous values reported in the literature. Silver diffusion should have been easily observable, but was not detected in <b>SiC</b> <b>plates</b> after heat treatments at 1500 Ê»C for times ranging between 200 h and 500 h. A detailed investigation of the silver morphology within the SiC {{both before and after}} heating showed that silver was immobilized at SiC grain boundaries and did not diffuse along them as expected. Novel spherical diffusion couples were fabricated containing silver inside shells of either graphite or SiC which were coated with CVD SiC. Mass measurements clearly revealed silver release from the diffusion couples after heating, but no silver was detected during concentration profile measurements in the SiC. Leak testing results, however, gave evidence of the presence of cracks in many of the SiC coatings, which may have provided pathways for silver escape. A simple vapor flow model was applied to estimate crack sizes that would account for silver release from SiC coatings in the current diffusion couples and coated fuel particle tests from the literature. (cont.) These calculated crack sizes are small enough that they would not have been detected during normal investigation or post-irradiation examination. A diffusive mechanism has been assumed to control silver transport in silicon carbide based on silver release observations reported previously in the literature, but no direct evidence of silver diffusion has been offered. Additionally, variations in silver release from particle to particle indicate that silver transport does not occur equally in all silicon carbide samples and is not consistent with diffusion. The findings presented in this dissertation are important to coated particle fuel design and fabrication because they indicate that SiC can successfully retain silver but that some SiC coatings permit silver release. Future work must be directed at identifying the pathways for silver release and their root causes in order to prevent silver release from coated fuel particles. by Heather J. MacLean. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline <b>SiC</b> clamping <b>plates,</b> all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The clamping plates are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one clamping plate. Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this clamping plate. Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other clamping <b>plate.</b> Piezoresistive single-crystal <b>SiC</b> thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two clamping plates are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom clamping plate. The top clamping plate is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top clamp plate aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|R
