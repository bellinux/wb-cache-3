A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Court {{has several}} emblems and carvings bearing {{the image of}} a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found {{throughout}} the house. The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman writings also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian to stay put and wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around the supper table, {{as to whether or not}} Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church bells of the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester and Strode.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s {{generally}} regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place {{as one of}} the great English poems. In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, [...] "At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what sort of man he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and what he hoped for from eternity." [...] Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, [...] "no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in." [...] Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was [...] "perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English." [...] Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, [...] "Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways." [...] Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that [...] "For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem." [...] She continued by praising the poem: [...] "Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable." [...] In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was [...] "frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{problems}} with this interpretation, however. [...] The chariot {{is not one of}} victory. [...] It would be unusual for a two-horse chariot to be used for the triumph. [...] Also, Tiberius wears the toga. [...] The toga represents civility and peace, not war. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a way to hand the victory to Augustus’ auguries. [...] Tiberius steps down from the chariot, doing obeisance to Augustus, giving his adoptive parent the triumph and victory. [...] If all this is true, then figure #8 could still be one of two persons, Drusus or Germanicus. [...] By this age, Drusus was probably already dead, having fallen from his horse and suffered irreparable injuries. [...] It could be, then, a representation of Drusus, and his memory, since he was fondly regarded by almost all. [...] Since he is clad in fighting garb, the helmet probably beside him under the chariot, and coincidentally standing next to a horse, this could very well be Drusus. [...] In addition, there are three constellations relating to the three portraits. [...] Drusus would claim Gemini, though the Gemini is quite covert.

At low Masses said on Palm Sunday (when palms are not distributed, as they should not be, unless <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the only Mass on that day) the Last Gospel is the one that is appointed for the ceremony of the blessing of the palms.
