The comparison is based upon two different experimental conditions of stimuli presentation. The first condition (called concentricity) provides for variable stimuli with dimensions smaller than, equal to, or greater than the standard stimulus used for paired comparison.

This after-effect was characterized as both a shift in the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> subjective <b>equality</b> and an increase in response uncertainty. The after-effect transferred across adapting pattern contrast and adaptor amplitude, suggesting an involvement from shape-specific mechanisms located at higher processing stages along the visual pathway. Moreover, our results suggested that the shift in the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> subjective <b>equality</b> was guided by global processing mechanisms, whereas the increase in uncertainty reflected activity from local processing mechanisms.

It is those individuals who have most difficulty in securing the basics that are essential to living their lives with dignity. Women in all communities are disproportionately represented among the poor. Thus, human rights have gender equity as a central focus. Put another way, we are dealing with the feminization of poverty.

We develop a new definition <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity and show {{how it can be}} implemented empirically. <b>Equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity is defined as the situation where income distributions conditional on social origin cannot be ranked according to stochastic dominance criteria. Stochastic dominance is assessed using non-parametric statistical tests. We measure social origin by parental education and occupation and use national household surveys to assess inequality of income and opportunities. USA and Italy show up as the most unequal countries both in terms of outcome and opportunity. At the opposite extreme, income distributions conditional on social origin are very close in Scandinavian countries even before any redistributive policy. The analysis highlights that inequality of outcome and inequality of opportunity can sometimes lead to different pictures. For instance, France and Germany experience a similar level of inequality of income but the former country is much more unequal than the latter from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity.

The origin of the dynamical transition in glass-forming glycerol is studied here by extensive molecular dynamics simulations.

Both the translational and rotational dynamics of glycerol show a dynamic crossover from the structural to a secondary relaxation at {{the temperature of the}} dynamical transition. A significant and discontinuous increase in the orientational Kirkwood factor and in the dielectric constant is observed in the same range of temperatures.

The increase in the dielectric constant is related to the dynamic freezing of dipolar domains on the time-scale of simulations. Comment: Paper is merged with the supplemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{place of}} Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) in the UK {{provides}} an interesting area of study. As of 2015, it is a platform {{which has been}} in existence for twenty years. During that time its position has been nebulous. It represents only one method of listening to radio output in a digital format but one in which the BBC, and latterly, the commercial radio sector, placed a huge degree of trust. It has however not become the standard mode of radio listening. One can argue that after much proactive effort from within the UK radio industry, its position may be beginning to falter somewhat in the commercial sector while remaining a paramount policy objective for the BBC. The aim of this thesis is to account for the emergence of DAB {{and its impact on the}} relationship between the BBC and the commercial radio sector. It examines the separate and joint roles of each in promoting DAB and highlights how this led to a unique period of cooperation between the two. A historical backdrop is necessary in order to establish the previous state of relations, before embarking upon the core of the thesis which argues that both parties adopted significant changes of posture in order to promote DAB. I argue that the implementation of DAB as a new radio technology represents a marked period of institutional change within the UK radio industry. In playing distinct, separate roles, I show how this reveals a maturity within the industry whereby the BBC and the commercial sector reached a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality.</b> In promoting a joint role, based on a policy of overt cooperation, I demonstrate how this represented a major shift in the historical relationship between both parties. Relying on a small canon of secondary sources and an extensive survey of primary source documentation, as well as interviews with some of the key players in DAB and the UK radio industry as a whole, this thesis provides a study of a significant period in British radio history which witnessed the development of a nascent radio platform, coupled with a significant change in the dynamic of existing relationships within the industry. In doing so, it delivers a wider historical interpretation of a particular point in radio history and marks a critical phase when the very nature of the industry changed...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 197 - 214). This {{study is}} {{an investigation of}} some of the developmental challenges facing transition economies. The thesis provides empirical and theoretical analyses on some of the institutional and macroeconomic challenges experienced by transition economies along their developmental trajectory. The thesis begins with an analysis of the reallocation of resources. Chapter 2 presents a model in which two groups in society are engaged in strategic interaction. Privileged members of society have the opportunity to allocate resources either to their own productive capacity, or to enhance the productive capacity of the disadvantaged. Redistribution to the disadvantaged can increase the productive capacity of society, but comes at the cost of rising political aspirations of the poor, which erodes the power of the rich. The results of the model derive possible political outcomes for society under which the rich will redistribute to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> with the poor; conditions under which the disadvantaged face genocide; as well as the range of intermediate redistributive activity likely to be employed by the privileged. Transition economies also face limited infrastructure development. This is especially true for countries in post-conflict situations. Increasing levels of infrastructure expenditure is argued to {{have a positive effect on}} growth. Chapter 3 analyses the impact of economic and social infrastructure on economic growth for a specific transition economy - South Africa. South Africa experienced a declining trend in physical infrastructure development. over the recent past. The econometric results find that while economic infrastructure has a positive effect on output, social infrastructure has no effect. Crowding out effects arising from both economic and social infrastructure expenditure are also discovered. The data also reveals that both output and private investment have a positive effect on economic and social infrastructure expenditure. The short term fluctuations in output, employment and labour productivity in South Africa are also investigated. The empirical evidence of negative correlation between employment and labour productivity contradicts the hypothesis of standard real business cycle theory. A model with monopolistic competition, sticky prices, and variable effort is shown to be able to account for the empirical findings. The findings indicate that technology shocks generate a negative co-movement between labour productivity and employment in South Africa. In addition, the degree of monetary accommodation, returns to labour and the degree of price stickiness and imperfect competition affects economic fluctuations in employment and labour productivity due to technology and demand shocks. Moreover, they affect the response of prices, real money balances and real interest rates to a technology shock...|$|E
