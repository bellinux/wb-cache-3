40|$|BACKGROUND: Renal diets are {{arguably the}} most {{restrictive}} for any patient group, {{and many of the}} restrictions contradict current recommendations for healthy eating. OBJECTIVES. This study aims to explore the knowledge and beliefs of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients about the role of diet in their disease presentation and management. METHODS: Focus groups (FG) with nephrology and dialysis patients informed the development of a questionnaire. Patient experiences and knowledge of diet-disease links and their education needs were explored. RESULTS: Renal diets were not always perceived as compatible with other dietary advice, and often difficult to integrate with family and social occasions. Eighty <b>percent</b> respondents <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like to receive dietary advice as soon as they know they have renal damage. Renal dietitians were identified as the most reliable and trustworthy source of dietary information, followed by renal specialist doctors.

As a result, DOD {{should be in a}} better position to implement its stated policy of relying on the private sector first for housing. DOD cannot expect a substantial increase in retention solely as a result of higher housing allowances. Together, housing and housing allowances were cited by less than one percent of those surveyed as reasons for leaving the military. Overall, of those living in military housing, more were satisfied than dissatisfied. Of those living in civilian housing, a high proportion were satisfied with the homes they chose.

To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} a 2008 Medicaid policy in Massachusetts (MA), regarding reimbursing physicians for providing fluoride varnish (FV) to eligible children in medical settings. Data Source. Survey of a sample of primary care physicians in MA. Study Design. Cross-sectional survey of a sample of physicians who provide care to MassHealth (MA Medicaid) enrolled-children. Dependent variables: history of completed preventive dental skills training, and FV provision. Independent variables: oral health knowledge, FV-attitudes, and physician and practice characteristics. Principal Findings. Overall, 19 percent of respondents had completed the training required to be eligible to bill for FV provision. Only 5 percent of physicians were providing FV. Most respondents (63 percent) were not familiar with the new policy, and only 25 percent felt that FV should be provided during well-child visits. Most physicians (60 percent) did not feel that the reimbursement rate of U.

40|$|Background: Pakistan is {{witnessing}} a massive wave of migration of doctors to greener pastures. This has serious implications for our public health services. We conducted this survey {{to find out}} the intentions of undergraduate students of Dow Medical College (DMC) about their post graduate career choices. Methods: A self-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data about students’ demographic characteristics, their intention to stay in Pakistan or go abroad for post graduation; the subject <b>they</b> <b>would</b> choose for specialization; the country <b>they</b> <b>would</b> choose to go to, and whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> return after specialization. Questionnaires were administered to students of third year, fourth year and final years MBBS. Confidentiality was maintained by keeping the questionnaire anonymous. Data was analyzed by SPSS software 17. Results: Of the total 237 students who returned the completely filled questionnaires, 183 (77 %) wished to go abroad. Eighty eight students (37 %) wanted to go to USA, 45 (19 %) to United Kingdom, 17 (7 %) to Canada and 17 (7 %) to Saudi Arabia. The main reason for going abroad was better post graduation facilities (71 %). Fifty six <b>percent</b> students <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like to come back some years after post graduation. Thirty one percent students chose Internal Medicine for specialization; only 11 % females and 22 % males chose Obstetrics and Gynecology and General Surgery respectively.

Thirty-nine {{percent of respondents}} believe certification is necessary on private land, but nearly 60 percent believe state, federal and tropical forests should be certified. Respondents believe that certification is being promulgated primarily from non-governmental environmental organizations (NGOs) with consumer demand ranked last.

In 1974, several hundred people travelled to North West Cape from around Australia to protest and occupy the base. Anti-Americanism supposedly exists among school teachers in Australia, which has been condemned by conservative politicians. In August 2005, Treasurer Peter Costello condemned anti-American sentiment by teachers and criticised the teaching of history in Australian schools.

40|$|Background. This study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} the acceptability of a Latest Date of Delivery (LDD) system of managing pregnancy. An LDD is the date at 42 weeks on which labour will be induced if a woman has not delivered by then. This study examined whether women under conventional expected date of delivery (EDD) management would find an LDD system acceptable in principle, and whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> prefer it to the EDD system. An additional objective was to examine changes in state anxiety in late pregnancy, post-term, and after delivery. Methods. This was a preliminary survey of women's attitudes towards an LDD system. Sixty-two women under normal pregnancy management completed questionnaires about the acceptability of an LDD system at 36 weeks gestation. In addition, questionnaires measuring state anxiety were completed at 36, 38, 40, and 41 weeks. Results. The majority of women evaluated an LDD system positively, with 64 % of women saying <b>they</b> <b>would</b> agree to an LDD and only 11. 3 % saying <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not. Forty <b>percent</b> of women <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> prefer an LDD to an EDD system and 36 % <b>said</b> <b>they</b> were not sure.

The LDD system appears to be acceptable to women and, for 40 % of women, preferable to the EDD. Anxiety appears to increase as women go post-term, but problems of attrition mean the results regarding anxiety should be treated cautiously.

Methods: Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a questionnaire. The performance with the filter paper method {{was assessed by}} comparing HbA 1 c results from EDTA-blood samples obtained via dried blood spots with HbA 1 c results obtained with freshly hemolyzed blood (routine HbA 1 c). Adult patients visiting the outpatient clinic for HbA 1 c analyses were recruited {{for the evaluation of}} dried blood spot sampling at home. Laboratory personnel collected a capillary blood sample on filter paper as well as a venous EDTA-blood sample. The participants collected another capillary blood sample at home and sent the dried filter paper back to the laboratory. Samples were analyzed with an immunoturbidimetric assay. Results: Between-filter coefficient of variation was 1. 8 %. Filter paper HbA 1 c increased slightly during storage, particularly during the first 5 days. Filter paper HbA 1 c highly correlated with routine HbA 1 c (r= 0. 987).

Objectives: This evaluation examined progress in abandoning FGM/C in ten woredas(districts) where strategy {{based on the}} social convention theory had led to official declarations of abandonment and assessed if the strategy could accelerate the declining trend of the FGM/C practice in Ethiopia. Method: Quantitative and qualitative instruments collected data from a document review, a household survey (1275 households), in-depth and key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Results: Overall, there were encouraging results in terms of awareness creation and behavioural change to some extent. Sixty-nine percent of women and 41 % of girls interviewed perceived {{a decline in the}} practice (range 40 % – 90 %) after the declaration. Seventy-six <b>percent</b> of women <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not circumcise girls in the future. The involvement of influential people such as religious leaders, elders, health extension workers, and law enforcement officials in the teaching contributed immensely to the awareness creation.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of Africans living in rural areas {{do not have access}} to health insurance and policy related questions to assist health planners design and implement financially viable rural health insurance schemes have yet to be fully addressed. This thesis seeks to fill some existing gaps in the knowledge about the performance of existing schemes and methods of assessing "willingness to pay" (WTP) and financial feasibility. It begins with a review of the literature on the theory of insurance and its practice in rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa, that contributed to the research conceptual framework and implementation. Two health insurance schemes (La Carte d'Assurance Maladie and the Abota in Burundi and Guinea Bissau), were evaluated regarding their social and financial performance in rural areas. The research instruments were household surveys, focus group discussions and health facility costing. In both schemes access to health care appeared to have improved and the findings suggested that were quality of care improved, the schemes would considerably reduce financial concerns faced by people at the time of illness. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> also raise significant revenue. In the third study country, Ghana, a study of preferred benefit options, WTP, and community rated premiums for a proposed health insurance scheme was undertaken in a rural area. In undertaking this feasibility study, the research developed a WTP instrument and used a contingent valuation approach. Eight hundred households participated in the study. Eighty <b>percent</b> of households <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be willing to pay the premium required to recover 100 % of the non-salary recurrent costs of providing OPD care in a local clinic and inpatient care in a hospital. The stated WTP was conditional on; a) the insurance scheme giving access to health care in which drugs and basic laboratory investigations would be available, b) health staff being professionally qualified and respectful, and c) a local solidarity association having a role in administering the participating health facilities. Econometric analysis of households' WTP for outpatient insurance cover supported the hypothesis that WTP is influenced by a) the experience of frequent difficulties in paying for health care in the past; b) the perception that adults in the household are healthier than those in other households; and c) the household head's sex, education and religion...|$|R
