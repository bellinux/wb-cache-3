40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} by which urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) prevents preterm premature rupture of fetal membrane and <b>premature</b> cervical <b>ripening</b> were investigated. We, therefore, {{examined the effects of}} UTI on the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which closely participate in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in cultured human uterine cervical fibroblasts and human chorionic cells. UTI suppressed specifically the production of interstitial procollagenase/proMMP- 1 and prostromelysin 1 /proMMP- 3 from both cells in a dose-dependent manner (0. 32 - 1. 28 μM). This suppression was accompanied by a decrease in steady-state levels of their mRNAs. These results indicate {{for the first time that}} UTI down-regulates the production of proMMP- 1 and proMMP- 3 accompanying with the decrease in the expression of their mRNAs, and therefore UTI actually participates in the maintenance of fetal membranes and/or uterine cervix by overall suppression of MMP production along with the known inhibitory actions towards serine proteinases...|$|R

50|$|It is {{not always}} easy to {{differentiate}} between the symptoms of SD and BLSD.

Large areas of leaf can be damaged causing a lowering of photosynthetic ability, a reduction in crop yield and <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> of the fruit. BLSD is the more serious of the diseases as the symptoms emerge on younger leaves and it affects many cultivars that have developed resistance to SD, including the plantain subgroup.|$|E
50|$|BXW {{symptoms}} can be sorted {{into two}} domains: symptoms on the inflorescence and symptoms on the fruit. Symptoms on the fruit are usually used to distinguish BXW from alternative banana diseases. A bacterial ooze is excreted {{from the plant}} organs {{and this is a}} mandatory sign that BXW may be present. Common symptoms on the fruit include internal discoloration and <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> of the fruit. A cross section of the BXW infected banana is characterized by the yellow- orange discoloration of the vascular bundles and dark brown tissue scaring. Symptoms on the inflorescence include a gradual wilting and yellowing of the leaves plus wilting of the bracts and shriveling of the male buds. Many factors may affect the combination of disease symptoms on show. These include the particular cultivar infected, how the disease has been transmitted and the current growing season.Symptoms normally appear within 3 weeks after infection, although the time taken to reach different stages of symptom expression may differ depending on the cultivar, plant growth stage, mode of disease transmission and environmental conditions. The symptoms expression were found to be faster in AAA-EA cooking varieties compared to ABB cultivars, in young plants compared to mature plants and during the wet season compared to the dry season. Infected plants show a progressive yellowing and wilting of the leaves, and uneven and <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> of the fruit. Male bud symptoms are firstly observed if an infection has occurred via the male inflorescence part, while leaf wilting symptoms are the first to be observed if the infection occurred via other plant parts such as roots, corm, leaf sheaths and leaves.|$|E
40|$|Preterm birth (PTB), or birth before 37 weeks gestation, is {{the leading}} cause of {{neonatal}} mortality worldwide. Cervical viral infections have been established as risk factors for PTB in women, although the mechanism leading to increased risk is unknown. Using a mouse model of pregnancy, we determined that intra-vaginal HSV 2 infection caused increased rates of preterm birth following an intra-vaginal bacterial infection. HSV 2 infection resulted in histological changes in the cervix mimicking cervical ripening, including significant collagen remodeling and increased hyaluronic acid synthesis. Viral infection also caused aberrant expression of estrogen and progesterone receptor in the cervical epithelium. Further analysis using human ectocervical cells demonstrated a role for Src kinase in virus-mediated changes in estrogen receptor and hyaluronic acid expression. In conclusion, HSV 2 affects proteins involved in tissue hormone responsiveness, causes significant changes reminiscent of <b>premature</b> cervical <b>ripening,</b> and increases risk of preterm birth.

40|$|Plantain (Musa spp., AAB group) {{cultivation}} {{is threatened}} by black sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet), an airborne fungal leaf spot disease. Several black-sigatoka-resistant tetraploid hybrids have been developed by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Resistance and yield performance of three hybrids were evaluated and compared with the maternal triploid plantain cultivar Obino l'Ewai with and without fungicide treatment. Plantain yield loss from black sigatoka was 33 %, as calculated from the difference in yield between the fungicide-treated and non-treated plantain (23. 5 and 15. 7 t ha- 1, respectively). Yield loss ensued from {{a reduction in the}} number of fruits per bunch and lower fruit weight. Black sigatoka also caused delayed flowering and harvest, and <b>premature</b> fruit <b>ripening.</b> Sigatoka evaluation at flowering indicated significantly less leaf spot damage in the three hybrids (TMPx 548 - 4, 548 - 9 and 597 - 4) as compared with the susceptible plantain. At harvest, however, hybrid TMPx 597 - 4 displayed a susceptible response, whereas hybrids TMPx 548 - 4 and 548 - 9 still showed field resistance. These two hybrids also had improved agronomic traits, such as high yield, shorter stature, earlier maturity and better suckering. Yield of TMPx 548 - 9 (33. 5 t ha- 1) was 43 % higher than that of the fungicide-treated and twice that of the nontreated plantain, suggesting that its higher yield was due not only to black sigatoka resistance, but also to heterosis. TMPx 597 - 4 had poor yield performance (12. 7 t ha- 1), indicating that tetraploidy per se does not increase yield. status: publishe...|$|R

This study acts as a feasibility study for a proposed ultrasonic technique for the identification of preterm birth risk factors using an acoustic technique known as Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging. A 3 D finite element model was constructed to optimize transducer ARFI parameters in a layered cervix structure prior to clinical evaluation. The transducer model optimized {{in this study was}} the AcuNav TM (Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA). Cervix model structural geometry and material properties were varied according to anticipated pregnancy induced property fluctuation. Transmitted ARFI acoustic fields were generated by applying a Field II derived pulse to the 3 D model[15]. Optimization procedures were performed in the following order: focal depth evaluation, transmit frequency optimization, effect of material property variation and the application of ARFI shear wave speed calculation algorithms to a layered cervical structure. Results indicated that ARFI evaluation of a layered cervix structure was most feasible using an 8 MHz transmit frequency in the focal range of 5 - 10 mm axial depth. It was observed that material property estimation errors were most likely when ARFI excitations were focused near a material boundary. A phenomenon was noted where shear waves initiated in stiffer media were slowed as a function of their relative proximity to a more compliant medium.

50|$|Like yellow sigatoka, black sigatoka, {{was first}} {{documented}} in the Sigatoka valley of Fiji. It was first recorded in 1964 and being more virulent tended to displace yellow sigatoka in banana crops. Therefore, yellow sigatoka is rarely found in locations where black sigatoka occurs. Black sigatoka infection appears on the leaves of crops during the unfurling. Sigatoka spores will incubate on the leaves {{for up to six}} days before penetrating the leaf. After this the infection will continue to colonize for a week before the plant exhibits symptoms. The initial symptoms are small spots on the undersides of the leaves. These appear 10-15 days after infection and grow until they appear as black streaks on the leaves. This is what gives black sigatoka its alternate name of black leaf streak. These streaks can dry out and collapse in less than a day. This affects growth and yield of bananas by reducing the total photosynthetic area of the leaf. However the largest effect on yields is through the toxins produced by black sigatoka that causes a <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> of the bananas.

40|$|Background: Preterm birth (PTB) {{is by far}} {{the leading}} {{worldwide}} cause of infant mortality and morbidity. Despite decades of research, the frequency of PTB has not decreased and the basic mechanisms initiating the onset of labour are still poorly understood. Vaginal preterm birth cannot take place without cervical softening and remodelling. Cervical ripening at term is an inflammatory-like process, in which complex interactions between cytokines, prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO) are believed to play key roles, with NO acting as the final mediator. An understanding of the mediators regulating this process in connection with spontaneous preterm labour is of equally great importance, e. g., when, due to maternal/foetal complications, induction of <b>premature</b> cervical <b>ripening</b> and onset of labour is desired. Aim: Compare preterm cervical ripening to the analogous process occurring at term. Methods: Transvaginal cervical biopsy specimens were obtained and serum samples taken. Women, exhibiting no clinical signs of infection and undergoing preterm labour with a ripe cervix or preterm birth without labour (unripe cervix) were compared to un-infected women delivering at term, with or without labour. Peripheral white blood cell counts (WBC) and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined by routine procedures in the clinical laboratory. The other parameters monitored and procedures employed were as follows: prostaglandin dehydrogenase, (PGDH), and cyclooxygenase, (COX) proteins (immunohistochemistry (IHC) and dual immunofluorescence) and mRNA Ls (Northern blot). NO synthase; bNOS, eNOS and iNOS proteins (IHC) and mRNA Ls (Real-time RT-PCR) IL- 6, IL- 8, MCP- 1, RANTES and TNF- ¿ proteins (ELISA/ Immulite) and IL- 8, MCP- 1 and RANTES mRNA (RT-PCR). Induction of cervical ripening and labour was performed using local administration of PgE 2 and/or intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Results: The only significant differences between women undergoing preterm and term labour were in the levels of expression of bNOS, eNOS, and iNOS mRNA Ls, which where all higher in the preterm group. Other significant changes were only seen upon comparisons of women undergoing and not undergoing labour, irrespective of the gestational age of the foetus. Thus, cervical levels of IL- 8 and MCP- 1 mRNA Ls and proteins, and of IL- 6 protein and serum WBC counts and levels of CRP were all higher in connection with labour. An indication of increased prostaglandin activity, i. e., reduced cervical expression of PGDH mRNA, was also observed in women in labour. In the clinical investigation induction of cervical ripening and labour with PgE 2 applied locally, preterm, term or at postterm was not associated with any differences, in the mode of delivery or neonatal outcome. The fact that postterm pregnancy is a high risk obstetric situation, was emphasized by the four-fold higher frequency of extensive postpartum bleeding, > 1000 ml, in this situation compared to labour at term. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that preterm cervical ripening involves an inflammatory process, which may constitute a normal physiological adaptation to the onset of labour. The elevations in WBC count and serum level of CRP are striking indicators of active labour. NO appears to {{play a crucial role in}} preterm cervical ripening, consistent with its presumed acting as the final mediator. Local application of PgE 2 to induce preterm cervical ripening and labour is effective and safe, for both mother and child...|$|R

Similar to the cervix before term, the preterm cervix of progesterone receptor antagonist-treated rats was characterized by reduced cell nuclei density, decreased collagen content and structure, as well as a greater presence of macrophages per unit area. Thus, loss of nuclear progesterone receptor-mediated actions promoted structural remodeling of the cervix, increased census of resident macrophages, and preterm birth much like that found in the cervix at term.

Fungal diseases caused appreciable losses of the rice crop in several years. Drechslera oryzae van Breda de Haan {{was found to}} be the major pathogen of rice. Its most conspicuous symptoms are leaf spots. Infection by D. oryzae was most severe during the reproductive phase of the rice plant. During that phase, the crop also showed a number of other symptoms such as discoloration of leaves, <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> with sterility, root decay, and matted roots. These symptoms together are designated as 'early senescence'. Brown leaf spotting caused by D. oryzae {{is just one of the}} group of symptoms constituting the syndrome. Severe infection by D. oryzae indicates poor rice-growing conditions. D. oryzae has the character of a perthophyte. The susceptibility of rice to infection by D. oryzae increases with the age of the plant. The fungus sporulates abundantly only on senescent leaves. Occurrence of epidemics is related to imbalance in development between the vegetative and the generative stages of the rice plant. This imbalance is induced by the incorporation of organic matter in the soil with tillage or the application of large amounts of nitrogen to the crop during the vegetative stage only. Early senescence of rice in the Wageningen Polder can be prevented by good tillage, balanced application of nitrogen, breeding and selection of cultivars specially adapted to marginal growing conditions. Control of D. oryzae with fungicides only takes away one of the causes of crop losses. Application of fungicides has not been economic. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Bananas are {{harvested}} {{at the green}} preclimacteric stage prior to sale. The time between harvest and the initiation of the natural ripening process is called green life. Black Leaf Streak Disease and Sigatoka Disease are the main foliar diseases affecting banana production. Sigatoka Disease (SD) is due to Mycosphaerella musicola, which frequently causes early ripening in commercial banana plantations, considered as {{an important source of}} damage. Our work aimed at determining the effectiveness of the removal of necrotic leaves, one month before harvest, on recovering banana quality arising from SD-infested plants. Materials and methods. Banana plants (totaling 80) at the flowering stage were selected in an experimental plot. These plants were divided into two groups of SD infestation levels: level 1 (Severity Index at flowering 25 %). We divided each group into two treatments: a treatment with no necrotic leaf removal and a treatment with necrotic leaf removal. Fruits were harvested at the same physiological age, at 900 degree-days. Fruit quality was characterized by weight, diameter, % of ripe fruit in the field and fruit green life. Results. Our results showed that the removal of necrotic leaves causes a reduction in size parameters but leads to a strong reduction in SD effects on the fruit maturity, thereby preventing <b>premature</b> <b>ripening.</b> Banana plants whose necrotic leaves were removed produced fruit with a very long green life. Discussion. Removal of necrotic leaves allows thwarting the negative effect of SD on fruit physiology. This shows that the presence of necrosis during the last month of fruit growth is responsible for this fruit physiological modification characterized by early ripening. Conclusion. Removal of necrotic leaves one month before the date of harvest may be a technique that can limit production losses when the infestation level by SD is high. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Realization {{of genetic}} yield {{potential}} of winter wheat {{depends on a}} large number of environmental factors among which rainfall level and air temperature are particularly important. Because of frequent rainfall shortages on the territory of Serbia in the period of wheat sowing in the fall and the vegetation in the spring, {{it is not possible to}} realize maximum yields, i. e., to reach the full genetic yield potential. In this situation, irrigation practice may be a solution needed to provide optimum soil moisture throughout the wheat growing season. Irrigation response of ten winter wheat varieties (Evropa, Avala, Pobeda, Balkan, Slavija, Milica, NS Rana 5, NS 4339, Nova Jadranka and Proteinka) was studied in the period 1993 - 1995. The varieties were irrigated at the time of sowing and during the growing period, the schedule being determined on the basis of soil moisture analysis and irrigation being performed at the soil moisture level of 70 - 75 % FWC. The three-year average yields obtained with and without irrigation were 6. 72 and 6. 47 t/ha, respectively. The average annual yields with and without irrigation were 7. 95, 6. 08 and 612 t/ha, and 7. 25, 6. 08 and 6. 09 t/ha, respectively. The variety Evropa was the best performer with 7. 03 t/ha in irrigation and 6. 58 t/ha without irrigation. The highest yield in irrigation, 8. 66 t/ha, was obtained in 1993. The average effect of irrigation was only 0. 25 t/ha, i. e., 4 %. This was due to relatively high rainfalls that occurred in all experiment years in the period when wheat had the highest water requirement. The relatively small irrigation doses could not be very effective in this situation. Furthermore, high temperatures occurred in June in all years, causing <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> of wheat. The differences in plant condition that existed between the irrigated and non-irrigated variants before June were thus eradicated and the yields were evened out...|$|E
40|$|Background: Phoma macdonaldii {{has been}} {{reported}} as the causal agent of black stem disease (BS) and <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> (PR) on sunflower. PR is considered as the most widespread and detrimental disease on sunflower in France. While genetic variability and QTL mapping for partial resistance of sunflower to stem, collar and roots attacks have been reported on plantlets in controlled conditions, this work aims to describe the genetic variability in a subset of a sunflower lines, {{and for the first}} time to map QTL involved in PR resistance evaluated in field conditions using controlled inoculation. Results: An efficient and reliable method for inoculation used in field experiments induced stem base necrosis on up to 98 % of all plants. A significant genetic variability for PR resistance in the field was detected among the 20 inbred lines of the core collection tested across the two years. For QTL mapping, the PR resistance evaluation was performed on two recombinant inbred lines (RIL) populations derived from the crosses XRQxPSC 8 and FUxPAZ 2 in two different years. QTL analyses were based on a newly developed consensus genetic map comprising 1007 non-redundant molecular markers. In each of the two RIL populations, different QTL involved in PR partial sunflower resistance were detected. The most significant QTL were detected 49 days post infection (DPI) on LG 10 (LOD 7. 7) and on LG 7 (LOD 12. 1) in the XRQxPSC 8 and FUxPAZ 2 RIL population, respectively. In addition, different QTL were detected on both populations for PR resistance measured between 14 and 35 DPI. In parallel, the incidence of natural attack of P. macdonaldii resulting in BS disease was recorded, showing that in these populations, the genetic of resistance to both diseases is not governed by the same factors. Conclusion: This work provides the first insights on the genetic architecture of sunflower PR resistance in the field. Moreover, the separate studies of symptoms on different organs and in time series allowed the identification of a succession of genetic components involved in the sunflower resistance to PR and BS diseases caused by Phoma macdonaldii along the development of the {plant * pathogen} interaction...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State UniversityEyespot is {{a chronic}} disease of winter wheat, caused by Oculimacula yallundae (OY) and O. acuformis (OA) {{that results in}} <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> of grain, lodging, and reduced grain yield. Discovery of the Oculimacula spp. teleomorph in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (PNW) is {{relatively}} recent {{and the role of}} apothecia or ascospores in the epidemiology of eyespot is unclear. Our goals were to determine the occurrence of OY and OA apothecia in commercial and inoculated field plots, to investigate when apothecia are produced and ascospores released, to determine persistence of apothecia to over summer and over winter, and to investigate factors influencing production of OY apothecia in vitro. Apothecia of OY and OA were found in spring and fall in commercial wheat fields, demonstrating that sexual reproduction occurs regularly in the PNW and may play a role as primary inoculum in the eyespot disease cycle. Apothecia survived over summer but not over winter in inoculated field plots. Occurrence of ascospores was monitored with Burkard spore traps in inoculated field plots. Ascospores of OY and OA were trapped during spring and fall, and there were no differences in the number of ascospores trapped from fields with a wheat crop or stubble. Number of ascospores m- 3 wk- 1 was positively correlated with relative humidity and weekly accumulated precipitation. Regression models based on environmental variables accounted for 27 to 36 % of the variation in number of ascospores trapped. The effect of media, host substrate, inoculation method, temperature, light and stress-shock preconditions on development of primordial and mature apothecia of OY were studied. Inoculation of winter wheat and spring barley straw segments with a suspension of conidia or mycelial plugs favored apothecia development; however, mature apothecia did not developed in treatments without host substrate. This research provides a base-line offering new insights into the role of the sexual stage of Oculimacula spp. in the epidemiology of eyespot. Understanding the incidence, seasonality and occurrence of apothecia and ascospores provides {{a better understanding of the}} role of ascospores as an inoculum source.

40|$|Take-all disease, {{caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is the most devastating root disease of wheat around the world. Typical {{take-all}} symptoms show as black necrotic lesions on the roots and when severe can cause <b>premature</b> <b>ripening</b> and stunting of the wheat crop, resulting in poor grain quality and yield loss. Both cultural and chemical control methods are moderately successful at controlling take-all but plant material that would be useful for take-all control via a genetic approach has not been identified in the UK or elsewhere. The main aim of this project was to identify resistance to take-all within wheat (Triticum spp.). This study explored a new phenomenon in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) which restricts take-all inoculum build-up (TAB) in the soil during a first wheat crop and also explored tissue based resistance to take-all in hexaploid wheat and a related diploid wheat species, Triticum monococcum. Forty-nine elite wheat varieties were evaluated {{for their ability to}} build-up take-all inoculum in first wheat field trials using a soil core bioassay method, and pedigree and molecular marker analyses were carried out to investigate the genetic sources of the TAB trait. The effect of a low or high TAB first wheat variety on take-all disease and yield in a following second wheat crop was evaluated in crop rotation field trials. This work demonstrated that there are significant differences between current elite wheat varieties screened for the TAB trait and that there are probably multiple genetic sources of the trait. Take-all disease was lower and yields generally higher in a second wheat crop after a low TAB first wheat. The susceptibility of fifty elite hexaploid wheat varieties and thirty-four T. monococcum accessions to take-all was evaluated in third wheat field trials. Both T. aestivum (variety Hereford) and T. monococcum (MDR 031 and MDR 046) genotypes with some partial resistance to take-all were identified. A seedling pot test method as a screen for resistance was also explored but the results were found not to be closely related to the susceptibility of adult plants in field trials. The implications of these new findings for the control of take-all and further research are discussed.
