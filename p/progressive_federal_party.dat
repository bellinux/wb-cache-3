25|$|During Malan's {{tenure in}} {{parliament}} as defence minister his greatest opposition came from MPs of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> such as Harry Schwarz and Philip Myburgh, who both served as shadow defence ministers {{at various points}} during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|As Prime Minister {{and later}} State President, his {{greatest}} parliamentary opponents were Harry Schwarz and Helen Suzman of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> until 1987, when his former cabinet colleague Andries Treurnicht's new Conservative Party became the official opposition on a strictly anti-concessionist agenda.|$|E
25|$|On 25 July 1975, the Reform Party {{merged with}} the Progressive Party to form the Progressive Reform Party. Schwarz became the party's {{spokesman}} on finance, education and Chairman of the Federal Executive, while Colin Eglin, the former leader of the Progressives was elected leader of the newly merged party. In 1977 the party was renamed the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party,</b> when additional defectors from the United Party joined. This served to finally realign opposition politics in South Africa, as the PFP became the official opposition party in South Africa, following the 1977 General Election.|$|E

5000|$|The Canadian federal {{elections}} use first-past-the-post voting {{which allows}} {{a party with}} minority support among the population to win {{the majority of the}} seats in the parliament. Given the current make-up of existing political parties, the progressive vote tends to splits between the <b>progressive</b> <b>federal</b> <b>parties,</b> the NDP, Liberals and Greens, which allows for the Conservatives to win a disproportional number of seats in the parliament compared to their popular support. This results in Conservative candidates winning seats in some ridings with as low as 30% of the vote in the riding.|$|R

500|$|The National Party, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of B. J. Vorster, appealed to the emotions of Afrikaner voters by depicting English-speaking white citizens as being guilty of Boerehaat. The National Party and its political mouthpiece Die Burger waged a [...] "Boerehaat campaign" [...] during a by-election in Oudtshoorn in 1972, depicting their United Party opposition, once supported by the majority of English-speaking voters, as Boerehaters, and won. The Nationalists also used the term to censure members of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> opposition party formed in 1977. After interviewing various South Africans including government officials during the early 1980s, American historian Otto Scott writes: [...] "This sort of xenophobic solidarity perceived the opposition as Boer haters." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the Conservative Party {{became the}} {{official}} {{opposition in the}} [...] House of Assembly, winning 550,000 votes, displacing the liberal <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party.</b> Donald Simpson, writing in the South African newspaper, The Star, {{went as far as}} to predict that the National Party would lose the next election and that the Conservative Party would become the new government of South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Noted {{for being}} outspoken by Craven, Du Plessis was soon {{in trouble with}} South Africa's rugby {{administration}} for wearing denim trousers with his Springbok blazer. His liberal views, {{in which he was}} influenced by Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, and his subsequent support for the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party,</b> also ran afoul of the conservative politics of rugby administrators. Nor was Du Plessis a stranger to controversial incidents during his domestic and international career. In the 1975 Springbok trials prior to the French tour, Du Plessis punched Kleintjie Grobler, knocking out the man that a journalist later described as [...] "pesky" [...] and an [...] "enforcer". Du Plessis and Grobler then played together on the national team against the Tricoleres that year. But probably the most notable incident involved Naas Botha, whom Du Plessis injured with a bone-crunching late tackle in the 1977 Currie Cup semifinal between Province and Northern Transvaal. The subsequent penalty kick by full-back Pierre Edwards was successful, and Province lost the match 17–15. The Loftus Versfeld faithful was so incensed that Du Plessis had to be escorted off the field by the police.|$|E

2500|$|Schwarz {{argued that}} if {{included}} in {{the constitution of the}} republic, it would act as a [...] "protector of rights many people had struggled to achieve in South Africa" [...] as well as to [...] "act as an inspiration" [...] to the people of South Africa and would [...] "be a unifying factor in a country in which unity of people is essential for survival". While virtually all MPs of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> supported the bill, no other party in Parliament supported it. Rejecting Schwarz’s proposal, Daan van der Merwe of the Conservative Party stated that the bill, based on a [...] "leftist-liberal political philosophy", would jeopardise the freedom of the white man. New Republic Party leader Vause Raw said Schwarz [...] "a master at platitudes" [...] was seeking idealistic freedoms that did not exist anywhere in the world. Following the rejection of Schwarz’s bill, fellow PFP MPs' Helen Suzman, Colin Eglin, Ray Swart and Dave Dalling attempted a further four times to introduce a Bill of Rights. The Bills' were effectively blocked by the National Party by placing them {{at the end of the}} order paper. The constitution of the new South Africa, signed into law in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights, which includes the same principles of the 1983 motion.|$|E
2500|$|While {{distinctly}} on {{the left}} of South African politics, he was perceived {{to be on the}} right-wing of the PFP mainly due to his favouring strong military defence and his insistence that political change must take place without the disruption of law and order, which earned him the nickname [...] "Harry the Hawk Schwarz". He often found himself in dispute with some members of the original Progressive Party, particularly Helen Suzman. Colleagues would often refer the clashes they had in the parliamentary caucus meetings as [...] "the Helen and Harry show". Suzman wrote of her relations with Schwarz in her autobiography, In No Uncertain Terms: A South African Memoir: following the merger between the PP and Schwarz's Reform Party [...] "I stayed in the party, but relations between Harry Schwarz and myself were very strained for some time thereafter. They improved only in 1986 when Frederik van Zyl Slabbert resigned from Parliament and the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party.</b> Harry Schwarz and I were the two most outraged members of the caucus, and our other differences faded into insignificance as a result. We developed a mutual respect for one another. Schwarz was an extremely able MP with a good financial brain, and a hard worker who could devastate National Party members in Parliament, especially Ministers of Finance, who feared his vigorous attacks. Like me, he could be unpleasant {{both in and out of}} the House. The differences we had were not on racial policy, but on his hawkish support of the South African Defence Force." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{policies}} of the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives (PCs) are very similar. The major differences are in their allegiances to <b>federal</b> <b>parties</b> and in personalities.

Whereas an {{extensive}} literature has developed {{on the broad}} conditions of crisis in South Africa in the seventies and eighties, and on the dynamic of state and popular responses to it, little focus has fallen on the reactions of the other key elements among the dominating classes. It is {{the aim of this}} dissertation to attempt to address an aspect of this lacuna by focussing on the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Party's</b> responses from 1981 until 1989. The thesis develops an understanding of the period as one entailing conditions of organic crisis. It attempts to show the PFP's behaviour in the context of structural and conjunctural crises. The thesis periodises the Party's policy and strategic responses and makes an effort to show its contradictory nature. An effort is made to understand this contradictory character in terms of the party's class location with respect to the white dominating classes and leading elements within it; in relation to the black dominated classes; as well as in terms of the liberal tradition within which the Party operated...|$|R
