500|$|After the American {{invasion}} of Afghanistan fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist sleeper cells in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror {{to a war}} on general perceived evils with the {{invasion of}} Iraq. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where Tony Blair uses {{the threat of terrorism}} to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay, many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance without actual investigation {{on the part of the}} United States military, and other forms of [...] "preemption" [...] against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a dirty bomb attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that <b>politicians</b> <b>will</b> eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, [...] "In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power." ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reforms to}} the {{provision}} of welfare services by the public sector have transferred control rights in production from politicians to managers and simultaneously introduced competition between public sector suppliers. We derive conditions under which a self-interested <b>politician</b> <b>will</b> introduce either competition and/or managerial control for services where quality matters. We show that both competition and managerial control give incentives for greater managerial effort. However the cost of competition is higher taxes {{and the cost of}} decentralisation is a loss of political benefits. The <b>politician</b> <b>will</b> introduce these reforms if the political benefits from higher value service outweigh these costs...|$|R
2500|$|A {{major source}} of ethnic {{conflict}} in multi-ethnic democracies is over the access to state patronage. Conflicts over state resources between ethnic groups can {{increase the likelihood of}} ethnic violence. In ethnically divided societies, demand for public good decreases as each ethnic group derives more utility from benefits targeted at their ethnic group in particular. These benefits would be less valued if all other ethnic groups had access to them.Targeted benefits are more appealing because ethnic groups can solidify or heighten their social and economic status relative to other ethnic groups whereas broad programmatic policies will not improve their relative worth. Politicians and political parties in turn, have an incentive to favor co-ethnics in their distribution of material benefits. Over the long run, ethnic conflict over access of sate benefits is likely to lead to the ethnification of political parties and the party system as a whole where the political salience of ethnic identity increase leading to a self-fulfilling equilibrium: If politicians only distribute benefits on an ethnic basis, voters will see themselves primarily belonging to an ethnic group and view politicians the same way. They will only vote for the politician belonging to the same ethnic group. In turn, <b>politicians</b> <b>will</b> refrain from providing public goods because it will not serve them well electorally to provide services to people not belonging to their ethnic group. In democratizing societies, this could lead to ethnic outbidding and lead to extreme politicians pushing out moderate co-ethnics. Patronage politics and ethnic politics eventually reinforce each other, leading to what Chandra terms a [...] "patronage democracy".|$|E
2500|$|Wengert's {{scholarship}} {{explored the}} politics {{of natural resources and}} environmental policy formation and administration, with emphases in national energy policy, urban water planning and management, land use planning and controls, national forest management, and citizen participation in administrative processes. At a time when environmental issues were nascent in the public consciousness, Wengert {{was one of the few}} political scientists applying their skills in this area. He achieved some early renown when his book Natural Resources and the Political Struggle which pioneered the revival of political economy in the United States found some popularity among scholars in 1955, but he is probably best known as coeditor and contributor of a timely anthology about the energy crisis that appeared coincidentally during the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, published by the prestigious American Academy of Political and Social Science. Later in his career he advanced a seminal theory of the [...] "politics of getting" [...] in which he asserted: [...] "American <b>politicians</b> <b>will</b> get as much as they can for their constituents, with only casual attention to the merits of the case and to the extent that they are not likely to be held directly accountable for costs". This theory was accepted by others and extended into the study of international relations and comparative politics. Unafraid of courting controversy, he also published a research monograph that argued that the U.S. Forest Service had substituted its professional values for the legal requirements of their Organic Act of 1897 by allowing timber to be clearcut on the national forests for almost 80 years before they were authorized to do so by the National Forest Management Act of 1976. Overall, he authored more than fifty monographs and studies on the political economy and public administration of environmental resources.|$|E

60|$|Thirdly, that, {{as long as}} {{it exists}} in France, it will be the {{interest}} of the managers there, and it is in the very essence of their plan, to disturb and distract all other governments, and their endless succession of restless <b>politicians</b> <b>will</b> continually stimulate them to new attempts.|$|E
60|$|One {{can hardly}} wonder then that this general {{corruption}} has extended {{even to the}} policemen who guard the Houses of Parliament. On the other hand this vein of corruption has not extended to English politics. Unlike ours, English politics,--one hears it on every hand,--are pure. Ours unfortunately {{are known to be}} not so. The difference seems to be that our <b>politicians</b> <b>will</b> do anything for money and the English politicians won't; they just take the money and won't do a thing for it.|$|E

25|$|Another {{critique}} {{points to}} the privileging of ethnic identity over personal political choice. Howard has deemed consociationalism {{as a form of}} ethnocracy and not a path to true pluralistic democracy. Consociationalism assumes that a <b>politician</b> <b>will</b> best represent the will of his co-ethnics above other political parties. This might lead to the polarization of ethnic groups and the loss of non-ethnic ideological parties.|$|R

60|$|At half-past four {{he was on}} {{his legs}} {{in the midst of a}} crowded House. The chance,--perhaps the hope,--of some such {{encounter}} as that of the former day, brought members into their seats, and filled the gallery with strangers. We may say, perhaps, that the highest duty imposed upon us as a nation is the management of India; and we may also say that in a great national assembly personal squabbling among its members is the least dignified work in which it can employ itself. But the prospect of an explanation,--or otherwise of a fight,--between two leading <b>politicians</b> <b>will</b> fill the House; and any allusion to our Eastern Empire will certainly empty it. An aptitude for such encounters is almost a necessary qualification for a popular leader in Parliament, as is a capacity for speaking for three hours to the reporters, and to the reporters only,--a necessary qualification for an Under-Secretary of State for India.|$|E
6000|$|By a {{circuitous}} route, indeed, the Marxist {{reaches a}} moral position curiously analogous {{to that of}} the disciple of Herbert Spencer. Since all improvement will arrive by leaving things alone, the worse things get, the better; for so much the nearer one comes to the final exasperation, to the class war and the Triumph of the Proletariat. This certainty of victory in the nature of things makes the Marxists difficult in politics, pedantic sticklers for the letter of the teaching, obstinate opponents of what they call [...] "Palliatives"--of any instalment system of reform. They wait until they can make the whole journey in one stride, and would, in the meanwhile, have no one set forth upon the way. In America the Marxist fatalism has found a sort of supreme simplification in the gospel of Mr. H. G. Wilshire. The Trusts, one learns, are to consolidate all the industry in the country, own all the property. Then when they own everything, the Nation will take them over. [...] "Let the Nation own the Trusts!" [...] The Nation {{in the form of a}} public, reading capitalistic newspapers, inured to capitalistic methods, represented and ruled by capital-controlled <b>politicians,</b> <b>will</b> suddenly take over the Trusts and begin a new system....|$|E
6000|$|But if any man {{dares to}} tell his fellow-men what Amos told them, and say, The kingdom of God is among you, and within you, and over you, whether you like or not, and you are in it; the Lord is King, be the people never so unquiet; and all power is given to Him in heaven and earth already; and at the last great day, when He comes in glory, He will show that He has been {{governing}} {{the world and the}} inhabitants thereof all along, whether they cared to obey Him or not:--if he tell men, that the righteousness of God means this--to pray for the Spirit of God and of Christ, that they may be perfect as their Father in heaven is perfect, and holy as Christ is holy, for without holiness no man shall see the Lord: if he tell men, that the wrath of God was revealed from heaven at the fall of man, and has been revealed continuously ever since, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, that indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish will fall upon every soul of man that doeth evil; and glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh good:--when a man dares to preach that, he is no more likely to be popular with the wicked world (for it is a wicked world) than Amos was popular, or St Paul was popular, or our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave both to Amos and to St Paul their messages, was popular. False preachers will dislike that man, because he wishes to make sinners uneasy, while they wish to make them easy. Philosophers, falsely so-called, will dislike that man, because he talks of the kingdom of God, the providence of God, and they are busy--at least, just now--in telling men that there is no providence and no God-- at least, no living God. The covetous and worldly will dislike that man, for they believe that the world is governed, not by God, but by money. [...] <b>Politicians</b> <b>will</b> dislike that man, because they think that not God, but they, govern the world, by those very politics and knavish tricks, which we pray God to confound, whenever we sing [...] "God save the Queen." [...] And the common people--the masses--who ought to hear such a man gladly, for his words are to them, if they would understand them, a gospel, and good news of divine hope and deliverance from sin and ignorance, oppression and misery--the masses, I say, will dislike that man, because he tells them that God's will is law, and must be obeyed at all risks: and the poor fools have got into their heads just now that not God's will, but the will of the people, is law, and that not the eternal likeness of God, but whatever they happen to decide by the majority of the moment, is right.|$|E

60|$|Prohibition, therefore, plainly {{violates the}} rights of man, {{if there are any}} rights of man. What its {{supporters}} really mean is that there are none. And in suggesting this, they have all the advantages that every sceptic has when he supports a negation. That sort of ultimate scepticism can only be retorted upon itself, and we can point out to them that they can no more prove the right of the city to be oppressive than we can prove the right of the citizen to be free. In the primary metaphysics of such a claim, it would surely be easier to make it out for a single conscious soul than for an artificial social combination. If there are no rights of men, what are {{the rights of}} nations? Perhaps a nation has no claim to self-government. Perhaps it has no claim to good government. Perhaps it has no claim to any sort of government or any sort of independence. Perhaps they will say that is not implied in the Declaration of Independence. But without going deep into my reasons for believing in natural rights, or rather in supernatural rights (and Jefferson certainly states them as supernatural), I am content here to note that a man's treatment of his own body, in relation to traditional and ordinary opportunities for bodily excess, is as near to his self-respect as social coercion can possibly go; and that when that is gone there is nothing left. If coercion applies to that, it applies to everything; and in the future of this controversy it obviously will apply to everything. When I was in America, people were already applying it to tobacco. I never can see why they should not apply it to talking. Talking often goes with tobacco as it goes with beer; and what is more relevant, talking may often lead both to beer and tobacco. Talking often drives a man to drink, both negatively in the form of nagging and positively in the form of bad company. If the American Puritan is so anxious to be a censor morum, he should obviously put a stop to the evil communications that really corrupt good manners. He should reintroduce the Scold's Bridle among the other Blue Laws for a land of blue devils. He should gag all gay deceivers and plausible cynics; he should cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaketh proud things. Nobody can doubt that nine-tenths of the harm in the world is done simply by talking. Jefferson and the old democrats allowed people to talk, not because they were unaware of this fact, but because they were fettered by this old fancy of theirs about freedom and the rights of man. But since we have already abandoned that doctrine in a final fashion, I cannot see why the new principle should not be applied intelligently; and in that case it would be applied to the control of conversation. The State would provide us with forms already filled up with the subjects suitable for us to discuss at breakfast; perhaps allowing us a limited number of epigrams each. Perhaps we should have to make a formal application in writing, to be allowed to make a joke that had just occurred to us in conversation. And the committee would consider it in due course. Perhaps it would be effected in a more practical fashion, and the private citizens would be shut up as the public-houses were shut up. Perhaps they would all wear gags, which the policeman would remove at stated hours; and their mouths would be opened from one to three, as now in England even the public-houses are from time to time accessible to the public. To some this will sound fantastic; but not so fantastic as Jefferson would have thought Prohibition. But there is one sense in which it is indeed fantastic, for by hypothesis it leaves out the favouritism that is the fundamental of the whole matter. The only sense in which we can say that logic will never go so far as this is that logic will never go the length of equality. It is perfectly possible that the same forces that have forbidden beer may go on to forbid tobacco. But they will in a special and limited sense forbid tobacco--but not cigars. Or at any rate not expensive cigars. In America, where large numbers of ordinary men smoke rather ordinary cigars, there would be doubtless a good opportunity of penalising a very ordinary pleasure. But the Havanas of the millionaire will be all right. So it will be if ever the Puritans bring back the Scold's Bridle and the statutory silence of the populace. It will only be the populace that is silent. The <b>politicians</b> <b>will</b> go on talking.|$|E
