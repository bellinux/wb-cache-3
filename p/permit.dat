5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city <b>permit.</b> An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree <b>permit.</b> Within the <b>permit</b> they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself.

50|$|Federal law {{requires}} CAFOs to obtain NPDES <b>permits</b> before wastewater may be {{discharged from the}} facility. The state agency responsible for approving <b>permits</b> for CAFOs in a given state {{is dependent on the}} authorization of that state. The <b>permitting</b> process is divided into two main methods based on a state’s authorization status. As of 2017, EPA has authorized 46 states to issue NPDES <b>permits.</b> Although they have their own state-specific <b>permitting</b> standards, <b>permitting</b> requirements in authorized states must be at least as stringent as the federal standards. In the remaining states and territories, an EPA regional office issues NPDES <b>permits.</b>|$|R

5|$|O'Neill's tenure lasted {{just six}} months; he {{resigned}} after {{a dispute with}} chairman Robert Chase over Chase's refusal to <b>permit</b> O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. According to O'Neill, the tipping point was the refusal of Chase to <b>permit</b> the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E

5|$|Permits are {{required}} for all overnight visits to the BWCAW. Quota permits {{are required}} for groups taking an overnight paddle, motor, or hiking trip, or a motorized day-use trip into the BWCAW from May 1 through September 30. These permits must be reserved in advance. Day use paddle and hiking permits do not require advance reservation and can be filled out at BWCAW entry points. From October 1 through April 30, <b>permit</b> reservations are not necessary, but a <b>permit</b> must be filled out at the <b>permit</b> stations located at each entry point. Each <b>permit</b> must specify the trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights.|$|E
50|$|Two key {{instruments}} {{of water resources}} management {{at the disposal of}} the CNA are <b>permits</b> and abstraction charges. However, the effectiveness of <b>permits</b> is reduced {{by the fact that the}} total volume of water for which <b>permits</b> have been granted exceeds total water availability in some regions. A total of 344,473 <b>permits</b> were registered in 2005 in the public register of water rights established in 1992. The total volume of water for which <b>permits</b> were granted is 76 BCM/year, excluding <b>permits</b> for hydropower, which is a non-consumptive use of water.|$|R
500|$|Tradable {{emissions}} <b>permits</b> can {{be issued}} to firms within an ETS by two main ways: by free allocation of <b>permits</b> to existing emitters or by auction. Allocating <b>permits</b> based on past emissions is called [...] "grandfathering" [...] (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.38). Grandfathering <b>permits,</b> just like the other option of selling (auctioning) <b>permits,</b> sets a price on emissions. This gives permit-liable polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions. However, grandfathering <b>permits</b> can lead to perverse incentives, e.g., a firm that aimed to cut emissions drastically would then be given fewer <b>permits</b> in the future. Allocation may also slow down technological development towards less polluting technologies. The Garnaut Climate Change Review noted that 'grandfathered' <b>permits</b> are not 'free'. As the <b>permits</b> are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter. The cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy, typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs. However, profit-maximising firms receiving free <b>permits</b> will raise prices to customers because of the new, non-zero cost of emissions.|$|R
