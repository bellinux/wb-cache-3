25|$|Gough – whom Haig {{had been}} subject to {{a great deal of}} {{political}} <b>pressure</b> to <b>sack</b> - dined with Haig on evening of 15 March. There is no indication that he was crying out for reinforcements. Gough later wrote in his memoirs that Haig had explained to him that he was concentrating on holding the Channel Ports.|$|R

50|$|To be {{unreasonable}} though, the employer's conduct {{would have}} to be outside the band of reasonable responses of any reasonable employer. Roughly speaking, the conduct is reasonable if some decent employers would have handled it similarly, but unreasonable if no reasonable employer would have handled it the same or the dismissal was not based on an honest and genuine decision on reasonable grounds. The tribunal cannot take account of industrial <b>pressure</b> to <b>sack</b> somebody.|$|R
5000|$|Norwell {{picked up}} {{where he left}} off from his strong rookie season.

50|$|McClain {{signed as}} a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys on March 12, 2014. Although he looked strong and was taking {{advantage}} of the added work as Henry Melton recovered from knee surgery during off-season workouts, a high-ankle sprain he suffered in training camp affected his momentum. He played 13 games in a reserve role and finished with 20 tackles (3 for loss), 7 quarterback <b>pressures,</b> one <b>sack</b> and a forced fumble.

In 2012, the Blaze's {{defensive}} line was coined [...] " [...] Sack Lake City" [...] {{due to the}} tremendous amount of <b>pressure</b> and <b>sacks</b> they applied to quarterbacks. In {{a game against the}} Iowa Barnstormers, the Blaze recorded a league record 11 sacks in one game, led by the combination of Rayford and Mike Lewis with 3.5 sacks each.|$|R

50|$|On June 10, the Turks {{attacked}} at Vorontsovka {{and took}} many prisoners, {{leading to an}} official threat from Berlin to withdraw its support and troops from the Ottoman Empire. Hans von Seeckt was dispatched to Georgia and met with Enver Pasha at Batumi. The Ottoman government had to concede to German <b>pressure</b> by <b>sacking</b> Vehip Pasha and halting its drive, for the moment, and further advance into Georgia for the Batumi-Tiflis-Baku railway and associated pipeline. The Ottomans reoriented their strategic direction towards Azerbaijan with a blocking action against British forces in northwestern Persia. Nuri Pasha led the drive under the Islamic Army of the Caucasus {{also known as the}} Ottoman Army of Islam.|$|R

50|$|The Raiders {{dominated}} the Browns early and led 13-0. Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton intercepted a Bernie Kosar pass which set {{up one of}} the Raiders two field goals.

5000|$|His {{selection}} by the Broncos did not {{sit well}} with Elway, for two reasons. One, the Broncos had greater needs at several other positions, which Elway felt should have been addressed with their first pick instead of using it on Maddox. Second, Elway was in his prime and still seven years away from his retirement in 1999, so selecting a successor so soon was extremely premature. However, Elway understood that Maddox had no control over the Broncos selection and was always professional in dealing with him, doing what he could to incorporate Maddox into the Broncos system. Maddox was expected to succeed John Elway as starting quarterback. As a rookie, Maddox was served by coach Dan Reeves. Maddox took his first snaps during the Week 6 (October 6) game against the Washington Redskins, completing 2-of-8 passes for 10 yards and one interception in the 34-3 loss. In that game, Maddox became the youngest NFL quarterback to complete a pass since Elmer Angsman in 1946. Maddox took over the week 11 (November 15) game after starting quarterback John Elway left with a shoulder injury and led the Broncos to a 27-13 victory over the New York Giants. Maddox would start the following four games from weeks 12-to-15, all losses. In his debut start in the week 12 24-0 loss to the Los Angeles Raiders, Maddox went 18-of-26 (69.2%) for 207 yards and two interceptions (both by Terry McDaniel), was sacked four times, and committed three fumbles (including one lost). Maddox only learned that he would start three hours before kickoff. The Los Angeles Times account of the game reported: [...] "Every time Denver moved the ball, Maddox would be <b>pressured,</b> <b>sacked</b> or simply dropped the ball." ...|$|R

60|$|Each night Francis {{had paid}} a visit to the sailors forward, to enjoin {{patience}} until he should give them the order for making the attempt. They had long since cut through the planks, which were only retained in their place by the <b>pressure</b> of the <b>sacks</b> behind them. He had bade them be in readiness on the first occasion on which rough weather might set in, and knew that they would now be expecting the signal.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2012 {{season the}} Blaze's {{defensive}} line was coined [...] "Sack Lake City" [...] {{due to their}} tremendous amount of <b>pressure</b> and quarterback <b>sacks.</b> In {{a game against the}} Iowa Barnstormers the Blaze recorded a league record 11 sacks in one game. Led by the combination of Caesar Rayford and Mike Lewis with 3.5 sacks each. In 2 seasons with the Utah Blaze the pair have recorded 3 All Pro Honors, along with 40 sacks combined.|$|R
50|$|In late 1994, Herro {{expressed}} his view (and {{that of his}} associate shareholders) to the Board of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC that Maurice should be dismissed as chairman due to his tardiness in reducing costs by maintaining expensive corporate offices at Berkeley Square for too long; Maurice's expressed intention to perhaps launch a takeover/partial takeover; his insistence on a new incentive/option plan which Herro saw as structured to Maurice's favour. In December 1994, the Board succumbed to shareholder <b>pressure</b> and <b>sacked</b> Maurice as chairman. Within a month senior executives Jeremy Sinclair, Bill Muirhead, David Kershaw, Moray McLennan, Nick Hurrell, Simon Dicketts, and James Lowther would all also resign and join Maurice Saatchi in a new business which would become known as M&C Saatchi. Charles Saatchi, other Saatchi staff and some consequential clients would follow including Gallaher Group, Mirror Newspapers, the retailer Dixons and after a competitive pitch, British Airways.|$|R
25|$|High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton {{stressed}} the need to “hand over any unauthorised arms to the authorities immediately,” {{in the wake of}} a protest on 26 March at the parliament building, to <b>pressure</b> lawmakers to <b>sack</b> the newly appointed Interior Minister Arsen Avakov because the Right Sector group believes that Avakov is personally responsible for ordering what they call a political assassination of one of their leader, Aleksandr Muzychko, who was killed in a special operation in a city of Rovno the previous evening.|$|R
