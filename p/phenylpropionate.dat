25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone <b>phenylpropionate),</b> stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone <b>phenylpropionate</b> and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone <b>phenylpropionate),</b> are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E

This drug is a blend of four esterized testosterone derivatives: Testosterone propionate, testosterone <b>phenylpropionate,</b> testosterone isocaproate and testosterone decanoate. Little is known about the effects of this drug on skeletal muscle at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Sustanon on the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers and the distribution of myogenic stem cells known as Satellite Cells (SCs) during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that Sustanon-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the number of SCs. Robust immunocytochemical techniques and morphometric analyses were used to calculate the numbers of SCs and myonuclei within the pectoralis muscle of chickens. Also, DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein levels were measured to confirm immunocytochemical findings. Sustanon significantly increased pectoralis mass and fiber size. All SC indices and the number of myonuclei increased significantly by Sustanon administration. In addition, greater DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein expression were found in Sustanon-treated birds.

METHODS [...] Oral (testosterone undecanoate 40 mg) and intramuscular (testosterone propionate 15 mg, <b>phenylpropionate</b> 30 mg, isocaproate 30 mg and decanoate 50 mg) testosterone and transdermal (17 beta oestradiol 25 micrograms and 50 micrograms) oestradiol were evaluated in 21 male (16 - 29 years) and 11 female (19 - 26 years) patients with beta thalassaemia major and various forms of hypogonadism. RESULTS [...] In male patients given oral testosterone, peak testosterone concentrations were observed either two to four hours or seven hours after administration; intramuscular testosterone produced peak values seven days after injection. Transdermal 17 beta oestradiol given to female patients produced a biphasic pattern with an initial peak concentration occurring at 36 hours and a secondary rise at 84 hours. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results indicate that oral androgens should be given twice daily in cases of hypogonadism, and where growth is incomplete, lower than recommended doses. If intramuscular testosterone is used, smaller doses of 10 - 25 mg should be given every one to two weeks. Transdermal administration of 25 - 50 micrograms 17 beta oestradiol generally produces a plasma E 2 value {{in the early to}} mid-follicular phase range (100 - 300 pmol/l).

40|$|Enrichment {{cultures}} {{were conducted}} using bismuth subsalicylate {{as the sole}} source of carbon and activated sludge as the inoculum. A pure culture was obtained and identified as a Fusarium sp. based on spore morphology and partial sequences of 18 S rRNA, translation elongation factor 1 -α, and β-tubulin genes. The isolate, named Fusarium sp. strain BI, grew to equivalent densities when using salicylate or bismuth subsalicylate as carbon sources. Bismuth nitrate at concentrations of up to 200 μM did not limit growth of this organism on glucose. The concentration of soluble bismuth in suspensions of bismuth subsalicylate decreased during growth of Fusarium sp. strain BI. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy revealed that the accumulated bismuth was localized in phosphorus-rich granules distributed in the cytoplasm and vacuoles. Long-chain polyphosphates were extracted from fresh biomass grown on bismuth subsalicylate, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry showed that these fractions also contained high concentrations of bismuth. Enzyme activity assays of crude extracts of Fusarium sp. strain BI showed that salicylate hydroxylase and catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase were induced during growth on salicylate, indicating that this organism degrades salicylate by conversion of salicylate to catechol, followed by ortho cleavage of the aromatic ring. Catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase activity was not detected. Fusarium sp. strain BI grew with several other aromatic acids as carbon sources: benzoate, 3 -hydroxybenzoate, 4 -hydroxybenzoate, gentisate, d-mandelate, l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, phenylacetate, 3 -hydroxyphenylacetate, 4 -hydroxyphenylacetate, and <b>phenylpropionate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of the aromatic compound <b>phenylpropionate</b> (PP) in Escherichia coli K- 12 requires the activation of two different catabolic pathways coded by the hca and the mhp gene clusters involved in the mineralization of PP and 3 -hydroxyphenylpropionate (3 HPP), respectively. The compound 3 -(2, 3 -dihydroxyphenyl) propionate (DHPP) is a common intermediate of both pathways which must be cleaved by the MhpB dioxygenase before entering into the primary cell metabolism. Therefore, the {{degradation of}} PP has {{to be controlled by}} both its specific regulator (HcaR) but also by the MhpR regulator of the mhp cluster. We have demonstrated that 3 HPP and DHPP are the true and best activators of MhpR, whereas PP only induces no response. However, in vivo and in vitro transcription experiments have demonstrated that PP activates the MhpR regulator synergistically with the true inducers, representing the first case of such a peculiar synergistic effect described for a bacterial regulator. The three compounds enhanced the interaction of MhpR with its DNA operator in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Inducer binding to MhpR is detected by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies. Fluorescence quenching measurements have revealed that the true inducers (3 HPP and DHPP) and PP bind with similar affinities and independently to MhpR. This type of dual-metabolite synergy provides great potential for a rapid modulation of gene expression and represents an important feature of transcriptional control.

Hepatic and muscular cytolytic enzymes were frequently raised, as were plasma ammonia, urea, and uric acid. Plasma total or free carnitine concentrations, especially non-fasting, were diminished in most cases. Plasma saturated medium chain fatty acids and particularly unsaturated cis- 4 -decenoate were on the other hand raised during the crises or during fasting. Urinary organic acid analysis revealed a characteristic profile of medium chain aciduria: C 6 -C 10 dicarboxylic acids, hydroxy acids, glycine conjugates, and carnitine conjugates. Oral loading tests with carnitine or <b>phenylpropionate</b> allow a precise diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by specific assays in various tissues. Avoidance of prolonged fasting seems to be the mainstay of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Biostimulation with {{different}} nitrogen sources is often {{regarded as a}} strategy of choice in combating oil spills in marine environments. Such environments are typically depleted in nitrogen, therefore limiting the balanced microbial utilization of carbon-rich petroleum constituents. It is fundamental, yet only scarcely accounted for, to analyse the catabolic consequences of application of biostimulants. Here, we examined such alterations in enrichment microcosms using sediments from chronically crude oil-contaminated marine sediment at Ancona harbor (Italy) amended with natural fertilizer, uric acid (UA), or ammonium (AMM). We applied the web-based AromaDeg resource using as query Illumina HiSeq meta-sequences (UA: 27, 893 open reading frames; AMM: 32, 180) to identify potential catabolic differences. A total of 45 (for UA) and 65 (AMM) gene sequences encoding key catabolic enzymes matched AromaDeg, and their participation in aromatic degradation reactions could be unambiguously suggested. Genomic signatures for the degradation of aromatics such as 2 -chlorobenzoate, indole- 3 -acetate, biphenyl, gentisate, quinoline and phenanthrene were common for both microcosms. However, those for the degradation of orcinol, ibuprofen, <b>phenylpropionate,</b> homoprotocatechuate and benzene (in UA) and 4 -aminobenzene-sulfonate, p-cumate, dibenzofuran and phthalate (in AMM), were selectively enriched. Experimental validation was conducted and good agreement with predictions was observed. This suggests certain discrepancies in action of these biostimulants on the genomic content of the initial microbial community for the catabolism of petroleum constituents or aromatics pollutants. In both cases, the emerging microbial communities were phylogenetically highly similar and were composed by very same proteobacterial families. However, examination of taxonomic assignments further revealed different catabolic pathway organization at the organismal level, which should be considered for designing oil spill mitigation strategies in the sea...|$|E
