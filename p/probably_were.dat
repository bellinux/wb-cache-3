5|$|George and Cassandra {{exchanged}} miniatures in 1763 and <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> engaged {{around that}} time. George received the {{living for the}} Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in. Two months after Cassandra's father died they married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day.|$|E
5|$|The average {{purity of}} the silver items is 96%. The {{remainder}} of the metal {{is made up of}} copper and a small amount of zinc, with trace amounts of lead, gold, and bismuth present. The zinc is likely to have been present in a copper brass used to alloy the silver when the objects were made, and the lead, gold, and bismuth <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> present in the unrefined silver ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{primitive}} early mines of Cornwall and Devon <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> {{operated by}} local extended families, with the men, {{women and children}} all working. Men and boys probably worked both above the surface and below ground, and women and girls worked only above ground; there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in Bronze Age Britain, although some mines from the period contain tunnels so small that only children or very short adults could have worked in them.|$|E
30|$|In adult patients, a {{complete}} diagnostic workup, including an abdominal CT scan with contrast media, should <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> performed (Grade 2 +, strong agreement). In the pediatric setting, abdominal ultrasonography should <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> performed as first-line imaging (Grade 2 +, strong agreement).|$|R

5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was ruled by a {{succession}} of seven kings. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, ruled in a tyrannical manner and, in 510 BC, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia, {{the wife of a}} senator named Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide because of the rape, and this led to a conspiracy which drove Tarquin from the city. With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive). While this story may be nothing more than a legend which later Romans created in order to explain their past, it is likely that Rome had been ruled by a series of kings, who <b>probably</b> <b>were,</b> as the legends suggest, overthrown quickly.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 Mary Ann Channer Davis, who {{had moved}} to St. Augustine {{with her husband in}} 1821, bought the Fornells claim to Key Biscayne from one of the Fornells' heirs for US$100. Mary and her husband William Davis, a deputy U.S. Marshal, <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> aware of plans to build a {{lighthouse}} on the Florida coast somewhere between St. Augustine and Key West, and knew that Key Biscayne was a likely location for it. Mary and William sold three acres (about one-and-a-quarter hectares) of their newly acquired land at the southern tip of the island (Cape Florida) to the U.S. government for US$225. The federal government built the Cape Florida lighthouse on that land in 1825.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} battles {{during the first}} two weeks of September, the South Korean troops, {{demoralized}} though they were, did most of the ground fighting. American tanks, artillery, and ground units supported them. Uncontested UN aerial supremacy and naval gunfire from offshore also supported the South Korean troops, and <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> the factors that tipped the scales in their favor. After the initial phase of their September offensive, the North Koreans labored under what proved to be insurmountable difficulties in supplying their forward units. The North Korean system of supply could not resolve the problems of logistics and communication necessary to support and exploit an offensive operation in this sector of the front. Nevertheless, the breakthrough was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days, eventually deciding to stand its ground.|$|E
25|$|The mandibles and {{the muscles}} {{found in the}} mandibles are exaptations, the large mandibles <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} for the increased ability to carry food, and further modified to {{to use as a}} way of defense and hunting.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} certain {{historical evidence}} of Christianity among the Britons {{is found in}} the writings of such early Christian Fathers as Tertullian and Origen {{in the first years of}} the 3rd century, although the first Christian communities <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> established at least some decades earlier.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Romans also {{employed}} regular orthogonal {{structures on}} which they molded their colonies. They <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> inspired by Greek and Hellenic examples, {{as well as by}} regularly planned cities that were built by the Etruscans in Italy. (See Marzabotto.) The Roman engineer Vitruvius established principles of good design whose influence is still felt today.|$|E
25|$|The over 70 {{temples and}} tombs extant at Mỹ Sơn have been dated {{to the period}} between the 4th century and the 14th century AD. However, the {{inscriptions}} and other evidence indicate that earlier now defunct constructions <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> present from the 4th century. The complex {{may have been the}} religious and cultural centre of historical Champa, while the government was based in nearby Trà Kiệu or Đồng Dương.|$|E
25|$|Human {{societies}} {{from the}} Paleolithic {{to the early}} Neolithic farming tribes lived without states and organized governments. For most of the Lower Paleolithic, human societies were possibly more hierarchical than their Middle and Upper Paleolithic descendants, and <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> not grouped into bands, though during {{the end of the}} Lower Paleolithic, the latest populations of the hominin Homo erectus may have begun living in small-scale (possibly egalitarian) bands similar to both Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies and modern hunter-gatherers.|$|E

25|$|On 28 July a ban {{was imposed}} {{on all the}} {{shipments}} on cattle from the prefecture Miyagi. Some 1,031 beasts had been shipped that <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> fed with contaminated rice-straw. Measurements of 6 of them revealed 1,150 becquerels per kilogram, {{more than twice the}} governmental set safety level. Because the origins were scattered all over the prefecture, Miyagi became the second prefecture with a ban on all beef-cattle shipments. In the year before 11 March about 33,000 cattle were traded from Miyagi.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in modern}} times {{speakers}} of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, in earlier times they <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> spoken in a larger area. After the Indo-Aryan migrations into north-western India, starting ca. 1500 BCE, {{and the establishment of}} the Kuru kingdom ca. 1100 BCE, a process of Sanskritisation started, which resulted in a language shift in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} Vishnu temples and iconography <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> already in existence by the 1st century BCE. The most significant Vishnu-related epigraphy and archaeological remains {{are the two}} 1st century BCE inscriptions in Rajasthan which refer to temples of Sankarshana and Vasudeva, the Besnagar Garuda column of ~100 BCE which mentions a Bhagavata temple, another inscription in Naneghat cave in Maharashtra by a Queen Naganika that also mentions Sankarshana, Vasudeva along with other major Hindu deities, and several discoveries in Mathura relating to Vishnu, all dated to about {{the start of the}} common era.|$|E

25|$|The grave also {{contained}} {{an assemblage of}} imported objects from Italy and the Greek world, all of them associated with the preparation of wine. They included the famous krater (see below), a silver phiale (shallow bowl, sometimes seen as a local product), an Etruscan bronze oinochoe (wine jug), and several drinking cups from Etruria and Attica. One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a terminus post quem for its date. The vessels <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} critics, {{starting}} from the difficult reconstruction of the entire catalogue of the Gentileschi, tried to give a less reductive reading of the career of Artemisia, placing it more accurately {{in the context of}} the different artistic environments in which the painter actively participated. A reading such as this restores Artemisia as an artist who fought with determination—using the weapon of personality and of the artistic qualities—against the prejudices expressed against women painters; being able to introduce herself productively in the circle of the most respected painters of her time, embracing a series of pictorial genres that <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> more ample and varied than her paintings suggest.|$|E
25|$|The {{gear teeth}} {{were in the}} form of {{equilateral}} triangles with an average circular pitch of 1.6mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2mm. The teeth <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even. Due to advances in imaging and X-ray technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.|$|E
