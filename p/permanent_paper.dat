50|$|In {{the report}} filed for 1991, two related issues arose. First, it is {{difficult}} and yet paramount to know at its creation how much enduring value a document will have. An obvious {{solution to this problem}} would be to implement a system where all paper was <b>permanent</b> <b>paper.</b> Here we meet the second issue: <b>permanent</b> <b>paper,</b> in 1991, cost 30% more than acidic paper, thus making such a system not feasible.

5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the mass {{production}} of paper, the type of size used for paper production also changed. As Swartzburg writes, “By 1850 rosin size had come into use. Unfortunately, it produces a chemical action that hastens the decomposition of even the finest papers.” [...] In the field of library preservation it is known “that acid hydrolysis of cellulose and related carbo-hydrates sic {{is one of the key}} factors responsible for the degradation of paper during ageing.” [...] Some recent professional work has focused on the specific in the degradation involved in the deterioration of paper that has had a rosin sizing process, and what amount of rosin affects the deterioration process, in addition to work on developing <b>permanent</b> <b>paper</b> and sizing agents that will not eventually destroy the paper. An issue on the periphery to the preservation of paper and sizing, is washing, which is described by V. Daniels and J. Kosek as, “The removal of discolouration ... in water is principally effected by the dissolution of water-soluble material; this is usually done by immersing paper in water.” In such a process, surface level items applied to the paper, such as size in early paper making processes as seen above, have the possibility of being removed from the paper, which might have some item specific interest in a special collections library. With later processes in paper making being more akin to “engine sizing,” as H. Hardman and E. J. Cole describe it, “Engine sizing, which is part of the manufacturing process, has the ingredients added to the furnish or stock prior to sheet formation,” [...] the concern for the removal of size is less, and as such, most literature focuses on the more pressing issue of preserving acidic papers and similar issues.|$|E
