40|$|In {{a quantum}} theory of {{cosmology}} spacetime behaves classically only in limited patches of the configuration space {{on which the}} wave function {{of the universe is}} defined. Quantum transitions can connect classical evolution in different <b>patches.</b> <b>Working</b> in the saddle point approximation and in minisuperspace we compute quantum transitions connecting inflationary histories across a de Sitter like throat or a singularity.

Generalising our analysis to scalar potentials with negative regions we identify saddle points describing a quantum transition between a classically contracting, crunching ekpyrotic phase and an inflationary universe.

25|$|Fentanyl transdermal patches (Durogesic/Duragesic) {{are used}} in chronic pain management. The <b>patches</b> <b>work</b> by slowly {{releasing}} fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage {{is based on the}} size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opiate (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{develops}} the manifold T-splines, which naturally extend {{the concept and}} the currently available algorithms/techniques of the popular planar tensor-product NURBS and T-splines to arbitrary manifold domain of any topological type. The key idea is the global conformal parameterization that intuitively induces a tensor-product structure with {{a finite number of}} zero points, and hence offering a natural mechanism for generalizing the tensor-product splines throughout the entire manifold. In our shape modeling framework, the manifold T-splines are globally well-defined except at a finite number of extraordinary points, without the need of any tedious trimming and <b>patching</b> <b>work.</b> We present an efficient algorithm to convert triangular meshes to manifold T-splines. Because of the natural, built-in hierarchy of T-splines, we can easily reconstruct a manifold T-spline surface of high-quality with LOD control and hierarchical structure. ...|$|R
