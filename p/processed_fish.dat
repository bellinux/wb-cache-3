5|$|Fish {{caught off}} the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador are {{required}} to have a minimal level of processing done in provincial fish plants. The objective is to ensure that the province’s fishery generates the maximum economic and employment benefits for the province.These requirements are known as minimum processing requirements, or MPRs. These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including; the cost of processing, labour availability and because some markets are interested in less <b>processed</b> <b>fish.</b> The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements.|$|E

25|$|Fishing is a {{relatively}} unimportant economic activity within the EU. It contributes generally less than 1% to gross national product. In 2007 the fisheries sector employed 141,110 fishermen. In 2007, 6.4million tonnes of fish were caught by EU countries. The EU fleet has 97,000 vessels of varying sizes. Fish farming produced a further 1million tonnes of fish and shellfish and employed another 85,000 people.

2500|$|The {{market for}} fish and fish {{products}} {{has changed in}} recent years. Supermarkets are now the main buyers of fish and expect steady supplies. Fresh fish sales have fallen, but demand for <b>processed</b> <b>fish</b> and prepared meals has grown. Despite this, employment in fish processing has been falling, with 60% of fish consumed in the EU coming from elsewhere. This {{is partly due to}} improvements in the ability to transport fresh fish internationally. [...] Competitiveness of the EU fishing industry has been affected by overcapacity and shortages of fish to catch.|$|E

40|$|A Complete Randomized Block {{design was}} used to study the total protein {{efficiency}} (TPE) in Iranian Kilka and Peruvian Anchovy fish meals. Six isoenergetic (3200 kcal ME/kg) and isonitrogenous (18. 5 % CP) diets based on corn with six samples of fish meal (No. 1, 5, 6 steam processed, 2, 4 flame <b>processed</b> Kilka <b>fish</b> meal and No. 3 Peruvian Anchovy fish meal) were formulated and fed to Lohman male chicks from 7 to 42 days of age. Feed consumption and weight gain were measured weekly. Total protein efficiency and feed conversion (FC) were calculated and statistically analyzed. The highest TPE values in fish meals obtained over the period of 7 - 28 days and significantly differed (P&lt; 5 %) among Kilka and Peruvian fish meals. With the exception of sample No. 5, the highest values of TPE obtained {{in the case of}} steam processed and the lowest obtained the case of flame <b>processed</b> Kilka <b>fish</b> meals.
