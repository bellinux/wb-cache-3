500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|She was {{particularly}} affectionate towards the latter because it {{allowed her to}} appear on camera with her two children, {{and said it was}} her favorite. Certain elements of Rand's characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner's side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> such as in [...] "Balance of Terror". The character was written out of the episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain's Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which she could use as an electronic camera. He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that {{led to the creation of}} the tricorder.|$|E
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He spoke into her ear, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist and refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that {{sent him to the}} ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E

6000|$|The {{reply was}} so {{unexpectedly}} mild for Aunt Sally, that Jeff <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and kissed her}} hard cheek. [...] "And I've got some quail, aunty, knowin' you liked em." ...|$|E

60|$|Clambering {{into the}} wagon, he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, {{pressing}} his cheek close against hers, and during {{what seemed a}} very long while the two remained silent, not daring to give words to their fears.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> {{and only}} by the convulsive {{movements}} of her body became aware that she was sobbing without a sound. Sustaining her, he lost himself in the profound silence of the night. After a while she became still, and cried quietly. Then, suddenly, as if waking up, she asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... ... he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Julia. Presently {{she asked}} him if [...] he would remove <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> He {{immediately}} did so, with a smile.|$|R

60|$|While he spoke, he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{neck and}} drew her towards him, {{as if to}} salute her in token of welcome.

60|$|She {{leaned toward}} {{him as he}} was about to say good night. But she leaned not imperatively, not seductively, but wistfully and humbly. He was touched to the heart.

5000|$|In one of {{his most}} famous stories, Dryden wrote about a [...] "bleary-eyed" [...] Rube Waddell leaving a saloon and jumping into the Delaware River to rescue what he {{believed}} to be a drowning woman.
