5000|$|Before 1624 {{he went to}} Paris, {{where he}} became teacher of the English {{language}} to the Princess Henrietta Maria. He had learned in England the [...] "rule of proportion" [...] (logarithmic scale) recently invented by Edmund Gunter which he communicated to mathematicians in Paris. He rushed into <b>print</b> to obtain <b>priority,</b> an advocate in Dijon to whom he had shown the rule in a friendly manner having already begun to make some public use of it.|$|R
50|$|The {{finding was}} {{reported}} to the French Academy of Sciences in August 1909, and the following year in April to the French Academy of Medicine. However, in 1910 German publications attributed this discovery to Robert Bárány, {{which led to a}} dispute in <b>print</b> between them. <b>Priority</b> was established when the English physician, Donald Schearer, described how he carried news of the discovery from Paris to Vienna in November 1909.pp. 677-678 Bárány received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1914, for other work.|$|R
50|$|He {{published}} a manuscript in 1809 {{under the name}} of a friend, Joseph Knight, entitled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, which contained only 13 pages related to cultivation techniques, but over 100 pages of taxonomic revision. However, {{it turned out that the}} work had nonetheless freely plagiarised the work of yet another botanist (Brown) who was at odds with Salisbury. Salisbury had memorised the plant names from Robert Brown's reading of his On the Proteaceae of Jussieu to the Linnean Society of London in the first quarter of 1809, which was subsequently published in March 1810. Knight and Salisbury thus beat Brown to <b>print</b> and claimed <b>priority</b> for the names that Brown had authored.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to managing the peasantry by improving their economic circumstances, Zuo {{also believed that}} increasing access to traditional Chinese philosophy would help to pacify areas experiencing unrest and ultimately create a more contented and unified populace. To this end, Zuo set up an printing press in northwestern China which printed Chinese classics, as well as agricultural pamphlets. When Zuo first arrived in the region, a decade of constant warfare had virtually stopped all publishing in the region. Zuo prioritised reestablishing the <b>printing</b> industry a <b>priority</b> and thousands of copies of the publications he authorised were distributed in Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi and Xinjiang. Printing appears to have stopped when Zuo returned to Beijing, but the endeavour is credited with inspiring later printing presses.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} reading of [...] "On {{the natural order of}} plants called Proteaceae", but before it {{appeared}} in print, there appeared a publication that started one of the most bitter disputes in 19th century botany. This was On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, ostensibly by Joseph Knight. Despite the title, this paper contained only 13 pages related to cultivation techniques, but over 100 pages of taxonomic revision. Although not explicitly attributed, it was widely believed, and is still so, that this revision was contributed by Richard Salisbury, who had been present at all four of the meetings at which Brown read his paper. The revision contains many of the plant names that Brown had presented to the Linnean Society; for example, the genera Petrophile, Isopogon and Grevillea. Thus Salisbury beat Brown to <b>print,</b> claiming <b>priority</b> for the names that Brown had authored. Salisbury is also accused of having appropriated some of Brown's observations; for example, in the Linnean Society copy of Knight's paper, where Salisbury says that he suspects that the fruit of Persoonia is unusual, Brown has pencilled in [...] "He suspects it because he listened very attentively to my paper when read at the Linnean Society." ...|$|R
5000|$|Publication of {{the paper}} {{triggered}} {{one of the most}} bitter disputes in 19th century botany, because Salisbury had preempted the publication of numerous plant names that Robert Brown had intended to publish. Brown's paper had already been read to the Linnean Society of London, at meeting which Salisbury had attended, but his paper had not yet made it to print. In publishing this paper before Brown's On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae had been printed, Salisbury beat Brown to <b>print,</b> claiming <b>priority</b> for the names that Brown had authored. As a result of this, Salisbury was accused of plagiarism and ostracised from botanical circles. Contemporary notes and letters indicate widespread condemnation of Salisbury's actions. For example, Samuel Goodenough wrote [...] "How shocked was I to see Salisbury's surreptitious anticipation of Brown's paper on new Holland plants, under the name and disguise of Mr. Hibbert's gardener! Oh it is too bad!"; and James Edward Smith wrote that he had a copy of Knight's paper [...] "but shall not keep it — I mean hereafter not to notice it or any other of the author's productions." [...] Brown himself wrote of Salisbury [...] "I scarcely know what to think of him except that he stands between a rogue and a fool." ...|$|R
40|$|For The Media {{exchange}} {{building in}} Ouseburn he designed an approx 3 mx 3 mx 3 m stainless steel work called `Corral'. The 3 dimensional Corral {{is primarily a}} fusion of form and function, part sculpture part bike rack. Inspired by a trip to Mini Hollywood, in Almeria Spain, yet also drawing on associations with horse riding in the Ouseburn Valley. Corral is a conceptual development from an earlier work in welded aluminum, `Hanging Pixels' exhibited at `Abstracting from Reality' curated by David Thorp in the Millennium Galleries Sheffield 2007. Corral was designed using Google sketch up software and built by Mikoengineering, based in Walker. Corral was developed through a commissioning process involving Northern <b>Print,</b> Commissions North, <b>Priority</b> Sites and Chipchase Architects and is located outside the Media Exchange in the Ouseburn Valley Newcastle upon Tyne...|$|R
40|$|Unfortunately, one {{is still}} {{used to see}} the {{companies}} scheduling problems being addressed based on the experience. This type of approach, practically made by rough estimate becomes risky once {{there may be a}} sub-exploitation of the available resources (e. g., machinery, man power, raw materials), thus taking to the loss of money by the part of the company and consequently making it difficult to expand and modernise. This type of scheduling never or rarely constitutes itself as the best solution, given the overwhelming number of variables to consider. These goals compete with each other originating conflicting situations, making the problem extremely complex, turning altogether impossible to reach acceptable solutions. In order to find a solution to these kind of problems, the goal of the present work is to study and implement the Job Shop Scheduling Problem using Evolutionary Algorithms. Finally, a real situation, taken from the company Tipografia Tadinense Lda, where the goal is to minimise the total time that an order takes to be performed, having into account the format, the colour of the <b>printing</b> and the <b>priority</b> that each order has associated with, will be discussed...|$|R

50|$|Born in Brindle, Lancashire, {{he became}} head {{gardener}} to George Hibbert, {{who was an}} enthusiastic amateur botanist. Hibbert became {{caught up in the}} craze for cultivating Proteaceae, and as a result Knight became adept at their cultivation and propagation. He eventually set himself to write a book on their cultivation, which would be published in 1809 under the title On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae. Despite the title, this book contained only 13 pages related to cultivation techniques, but over 100 pages of taxonomic revision. Although not explicitly attributed, this 100 page revision is known to have been contributed by Richard Salisbury. In it, Salisbury published for the first time many plant names that he had memorised from Robert Brown's reading of his On the Proteaceae of Jussieu to the Linnean Society of London {{in the first quarter of}} 1809, which was subsequently published in March 1810. Knight and Salisbury thus beat Brown to <b>print</b> and claimed <b>priority</b> for the names that Brown had authored. As a result, Salisbury was accused of plagiarism, ostracised from botanical circles, and his publications were largely ignored during his lifetime. Although Salisbury's generic names have almost all been overturned, many of his specific names have been reinstated; since the nominal author was Knight, not Salisbury, Knight is now considered the author of a great many Proteaceae species.|$|R
