25|$|Until 1916, {{transport}} {{arrangements for}} the BEF were based on an assumption that the war of movement would soon resume and make it <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> build infrastructure, since it would be left behind. The British relied on motor transport from railheads which was insufficient where large masses of men and guns were concentrated. When the Fourth Army advance resumed in August, the wisdom of not building light railways which would be left behind was argued by some, in favour of building standard gauge lines.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{that it was}} <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> {{pursue his}} enemies into the mountains, Soult halted his offensive. He hoped to regroup his army for a major {{invasion}} of Portugal but he was overruled. Joseph ordered Ney's VI Corps to return north to help Kellermann and placed Soult's two remaining corps on the defensive at Plasencia and Talavera. This deployment freed Victor's I Corps to march east against Venegas. The next battle was the Battle of Almonacid on 11 August 1809. The following day, Ney's corps bumped into Wilson's column on its return march at the Battle of Puerto de Baños.|$|E

Khánh made plans with conservative Laotian General Phoumi Nosovan for anti-communist incursions into eastern Laos, but the Americans stopped him and leaked false reports to the media that he was reluctant to attack. As a result, Khánh concluded that a military victory might not be feasible and one of his officials made contacts with the communists to see if negotiation was possible, but nothing came of this approach.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

In Scotland on Sunday, Helen Stewart lamented the loss of Fay Ripley and Jenny's replacement by [...] "the bland but international crossover-friendly Jo, [...] who is sufficiently <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> be dismissed even by her fellow characters as 'not as good as Jenny'." [...] Stewart also criticised Hermione Norris's acting and Karen for being a [...] "spoon-faced moaner".

500|$|Liszt {{desired to}} expand single-movement works beyond the concert {{overture}} form. As he himself said, [...] "New wine demands new bottles," [...] and as Alan Walker points out, the [...] "language of music was changing; it seemed <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> Liszt to contain it in forms that were almost 100 years old." [...] The music of overtures is to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods; Liszt intended to combine those programmatic qualities with a scale and musical complexity normally {{reserved for the}} opening movement of Classical symphonies. The opening movement, with its interplay of contrasting themes under sonata form, was normally considered {{the most important part}} of the symphony. To achieve his objectives, he needed a more flexible method of developing musical themes than sonata form would allow, but one that would preserve the overall unity of a musical composition.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway habitually {{used the}} word [...] "and" [...] in place of commas. This use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence—or in later works his use of {{subordinate}} clauses—uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images. [...] Benson compares them to haikus. Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; Saul Bellow satirized this style as [...] "Do you have emotions? Strangle them." [...] However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway {{thought it would be}} easy, and <b>pointless,</b> <b>to</b> describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp [...] "the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always". This use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Proust. Hemingway's letters refer to Proust's Remembrance of Things Past several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice.|$|E
500|$|Surprised by {{the news}} of a Matabele mission to London, Rhodes {{attempted}} to publicly downplay the credentials of the izinDuna and {{to stop them from}} leaving Africa. When the envoys reached Kimberley Rhodes told his close friend, associate and housemate Dr Leander Starr Jameson—who himself held the rank of inDuna, having been so honoured by Lobengula years before as thanks for medical treatment—to invite Maund to their cottage. Maund was suspicious, but came anyway. At the cottage, Rhodes offered Maund financial and professional incentives to defect from the London syndicate. Maund refused, prompting Rhodes to declare furiously that he would have Robinson stop his progress at Cape Town. The izinDuna reached Cape Town in mid-January 1889 to find that it was as Rhodes had said; to delay their departure, Robinson discredited them, Maund and Colenbrander in cables to the Colonial Office in London, saying that Shippard had described Maund as [...] "mendacious" [...] and [...] "dangerous", Colenbrander as [...] "hopelessly unreliable", and Babayane and Mshete as not actually izinDuna or even headmen. Cawston forlornly telegraphed Maund that it was <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> try to go on while Robinson continued in this vein.|$|E

[...] Westbrook wrote that [...] "Echoing such a popular predecessor as Shrek {{is not a good}} thing– especially when the echo is so faint." [...] Berardinelli felt that the fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in the first Shrek film, while Bernard felt that Hoodwinked! took fairy tale revisionism too far. He felt that the humor in Shrek worked due to the fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout the film, and wrote, [...] "It's <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> scold them for behaving the way fairy tales intended, and that's far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic, considered Red's kung fu abilities to be overly similar to Princess Fiona's [...] "Matrix agility." [...] Gleiberman also noted the similarities between the film and Shrek, but he was positive in the comparison, feeling that its independent production gave the filmmakers [...] "the freedom to follow their flakiest corkscrew whims."

500|$|Paramount was {{dissatisfied}} with the script, so its head of production Dawn Steel asked Nicholas Meyer, the writer and director of , to help rewrite it. Meyer never read the earlier script, reasoning it <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> do so since the content had no appeal to the studio. He and Bennett split the task of conceiving the plot between them. Bennett wrote {{the first quarter of}} the story, up to the point where the crew goes back in time. Meyer wrote the story's middle portion, taking place on 20th-century Earth, and Bennett handled the ending. After 12days of writing, Meyer and Bennett combined their separate portions. In this version, Gillian Taylor stays on 1986's Earth and vows to ensure the survival of the humpback whale despite the paradox it could create. Meyer preferred this [...] "righter ending" [...] to the film version, explaining [...] "the end in the movie detracts from the importance of people in the present taking the responsibility for the ecology and preventing problems of the future by doing something today, rather than catering to the fantasy desires of being able to be transported in time to the near-utopian future." [...] Meyer and Bennett cut out Krikes and Meerson's idea of having the Klingon Bird-of-Prey fly over the Super Bowl and the hint that Saavik remained on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock's child.|$|E
500|$|Melissa Sternenberg from THEM Anime Reviews {{reviewed}} and praised for its dark animation and plot. ActiveAnime's reviewers commented on complex character {{design and the}} [...] "spirit" [...] that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it. The series is also said to better suit the more matured audience. In the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for North American audiences. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> change {{the names of the}} characters, and Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical. The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of Case Closed for Anime News Network; he said that while the main characters sounded like [...] "real people", the secondary ones [...] " [...] off as caricatures". Lori Lancaster of Mania.com described Case Closed as [...] "a clever series that had mysteries at every corner", noting the [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] nature of each case. IGN's Chris Wyatt was positive to the manner the cases were set up, relating them to Agatha Christie's [...] "closed room" [...] mysteries. He described the series as [...] "Inspector Gadget meets Law & Order but in an anime style." [...] His colleague, Harris, however, expressed annoyance with repetitive elements in the show and the contrived methods the series uses to keep Conan's identity a secret from certain characters.|$|E

500|$|William J. Bell {{had created}} the {{character}} of Phillip Chancellor III in 1976, and he remained {{a vital part of}} the soap opera's storylines until his death onscreen in 1989. In 2007, Latham rewrote Chancellor's birth by establishing that Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Jill's enemy and Phillip Chancellor II's wife, switched their child with another hours after his birth; the character was brought back to the series as an adult named Cane Ashby, an Australian looking for his birth mother. During that time, Goddard did not want to know the real motives of his character because he did not want that to influence his performance. After the revelation that Jill was Cane's mother, his views changed, saying he [...] "now welcomed the information as it added more color to his portrayal". The initial lack of information made portraying Cane difficult since there was an amount of ambiguity over whether he was a good, bad, or mediocre character. The ambiguity deepened when Goddard read the script revealing that a DNA test performed for Jill and Cane came back negative. He stated that he had never asked Latham [...] "what was going on" [...] with the storyline, but told her that he could [...] "play anything he needed to". A second DNA test later confirmed Cane as Jill's son. Goddard also said it was [...] "too good to be true" [...] for Cane to be Jill's son, adding that, [...] "But, down the road you realize these people actually do care about you, that you can reciprocate that care. For Cane, he's had so much time without them it's <b>pointless</b> <b>to</b> have the time with them and not enjoying it." [...] Though the maternity question was answered, more ambiguity about Cane's intentions appeared as the character received a phone call from his uncle Langley that hinted about Cane scheming against Jill and Katherine. The original intent of the call was to show that Cane wanted what was owed to him after being given away as an infant. The writers changed directions after the popularity of the character grew. Goddard said he felt the phone call was resolved within the story when Cane sent money to his uncle as part of taking care of him.|$|E
