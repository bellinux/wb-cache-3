40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the viability of}} the management of a transboundary resource, the Bay of Biscay anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus L.). A deterministic model is used to simulate the anchovy dynamics, with the fish stock consisting of two age groups, “young" and “old", while recruitment follows a Beverton Holt pattern. Two countries, France and Spain, harvest the resource, with two different types of gear, the purse seiner for Spain and the <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawler</b> for France. These technologies impact the different age-groups of anchovy at differing rates. A regulatory agency defines an annual fishing quota and its allocation between the two countries, with the aim of sustainability in the overall allocation design. A set of constraints is defined to describe the sustainability of the system which encompasses the economic, ecological and social aspects of the fishery. The optimal harvest share between the two countries is found and a number of scenarios are then tested in relation to their ability to remain within the set of constraints, or viability kernel. Other scenarios, including the historical trajectory, the optimal harvest share trajectory and the minimum time of crisis trajectory, are examined...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a study of}} cost structures through a cost minimisation approach. Estimations reveal predicted u-shaped unit cost functions for three types of vessels participating in the Norwegian pelagic fisheries: coastal vessels, purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Interaction terms on defined vessel groups identify relative advantages in the unit cost {{of the most important}} species. Through a cost minimisation problem, we assess the potential for reductions in variable costs. The data origins from the profitability surveys conducted by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries in the period 2000 - 2014. The estimated cost functions take a polynomial form. Such a functional form is sufficiently flexible to estimate/fit a u-shaped unit cost function. OLS analyses reveal the predicted longrun cost curve for several of the species included in the estimation. For the coastal vessels, these are herring, capelin and cod and pollock. In the combined fleet of purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers,</b> we find the predicted non-linear specification of costs for blue whiting and capelin. For both fleets, a linear relationship describes the underlying structure between variable costs and output of mackerel in the final specification. This specification applies also to the output of herring in the case of purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers.</b> These differences in the predicted relationships seem consistent with the structure of the data. We find a potential reduction of variable costs of NOK 10. 5 billion in the optimal solution to the cost minimisation problem. This amount serves as an indication of the costs of certain regulations within the management system in the period. Our optimal solution disregards policy constraints such as redistribution of catches between vessel groups. nhhma...|$|R

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. In multi-species fisheries, {{technical}} and social interactions between different {{components of the}} fisheries can {{make it difficult to}} maximize economic yield. Furthermore, the different fish stocks contributing to the overall catch may present different levels of natural variability leading to difficulties in determining optimal management strategies. Bio-economic performances of multi-species fisheries being subject to high levels of biological and economic uncertainty, successful fisheries management should identify and cope with risk when assessing management strategies. In this paper, bio-socio-economic performances of various management strategies under uncertainty are studied based on the French fisheries in the Gulf of Lion in the Mediterranean Sea. These multi-species and multi-gear fisheries is divided here into three main components, one including demersal trawlers exploiting especially hake (Merluccius merluccius), one including <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers</b> used to be directed to the catch of small pelagic species (mainly anchovy Engraulis encrasicholus and sardine Sardina pilchardus) and recently reallocating effort on demersal species due to anchovy and sardine collapse and the other component consisting of small-scale fisheries. A multi-species, multi-gear bio-economic and stochastic model (Impact Assessment model for fisheries management, IAM) is used to explore the bio-socio-economic performances of the three different components of the fishery. Different management strategies are tested and compared in the context of change in fishing strategy of <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Taking into account the interactions between <b>pelagic</b> and demersal <b>trawlers</b> {{on the one hand and}} trawlers and small-scale fisheries on the other hand, the trade-offs between biological and socio-economic indicators are quantified for the different management strategies...|$|R

This compares to an actual rent in 2007 estimated at £ 16. 3 million.

Although small pelagic fishes are locally quite appreciated for direct fresh consumption, landings are always totally absorbed by Sciacca transformation (canning) companies’ high demand.

40|$|By-catch {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{anthropogenic}} mortality in marine species of conservation concern worldwide. Between 2006 and 2008, the Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Scienze del Mare (CoNISMa) coordinated a monitoring programme of cetacean by-catch in Italian <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers,</b> funded in compliance with European Regulation 812 / 2004. Sixteen independent observers monitored a total of 3141 hauls. The observation coverage ranged between 0. 9 and 6. 3 % of the regional fishing effort. Almost all by-catch events were recorded in the northern Adriatic Sea. By-catch rates of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were 0. 0006 and 0. 0255 individuals per haul, respectively. Given the low number of observed deaths, reliable estimates of total mortality for these two species were not obtained. The annual number of by-caught turtles was 863 (CV= 0. 15), with 99 % released alive. A ‘hotspot’ for turtle captures was found off Goro (south Venice). The existence of lethal interactions makes it important to understand whether the scale of this mortality is sufficient to pose a threat at population level. Finally, annual by-catch estimates for rays and sharks were 5436 (CV= 0. 08) and 5414 (CV= 0. 15), respectively.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the discard sampling programme of the Dutch <b>pelagic</b> freezer <b>trawler</b> fleet in European waters in 2010. The <b>pelagic</b> freezer <b>trawler</b> fishery targets <b>pelagic</b> species, namely herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), greater argentine (Argentina silus), and pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). The annual landings of this fishery illustrates its seasonality; different species are targeted during different parts of the year. The total landings of the Dutch fleet were about 201, 000 tonnes in 2010. Horse mackerel and herring were the most abundant landed species. Overall, the discard percentage for the Dutch pelagic fleet in 2010, based on 8 sampled trips, is estimated at 6 % in weight. This is consistent with the discard percentages that have been found in previous years. However, in 2010 we did not succeed in sampling the fishery each quarter of the year; no trip was sampled in quarter 3. On board of the <b>pelagic</b> freezer <b>trawlers</b> two different discarding methods are observed, namely discarding after the catch is sorted and discarding prior to sorting. The latter includes catch that is discarded directly or via the conveyer belt from the cooling tanks, and catch that is slipped from the net. Due to practical limitations and safety issues {{it is not possible to}} sample these discards. The results show that the estimated amount of unsampled discards represent 30 % of the total estimated discards. Motivations for discarding unsampled catch can vary. Anecdotal information implies most incidents of discarding take place when more fish is caught than can be stored in the cooling tanks. In addition, fish-quality issues, unprofitable mixtures of species, or a lack in quota, could also be reasons for this discarding behaviour. The discard composition and length frequency data shown in this report are only based on routinely sorted discards. Discard percentages of target species herring, horse mackerel, and blue whiting are relatively low (1 %, 1 %, and 4 % respectively). For mackerel the discard percentage is significantly higher (18 %). The present study therefore suggests that, with the exception of mackerel, this fishery is efficient, when it comes to targeting (marketable) fish...|$|R

40|$|World food {{production}} has increased substantially {{in the past}} century, thanks mostly {{to the increase in}} the use of oil as input in the production processes. This growing use of fossil fuels has negative effects, both on the environment and the production costs. Fishing is a fuel consuming {{food production}} activity, and its energy efficiency performance has worsened over time. World-wide fisheries are also suffering from overexploitation, which contributes to the poor efficiency performance, adding more pressure and criticism on this economic activity. In this paper we analyzed the energy efficiency performance of more than 20, 000 European Union (EU) fishing vessels for the period 2002 - 2008, using the edible energy return on investment (EROI) indicator. The vessels analyzed, grouped in 49 different fleets, represented 25 % of the vessels and 33 % of the landings of the EU fishing sector. These EU fishing fleets' average EROI for 2008 was 0. 11, which translates to an energy content of the fuel burned that is 9 times greater than the edible energy content of the catch. Hence, the significance of this study arises from the use of time-series data on a relevant part of the EU fleet that showed stable or even slight improvements on the EROI over time. Moreover, results showed that the energy efficiency of the different fleets varied significantly (from 0. 02 to 1. 12), mainly depending on the fishing gear and the vessel length. The performance of the most efficient fleets, such as large <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers</b> and seiners, was comparable to many agricultural production activities.

40|$|Fuel {{costs are}} an {{important}} element in models used to analyse and predict fisher behaviour for application within the wider mixed fisheries and ecosystem approaches to management. This investigation explored the predictive capability of linear and generalized additive models (GAMs) in providing daily fuel consumption estimates for fishing vessels given knowledge of their length, engine power, fleet segment (annual dominant gear type), and fuel prices. Models were fitted to half of the Irish fishing vessel economic data collected between 2003 and 2011. The predictive capabilities of the seven best models were validated against the remaining, previously un-modelled, data. The type of gear used by a fleet segment had an important influence on fuel consumption as did the price of fuel. The passive pot gear and Scottish seine gear segments indicated consistently lower consumptions, whereas dredge and pelagic gears showed consistently higher fuel consumptions. Furthermore, increasing fuel price negatively affected fuel consumption, especially for more powerful, larger vessels. Of the formulated models, the best fit to training data were a GAM with a gear main effect and two smooth functions; standardized vessel length and engine power interacting with fuel price. For prediction, overall, this model showed the closest predictions with the least bias, followed by three linear models. However, all seven models compared for predictive capability performed well for the most sampled segments (demersal and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers).</b> This is an author produced pre-print pdf.

The well-reviewed [...] UEFA sa Ghaeltacht, which saw Mac Con Iomaire as {{presenter}} and writer, told the story of a UEFA Cup soccer match being played on a gaelic football pitch in rural Connemara. [...] "Trálaer" [...] looked at life aboard a deep-sea <b>pelagic</b> fishing <b>trawler</b> from the Aran Islands, which was again presented and written by Mac Con Iomaire. Saighdiúr looked at the role of Irish citizens in the British army during World War II, where Mac Con Iomaire used the case of his grand-uncle, Paddy Ridge, to illustrate the story. Ridge was killed while serving in the Irish Guards in Tunisia in 1943. Mac Con Iomaire shot, co-directed, wrote and presented Saighdiúr.|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustic}} survey (PELGAS) {{is carried out}} {{every year in the}} Bay of Biscay in spring onboard the French research vessel Thalassa. The objective of PELGAS survey is to study the abundance and distribution of pelagic fish in the Bay of Biscay. The main target species are anchovy and sardine but they are considered in a multi-specific context and within an ecosystemic approach as they are located in the centre of pelagic ecosystem. The Pelgas 17 {{acoustic survey}} has been carried out with medium weather conditions (regular wind, low atmospheric temperatures) for the whole area, from the South of the bay of Biscay to the west of Brittany. The help of commercial vessels (two pairs of <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers</b> and a single one) during 18 days provided about 110 valid identification hauls instead of about 60 before 2007 when Thalassa was alone to identify echotraces. Their participation increased the precision of identification of echoes and some double hauls permitted to confirm that results provided by the two types of vessels (R/V and Fishing boats) were comparable and usable for biomass estimate purposes. These commercial vessels participated to the PELGAS survey in a very good spirit of collaboration. Vessels (and the scientific observer onboard) are founded by EMFF (European Maritime and Ficheries Found) for the period 2017 - 2019, with the financial help of "France Filière Pêche" which is a groupment of French fishing organisations. The PELGAS 17 survey observed a relatively high level of anchovy biomass (134 500 tons), which seems to be higher to previous year, comparable to 2011 and far away from the 2015 biomass The biomass estimate of sardine observed  is 465 022 tons, which constitutes a strong increase from the last survey...|$|R
