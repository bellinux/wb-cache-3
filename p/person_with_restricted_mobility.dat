40|$|Injuries {{occurring}} in the remote environment present particular challenges to healthcare professionals, and decisions need to be carefully made on an individual basis. This report describes the successful management of a patella fracture sustained on the Subantarctic island of South Georgia. A 36 -year-old boating officer presented to the island surgery after sustaining an isolated closed injury to his left knee. On physical examination {{there was a large}} effusion palpable within the joint, and on subsequent radiography an undisplaced transverse fracture of the patella was apparent. The patient had an intact and competent extensor mechanism, and fulfilled indications for non-operative management. His clinical case was discussed with supervising consultants at the British Antarctic Survey Medical Unit in the United Kingdom, and radiographs forwarded electronically for an orthopaedic review. The decision was made to undertake medical evacuation of the patient. There were additional environmental factors to be considered in this situation. The terrain on South Georgia is rugged and unforgiving, there is a risk of injury posed by the local fauna (Arctocephalus gazella) during summer months, and emergency evacuation from the base would be difficult for any <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility.</b> A planned retrieval enabled our patient to continue rehabilitation and physiotherapy in the preferrential setting of his home country, without causing undue delay in time taken returning to work in this remote location...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} Adaptive Multimodal Systems and their {{applications}} on improving user interface accessibility. Disabled and/or elderly {{people are a}} group {{at high risk of}} social exclusion. The access to the opportunities offered by society is obviously limited if these cannot be reached by <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> impairments or <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility.</b> A more subtle way of exclusion results from the sensory modalities in which they are presented. Therefore, if the presentation of information has only one modality it will exclude people with impairments in that particular sensory modality. As a solution to these problems, this document presents GUIDE, an European funded project which intends to develop a software framework which allows developers to efficiently integrate accessibility features into their applications. To perform adaptation the system must know the users, their characteristics and preferences. Thus, a prototype was implemented to assist in user trials. These trials had the goal to understand users’ interaction patterns as well as to group users with common characteristics. In order to match a user with its cluster, it was implemented a prototype named User Initialisation Application (UIA) that besides of tutoring the user on how to interact with the system, it asks the user to perform some tasks and answer some questions. When finished the UIA is able to decide which group the user identifies with. This thesis takes special focus on Dialogue Manager as it is the core component of the system architecture. It coordinates the activity of several subcomponents in a dialogue system and its main goal is to maintain a representation of {{the current state of the}} ongoing dialogue. This document presents the design of the Dialogue Manager that will run in the GUIDE framework. Additionally, in order to the Dialogue Manager and the other components understand the applications’ user interface it was implemented a tool that extracts a User Interface Markup Language (UIML) from a Web based application...|$|R

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} licentiate thesis was {{to explore}} the {{accessibility}} to different environments for children <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility,</b> from the children's own point of view. The environments explored were the home, the school and playgrounds. With Bronfenbrenners theory "the Ecology of Human Development" as the main theoretical frame of reference the ambition was to see how both physical and social accessibility in different environments, could affect children <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility.</b> The thesis includes four substudies. In study one {{the purpose was to}} investigate how children <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> perceive their home environment. The investigated group who responded to the questionnaire consisted of 82 children. The results showed that the children perceived the accessibility of the physical environment in their homes as relatively good. Problems of accessibility in the physical environment were most obvious in the setting outside the home. As regards the social environment, the results were polarised. One third of the children had peer contacts in the home several times a week, while one third had peer contacts in the home only once a month or less. In study two the purpose was to describe how pupils <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> themselves perceive their school environment. Ten pupils were interviewed. The results showed that even though the interviewed pupils consider that the indoor school environment was generally satisfactory, it still lead to the pupils being excluded from certain contexts, both teaching and play contexts. Problems with physical accessibility lead to that the pupils lost valuable opportunities for contacts and relations with friends; i. e. shortcomings in the physical environment had social consequences. In study three the purpose was to explore the attitudes to accessibility problems in playgrounds among two groups of key persons: "creators" and "users of playgrounds" in a mediumsized municipality in northern Sweden. The results showed that those who created playgrounds had 1) a fragmented organisation, 2) insufficient knowledge of disabilities, 3) poor economy and 4) attitudes as an obstacle. Interviews with the users of the playgrounds showed that 1) the playground is not for me (i. e. for children <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility)</b> and 2) assistance is a precondition for accessibility. In study four the purpose was to investigate the accessibility of playgrounds to children <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> in the northern half of Sweden. When compiling the answers it appeared that only two {{of the total number of}} playgrounds were considered by the municipalities to be completely adapted for children <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> and that 46 playgrounds were partially adapted for them.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although older {{patients}} <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> are {{at increased}} risk for venous thromboembolism, they are under-represented in clinical trials evaluating prophylactic treatments against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prolonged prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is associated with a lower rate of DVT in older patients <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility.</b> METHODS: Two cross-sectional studies were conducted in 50 hospital-based, post-acute care facilities in France in 2001 and 2003. The studies included 1603 evaluable patients aged >or= 65 years, including 866 LMWH users (median treatment duration 23 days; interquartile range 13 - 42) and 737 LMWH non-users. All patients underwent complete compression ultrasonography performed by board-certified vascular medicine physicians. The primary study outcome was proximal DVT. Propensity analyses were used to control for bias in LMWH treatment assignment. RESULTS: The rate of proximal DVT was 4 % (35 / 866) and 5. 7 % (42 / 737) for LMWH users and non-users, respectively (p = 0. 16). Prophylaxis with LMWH was associated with decreased odds of proximal DVT after adjusting for baseline characteristics (odds ratio [OR] 0. 56; 95 % CI 0. 33, 0. 95; p = 0. 03) or quintile of propensity score (OR 0. 58; 95 % CI 0. 35, 0. 99; p = 0. 04). In propensity matched analysis, 342 LMWH users were at decreased odds of proximal DVT compared with 342 non-users (OR 0. 50; 95 % CI 0. 24, 1. 00; p = 0. 04). The decrease in proximal DVT was paralleled by a similar decrease in distal DVT. Compared with non-users, only high-risk dose users had decreased odds of DVT. CONCLUSIONs: In this observational study, prophylaxis with a high-risk dose of LMWH was associated with decreased odds of proximal DVT in older patients <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility.</b> Further study is needed before recommending routine prophylaxis with LMWH in these patients...|$|R

40|$|The general aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{describe}} how children and adolescents <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> perceived their roles, relations and activities in relation to peers and adults in different settings. The thesis includes six sub-studies, {{which are based on}} interviews, observations and field notes with children and adolescents <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> aged from 6 to 19 years. Using Bronfenbrenner’s theory “the Ecology of Human Development” as the main theoretical framework, the ambition was to understand the children and adolescents’ social world from their perspective. The principal finding was the lack of peers in the children and adolescents’ social network. Furthermore, this tendency of isolation from peers was found to increase during the transition from childhood to adolescence. Their relationships to peers were strained and activities and surroundings in which social contacts could develop were limited. The relationships with peers were also characterised by social barriers in the form of attitudes that resulted in social isolation from the group of persons the disabled children and adolescents most wished to be with. When relations to peers were limited, the disabled children’s social life was restricted to adults. The results further showed that the children and adolescents’ roles and relations often were significantly different from their peers. The children and adolescents’ arrived at a concept of themselves that differed from the way others conceptually saw them. Furthermore, the children and adolescents saw themselves as regular members of their peer group, but {{the other members of the}} peer group saw them as different from themselves. Relationships to friends of the same age either were confined or were nonexistent. Relationships to adults were often characterised as ambivalent or asymmetric, i. e. the adults were helpful and supportive while over protective and dominant at the same time. The thesis revealed that, despite the many obstacles facing them, the children and adolescents <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> had a positive view of their future.

40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{asymptotic}} delay-throughput trade-offs {{in mobile}} ad-hoc networks comprising heterogeneous nodes <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility.</b> We show that node spatial heterogeneity {{has the ability}} to drastically improve upon existing scaling laws established under the assumption that nodes are identical and uniformly visit the entire network area. In particular, we consider the situation in which each node moves around its own home-point according to a <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> process which results into a spatial stationary distribution that decays as a power law of exponent delta with the distance from the home-point. For such <b>restricted</b> <b>mobility</b> model, we propose a novel class of scheduling and routing schemes, which significantly outperforms all delay-throughput results previously obtained in the case of identical nodes. In particular, for delta = 2 it is possible to achieve almost constant delay and almost constant per-node throughput (except for a poly-logarithmic factor) as the number of nodes increases, even without resorting to sophisticated coding or signal processing techniques.

The authors did this by probing the symmetry of NLO-functionalized dendrimers, measuring the first hyperpolarizability at different generations. These results are compared with measurements on side-chain NLO-functionalized linear copolymers with different degrees of NLO-functionalization along the polymer backbone.
