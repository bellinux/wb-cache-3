50|$|The Severn Railway Bridge crossed {{just north}} of Lydney from Purton to Sharpness on the eastern bank. Built in the 1870s, it was damaged beyond repair {{by a pair of}} oil <b>tanker</b> <b>barges</b> in 1960. The barges hit Pier 17 {{bringing}} down two bowstring girders. There have been several plans to renew the link, most recently in the late 1990s as a millennium project.|$|R
50|$|The Federal yard at Kearny {{remained}} operational {{during the}} difficult interwar period and Great Depression. Federal built commercial ships, <b>tankers,</b> <b>barges</b> and car floats for companies like Grace Line, Standard Oil of New Jersey and various railroads. Federal also {{was able to}} get contracts for two Mahan-class destroyers in the mid-1930s followed by a few Somers-class destroyers and Benham-class destroyers in the late-1930s lead up to World War II.|$|R
40|$|The {{lighthouse}} tender CROCUS {{is tied to}} the South Dock on Kelleys Island. Lighthouse tenders carried {{passengers and}} supplies to lighthouses. The CROCUS was built at Shooter's Island, New York, and served in the lighthouse service from 1904 to 1939. From 1939 to 1946, the CROCUS was part of the United States Coast Guard. She was steel-hulled and first assigned to duty at the 10 th Lighthouse District and was based at Buffalo, New York. In 1932, she was converted to oil-fired boilers and transferred to Detroit. During WWII she was based in Toledo, Ohio, continuing her peacetime duties of servicing navigation aids. She aided in recovering the bodies of the crews of the tug "Admiral" and the <b>tanker</b> <b>barge</b> "Cleveco. " The men lost their lives when the vessels foundered in a storm in December 1942. The "Admiral" was towing the fully-loaded <b>tanker</b> <b>barge</b> from Toledo to Cleveland, Ohio. The "Crocus" was decommissioned in 1948. Photograph # 3287. FR 2. 11. 1 shows the Crocus with her crew. It was probably taken in the 1930 s...|$|R
5|$|There {{were a few}} regular {{carriers}} left by the 1920s, one of whom ran Jackson's Navy, using {{horses to}} tow the barges, and steam tugs after 1930. When the company stopped trading in 1948, sugar beet traffic was carried to Ely in boats owned by the beet factory for another ten years. Fuel oil for the pumping stations was supplied by the <b>tanker</b> <b>barge</b> Shellfen until 1971, by which time the Well Creek was almost impassible.|$|R

50|$|The {{city was}} the site of an oil spill in 2010, when an oil <b>tanker</b> and <b>barge</b> collided, causing 450,000 gallons of oil to spill into the Sabine/Neches {{waterway}} alongside the city.|$|R
5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the <b>tanker</b> <b>barge</b> Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|R

The group owns {{one of the}} largest palm oil refinery networks in the world and is among the biggest players in the vegetable oil refining business. It also manufactures consumer goods in Indonesia, producing soap brands, and cooking oil brands such as Sunco. Musim Mas has a 37,000-strong workforce, supported by a comprehensive logistical network of chemical and costal <b>tankers,</b> <b>barges,</b> tugboats and bulk installations at major ports across Indonesia and other strategic parts of the world.|$|R
50|$|On 23 January 2010, an oil <b>tanker</b> and <b>barge</b> {{collided}} in {{the channel}} leading to Port Arthur, spilling up to 450,000 {{gallons of oil}} into the seaway. The tanker was chartered by ExxonMobil and was bound for Exxon's refinery in Beaumont, Texas.|$|R
50|$|Marine oil <b>tanker</b> and <b>barges</b> can {{transport}} this petroleum {{all around}} the world. These vessels are used because they can carry a lot of fuel, so the amount it costs per barrel to move this oil is very cheap. These tankers are also really {{the only way to}} move crude oil across the oceans. Usually the larger tankers are used to transport this fuel on a global scale, taking fuel from one continent to the other. Barges are a lot like <b>tankers,</b> however <b>barges</b> are a lot smaller and do not have any method of propulsion to move them. Barges are often pushed or towed by tugs. This makes barges very poor for transporting this oil for long distances. Barges are very poor for traveling across rough seas, so they are used in calmer waters. However, these barges are usually used for transporting the fuel shorter distances.|$|R
50|$|Grenadiers fifth war patrol, {{under the}} command of LCDR John Allison Fitzgerald, between 1 January and 20 February 1943, brought her {{considerably}} better fortune than earlier patrols. A 75-ton schooner fell victim to her deck guns 10 January, and two days later Grenadier sighted a small <b>tanker</b> with a <b>barge</b> in tow. Judging the target not worth a torpedo, she slipped silently into the column behind the two Japanese ships. At dusk she battle surfaced. With binoculars lashed to the deck guns as sights, she raked the <b>tanker</b> and <b>barge,</b> sinking them immediately. The remainder of her patrol, along the Borneo coast through shallow and treacherous waters, was hampered by fathometer failures. She conducted an aggressive attack on two cargo ships 22 January but did not sink them.|$|R
5000|$|Transportation: Oil and gas are {{transported to}} {{processing}} facilities, {{and from there}} to end users, by pipeline, tanker/barge, truck, and rail. Pipelines are the most economical transportation method and are most suited to movement across longer distances, for example, across continents. <b>Tankers</b> and <b>barges</b> are also employed for long-distance, often international transport. Rail and truck can also be used for longer distances but are most cost-effective for shorter routes.|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of new {{pipeline}} capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river <b>barge,</b> <b>tanker,</b> and other transportation methods. Other than ocean tankers, these alternatives are all more expensive than pipelines.|$|R
50|$|A typical non-convex {{problem is}} that of {{optimizing}} transportation costs by selection from a set of transportation methods, {{one or more of}} which exhibit economies of scale, with various connectivities and capacity constraints. An example would be petroleum product transport given a selection or combination of pipeline, rail tanker, road <b>tanker,</b> river <b>barge,</b> or coastal tankship. Owing to economic batch size the cost functions may have discontinuities in addition to smooth changes.|$|R
50|$|Hitzler Werft is a {{shipyard}} in Lauenberg, Germany, {{just outside}} Hamburg. The company {{was founded in}} 1885 by Johann Georg Hitzler as a boat repair yard, {{and went on to}} build <b>barges,</b> trawlers, freighters, <b>tankers,</b> tugs, launches, <b>barges</b> and icebreakers.|$|R

50|$|Marine Transfer Operations are {{conducted}} at many ports {{around the world}} between <b>tanker</b> ships, <b>barges,</b> and marine terminals. Specifically, once the marine vessel is secure at the dock a loading arm or transfer hose is connected between a valve header on the dock and the manifold header on the vessel. A marine transfer of petroleum products cannot be conducted unless it is supervised by a person-in-charge (PIC) on the vessel who is seafarer in the Merchant Marine and another person-in-charge on the dock.|$|R
50|$|The loading master person-in-charge (PIC) is {{the marine}} {{transfer}} operator at the marine terminal who supervises {{the movement of}} petroleum products between <b>tanker</b> ships, <b>barges,</b> and the terminal while the vessel is berthed at the dock. In this capacity the marine transfer operator ensures that all regulatory aspects concerning {{protection of the environment}} and maritime security are adhered to during marine transfer operations. Of particular importance is ensuring no water pollution occurs from a spill or a breach of security from the access of unauthorized personnel.|$|R
50|$|Refineries {{which use}} {{a large amount}} of steam and cooling water need to have an {{abundant}} source of water. Oil refineries therefore are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a sea shore, nearby a port. Such location also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil by pipeline are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals by pipeline. Pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and rail cars, road <b>tankers,</b> and <b>barges</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{flexible}} fabric barge concepts aims at an economical delivery system for fresh water {{that would be}} considerably cheaper than desalination plants, rigid ships, <b>tanker</b> trucks, conventional <b>barges,</b> aqueducts or pipeline transport. Waterbags are more economical and better for the environment than desalination of the seas and oceans.|$|R
50|$|Harry Sargeant III (born December 30, 1957) is {{a billionaire}} diversified energy and {{shipping}} magnate from Florida. A former officer and fighter {{pilot in the}} United States Marine Corps, Sargeant operates an expansive, multibillion-dollar conglomerate of private global enterprises consisting of aviation companies, oil refineries, oil trading operations, alternative fuels development, and oil and asphalt shipping, his Sargeant Marine Group being the largest fleet of asphalt <b>tankers</b> and <b>barges</b> in the world. He is also the owner of International Oil Trading Company (IOTC), a company that supplies aviation fuel to the U.S. Military in Iraq, and grosses billions of dollars annually.|$|R
50|$|Petroleum {{products}} {{provide a}} valuable {{asset to the}} global economy and without this resource the economies and security of nations through {{the world would be}} constrained. Marine transfer operations at global marine terminals provide a vital link in the supply chain between the <b>tanker</b> ships and <b>barges</b> that transport an important commodity upon our waterways.|$|R
50|$|For example, during marine {{transfer}} operations when flammable products are transferred between the marine terminal and <b>tanker</b> ships or <b>barges,</b> two-way radio communication {{needs to be}} constantly maintained in case the transfer needs to stop for unforeseen reasons such as a spill. The United States Coast Guard requires that the two way radio must be certified as intrinsically safe.|$|R
50|$|United States v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{unanimously}} held that certain state regulations regarding oil <b>tankers</b> and oil <b>barges</b> are preempted under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution in deference to the extensive body of federal regulations affecting these classes of vessels.|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic {{transportation}} {{methods for}} providing liquid hydrogen requirements are examined {{in support of}} shuttle transportation system launch operations at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, during the time frames 1982 - 1991 in terms of cost and operational effectiveness. Transportation methods considered included sixteen different options employing mobile semi-trailer <b>tankers,</b> railcars, <b>barges</b> and combinations of each method. The study concludes that the most effective method of delivering liquid hydrogen from the vendor production facility in New Orleans to Kennedy Space Center includes maximum utilization of existing mobile tankers and railcars supplemented by maximum capacity mobile tankers procured incrementally in accordance with shuttle launch rates actually achieved...|$|R
50|$|The Aire and Calder Navigation is on a {{different}} scale to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, with locks 200 by 20 ft, {{and because it is}} a river navigation, there is a flow and the locks are accompanied by weirs. It is still used by 600-tonne <b>tankers</b> and <b>barges</b> carrying sand, which create considerably more wash than a narrowboat, and in times of heavy rainfall, the navigation may be closed, with flood gates closed, until the volume of water drops to a safe level again. The locks are mechanically operated, but although there are lock-keepers, they tend to move from lock to lock to assist commercial boats, and those using the river for pleasure can operate the locks themselves.|$|R
