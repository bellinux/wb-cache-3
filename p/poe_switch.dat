50|$|The PowerConnect 3500 series {{switches}} are Ethernet access-switches {{which comes}} in 4 models: the PCT3524 and PCT3548 with 24 resp 48 10/100Mb ethernet ports and the PCT3524P / PCT3548P with 24 or 48 10/100Mb with PoE option to power VOIP phones, Wifi Access-points or IP camera's.All models {{can be provided}} with a redundant power-supply for either pure redundant power or to provide full PoE power-budget for the 48 ports <b>PoE</b> <b>switch.</b> The technical specifications of the 'non PoE' and the 'PoE' models are the same in regards to switching capabilities and {{the main difference between}} the 24 and 48 port models is the total forwarding rate of the switch: 12,8Gbit/s for both 24 port models and 17,6 Gbit/s for the 48 port models. As with the PCT2800 models the MAC address table can hold up to 8000 MAC addresses.Apart from all standard layer2 switching capabilities as VLAN's, link aggregation (static and LACP, dot1x access-security and dynamic vlan assignment, the switches also offer some basic IP routing/layer 3 processing.All PCT3500 switches offer two gigabit ethernet (1000BaseT) ports for high-speed uplinks to distribution or core switches or for stacking of switches and two gigabit SFP ports for a 1Gbit/s fiber transceiver for uplinks to distribution/core layer.|$|E
40|$|The Zero Watt Inside (ZeWIn) system avoids standby and offmode {{losses of}} ethernet-connected devices without compromising consumers' {{ease of use}} of {{electronic}} devices. The system is currently under development within the ZeWIn project. Via a central power over Ethernet (<b>PoE)</b> <b>switch,</b> ZeWIn uses the service request signal to Ethernet-bound electrical and electronic devices in networks to switch the device on and off without additional energy consumption. To maintain users' comfort and to minimize the overall energy consumption, the ZeWIn system needs a smart control deciding - based on the expected or actual current use of the device - when it is better not to switch off a device. The system is self-learning and rapidly adapts to deviations from the use pattern of the controlled device...|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of PSEs: endspans and midspans. Endspans (commonly called <b>PoE</b> <b>{{switches}})</b> are Ethernet switches that include the power over Ethernet transmission circuitry. Midspans are power injectors that stand between a regular Ethernet switch and the powered device, injecting power without affecting the data.|$|R
50|$|The Earth Rangers 9.3 {{square metre}} data centre was {{completed}} in December 2008. The data room uses storage servers from Pillar, Dell’s processing servers, and virtual personal machines using VMware View software. Nortel’s Power over Ethernet (<b>PoE)</b> <b>switching</b> facilitates the transfer of electrical power and data across the infrastructure. Earth Rangers also participates in Compugen’s Green4Good program which works to combat {{the environmental impact of}} end-of-life technology products and support charities in need.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, <b>Poe</b> again <b>switched</b> {{gears and}} started several music tip sheets for music {{industry}} insiders and radio stations. The most successful tip sheet was Pop Music Survey, which grew significantly when Poe began an annual music convention. After 25 successful conventions, Poe retired in 1996.|$|R
50|$|When {{the device}} is a switch, it is {{commonly}} called an endspan (although IEEE 802.3af refers to it as endpoint). Otherwise, if it's an intermediary device between a non <b>PoE</b> capable <b>switch</b> and a <b>PoE</b> device, it's called a midspan. An external PoE injector is a midspan device.|$|R
500|$|<b>Poe</b> <b>switched</b> {{his focus}} to prose {{and spent the}} next several years working for {{literary}} journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Richmond in 1836, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem [...] "The Raven" [...] to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. Poe died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.|$|R
50|$|The Juniper EX2200 line of 1Gb Ethernet {{switches}} are compact gigabit switches. They {{are small}} and energy efficient making them environmentally friendly and great for office use. PoE variants in the EX2200 family support high-power 802.3at PoE+ (up to 30W/port) on all ports, up {{to a maximum of}} 405 Watts, which is the maximum power budget for the switch. The power budget is the lowest of all EX series <b>PoE</b> <b>switches,</b> and notably insufficient to run high-power Powered Devices (PD's) on all ports simultaneously. They {{come in a variety of}} forms including a 24 port plus 4 SFP PoE and non-PoE, a 48 port plus 4 SFP PoE and non-PoE, and the EX2200-C which is a 12 port plus 2 SFP Poe and non-PoE models. The 4 SFP ports allow link aggregation and uplink to aggregation switches without sacrificing the base ports. This model does not have dual power supplies. However, as of September 24, 2012 (JunOS 12.2R1 release date), it supports Juniper's virtual chassis technology. The EX2200-24T/24P has a data rate of 56 Gbit/swhile the EX2200-48T/48P has a data rate of 104 Gbit/s.|$|R
