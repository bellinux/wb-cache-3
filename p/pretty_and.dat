25|$|In 1868, now {{again in}} Utah, Bull {{married to a}} woman {{described}} as having been extremely <b>pretty</b> <b>and</b> lady like, but ill-suited for his lifestyle. Bull thus moved with her to Chicago, Illinois, and there the two had two children. She died of illness in 1872, and Bull placed his children in foster homes. By the following year he was in Omaha, Nebraska, again operating as a gambler.|$|E
25|$|The ship-burial {{treasure}} {{was presented}} to the nation by the owner, Mrs <b>Pretty,</b> <b>and</b> was at the time the largest gift made to the British Museum by a living donor.

25|$|In 1910, {{a mansion}} with fifteen {{bedrooms}} was built {{a short distance}} from the mounds and in 1926 the mansion and its arable land was purchased by Colonel Frank Pretty, a retired military officer who had recently married. In 1934, Pretty died, leaving a widow, Edith <b>Pretty,</b> <b>and</b> young son, Robert Dempster Pretty. Following her bereavement, Mrs Pretty became interested in Spiritualism, a religion that placed belief in the idea that the spirits of the deceased could be contacted.|$|E
25|$|Snorri relates that Aðils betook {{himself to}} pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geirþjófr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort {{were not at}} home, and so Aðils and his men plundered their {{residence}} at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships. One of the captives was a remarkably beautiful girl named Yrsa, and Snorri writes that everyone was soon impressed with the well-mannered, <b>pretty</b> <b>and</b> intelligent girl. Most impressed was Aðils who made her his queen.|$|E
25|$|From {{roughly the}} age of nine Karen became ambitious and {{somewhat}} rebellious. She felt {{that she could not}} become <b>pretty,</b> <b>and</b> instead decided to vest her energies into her intellectual qualities — despite the fact she was seen by most as pretty. At this time she developed a crush on her older brother, who became embarrassed by her attentions — soon pushing her away. She suffered the first of several bouts of depression — an issue that would plague her {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

25|$|Miss Mary Crawford: The <b>pretty</b> <b>and</b> charming {{sister of}} Mr Crawford and Mrs Grant, {{who takes a}} keen {{interest}} in Edmund Bertram in spite of his being a second son. Though she is charming, she has certain immoral views and opinions which mean in the end that she loses Edmund. She is often kind to Fanny Price, but is not a reliable friend. She is aware of her brother Henry's plan to toy with Fanny's heart, but does nothing to discourage him or warn Fanny. Fanny believes her to be driven primarily by mercenary considerations.|$|E
25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works. While it has been criticized as the least {{substantial}} of the composer's three ballets, {{it should be remembered}} that Tchaikovsky was restricted by a rigorous scenario supplied by Marius Petipa. This scenario provided no opportunity for the expression of human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, at its best, the melodies are charming and <b>pretty,</b> <b>and</b> by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very <b>pretty,</b> <b>and</b> she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E

25|$|The Ynglinga saga {{was written}} c. 1225 by Snorri Sturluson {{and he used}} Skjöldunga saga as a source when he {{told the story of}} Aðils. Snorri relates that Aðils succeeded his father Óttar (Ohthere) and betook himself to pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geirþjófr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort were not at home, and so Aðils and his men plundered their {{residence}} at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships.

25|$|Once {{everyone}} is safe, Maddy begins {{working on a}} cure using Dr. Cable’s tablet. She then offers it to Shay, who refuses, not wanting to become a “vegetable.” Since Tally feels responsible for her betrayal, she decides to become a <b>Pretty</b> <b>and</b> take the cure as a “willing subject”. To convince David {{to let her go}} back to the city, she tells him about her involvement with Special Circumstances and searching for the Smoke to betray them. While David is absorbing what Tally admitted, Maddy advises Tally to go back with Shay before she changes her mind. Once there, Tally announces to a Middle Pretty, “I’m Tally Youngblood. Make me pretty,” the final phrase of the novel.|$|E
25|$|Another {{prominent}} guild in Kangting {{is that of}} {{the women}} tea coolies who shift the stuff from the warehouses to the inns where the caravans start. They have a monopoly on this work and the cheerful gangs of girls are a picturesque element in the city's life. They need to be immensely strong to do a job which consists of carrying over a short distance anything up to an entire yak's load several times a day. Many of them are quite <b>pretty</b> (<b>and</b> well aware of the fact); they look very gay and rather brazen as, giggling and chattering among themselves, they move along with their heavy burdens, which are held in place by a woolen girdle around the chest.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{critics also}} found a theme of {{humanity}} within Uglies. Phillip Gough noted that <b>Pretties</b> <b>and</b> Specials (those who worked for Special Circumstances) are “posthuman” because of their operations. Others, including Scott and Dragoo, argued against this, claiming “the human body provides an artistic and political canvas for intentional manipulation," [...] and that this physical transformation can be an “outlet for humanity”. The novel Uglies seems to take no definite stance on it, though clearer points are shown in <b>Pretties</b> <b>and</b> Specials, the following books in the trilogy.|$|R
25|$|Eriksson's {{father was}} an innkeeper with the surname Lambert, but in 1797, her mother married E. Eriksson, a servant in the royal household, who later became a pad-maker, and Charlotta took her stepfather's name. She was {{accepted}} {{as a student at}} Dramatens elevskola in 1805, and was contracted as an actress in the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm in 1812, at the same year as the other female star of her generation, Sara Torsslow. That same year, she married the choirmaster Johan Fredrik Wikström. In the first years of her career, she was considered <b>pretty</b> <b>and</b> nothing more; she had her breakthrough in 1820, when she played Ophelia instead of Carolina Kuhlman and was highly admired for her realistic interpretation of insanity.|$|E
25|$|Amodini {{was made}} in 1996. It was a one-hour forty five minutes family comedy. Casting {{included}} Aparna Sen, Rachana Banerjee, Anusree Das and Pijush Ganguly, among others. A satirical Indian fairy tale, it {{is set in the}} perspective of 18th century, when traditional social customs were strictly enforced and complied. The storyline is about the exploits of a <b>pretty</b> <b>and</b> spoiled daughter of a rajah (king) who is forced to become the bride of her 15-year-old Brahmin houseboy after the man she was supposed to marry jilts her on her wedding day. If she does not marry before sunset, something horrible will happen to her; therefore she must marry the servant boy. After the ceremony, the boy is exiled and the union remains unconsummated.
