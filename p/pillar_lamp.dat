50|$|The {{park was}} {{designed}} by architect Tuan Syed Ahmad Ibrahim from the Syed Ahmad Ibrahim Architect Firm. Gondowana stone wall stands {{at the entrance of}} the park to show the formation of Langkawi Island from plate tectonic movement. The wall depicts the main Langkawi Island with its small islands surrounding it. The entrance area features a large square made of marble and black stones decorated with <b>pillar</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{remained}} {{for a few}} minutes, feeling cheered. Geraldine, Ethel, and now Hilda had urged him on. They thought he was right, and {{it looked as if}} all had some confidence in his ability. He was not sure that it was well founded, for he knew his limitations, the worst of which was ignorance. Still, he must try not to discredit his supporters, and his task could not be shirked. He went to the library, where his relatives were waiting, and gravely asked them to be seated. Though two <b>pillar</b> <b>lamps</b> were lighted, the large room was shadowy. A silver stand with candles burning occupied the middle of the great oak table round which the party gathered, flinging a clear illumination on their faces.|$|R
50|$|The {{temple was}} reconstructed during the Maratha period {{and has two}} <b>pillars</b> adorned with <b>lamps,</b> that are special {{features}} of Maratha art. There is an ancient well on the premises, and an artistic pillar adorns the top of it.|$|R
25|$|Two main sthambha (pillars) {{are found}} in the temple complex. The pillar facing the main temple, the Garuda (eagle) sthambha was erected in the Vijayanagar period while the pillar on the right, the Deepa sthambha (<b>pillar</b> with <b>lamp)</b> dates from the Hoysala period. Near the Viranarayana temple is a mandapa where annual {{procession}} ratha and temple vehicles have traditionally been stored. It is called vahana mandapa. The complex also has a kalyana-mandapa in the southeast corner for ceremonies. It was added in the 17th century.|$|R
50|$|Though many of Kondiah Raju's {{paintings}} bear a resemblance with Ravi Varma's paintings, he {{went further}} in {{his treatment of}} religious subjects by emphasising characteristics of the main subject {{in line with the}} depictions in temple and traditional Tanjore paintings. His calendar art unlike Ravi Varma or any other artist, was in a style quite reminiscent of the traditional iconic and formal representation of deities in South Indian paintings as opposed to the western fashion adopted by Ravi Varma or S. M. Pandit. In Kondiah's paintings the central deity is emphasised by providing it a well-lit, central and prominent position and relegating the surroundings to static objects like <b>pillars,</b> <b>lamps,</b> etc. Further it should also be remembered that Kondiah Raju like his forebear Ravi Varma was compelled to stick to not only the canonical iconography traditionally prescribed for the Hindu divinities but also cater to the tastes of the burgeoning Indian middle classes. In another major innovation, he would with his students herald the introduction of German tempera colours in lieu of oil colours for painting in South Indian calendar art. Subsequently, the introduction of Camlin watercolours would ensure that the artist could execute his paintings with greater speed and ease.|$|R
50|$|A padded {{roof was}} {{standard}} equipment on all Town Cars, with its design determined by trim level. On standard-trim Town Cars, a leather-grained vinyl full-length covering with center <b>pillar</b> coach <b>lamps</b> was fitted. For Signature Series and Cartier trims, a padded vinyl coach roof (covering the rear {{half of the}} roof) with a frenched (smaller) rear window opening was fitted; the coach roof was also an option on standard-trim Town Cars. On non-Cartier Town Cars, a full-length cloth (canvas) roof was an option; imitating {{the look of a}} convertible, the design deleted the C-pillar quarter windows.|$|R
50|$|Roberts Park is a {{historic}} public park and national historic district located at Connersville, Fayette County, Indiana. The parkland was donated {{to the city of}} Connersville in 1902. The 80-acre, rectangular site includes the contributing stone wall lined drives, stone <b>pillars</b> with <b>lamps,</b> a sundial, the Pavilion (1903), Amphitheatre (1907-1909), Horse Track (1903), Judge's Stand (1903), Horse Barns (c. 1910), Liberty Building (1932), Police Building (c. 1940), James E. Roberts Memorial Building (1936), and the Roberts Park Pool (1936). A number of park improvements were made by the Works Progress Administration. Located in the park is the Longwood Covered Bridge, a non-contributing structure formerly listed on the National Register of Historic Places from 1981 to 1989.|$|R
50|$|The {{first scene}} {{we see is}} two paramedics lifting a patient from the {{ambulance}} onto the ground on a stretcher. We then learn that H is the patient and Lee {{is one of the}} paramedics. Then, we see Lee pushing H into the hospital. The next scene we see is a receptionist and this turns out to be Claire. She sings her verse. Then, the camera goes over to a nurse who we see is Faye. She sings her verse. Then, the camera follows Faye over to Lee and H. We now know that Faye loves Lee so she touches his hand. Then Faye calls Claire over and they start making their way over to the operating theatre. Lee then calls a doctor over which turns out to be Lisa. We now also know that Lisa loves H. The next scene we see is H singing his verse while the others are acting their parts. Then, Lisa sings her verse and then Faye holds the operating camera and the light shines into the camera and then we see Steps in a change of clothes which are brown and white. We also see them dancing. They have close up shots and are each seen with a particular piece of furniture. Claire appears with a corner sofa. Faye appears on a furry staircase. Lee appears with a set of five dining chairs. Lisa appears with three tall <b>pillar</b> <b>lamps,</b> while H appears with a high back armchair. The video ends with Steps close together singing the last line of the song. The video was filmed at Greenwich Hospital and a studio in London.|$|R
5000|$|The two dates on the Great Seal, 1869 and 1890, {{commemorate the}} {{organization}} of the territorial government and Wyoming's admission to the Union. The draped figure in the center holds a staff from which flows a banner bearing the words, [...] "Equal Rights." [...] The banner symbolizes the political status women have enjoyed in Wyoming since the passage of the territorial suffrage amendment in 1869. The male figures typify the livestock and mining industries of the state. The number 44 on the five-pointed star signifies that Wyoming was the 44th state admitted to the Union. On top of the <b>pillars</b> rest <b>lamps</b> from which burn the Light of Knowledge. Scrolls encircling the two pillars bear the words, Oil, Mines, Livestock, and Grain, four of Wyoming's major industries.|$|R
2500|$|New {{post box}} designs were ordered in 1887 for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. For {{the first time}} there was a lamp-post mounted letter box for use in London squares, but which soon {{established}} themselves in rural areas (see lamp boxes). For the big cities, a double-aperture oval-shaped pillar (designated Type C) was introduced, partly to increase capacity and certainly in London, to allow mail to be pre-sorted by region, normally with apertures marked separately for [...] "London" [...] and [...] "Country". All <b>pillar</b> and <b>lamp</b> boxes now had the distinctive Imperial cypher of Victoria Regina, whilst the wall-mounted boxes continued to show only a block cypher VR. The new pillar box design saw out the reign and remained little changed until 1905, when the basic design was refined.|$|R
50|$|The footway was {{originally}} of red deal (Pinus sylvestris/European Redwood), 3 inches (7.62 cm) {{higher in the}} middle than at the sides to ensure water runoff. The bridge was lit by six lamps in total, two Victorian lamps hanging {{from each of the}} cross braces between the towers with heavy cast iron <b>lamp</b> <b>pillars</b> in character, and four more similar lamps affixed to the towers at the ends of the bridge. The total weight of the iron work of the bridge is over 200 tons (203 tonnes).|$|R
50|$|Temple to Bhavani or Durgadevi has a Balbodh {{inscription}} recording its erection some 200 yews ago. The idol of {{the goddess}} is installed on a high pedestal inside the vestibule and is flanked by representations of Tuljapur and Mahur goddesses. In front of the temple is a tall <b>lamp</b> <b>pillar</b> about 50 feel in height. Repairs were carried out to the temple 8 to 10 Year ago. A fair attended by two to three thousand persons is held on Chaitra suddha 5. The temple has about 30 acres of Inam Lands.|$|R
25|$|The Ganigitti Jain temple is near Bhima's gate in the {{south-east}} of {{the urban}} core section of Hampi. In front {{of it is a}} monolithic <b>lamp</b> <b>pillar.</b> The temple faced north; it is dated to 1385 CE, during the rule of Hindu king Harihara II, based on an inscription in the temple. It is dedicated to Tirthankara Kunthunatha and has plain walls, a pillared mandapa and a square sanctum from which the Jina's statue is missing. There are capitals on the pillars and the doorways have decoration. Over the sanctum is a Dravidian-style, narrowing square, pyramidal tower. Other monuments in the temple compound are in ruins.|$|R
25|$|It is {{also said}} that the {{original}} temple was in existence even before the reign of the Chalukyas who gave royal favour to the beliefs of the Vaishnava, Shaivaite, Jain and Shakta religious orders. They worshipped Banashankari as a form of Shakti, their Supreme Goddess. Epigraphic inscriptions mention that Jagadekamalla I renovated the temple with several additions. Another inscription in Kannada language on a pillar located on the northern side of the temple dated to 1019 AD, describes the bravery of the Rashtrakuta king Bhimadeva. The Deepa Stambas (<b>lamp</b> <b>pillar)</b> are seen {{at the entrance to the}} temple; the construction of these, as per an inscription, are ascribed to the warrior Ketimayya.|$|R
25|$|The temple faces eastwards, {{aligning}} the sanctums of the Shiva and Pampa Devi temples to the sunrise; a large gopuram marks its entrance. The superstructure is a pyramidal tower with pilastered storeys on each {{of which}} is artwork including erotic sculptures. The gopuram leads into a rectangular court that ends in another, smaller gopura dated to 1510 CE. To its south side is a 100-column hall with Hindu-related reliefs on all four sides of each pillar. Connected to this public hall is a community kitchen, a feature found in other major Hampi temples. A channel is cut into the rock to deliver water to the kitchen and the feeding hall. The courtyard after the small gopura has dipa-stambha (<b>lamp</b> <b>pillar)</b> and Nandi.|$|R
2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} a bronze statue of Saint George holding a sword by the blade below the hilt, sculpted by Sir George Frampton, which stands on a grey granite Doric column. At {{the bottom of the}} column is a two-staged square plinth and below that is base of three square stone blocks. The whole memorial stands on three shallow stone steps, taking the memorial to a total height of [...] At the corners of the bottom step are low stone bollards, which are part of the original design, next to which are metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pillars,</b> which are a modern addition. The memorial does not include a space for the names of the fallen; these are instead recorded on a bronze plaque which was placed in Hove Library.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of this}} update, officially {{known as}} the TJ MY02 series, side impact bars {{previously}} fitted only to export models were also introduced for Australian market cars, and the front doors now featured energy absorbing material. The Magna Executive received ABS and power windows as standard, while the Advance, Sports and VR-X were each fitted with a six speaker sound system (up from four), automatic climate control, front map lamps, glovebox lamp and power antenna. The Verada Xi's electric sunroof with front map <b>lamps</b> and C <b>pillar</b> courtesy <b>lamps</b> was now optional on all models. The Sports was further distanced from the VR-X by no longer sharing the same boot lid spoiler, but a smaller version (which became another optional accessory across the Magna range, and was fitted as standard on subsequent limited-run models, the Verada GTV and Diamante VR-X). Power for the standard (non [...] "high output") 3.5-litre V6 engine increased to [...] thanks to a higher compression ratio and a Karman Vortex airflow meter. The instrument cluster now had an integrated odometer and trip meter, {{as opposed to the}} previous analogue setup. The above engine power increase also interested the Verada range. Moreover, the Ei was now fitted with a new chrome grille, while both the Ei and Xi received new design alloy-wheels and illuminated vanity mirrors. With this update all cars now had clear front turn bezels.|$|R
6000|$|CAESAR. Incorrigible, oh, incorrigible! Away! (He follows her, the bucina {{sounding}} louder as they steal {{across the}} desert. The moonlight wanes: the horizon again shows black against the sky, {{broken only by}} the fantastic silhouette of the Sphinx. The sky itself vanishes in darkness, from which there is no relief until the gleam of a distant torch falls on great Egyptian pillars supporting the roof of a majestic corridor. At the further end of this corridor a Nubian slave appears carrying the torch. Caesar, still led by Cleopatra, follows him. They come down the corridor, Caesar peering keenly about at the strange architecture, and at the pillar shadows between which, as the passing torch makes them hurry noiselessly backwards, figures of men with wings and hawks' heads, and vast black marble cats, seem to flit in and out of ambush. Further along, the wall turns a corner and makes a spacious transept in which Caesar sees, on his right, a throne, and behind the throne a door. On each side of the throne is a slender <b>pillar</b> with a <b>lamp</b> on it.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{entrance}} to the complex is crowned by a Rajagopura (superstructure over entrance) built during {{the days of the}} Vijayanagar empire. [...] Within the complex, the Chennakesava temple is at the centre, facing east, and is flanked by the Kappe Channigraya temple on its right, and a small Sowmyanayaki (form of the goddess Lakshmi) temple set slightly back. On its left, also set slightly back is the Ranganayaki (Andal) temple. Two main sthambha (pillar) exist here. The pillar facing the main temple, the Garuda (eagle) sthambha was erected in the Vijayanagar period while the pillar on the right, the Deepa sthambha (<b>pillar</b> with <b>lamp)</b> dates from the Hoysala period. This is the first great Hoysala temple, though according to the art critic and historian Settar, the artistic idiom and signature is still Western Chalukyan. Hence, the over-decoration which is seen in later Hoysala temples (including the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu and the Keshava temple at Somanathapura) is not visible here. According to Settar, during later years, the Hoysala art took an inclination towards craftsmanship, with a weakness for minutiae. The Chennakesava temple has three entrances and their doorways have decorated sculptures called dvarapalaka (doorkeepers) on either side. While the Kappe Channigraya temple is smaller than the Chennakesava temple, it is architecturally significant, though it lacks any sculptural features. The Kappe Chennigraya temple became a dvikuta (two shrined temple) with the later addition of a shrine to its original plan. The original shrine has a star-shaped plan while the additional shrine is a simple square. The image inside is also that of Kesava ( [...] a form of the god Krishna) and was commissioned by Shantala Devi, the noted queen of King Vishnuvardhana.|$|R
50|$|On {{the right}} {{bank of the}} stream behind the Pant's mansion is a small temple of Mahadev about thirty feet by fifteen with a flight of steps leading down to the stream. It {{consists}} of an open sided mandap and an image-chamber with a spire. The pillars are imitations of the early Hindu style. The spire is of brick with stone ornamentation. The temple of Yamnai Devi lies on the summit of a somewhat pointed hill about 350 to 400 ft above the plain. The way up to it is by the road before mentioned which close to the gorge is left on the right for a flight of 300 steps with a stone balustrade on each side. The temple court, irregular and nearly oval is entered from the west by a pointed archway with a music chamber or nagarkhana on the top. The rock is fenced with a solid masonry wall about twelve feet high from inside, and outside in places from thirty to forty feet high. At the eastern end is a small entrance from a path communicating with a spring halfway down the south slope of the hill. There are cloisters with a terrace on the left or south side of this entrance and on the north a large solid but plain <b>lamp</b> <b>pillar</b> or dipmal. The pillar was broken years ago by lightning and as this {{was said to be}} the third time of its being struck, it was thought ominous to repair it. The temple is a plain structure about forty feet by twenty feet with a flat roofed hall or mandap supported on three rows of four pillars about eighteen inches square at the base and plain imitations of the early Hindu style. The image-chamber or gabhara is square and contains an image of devi in black stone ornamented with jewels and embroidered apparel and displayed with much pomp by means of a mirror casting light upon it from outside. The courtyard is paved and immediately in front of the mandap is a stone embedded in the pavement and containing vents made to receive coins to be laid in them for presentation to the goddess. A yearly fair is held, in her honour from Kartik Paurnima onwards for 15 days, when about 1,00,000 people attend.|$|R
5000|$|The shrine was {{attacked}} and destroyed on 14 April 1622, the Tamil New Years Day, by the Portuguese general Constantino de Sá de Noronha (who {{called it the}} Temple of a Thousand <b>Pillars).</b> Eleven brass <b>lamps</b> had been lit in the shrine and the main statues were taken out to town during the ther procession in the festive period, during which time Portuguese soldiers entered the temple dressed as Iyer priests and began robbing it. In an act of religious zeal, the temple was then levered over the edge into the sea. Fleeing priests buried some of the temple's statues in the surrounding area, and all remaining priests, pilgrims and employees were massacred. The final monument of the temple complex was destroyed two years later in 1624. Temple stones and its carved pillars were used to construct Fort Fredrick to strengthen the colonists' influence over the eastern seaboard of the island against other invading European armies, including the Dutch navy during the Dutch-Portuguese Wars. A new church and village were built {{in and around the}} fort. An extensive campaign of destruction of five hundred Hindu shrines, the Saraswathi Mahal Library and forced conversion in the Tamil country was conducted by the Portuguese upon their arrival to the island and conquest of the Jaffna kingdom; the temple had been paying protection fees of 1280 fanams a year to the Portuguese. Trincomalee witnessed several naval battles of Europe's Thirty Years' War under Phillip II's man Filipe de Oliveira. Between 1639 and 1689 A.D., the Ati Konanayakar temple was built in nearby Thampalakamam to house the idols on procession that survived. The destruction of the Konesar temple is historically viewed as the biggest loot of one of the richest temples of Asia. Gold, pearls, precious stones and silks collected for more than a millennium were robbed within a few hours. A site plan by De Quieroz states: [...] "On the first rise to the summit of the rock was a Pagoda, another at mid-ascent - the principal one of them all at the highest eminence, visited by a concourse of Hindus from the whole of India." [...] He describes three temples of the compound on the promontory, stating that pilgrims leaped from the last temple into the ocean in sacrifice to their idols. In his dispatch to Philip III, King of Portugal, Constantine described: [...] "The land of the Pagoda is 600 fathoms long and 80 feet at its broadest, narrowing to 30 feet." [...] Regarding a prophetic Tamil inscription de Noronha found at the site, he added [...] "When I went there to make this Fort, I found engraved on the Pagoda, among many other inscriptions, one that ran thus: Kulakottan has built this pagoda..." ...|$|R
