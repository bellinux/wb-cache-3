50|$|Guitar: this is {{the output}} from a humbucking pickup. A three {{position}} EQ switch, plus tone control, provided variation to the guitar signal. There is also an optional mild <b>peaking</b> <b>filter,</b> somewhat similar to a wah-wah pedal, on the GR-500 module.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{the effect}} being {{controlled}} by a pedal, as on a standard wah-wah, the effect alters {{in response to the}} volume of the input signal. Like a wah, it works by adjusting a <b>peaking</b> <b>filter,</b> which amplifies a specific frequency and cuts off other selected frequencies. Since the electronic circuits in the effect can respond much faster than a human musician can physically move a pedal, certain effects that a standard wah cannot achieve are only possible with auto-wah. The response {{of the effect}} is highly interactive with the dynamics of the input signal - this makes it possible to vary the response at will via slight adjustments to playing technique. Therefore it may take some practice before the response of the auto-wah can be wilfully controlled in order to achieve a consistent sound.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{potential}} benefits and pitfalls of using active inductors instead of monolithic spiral inductors for on-chip filtering are investigated. In particular, the metrics of power consumption, required area, inductor quality factor, {{and frequency of}} operation are taken into consideration.

50|$|Some of {{the more}} {{desirable}} features of the XP-50's sound engine are frequency cross-modulation, tone delay variations, MIDI clock sync, high/low/band pass and <b>peaking</b> resonant <b>filter</b> options, and synchronizable LFOs.|$|R
40|$|The human {{visual system}} {{contains}} {{a large number}} of narrowly-tuned spatial-frequency-specific channels. Does it contain an analogous set of channels tuned to a narrow range of temporal frequency? On the basis of data gathered {{with the use of a}} threshold elevation technique it is argued that human sensitivity to flicker can be accounted for by assuming the existence of just two filters, one a low-pass <b>filter</b> <b>peaking</b> gently at around 6 Hz and one a band-pass <b>filter</b> <b>peaking</b> at around 9 Hz. Similar data gathered from studies of interocular transfer suggest that at least some of the mechanisms involved are binocular, rather than being purely monocular as has previously been suggested...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK) for Canon's PowerShot cameras, third party {{firmware}} was also produced for the 5D Mark II. The Magic Lantern firmware provides many additional video and cinematography related controls and meters such as false colors, and zebra stripes for exposure control, depth of field estimates via <b>peaking</b> <b>filters,</b> audio VU meters and disables the automatic gain control on the microphone input (although some of these features have since been added to Canon's official firmware, as noted above). Recent nightly builds have even managed to provide a stable output of uncompressed 14-Bit RAW video data onto fast UDMA 7 CF cards at almost HD resolution (1004p vs. 1080p at Full HD). Although the size of the files and high price of appropriate cards are considered moderate drawbacks and the 5D Mark III generally shows better performance regarding RAW video, the Mark II, being the oldest among them, still remains to be the next best among reasonable choices for DSLR RAW video output and showcases thus, that uncompressed HD RAW video on a DSLR was already theoretically possible with technology of the year 2008.|$|R
40|$|In {{modern day}} {{communication}} systems, {{there is a}} constant demand for increase in transmission rates. This is however limited by the bandwidth limitation of the channel. Inter symbol interference (ISI) imposes a great threat to increasing data rates by degrading the signal quality. Equalizers are used at the receiver to compensate for the losses in the channel and thereby greatly mitigate ISI. Further, an adaptive equalizer is desired which can be used over a channel whose response is unknown or is time-varying. A low power equalizing solution in a moderately attenuated channel is an analog <b>peaking</b> <b>filter</b> which boosts the signal high frequency components. Such conventional continuous time linear equalizers (CTLE) provide a single degree of controllability over the high frequency boost. A more complex CTLE has been designed which has two degrees of freedom by controlling the high frequency boost as well as the range of frequencies over which the boost is applied. This extra degree of controllability over the equalizer response is desired to better adapt to the varying channel response and result in an equalized signal with a wider eye opening. A robust adaptation technique is necessary to tune the equalizer characteristics. Some of the commonly used techniques for adaptation of CTLEs are based on energy comparison criterion in the frequency domain. But the adaptation achieved using these techniques might not be optimal especially for an equalizer with two degrees of controllability. In such cases an eye opening monitor (EOM) could be used which evaluates the actual signal quality in time domain. The EOM gives an estimate on the signal quality by measuring the eye opening of the equalized signal in horizontal and vertical domain. In this thesis work a CTLE with two degrees of freedom with an EOM based adaptation system has been implemented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Most design {{procedures}} for a digital parametric equalizer begin with analog design techniques, followed {{by applying the}} bilinear transform to an analog prototype. As an alternative, an approximation to the parametric equalizer is sometimes designed using pole-zero placement techniques. In this paper, we present an exact derivation of the parametric equalizer without resorting to an analog prototype. We show {{that there are many}} solutions to the parametric equalizer design constraints as usually stated, but only one of which consistently yields stable, minimum phase bbehaviorwith the upper and lower cutoff frequencies positioned around the center frequency. The conditions for complex conjugate poles and zeros are found and the resultant pole zero placements are examined. Index Terms—Filter design, parametric equalizers, <b>peaking</b> and notch <b>filters,</b> pole zero placement. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we present SFERA, a low-noise fully-programmable 16 channel readout ASIC {{designed}} for both X- and γ-ray spectroscopy and imaging applications. The chip {{is designed to}} process signals coming from solid-state detectors and CMOS preamplifiers. The design has been guided {{by the use of}} Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) and CUBE charge sensitive amplifiers (CSAs), although we consider the ASIC sufficiently versatile to be used with other types of detectors. Five different gains are implemented, namely 2800 e-, 4400 e-, 10000 e-, 14000 e- and 20000 e-, considering the input connected to a 25 fF feedback capacitance CMOS preamplifier. <b>Filter</b> <b>peaking</b> times (tP) are also programmable among 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 μs. Each readout channel is the cascade of a 9 th order semi-Gaussian shaping-amplifier (SA) and a peak detector (PKS), followed by a dedicated pile-up rejection (PUR) digital logic. Three data multiplexing strategies are implemented: the so-called polling X, intended for high-rate X-ray applications, the polling γ, for scintillation light detection and the sparse, for signals derandomization. The spectroscopic characterization has shown an energy resolution of 122. 1 eV FWHM on the Mn-Kα line of an 55 Fe X-ray source using a 10 mm 2 SDD cooled at - 35 °C at 4 μs <b>filter</b> <b>peaking</b> time. The measured resolution is 130 eV at the peaking time of 500 ns. At 1 Mcps input count rate and 500 ns peaking time, we have measured 42 % of processed events at the output of the ASIC after the PUR selection. Output data can be digitized on-chip by means of an embedded 12 -bit successive-approximation ADC. The effective resolution of the data converter is 10. 75 -bit when operated at 4. 5 MS/s. The chosen technology is the AMS 0. 35 μm CMOS and the chip area occupancy is 5 × 5 mm 2...|$|R
