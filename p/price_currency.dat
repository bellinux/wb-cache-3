The IDIV is developed {{based on the}} implied volatility estimated on equally spaced intradaily intervals. This model captures the intra-daily level aggregate information related to foreign exchange (FX) behavior, which changes every five minutes. The implied volatility (IV) and realized volatility (RV) are widely accepted as good estimates of daily and intra-daily price volatility, respectively. Therefore, using the options pricing framework, we assess the capability of IDIV against IV and RV in pricing foreign currency options. A comparison of out-of-sample forecasts under both the F-test and Diebold-Mariano test reveals that the IDIV outperforms both the IV and the RV in estimating one-day-ahead option prices. In other words, the IDIV estimation framework provides a more accurate and efficient volatility estimate for pricing currency options. The {{findings of this study}} indicate that the forward looking intra-daily information of IDIV is appropriate to price options correctly rather than forward looking daily and historical intra-daily information is obtained by the IV and RV, respectively...|$|E

We solve the model globally in closed form without restricting the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods to one. Using this global closed-form solution, we give an exact characterization of optimal monetary policy and welfare with and without international policy cooperation. We consider the cases of internationally complete asset markets and financial autarky, producer <b>currency</b> <b>pricing</b> and local <b>currency</b> <b>pricing.</b> Under producer <b>currency</b> <b>pricing,</b> it is always optimal to mimic the flexible-price equilibrium through a policy of price stability.

Even if substitutability differs from one, the continuum of small open economies implies that the share of each country's output in the world consumption basket (and therefore {{the impact of the}} country's monopoly power) is negligible. This removes the incentive to deviate from price stability under producer <b>currency</b> <b>pricing</b> or a fixed exchange rate under local <b>currency</b> <b>pricing.</b> There are no gains from international monetary cooperation in all cases examined. Our results stand in contrast to those in the literature on optimal monetary policy for large open economies, where strategic interactions drive optimal policy away from price stability or fixed exchange rates, and gains from cooperation are present, when substitutability differs from one. ...|$|R

The customers, such as telecommunications companies and weather forecasters, are very price sensitive and, usually, {{award contracts to}} the lowest priced bids. Lockheed manufactures satellites {{using a combination of}} in-house manufacturing, purchasing, and subcontracting (for subcontract parts). The subcontract parts constitute a majority of a satellite's costs. Lockheed uses contracts and other supply management techniques to stay competitive and to keep satellite, specifically subcontract part, costs under control. Some of the subcontract part contracts are managed under subcontract agreements called long-term agreements (LTA). A small supplier pool, long turnover (for bringing these suppliers onboard), regulatory requirements, and capital-intensive nature of the industry are important considerations in evaluating these LTAs. The LTAs embody the risks inherent in project supply chains, specifically, <b>price,</b> <b>currency,</b> and supply risks. In such events, LTAs can become a liability and can lead to monetary losses or discord with suppliers.

We analyze these issues in an intertemporal optimizing model that allows a portion of aid to be devoted to reducing the government’s seigniorage requirement.

40|$|On July 31, 1985, Farmlands Grain New Zealand Society Ltd {{engaged the}} Agricultural Economics Research Unit at Lincoln College {{to conduct an}} audit of the {{marketing}} and administrative performance of the Society for the four pool years, 1981 - 85 inclusive. The AERU was given full access to all records of the Society. Given {{the growth of the}} Society, a number of its operational systems are continuing to evolve rapidly. Some suggestions made in this report are already being adopted. Other suggestions and criticisms need to be viewed {{in the context of this}} rapidly evolving organisation. It was wise and indeed fortunate to establish the South Island Barley Society Ltd in the Spring of 1980. This buoyant period of world market demand for coarse grains from non traditional sources enabled the Society to establish itself firmly in the market. Since that time, the Society has continued to perform at a very high level in a volatile external operating environment, both at home and overseas. The Society has managed its grain marketing operations energetically with a high degree of effort in export marketing. The Society has established a major new New Zealand export product (Triumph Malting Barley). This achievement may be one of the greatest export marketing efforts of the last five years. The risk management procedures of the Society have been prudent and operated in a measured, systematic fashion. This has resulted in significantly higher pool returns to farmer clients over the four year period 1981 - 85. There is every indication that the Society can maintain and even enhance its market leadership position in the future. There is of course, room for some improvement in certain areas. The reporting of management and marketing performance to clients (current and potential) is weak. In one sense the high performance level of the Society has been obvious through pool returns but until very recently, little appears to have been done to explain the source of this performance. It is recommended that the Society produce a management report each year to complement the financial reporting system. With the rapid developments in financial markets and policy changes in New Zealand, risk management may require increased attention in the future. Increased attention may need to be devoted to establishing longer term marketing arrangements and early sales in the August-November period. Furthermore, a daily system of monitoring the exposure of each pool (and the Society overall) to <b>price,</b> <b>currency</b> and farm contract risk is required for operational purposes. This comment need not be interpreted as a criticism of past performance because most export enterprises are in the same position in New Zealand as a result of the changed exchange rate policy, the opening of futures markets and the removal of a wide array of financial regulations...|$|E
40|$|For each {{specific}} offshore {{development project}} the partnership agrees {{on a project}} execution strategy and a contract strategy. These strategies determine how the project will be executed - how the contracts will be defined, awarded and followed up. The facility will often have a combination of “local” and “global” content. For fabrication in Norway the Norwegian value creation will be the contract value minus the value of imported goods and services. For fabrication in the Far East, the Norwegian value creation will be the value of Norwegian goods and services used in the fabrication. It has been a common understanding that Far East fabrication is less expensive than Norwegian fabrication and Far East yards have won {{an increasing number of}} contracts. This has mainly happened during the last ten years, a period with dramatic cost increases worldwide. However, the market is currently changing and three main contributing factors to this has been illuminated in this thesis: globalization, oil <b>price,</b> <b>currency.</b> With the reduced oil price, and a change by approximately 30 pct. in the ratio between Norwegian kroner and American dollars, there is a general trend towards a reduced cost level. At the same time, the globalization of the industry is increasing the competition for contracts on the Norwegian continental shelf, forcing the yards to give more competitive prices. This thesis seeks to discover whether this new market situation has changed the competition between Norwegian and Far East yards. A qualitative research study has been conducted by collecting primary data through interviews, and secondary data from books, news articles, reports, and online databases. Through a study of the current trends and challenges in the industry today, the current market situation has been discussed and evaluated. Further, a quantitative analysis of five representative project developments has been conducted regarding their cost development and level of Norwegian content, {{in order to get a}} deeper understanding of how the market situation has influenced them. The analysis includes the projects: Gjøa, Edvard Grieg, Goliat, Ivar Aasen, and Aasta Hansteen. These projects vary in both technical concept and fabrication yard. The analysis shows a general cost increase in all the five project developments. In addition, the level of Norwegian content in the developments indicates a trend where the projects with the lowest level of Norwegian content are also those projects with the largest cost overrun and delay. This thesis is aimed at providing useful insight towards the current market situation and its effect on the facility topside contractors, with focus on the competition between Norwegian and Far East yards. The work conducted throughout this thesis shows that the new market situation has contributed to a change in the competition between the two. The trend being that while the Far East yards are struggling to meet their expectations, the Norwegian yards are increasing their competitiveness in the competition for contracts on the Norwegian continental shelf...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} how new credit risk transfer vehicles have {{made it easier to}} reallocate large amounts of credit risk from the financial sector to the non-financial sector of the capital markets. In this article, we describe one of these new credit risk transfer vehicles, the collateralized debt obligation. Synthetic credit debt obligations utilize credit default swaps, another relatively new credit risk transfer vehicle. Financial institutions face five major risks: credit, interest rate, <b>price,</b> <b>currency,</b> and liquidity. The development of the derivatives markets prior to 1990 provided financial institutions with efficient vehicles for the transfer of interest rate, price, and currency risks, as well as enhancing the liquidity of the underlying assets. However, it is only in recent years that the market for the efficient transfer of credit risk has developed. Credit risk is the risk that a debt instrument will decline in value {{as a result of the}} borrower's inability (real or perceived) to satisfy the contractual terms of its borrowing arrangement. In the case of corporate debt obligations, credit risk encompasses default, credit spread, and rating downgrade risks. The most obvious way for a financial institution to transfer the credit risk of a loan it has originated is to sell it to another party. Loan covenants typically require that the obligor be informed of the sale. The drawback of a sale in the case of corporate loans is the potential impairment of the originating financial institution's relationship with the obligor of the loan sold. Syndicated loans overcome the drawback of an outright sale because banks in the syndicate may sell their loan shares in the secondary market. The sale may be through an assignment or through participation. While the former mechanism for a syndicated loan requires the approval of the obligor, the latter does not since the payments are merely passed through to the purchaser and therefore the obligor need not know about the sale. Another form of credit risk transfer (CRT) vehicle developed in the 1980 s is securitization [Fabozzi and Kothari (2007) ]. In a securitization, a financial institution that originates loans pools them and sells them to a special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE obtains funds to acquire the pool of loans by issuing securities. Payment of interest and principal on the securities issued by the SPE is obtained from the cash flow of the pool of loans. While the financial institution employing securitization retains some of the credit risk associated with the pool of loans, the majority of the credit risk is transferred to the holders of the securities issued by the SPE. Two recent developments for transferring credit risk are credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). For financial institutions, credit derivatives allow the transfer of credit risk to another party without the sale of the loan. A CDO is an application of the securitization technology. With the development of the credit derivatives market, CDOs can be created without the actual sale of a pool of loans to an SPE using credit derivatives. CDOs created using credit derivatives are referred to as synthetic CDOs. In this article, we discuss CDOs. We begin with the basics of CDOs and then discuss synthetic CDOs. The issues for regulators and supervisors of capital markets with respect to CDOs, as well as credit derivatives, are also discussed.
