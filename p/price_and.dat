40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> consumption, {{through the use of}} debt. Using unique Canadian household-level data that reports the uses of debt, we begin by looking at the relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> debt. Using quantile regression, we find a positive and significant relationship between regional house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> total household debt all along the conditional debt distribution. This suggests that the household-level relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> debt goes beyond the purchase of real estate. We then find a positive relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> non-mortgage debt (the sum of secured lines of credit, unsecured lines of credit, leases and other consumer loans, except for credit cards) for homeowners. Combining these results with the reported uses of non-mortgage debt allows us to connect house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> nonhousing consumption - this connection is new to the literature on house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> consumption. We conclude that the increases in house prices over the 1999 - 2007 period were, indeed, associated with an increase in non-mortgage debt and non-housing consumption. Our results {{can be thought of as}} the establishment of a conservative lower bound for the overall relationship between house <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> aggregate consumption...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Housing market cycles are {{featured}} by {{a positive correlation}} of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> trading volume, which is conventionally attributed to a causal relationship between <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume. This paper analyzes the housing markets in 114 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States from 1990 to 2002, treats both <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume as endogenous variables, and studies whether and how exogenous shocks cause co-movements of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume. At quarterly frequency, we find that, first, both home <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> trading volume are affected by conditions in labor markets, the mortgage market, and the stock market, and the effects differ between markets with low and high supply elasticity. Second, home prices Granger cause trading volume, but the effects are asymmetric—decreases in prices reduce trading volume, <b>and</b> increases in <b>prices</b> have no effect. Third, trading volume also Granger causes home prices, but only in markets with inelastic supply. Finally, we find a statistically significant positive price–volume correlation; which, however, is mainly explained by co-movements of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume caused by exogenous shocks, instead of the Granger causality between <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> volume...|$|R
