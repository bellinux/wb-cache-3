This {{distortion of the}} correlation function {{is similar to the}} saturation eect of the correlation function in a high power excitation region. The correlation amplitude is signicantly reduced by the deadtime. The deviations in the number of molecules and diusion time are empirically given by the deviation of the uorescence intensity linearity. The empirical curves of the deviations {{can be applied to the}} systematic error estimation of the parameters. The <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> the number of molecules to the concentration of uorophores is no longer maintained with the large deadtime, although almost all <b>of</b> the <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> the diusion time to the inverse diusion constant remains.

40|$|Competing {{theoretical}} claims {{exist in}} the literature on the effect <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> on political trust. To date, empirical studies yielded mixed results. In this paper, we examine a curvilinear effect <b>of</b> the <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> election outcomes on political trust using data from the European Social Survey (2006 - 2009). The findings show that political trust is indeed highest in countries with very proportional as well as in countries with very disproportional election outcomes and lowest in countries that fall in between. Election outcomes that are more fully inclusive and those that provide more accountability can both lead to higher levels of political trust. Next to the <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> the translation of votes into seats, this study investigates a broad range of election outcomes that are associated with (dis) proportionality i. e. the effect of the number of parties in elections, parliament and government, voting for the winning or losing party under different levels <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> and the clarity of responsibility. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} compared {{physical characteristics}} of bodybuilders to judges' rankings, and compared the judges' rankings across {{three levels of}} judges: Elite, Trained, and Untrained. Twenty-nine male and nine female bodybuilding athletes consented to anthropometric and circumference measurements. The independent variables {{in this study were}} bodyfat, fat-free weight, and <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> muscle. Three groups of judges ranked male and female athletes in the Open, Novice, Collegiate, and Masters divisions. The measurements <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> muscle, bodyfat, girths, and fat-free weight were analyzed using simple and multiple regression. The judges' rankings in each class were compared using reliability coefficients, correlation, repeated measures analysis of variance, and the generalized theory for inter-rater reliability. There were significant correlations between the Elite judges' rankings and bodyfat in the Men's Open lightweight class. The Trained and Elite judges' rankings were significantly correlated with bodyfat in the Women's Novice class. Fat-free weight was significantly correlated with the Untrained and Elite judges' rankings in the Women's Novice division. <b>Proportionality</b> <b>of</b> muscle was significantly correlated with the Elite and Trained judges' rankings in the Men's Open lightweight class.

40|$|The {{process of}} Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is a {{globally}} widespread tool to avoid excessive regulation.

The <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> regulation is mainly based on three requirements.

Most adequacy requirements are not met or the process is not satisfactorily evaluated by RIA. Depth evaluation of the impacts in both RIAs is very different.
