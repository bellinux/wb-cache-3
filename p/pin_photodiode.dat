Detectors which utilize Silicon <b>PIN</b> <b>Photodiodes</b> have been increasingly used in recent years, due to their low cost and being worked with at room temperature, the liquid nitrogen containers used with Ge and Si(Li) detectors not being necessary. Although, initially, the <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> have a poorer energy resolution, as compared with Ge detectors, itś good enough for most purposes. Moreover, the development of thermoelectrically cooled systems and low noise level pre-amplifiers have resulted in <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> achieving comparable resolutions to Ge ones. This work seeks to establish the properties of detectors made with Silicon <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> and to develop the correctional process of the raw specffa both for the efficiency of the detector and other relevant factors, with the aim of obtaining the true spectrum emitted by radiodiagnostic equipment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the behavior of}} <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> after combined gamma and neutron irradiation. Different types of <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> have been exposed first to gamma and then to neutron irradiation. I-V characteristics (current dependence on voltage) of photodiodes have been measured after each of these irradiations. It has been noted that the photocurrent level after the neutron irradiation is higher than before it, which is {{not consistent with the}} current theories about the effects of neutron radiation on semiconductors. In order to explain this behavior of the photodiodes, the Monte Carlo simulation of photon transport through the material has been used. It is proposed that a possible cause for current enhancement are defects in semiconductor created by gamma irradiation and effects of neutron irradiation on these defects. The results can be explained by an intercentre transfer of charge between defects in close proximity to each other.
