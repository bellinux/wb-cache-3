Good print quality, a property that makes the print legible, is of utmost importance for identification and preventing mix-ups among various types of capsules.

Elimination or compensation of print appearance variations is necessary for improving defect detection performance of inspection systems. For that reason, a novel appearance-based method for <b>print</b> quality <b>inspection</b> on capsules is proposed.

Therefore, an optical inspection system for such tasks has to be equipped with several high-speed/high-resolution cameras, each acquiring hundreds of megabytes of data per second. This paper presents an inspection system which meets the given requirements by exploiting data parallelism and algorithmic parallelism. This is achieved by using complex field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for image processing. The scalable system consists of several processing modules, each representing a pair of a FPGA and a digital signal processor. The main chapters of the paper focus on the functionality implemented in the FPGA. The image processing algorithms include flat-field correction, lens distortion correction, image pyramid generation, neighborhood operations, a programmable arithmetic unit, and a geometry unit.

Examples are quality assurance in <b>print</b> <b>inspection,</b> {{printed circuit board}} inspection, wafer inspection, real-time surveillance of railroad tracks, and in-line monitoring in flat panel fabrication lines. Ultra-highspeed is an often demanded feature in modern industrial production facilities, especially, where it comes to high volume production. A novel technology {{in this context is}} the new high-speed sensor for line-scan camera applications with unmatched line rates up to 200 kHz (tri-linear RGB) and 600 kHz (b/w), presented in this paper. At this speed, the multiline-scan sensor provides full color images with, e. g., a spatial resolution of 50 µm at a transport speed of 10 m/s. In contrast to conventional Bayer pattern or three-chip approaches, the sensor presented here utilizes the tri-linear principle, where the color filters are organized line-wise on the chip. With almost 100 % fill-factor, the tri-linear technology assures high image quality because of its robustness against aliasing and Moiré effects leading to improved inspection quality, less false positives and thus less waste in the production lines...|$|E

In addition, a framework for comparing blur estimation procedures based on barcode readability is introduced.

40|$|A large {{percentage}} of bridges {{in the state of}} Iowa are classified as structurally or fiinctionally deficient. These bridges annually compete for a share of Iowa's limited transportation budget. To avoid {{an increase in the number}} of deficient bridges, the state of Iowa decided to implement a comprehensive Bridge Management System (BMS) and selected the Pontis BMS software as a bridge management tool. This program will be used to provide a selection of maintenance, repair, and replacement strategies for the bridge networks to achieve an efficient and possibly optimal allocation of resources. The Pontis BMS software uses a new rating system to evaluate extensive and detailed inspection data gathered for all bridge elements. To manually collect these data would be a highly time-consuming job. The objective of this work was to develop an automated-computerized methodology for an integrated data base that includes the rating conditions as defined in the Pontis program. Several of the available techniques that can be used to capture inspection data were reviewed, and the most suitable method was selected. To accomplish the objectives of this work, two userfriendly programs were developed. One program is used in the field to collect inspection data following a step-by-step procedure without the need to refer to the Pontis user's manuals. The other program is used in the office to read the inspection data and prepare input files for the Pontis BMS software. These two programs require users to have very limited knowledge of computers. On-line help screens as well as options for preparing, viewing, and <b>printing</b> <b>inspection</b> reports are also available. The developed data collection software will improve and expedite the process of conducting bridge inspections and preparing the required input files for the Pontis program.

40|$|The {{application}} of the Reticon RO- 64 annular photo-diode array {{to the task of}} optical tracking of special targets, direct optical focusing, and automatic <b>printed</b> circuit board <b>inspection</b> were studied. In order to facilitate this work, a digital camera unit incorporating the array was designed and constructed. Of the three applications investigated, the tracking task proved to be the most successful, since multiple targets were tracked in real time using the array. In the focusing application, the digital approach was found to be too slow for real-time use, and suggestions were made for the analog implementation of a focusing algorithm using the array. The <b>printed</b> circuit board <b>inspection</b> algorithm detected errors successfully, but the inefficiency of image acquisition with the array is a serious drawback, leading to the conclusion that linear arrays of similar design would provide faster and less expensive inspection.

While many remanufacturers of toner cartridges for laser printers replace the recycled organic photoconductive (OPC) drums with new aftermarket ones, others opt to reuse the recycled OPCs. The latter approach yields a savings to the remanufacturer in both material cost and waste, but since the condition of a used drum is unknown, tests must be performed on each individual OPC to determine its reusability.

This investigation has been concerned with the application of image processing techniques and the leakage light detection method. The hardware and software requirements for automatic visual inspection of stuffed board components are established initially using available equipment from the Department of Production Technology.
