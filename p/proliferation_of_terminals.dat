40|$|Abstract: With the {{increasingly}} demanding schedules of formal and casual learners and the <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> devices available for content delivery, learners are demanding ubiquitous {{access to their}} learning. The multi-modal nature {{of the variety of}} devices employed by these learners will necessitate that learning experiences can be started on one device and transitioned seamlessly to another as the learner changes the context of their learning. This movement of learning experience between devices, which may have dramatically different capabilities, presents a usability challenge to ensure our learners do not feel their learning experience has been adversely affected. Personalized eLearning offerings can be tailored not only to the learner, but also to the device they are using. Generally, the evaluations that have been carried out of personalized eLearning systems have concentrated on systems that are delivered via devices, such as desktop computers, that have generous screen real estate available for rendering the personalized courses. When screen real estate and characteristics such as bandwidth are limited appropriate personalization becomes much more important.

Inactivating mutations in Kiss 1 and the kisspeptin receptor (GPR 54 /Kiss 1 r) are associated with pubertal failure and infertility. Kiss 2, a paralogous gene for kiss 1, has been recently identified in several vertebrates including zebrafish. Using our transgenic zebrafish model {{system in which the}} GnRH 3 promoter drives expression of emerald green fluorescent protein, we investigated the effects of kisspeptins on development of the GnRH neuronal system during embryogenesis and on electrical activity during adulthood. Quantitative PCR showed detectable levels of kiss 1 and kiss 2 mRNA by 1 day post fertilization, increasing throughout embryonic and larval development. Early treatment with Kiss 1 or Kiss 2 showed that both kisspeptins stimulated <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> trigeminal GnRH 3 neurons located in the peripheral nervous system.

On one hand, the <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> user <b>terminals</b> such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks, smart TVs, game consoles, and desktop computers makes {{it extremely difficult}} {{to achieve the same}} level of protection regardless of the device used. On another hand, when various users share devices (e. g. parents and kids using the same devices at home), the setup of distinct security profiles, policies, and protection rules for the different users <b>of</b> a <b>terminal</b> is far from trivial.

40|$|Abstract — Personalization of web-based content {{coupled with}} a <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> {{heterogeneous}} <b>terminals</b> and devices will dramatically increase the need for computational services. Current trends towards thin clients {{make it difficult to}} perform such computation at the terminal end, while service providers frequently out-source computation, especially when operating under varying load. Today, most computational services utilize a traditional distributed systems model, which does not scale to Internet proportions. To alleviate this problem, we believe that computational services should instead be provided on a highly-distributed, besteffort basis, which has proven successful for packet routing in IP networks. In this paper, we describe an architecture that collocates routing and computational functionality, thereby providing a scalable computational service within a network. The prototype we have built utilizes multiple off-the-shelf PC’s to provide the necessary computational power. Initial experiments indicate that our proposed architecture can be utilized to perform real-time transcoding of video with minimal overhead. Moreover, the architecture does not incur any overhead on conventional IP routing. Keywords—cluster computing, active network, router architecture, multimedia streaming, MPEG transcoder I...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{chemicals}} may {{be involved}} in the etiology of breast cancers. Many studies have addressed the association between cancer in humans and agricultural pesticide exposure. Organophosphorous pesticides have been used extensively to control mosquito plagues. Parathion and malathion are organophosphorous pesticides extensively used to control a wide range of sucking and chewing pests of field crops, fruits, and vegetables. They have many structural similarities with naturally occurring compounds, and their primary target of action in insects is the nervous system; they inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Eserine, parathion, and malathion are cholinesterase inhibitors responsible for the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. Atropine, a parasympatholytic alkaloid, is used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether pesticides were able to induce malignant transformation of the rat mammary gland and to determine whether alterations induced by these substances increase the cholinergic activation influencing such transformation. These results showed that eserine, parathion, and malathion increased cell <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> end buds <b>of</b> the 44 -day-old mammary gland of rats, followed by formation of 8. 6, 14. 3, and 24. 3 % of mammary carcinomas, respectively, after about 28 months. At the same time, acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in the serum of these animals from 9. 78 +/- 0. 78 U/mL in the control animals to 3. 05 +/- 0. 06 U/mL; 2. 57 +/- 0. 15 U/mL; and 3. 88 +/- 0. 44 U/mL in the eserine-, parathion-, and malathion-treated groups, respectively. However, atropine alone induced a significant (p < 0. 05) decrease in the acetylcholinesterase activity from the control value of 9. 78 +/- 0. 78 to 4. 38 +/- 0. 10 for atropine alone, to 1. 32 +/- 0. 06 for atropine in combination with eserine, and 2. 39 +/- 0. 29 for atropine with malathion, and there was no mammary tumor formation.

In WLANs (e. g., the Wi-Fi technology) or in WWANs (e. g., 2. 5 G/ 3 G/ 4 G cellular networks), mobile hosts communicate with an access point or a base station that is connected to the wired networks. Obviously, only one hop wireless link is needed for communications between a mobile host and a stationary host in wired networks. In contrast, there is no fixed infrastructure such as base stations or access points in a MANET. Each node in a MANET is capable of moving independently and functioning as a router that discovers and maintains routes and forwards packets to other nodes.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the {{emerging}} concept that pattern recognition molecules, originally characterized in the immune system, may be expressed and used by neurons to mediate non-immune functions. In line with this concept, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and certain complements proteins have been implicated in synaptic plasticity in the developing visual system. In Paper I, we studied the expression of MHC class I mRNAs and proteins in normal and axotomized spinal mouse motoneurons. Two mRNAs encoding classical MHC class I molecules (H 2 -Kb and H 2 -Db) were moderately expressed in uninjured motoneuron cell bodies. After a peripheral nerve lesion, both mRNAs were strongly up-regulated by axotomized motoneurons and surrounding glial cells. Using a MHC class I antibody with affinity for H 2 -Db, we observed moderate immunoreactivity (IR) in the cell bodies of a subpopulation of uninjured spinal motoneurons. After a peripheral nerve lesion, H 2 -Db IR was strongly increased in activated microglia. In contrast to the in situ hybridization results, the H 2 -Db IR remained unchanged in axotomized motoneuron cell bodies. We then further investigated the in vivo motoneuron expression of H 2 -Db in the periphery. H 2 -Db IR was detected in a subpopulation of axons in the sciatic nerve and at the presynaptic side of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in hind limb muscles. When studying mice deficient in classical MHC class I (Kb-/-Db-/-), we observed abnormal dynamic changes in NMJ density during muscle reinnervation and delayed motor recovery after a sciatic nerve crush (SNC). During the reinnervation phase, Kb-/-Db-/- mice also displayed an attenuated <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> Schwann cells at NMJs compared to wild-type mice (WT). Interestingly, we found expression of the paired immunoglobulin receptor B in dissociated Schwann cells and histological sections from the sciatic nerve. In order to investigate the role of MHC class I proteins in central motoneuron plasticity, we studied synaptic elimination from axotomized motoneuron cell bodies at the ultrastructural level in Paper II. In contrast to a previous publication by Shatz et al. 2000, axotomized motoneurons in mice lacking functional MHC class I (TAP 1 -/- and beta 2 m-/-) displayed an increased synaptic elimination compared to WT mice. Moreover, in beta 2 m-/- mice the remaining terminals were randomly dispersed along the cytoplasmic membrane in difference to WT animals where they were tightly clustered. When analyzing the types <b>of</b> synaptic <b>terminals</b> that were retracted in the beta 2 m-/- mice, we found a preferential loss <b>of</b> inhibitory <b>terminals.</b> In parallel, axonal regeneration appeared to be hampered in the absence of functional MHC class I molecules. Since complement-deficient animals (C 1 q-/- and C 3 -/-) are shown to display a phenotype resembling that of MHC class I-deficient mice regarding synaptic plasticity in the visual system, we investigated the role for complement proteins in adult motoneuron plasticity in Paper III. In accordance with a previous study by Steven et al. 2007, C 3 -/- deficient animals displayed a diminished reduction in synapse density and covering of axotomized motoneurons. The histological expression pattern of C 1 q and C 3 in the spinal cord was somewhat hard to interpret. We found a clear up-regulation of complement mRNA and protein in the axotomized sciatic motor pool, but we have so far failed to determine the subcellular localization with certainty. Nonetheless, we found complement IR in close association with the motoneuron surface and with presynaptic terminals on proximal dendrites and with surrounding glial cells. In addition, C 3 -/- animals recovered motor function more rapidly after a SNC. In conclusion, we have investigated and found evidence of new roles for classical immune molecules in motoneurons with regard to synaptic plasticity and regeneration. The subcellular expression and signaling pathways remain to be described before specific functions and sites of action for these molecules can be determined. Further studies of neuronal immune molecules will be important in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of cellular interaction between different types of neurons or glial cells...|$|R

40|$|Anandamide (AEA) is {{a member}} of an {{endogenous}} class of lipid mediators, known as endocannabinoids, which are involved in various biological processes. In particular, AEA regulates cell growth, differentiation, and death. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that AEA controls also epidermal differentiation, one of the best characterized mechanisms of cell specialization. Indeed, the epidermis is a keratinized multistratified epithelium that functions as a barrier to protect the organism from dehydration, mechanical trauma, and microbial insults. Its function is established during embryogenesis and is maintained during the whole life span of the organism, through a complex and tightly controlled program, termed epidermal terminal differentiation (or cornification). Whereas the morphological changes that occur during cornification have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process remain poorly understood. In this chapter, we summarize current knowledge about the molecular regulation <b>of</b> <b>proliferation</b> and <b>terminal</b> differentiation in mammalian epidermis. In this context, we show that endocannabinoids are finely regulated by, and can interfere with, the differentiation program. In addition, we review the role of AEA in the control of cornification, and show that it occurs by maintaining a transcriptional repression of gene expression through increased DNA methylation.

40|$|NoThe {{epidermal}} differentiation {{program is}} regulated at several levels including signaling pathways, lineage-specific transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators that establish well-coordinated process <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation resulting in {{formation of the}} epidermal barrier. The epigenetic regulatory machinery operates at several levels including modulation of covalent DNA/histone modifications, {{as well as through}} higher-order chromatin remodeling to establish long-range topological interactions between the genes and their enhancer elements. Epigenetic regulators exhibit both activating and repressive effects on chromatin in keratinocytes (KCs) : whereas some <b>of</b> them promote <b>terminal</b> differentiation, the others stimulate <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> progenitor cells, as well as inhibit premature activation <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation-associated genes. Transcription factor-regulated and epigenetic mechanisms are highly connected, and the p 63 transcription factor has {{an important role in the}} higher-order chromatin remodeling of the KC-specific gene loci via direct control of the genome organizer Satb 1 and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Brg 1. However, additional efforts are required to fully understand the complexity of interactions between distinct transcription factors and epigenetic regulators in the control of KC differentiation. Further understanding of these interactions and their alterations in different pathological skin conditions will help to progress toward the development of novel approaches for the treatment of skin disorders by targeting epigenetic regulators and modulating chromatin organization in KCs...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the diastrophic {{dysplasia}} sulfate transporter (DTDST or SLC 26 A 2) cause {{a family}} of recessively inherited chondrodysplasias including, in order of decreasing severity, achondrogenesis 1 B, atelosteogenesis 2, diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) and recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. The gene encodes a widely distributed sulfate/chloride antiporter of the cell membrane whose function is crucial for the uptake of inorganic sulfate, which is needed for proteoglycan sulfation. To provide new insights in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to skeletal and connective tissue dysplasia and to obtain an in vivo model for therapeutic approaches to DTD, we generated a Dtdst knock-in mouse with a partial loss of function of the sulfate transporter. In addition, the intronic neomycine cassette in the mutant allele contributed to the hypomorphic phenotype by inducing abnormal splicing. Homozygous mutant mice were characterized by growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia and joint contractures, thereby recapitulating essential aspects of the DTD phenotype in man. The skeletal phenotype included reduced toluidine blue staining of cartilage, chondrocytes of irregular size, delay {{in the formation of}} the secondary ossification center and osteoporosis of long bones. Impaired sulfate uptake was demonstrated in chondrocytes, osteoblasts and fibroblasts. In spite of the generalized nature of the sulfate uptake defect, significant proteoglycan undersulfation was detected only in cartilage. Chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis studies suggested that reduced <b>proliferation</b> and/or lack <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> chondrocyte differentiation might contribute to reduced bone growth. The similarity with human DTD makes this mouse strain a useful model to explore pathogenetic and therapeutic aspects of DTDST-related disorder...|$|R
