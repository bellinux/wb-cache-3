Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his <b>parental</b> <b>rights.</b> Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their <b>parental</b> <b>rights</b> without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child.

The conclusions is that following three characters were given to the disciplinary right of parents: means for education, punishment and recovering lost honor, at the stage of the Meiji Civil Law enforcement,. Corporal punishment was approved so positively that "beating" was positioned within the range of discipline, and chastisement right was put at t he core of the disciplinary right of parents. And disciplinary action "as long as necessary" was determined as the reason for rejection of illegality in Supreme Court judgment above...|$|R

Patric and Schreiber separated in May 2012. Schreiber's attorneys argued that, under California law, Patric was a sperm donor as Schreiber and Patric had not married and the conception of the child was by artificial means, and therefore Patric has no custody rights to the son. Patric is currently pursuing changes to the law that bars his <b>parental</b> <b>rights.</b> He then sued for <b>parental</b> <b>rights</b> over the child, but lost the case at the trial court level. The Court of Appeal of California, however, also ruled that the CA Family Code did not preclude him from establishing that he was presumed a parent based on his post birth conduct.

40|$|The article {{proposes a}} new {{understanding}} of the right to visitation that challenges the common understanding of the right to visitation as a <b>parental</b> <b>right</b> and as an integral component of the cluster of <b>rights</b> associated with <b>parental</b> status.

Understanding visitation as a <b>parental</b> <b>right</b> marginalizes relational values and thwarts the development of a coherent theory of visitation. The absence of such a theory could account for the perplexity plaguing visitation issues. Detaching visitation from the cluster of <b>rights</b> associated with <b>parental</b> status and constructing it as an independent relational right enables us to develop a theory of visitation that places questions pertaining to visitation with children within an adequate conceptual framework.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a rigorous {{analysis of the}} legitimacy of continuing to rely on and promote school-based family life education, {{as a way of}} addressing concerns associated with sexual activity by adolescents. The issue is crucial because empirical evidence strongly suggests that a school-based approach, regardless of curricular content, has failed. For reasons grounded in law and policy, this article advocates that states should retreat from school-based family life education and, instead, recover the insights of the philosophical principle of subsidiarity. Recovering subsidiarity means fully respecting and giving effect to the <b>parental</b> <b>right</b> and duty to educate children in matters relating to morality, family life, and sexuality. Leaving this crucial task primarily to the family ensures not only efficient allocation of responsibility within society, but also a superior environment for effective and comprehensive family life education. This article also explores the key impetus behind the movement to get family life or sex education into schools, a movement grounded in a variety of ideologies. Because these ideologies are far removed from any genuine concern for {{the health and well-being of}} adolescents, the state interests often asserted as reasons for a school-based approach are insufficient to warrant continued infringement of the <b>parental</b> <b>right</b> and duty relating to the education and formation of children. Recovering subsidiarity will foster a parent-centered approach that is more likely to genuinely safeguard the well-being and reproductive health of the vast majority of adolescents...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} impact of the new Children’s Act 38 of 2005 on the {{acquisition}} of <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> within a newly proposed framework designed for the purpose of reflecting the various ways in which <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> can be acquired. The research has shown that the Children’s Act has fundamentally transformed the way in which <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> are acquired. The transformation has created a scheme for the acquisition of <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> that is for the most part constitutionally compliant and progressive insofar as it gives recognition to the different family forms found in South Africa. To this end the Children’s Act has considerably expanded the ways in which <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> can be acquired. Whereas previously exclusively the preserve of heterosexual married parents in a nuclear family, <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> can now automatically be acquired by a committed biological father and a married lesbian couple conceiving by artificial means. Apart from authorising courts to assign <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights,</b> the Children’s Act allows any holder of <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> to confer responsibilities and rights on another by prior approved agreement. The Act also includes specific provisions to regulate the acquisition of <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> by commissioning parents {{in the case of a}} surrogate motherhood agreement. The structure developed for the research topic reflects the transformation of the law in this regard by making the application of the best interests-standard, rather than the marital status of the child’s parents, the distinguishing feature of the subdivision between automatic and assigned acquisition. In this way the structure is an embodiment of the paramountcy of the best interests principle in section 28 (2) of the Constitution. Insofar as the law still requires a distinction to be made between biological mothers and fathers, on the one hand, and naturally and artificially conceived children, on the other, the structure also highlights the remaining shortcomings of the law in this regard. The structure is, furthermore, necessarily complicated by the need to distinguish between the acquisition of care, on the one hand, and guardianship, on the other. As far as fathers are still not treated the same as mothers in the automatic allocation of <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights,</b> the Act is deemed not to have been progressive enough. Conferring full <b>parental</b> responsibilities and <b>rights</b> on both parents based on their biological link to the child would not only be in line with worldwide trends, but would also meet the constitutional demands of substantive sex and gender equality. It will further place the focus on the best interests of the child, which emphasises the importance of both parents for the child. While the research shows that tensions between the biological and social constructs of parenthood may possibly hamper the legal recognition of de facto care-givers or other persons with whom the child has developed a psychological bond, the greatest weakness of the Act would seem to lie in the failure to implement an integrated family court structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The best-interests {{standard}} {{is a widely}} used ethical, legal, and social basis for policy and decision-making involving children and other incompetent persons. It is under attack, however, as self-defeating, individualistic, unknow-able, vague, dangerous, and open to abuse. The author defends this standard by identifying its employment, first, as a threshold for intervention and judgment (as in {{child abuse and neglect}} rulings), second, as an ideal to establish policies or prima facie duties, and, third, as a standard of reasonableness. Criticisms of the best-interests standard are reconsidered after clarifying these different meanings.
