50|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} {{is usually}} harmless: this condition {{is often seen}} in infants around the second day after birth, lasting until day 8 in normal births, or to around day 14 in premature births. Typical causes for neonatal jaundice include normal <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice,</b> jaundice due to formula supplementation, and hemolytic disorders that include hereditary spherocytosis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency, ABO/Rh blood type autoantibodies, or infantile pyknocytosis. Serum bilirubin normally drops to a low level without any intervention required. In cases where bilirubin rises higher, a brain-damaging condition known as kernicterus can occur, leading to significant disability. This condition has been rising in recent years due to less time spent outdoors. A Bili light is often the tool used for early treatment, which often consists of exposing the baby to intensive phototherapy. Sunbathing is effective treatment, and {{has the advantage of}} ultra-violet-B, which promotes Vitamin D production. Bilirubin count is lowered through bowel movements and urination, so frequent and effective feedings are especially important.|$|E

40|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{a common}} condition present in infants after birth. It is caused by elevated bilirubin in the blood. It can affect up to 84 % of term infants {{and is one of}} the most common cause for hospital readmission for the neonatal department (Muchowski, 2014). It typically appears within 24 hours of life and is normally present in otherwise healthy newborns. <b>Physiologic</b> <b>jaundice,</b> also known as unconjugated bilirubin, is a normal process that happens in neonates because the hepatic system is not matured yet (Kirk, 2008). Majority of the time <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> resolves on its own. Pathological jaundice, also known as conjugated bilirubin, in newborns is due to other reasons other than the normal pathologic process the newborn hepatic system goes through. It may be a result of endocrine or genetic disorders, which are considered to be rare (Kirk, 2008). A more common cause is due to ABO incompatibility. For the purpose of this poster the focus is going to be on pathologic elevated bilirubin specifically related to ABO incompatibility between mother and baby...|$|E
40|$|Background: Clofibrate is an {{effective}} anti lipid agent that induces glucuronyltransferase could increase bilirubin conjugation. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate effect of clofibrate on neonatal <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Methods: Randomized clinical trial sampling method used and 60 healthy term neonates which were admitted in Imam Reza Hospital of Kermanshah-Iran because of indirect hyperbilirubinemia enrolled into the study. 30 neonates (case group) were treated with single oral dose of clofibrate (100 /mg) plus phototherapy and 30 neonates (control group) received only phototherapy. Serum total and direct bilirubin levels were measured at admission, 12 hours later, and then every 24 hours until 96 hours. Results: There were no significant difference between two groups regarding to gender, age, weight and total serum bilirubin level at the admission. Mean values for total bilirubin of serum in case group 12, 24 and 48 hours after admission were significantly lower than control group (P< 0. 001). The mean of needed time for phototherapy in case group was significantly less than the control group (P< 0. 00 l). Conclusion: It seems that clofibrate plus phototherapy is effective for treatment of neonatal <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> in healthy term newborns, although further studies are necessary for evaluation of clofibrate safety as a routine treatments...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of LDH in the serum of normal newborn infants {{tends to be}} greater than in that of normal older children and adults. The {{concentration of}} LDH in the serum of infants suffering from erythroblastosis fetalis is very variable and may be increased much above that of normal infants. A considerable number of babies with erythroblastosis fetalis have higher concentrations of LDH and lower concentra-tions of indirect-reacting bilirubin in their serum than do babies with <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> (hyperbilirubinemia). However, among the infants studied, there is no con-sistent correlation between the concentration of serum LDH and that of indirect-reacting bilirubin. In infants being treated by exchange transfusion, {{the rise and fall}} of serum LDH and bilirubin tend to parallel each other. T PRESENT, one of the most interesting subjects in pediatrics is the investigation and treatment of various forms of jaundice in newborn infants. The study reported here was concerned with the concentra-tions of lactic dehydrogenase (L 1) H) and indirect-reacting bilirubin in the serum of newborn infants suffering from one of the following diseases: erythroblastosis fetalis or hemolytic disease in which the mother has anti-Rh antibody in her serum and the infant is Rh posi-tive; ABO incompatibility or hemolytic disease due to blood group A or B incompatibility; and <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> or hyperbilirubinemia, due in part, at least, to a transient deficiency of bilirubin transferase in the liver. Subjects and Methods The infants studied were patients at the Medical Center of the ITni versity of Rochester. For this investigation, the colorimetric metho...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} study was undertaken {{to determine if}} Inuit and Caucasian neonates have different patterns of <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Daily blood samples obtained by heel pricks of Inuit and Caucasian neonates born at the Churchill (Man.)

The mean peak bilirubin level in the Inuit group {{was significantly higher than}} that in the Caucasian group (8. 76 v. 6. 04 mg/dl [150 v. 103 mumol/l]) and occurred later (on day 3 rather than day 2). Of the Caucasian neonates, those who were breast-fed in hospital had a significantly higher (P less than 0. 05) mean peak bilirubin level than those who were not, and among all the neonates who were not breast-fed in hospital the Inuit had a significantly higher mean peak bilirubin level than the Caucasians (7. 98 v. 3. 64 mg/dl [136 v. 62 mumol/l]). These findings indicate that factors other than breastfeeding, some of which may be genetic, are responsible for the higher and later peak in the serum bilirubin concentration in Inuit neonates...|$|E
40|$|Cholestatic {{jaundice}} {{in early}} infancy {{is a complex}} diagnostic problem. Misdiagnosis of cholestasis as <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> delays the identification of severe liver diseases. In the majority of infants it may represent benign cases of breast milk jaundice, but few among them are masked and caused by neonatal cholestasis that requires a prompt diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, a prolonged neonatal jaundice longer than two weeks after birth must always be scrutinized because an early diagnosis is essential for appropriate management. To rapidly identify the cholestatic cases, the conjugated bilirubin needs to be determined in any infant presenting with prolonged jaundice at 14 days of age with or without depigmented stool. Once neonatal cholestasis is confirmed, a systematic approach {{is the key to}} reliably achieve the diagnosis in order to promptly initiate the specific, and in many cases, life saving therapy. This strategy is most important to promptly identify and treat infants with biliary atresia, {{the most common cause of}} neonatal cholestasis that requires a hepatoportoenterostomy as soon as possible. Here, we provide a detailed work-up approach including initial treatment recommendations and a clinically oriented overview of possible differential diagnoses in order to facilitate an early recognition and a timely diagnosis. This warrants a broad spectrum of diagnostic procedures and investigations including new methods that are described in this review...|$|E
40|$|Context: The goal of {{phototherapy}} is {{to lower}} the concentration of circulating bilirubin or keep it from increasing {{in the treatment of}} neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. As phototherapy decrease billirubin level of infants, it is important to fix the dose of phototherapy. Objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the effectiveness of double phototherapy versus conventional single phototherapy in the treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Materials and Methods: For this purpose 50 term and preterm newborns were enrolled. They were divided into 2 groups, 38 newborns were taken in group 1 and 12 newborn were taken in group 2. The babies who got conventional single phototherapy were taken in group 1. Each group was again divided into 3 subgroups according to their birth weight Normal Birth Weight (NBW), = Low Birth Weight (LBW) and Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW). Results: The serum bilirubin level of term babies were found 17. 32 ± 4. 08 mg/dl and in preterm babies were found 13. 17 ± 1. 49 mg/dl. Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in enrolled babies were due to <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> (38 %), neonatal sepsis (50 %) and perinatal asphyxia (12 %). The serum bilirubin level in physiological jaundice was found 18. 47 ± 5. 38 mg/dl, in neonatal sepsis was found 14. 90 ± 1. 85 mg/dl and in perenatal asphyxia was found 14. 10 ± 1. 47 mg / dl.

40|$|David G Levitt, 1  Michael D Levitt 2 1 Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2 Research Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, USAAbstract: Serum {{bilirubin}} {{measurements are}} commonly {{obtained for the}} evaluation of ill patients and to screen for liver disease in routine physical exams. An enormous research effort has identified the multiple mechanisms involved in the production and metabolism of conjugated (CB) and unconjugated bilirubin (UB). While the qualitative effects of these mechanisms are well understood, their expected quantitative influence on serum bilirubin homeostasis has received less attention. In this review, each of the steps involved in bilirubin production, metabolism, hepatic cell uptake, and excretion is quantitatively examined. We then attempt to predict the expected effect of normal and defective function on serum UB and CB levels in health and disease states including hemolysis, extra- and intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatocellular diseases (eg, cirrhosis, hepatitis), and various congenital defects in bilirubin conjugation and secretion (eg, Gilbert&# 39;s, Dubin–Johnson, Crigler–Najjar, Rotor syndromes). Novel aspects of this review include: 1) quantitative estimates of the free and total UB and CB in the plasma, hepatocyte, and bile; 2) detailed discussion of the important implications of the recently recognized role of the hepatic OATP transporters in the maintenance of CB homeostasis; 3) discussion {{of the differences between the}} standard diazo assay versus chromatographic measurement of CB and UB; 4) pharmacokinetic implications of the extremely high-affinity albumin binding of UB; 5) role of the enterohepatic circulation in <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> of newborn and fasting hyperbilirubinemia; and 6) insights concerning the clinical interpretation of bilirubin measurements.

40|$|Introduction: Neonatal {{cholestasis}} is a {{rare and}} always pathological condition that must be distinguished from <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice</b> of the newborn. It {{is characterized by a}} conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with accumulation of biliary products due to multiple causes, some of which need prompt treatment. The objectives of this study are to characterize a population of neonates with neonatal cholestasis in a level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and to identify predictors of mortality. Materials and methods: All patients presenting cholestasis and admitted to “Centro Hospitalar São João” NICU from January 1996 to December 2014 were included. Results: A total of 83 newborns were included with a prevalence of prematurity of 78. 3 % and of major malformations of 30. 1 %. Sixty-seven newborns developed sepsis and 71 needed total parenteral nutrition for a median length of 32 days. A multifactorial etiology for cholestasis was found in 57. 8 %; extra- and intrahepatic diseases accounted for 19. 3 % and 22. 9 % of the cases, respectively. Maximum values for total bilirubin (TB) and direct bilirubin (DB) were significantly higher in newborns who died (TB: median 22. 9 versus 13. 5 mg/dl, p = 0. 005; DB: median 15. 0 versus 6. 4 mg/dl, p = 0. 009). The same was observed for minimum values of albumin and total proteins. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was more often used in patients that survived than in those that died (50. 9 % versus 19. 2 %) and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0. 007). Conclusions: Cholestasis in our NICU has a multifactorial etiology and a prevalence of 1 %. TB and total proteins can be used as predictors of mortality in newborns with cholestasis. Higher levels of DB and lower levels of albumin were also associated with worse prognosis with a statistically significant difference between the groups. UDCA is a possible agent in this context and clinicians should be reminded of its utility. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background & aim: Jaundice {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} problems to consider in the neonatal period. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of oral zinc sulfate on uncomplicated neonatal jaundice using comparison of effect of just phototherapy with the effect of combination of phototherapy and oral zinc sulfate.   Methods: The present double blind randomized clinical trial was carried out on 78 normal term neonates with the age of 2 - 7 days who were admitted for uncomplicated jaundice in neonatal ward of Imam Sajjad Hospital of Yasuj University of Medical Sciences. These infants were divided to experimental group (40 cases) and control group (38 cases) using block random allocation. In the control group, phototherapy was done alone and experimental group received elemental zinc orally as 10 mg daily for 5 days in combination with phototherapy.   The total bilirubin serum levels were measured at the beginning of the study, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after the beginning of the study, discharge, and one week after discharge. The collected data were analyzed by the Chi Square test, independent t-test, and analysis of variance with repeated measurement.   Results: There were no significant statistical difference between the experimental group and control group in sex, age, birth weight, hemoglobin, reticulocyte percentage, G 6 PD deficiency, and of serum total bilirubin level at the beginning of study(p> 0. 05). Analysis of variance with repeated measurement showed that there were no significant statistical difference between the total bilirubin serum level at 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours after beginning of the study, discharge, and one week after discharge (p> 0. 05). Also, the mean of hospitalization duration was not significantly different between the two groups (p> 0. 05).   Conclusion: Although oral zinc salts inhibit the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, however probably not effective in the treatment of neonatal <b>physiologic</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Due to lack of human studies on the effect of oral zinc salts, further studies are recommended...|$|E
