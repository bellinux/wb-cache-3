His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods.

By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> goods and services.

In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve.

The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point.
