40|$|Zooplankton {{communities}} were investigated in a turbid shallow lake with an aim to analyze (i) relationships between ecological {{conditions and the}} communities and (ii) trophic state inferred from abiotic and biotic indicators. According to results emerged littoral vegetated zone increased diversity (30 taxa) {{in comparison to the}} <b>pelagial</b> (17 taxa). Rotifers dominated in terms of diversity and abundance in littoral and <b>pelagial,</b> 15 and 27 taxa, 58 and 71 %, respectively. Thus, they were chosen for approximation of the system trophic level according to their feeding preferences exhibited as guild ratio. Mean guild ratios in littoral (– 0. 36) and <b>pelagial</b> (– 0. 31) suggested the prevalence of microfagous rotifers. They fed mostly on bacteria and detritus suspension, thus together with environmental parameters indicated high trophic level of the lake.

40|$|The {{research}} of zooplankton diversity, abundance and trophic structure was {{conducted during the}} summer period in <b>pelagial</b> zone on the longitudinal profile of the Sutla River Backwater. Investigated site consists of two interconnected basins: transparent Upper Basin with submerged macrophytes and turbid Lower Basin without macrophytes in the littoral zone. In the Upper Basin, abundance and diversity of zooplankton in the <b>pelagial</b> was higher {{in comparison to the}} Lower Basin, with prevailing species of genus Keratella as microfilter-feeder, and genera of Polyartha and Trihocerca as macrofilter-feeder rotifers. On the contrary, in the Lower Basin, crustaceans dominated in abundance. Microfilter-feeder cladoceran (Bosmina longirostris) and larval and adult stages of macrofilter-feeder copepod (Macrocyclops albidus) prevailed in the Lower Basin. Fish predation pressure was more pronounced in the <b>pelagial</b> of the Upper Basin, indicated by low cladoceran abundance in the surface layer. Although the studied basins were interconnected, results indicate significant (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0. 05) differences in the zooplankton structure as a potential result of the macrophyte impact on environmental conditions and fish predation pressure...|$|E

The diurnal cycles and vertical distribution of algae were also investigated. Fixation was correlated with the presence of heterocystous blue-green algae, especially Aphanixomenon, in the phytoplankton, and was light dependent, though appreciable dark fixation also occurred, owing to endogenous utilization of photosynthetic products formed during previous light periods. The annual contribution of nitrogen fixation in the <b>pelagial</b> was of the order 0. 5 g N/m’. The highest values were obtained before mass development of Aphanixomenon and maximal primary production. The algae showed highest nitrogenase activity in the first period of algal development.

40|$|Lakes {{and ponds}} harbour {{a high number}} of diverse planktonic {{microorganisms}} that are centrally involved in biochemical cycles and aquatic food webs. Although the open water body (<b>pelagial)</b> seems to be a uniform and unstructured environment, ecological niche separation of coexisting microbial taxa might be triggered by limiting resources (bottom-up control) and mortality factors (top-down control), leading to distinct spatial and temporal distribution patterns of different microbes. This review gives an overview of the most abundant prokaryotic populations by grouping them in specific ecological guilds based on their life strategies. Defense specialists such as very small Actinobacteria or big filamentous bacteria mostly occur at times of highest grazing pressure by heterotrophic nanoflagellates, the main consumers of bacteria. Oligotrophic ultramicrobacteria, on the other hand, seem to be mostly adapted to nutrient depleted water layers during summer stratification, while opportunistic bacteria profit from material released during short-living algal blooms. Seasonal changes in abiotic and biotic factors may be the main causes for periodic reoccurring density maxima of different prokaryotes populations in the <b>pelagial</b> of temperate lakes, reflected in a distinct seasonality of the freshwater bacterioplankton. </p...|$|E

40|$|Distribution {{and ecology}} of pelagic copepods were studied in a boreal area {{strongly}} affected by acidification in southern Norway. Differential regional composition of bedrock geology and Quaternary deposits combined with liming have produced aquatic sites with contrasting acidification and recovery histories. The omnivorous species Eudiaptomus gracilis showed a striking ability to tolerate both acidification and chemical recovery. The predominantly carnivorous species Heterocope saliens increased numerically during acidification, both {{because it is}} tolerant to acidic environments and because fish predation diminished or disappeared altogether. After chemical recovery, H. saliens, having an endogenous egg-bank, most readily produced viable populations with numerical abundance depending upon fish predation pressure. Thermocyclops oithonoides and Cyclops scutifer were negatively affected by strongly acidic environments, whereas Mesocyclops leuckarti tolerated acidic conditions better. All three cyclopoid species increased in abundance after chemical recovery, most probably from small residual populations. The hypolimnetic C. scutifer faced dispersal problems in re-establishing following liming. Deep lakes (> 20 m) harboured considerable residual populations of C. scutifer which recovered rapidly to pre-acidic conditions. Cyclops abyssorum inhabited the <b>pelagial</b> during early recovery of formerly chronically acidified lakes as a fugitive species, probably due to rapid dispersal capacities. Littoral cyclopoids, such as Acanthocyclops vernalis and Diacyclops nanus, were commonly distributed in the free waters of the most acidic lakes (pH = 4. 5 - 4. 8), but disappeared from the <b>pelagial</b> shortly after chemical recovery. The total community of pelagic copepods forms a promising tool to identify historical acidification and trajectories of recovery in the freshwater environment...|$|E

The typical absorption at 440 nm in the <b>pelagial,</b> litoral and the Rhein mouth is 0. 29 ± 0. 05 m- 1.

Nine out of 13 isolates exhibit different DNA structures in the probed areas and, furthermore, they differ from morphologically similar strains collected from other lakes. The data set does not support a principal distinction between PC-rich and PE-rich strains but it reveals less heterogeneity in the coding region of the psbA genes among PE-rich isolates than among PC-rich isolates.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interactions}} among microbiota in clearwater lakes. Field sampling and field experiments were performed to evaluate interactions among microbiota {{and the importance of}} benthic versus pelagic microbiota in terms of biomass and production. In addition, carbon cycling in an oligotrophic clearwater lake was calculated. Biomass and production of microbiota was clearly focused to the benthic habitat. During natural nutrient concentrations growth of heterotrophic bacteria (benthic and pelagic) was coupled to production of microphytobenthos in Lake Eckarfjärden, indicating interactions between autotrophic and heterotrophic microbiota in, as well as between, habitats. At increased nutrient concentrations, growth of heterotrophic bacteria was not correlated to microphytobenthos production. This was explained by less release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from microphytobenthos when they got access to more nutrients. Further investigations showed different scenarios in oligotrophic clearwater lakes following increased nutrient concentrations. The interactions between microbiota may be altered following increased nutrient concentrations and the microbial mat either positively or negatively affect the pelagic microbiota. The most striking result was that the expected shift towards dominance of pelagic primary production does not necessarily occur. Major flows of carbon were identified between different habitats in the oligotrophic clearwater Lake Eckarfjärden, and the net result was that the benthic habitat provided carbon to the <b>pelagial.</b> High DOC concentrations in the lake together with low pelagic production are factors that would indicate net heterotrophy. Accordingly, the <b>pelagial</b> of Lake Eckarfjärden was net heterotrophic but when the benthic and littoral habitats were included in the calculations, the lake turned out to be net autotrophic. In conclusion, the benthic microbiota contributed significantly to the total production in the investigated lakes and had {{a major role in the}} lake metabolism. Thus, this thesis emphasises the importance of benthic microbiota in shallow clearwater lakes...|$|E
