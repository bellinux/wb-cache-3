The British Family Planning Association (FPA) through its clinics was then the primary provider of family planning services in Britain and provided only contraceptives that were on its Approved List of Contraceptives (established in 1934).

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 293 IPOs in Hong Kong, we {{separately}} measure <b>pre-market</b> and aftermarket sentiments and examine their impact on IPO pricing in a two-stage framework.

We also show that aftermarket sentiment causes a further price run-up in the secondary market. Overall, our findings suggest that institutional investors play an important role of re-distributing shares in the secondary market and underwriters take into consideration of investor sentiment in pricing IPOs during <b>pre-market</b> and aftermarket periods.

The most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate [...] "substantial evidence" [...] of the drug's efficacy for a marketed indication, {{in addition to the}} existing requirement for <b>pre-marketing</b> demonstration of safety.

50|$|In the U.S., {{with about}} a third of all global 2011 {{pharmaceutical}} expenditures, the drug industry is regulated by the FDA, the largest national drug regulatory authority in the world. FDA authority is exercised through enforcement of regulations derived from legislation, as published in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); the principal drug safety regulations are found in 21 CFR Part 312 (IND regulations) and 21 CFR Part 314 (NDA regulations). While those regulatory efforts address <b>pre-marketing</b> concerns, pharmaceutical manufacturers and academic/non-profit organizations such as RADAR and Public Citizen do play a role in pharmacovigilance in the US. The post-legislative rule-making process of the U.S. federal government provides for significant input from both the legislative and executive branches, which also play specific, distinct roles in determining FDA policy.|$|E

50|$|When {{consumers}} {{approach their}} doctor with a health concern, or {{to request a}} change in medication for a condition they already have, often their first and most persuasive source of information was a pharmaceutical advertisement. This leads consumers to direct their doctors’ visits from the start by prompting a conversation about a certain drug or course of treatment. Doctors {{may be more likely}} to prescribe the medicine patients requested even when it may not be the most cost-effective, medically sound or safe course of treatment. Of those patients who sought medical treatment because of an advertisement, 44% report their doctor prescribed the medication that they requested. When new drugs are marketed directly to patients, the use of these drugs accelerates, even though trials and testing may not have yet had enough time to identify long-term side effects or rare reactions to the drug. Recently-released drugs usually are only tested in small <b>pre-marketing</b> clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - To examine {{discrepancies}} between co-morbidity of patients included in pre marketing clinical trials of cardiovascular drugs and patients from daily practice, representing the actual users after marketing, and {{to investigate the}} availability of data regarding co-morbidity in registration files. Methods - Data were collected from phase III trials of registration files of 16 drugs, registered in the Netherlands in the period 1985 through 1994 for the indications hypertension, angina pectoris or hypercholesterolemia, and from a general practitioners database. Patients were selected who used drugs from the same therapeutic classes for the same indication as the patients in the <b>pre-marketing</b> trials. Prevalences of concomitant cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic diseases were compared between pre- and postmarketing populations. Discrepancies were defined as more than 10 % difference in prevalences. Results - Data regarding co-morbidity were present in 13 out of 16 registration files and differed in formal of reporting. For all indications, coexisting cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic diseases were less prevalent in the <b>pre-marketing</b> populations, except ischemic heart disease, which was more prevalent coexisting with angina pectoris and hypercholesterolemia. Discrepancies were found for hypertensive disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction. Conclusions - Phase III trials testing cardiovascular drugs included patients with concomitant cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic diseases, but discrepancies were present with patients in daily practice. Development of guidelines for uniform collection and reporting of co-morbidity data in <b>pre-marketing</b> trials is recommended, as well as further utilization of data.
