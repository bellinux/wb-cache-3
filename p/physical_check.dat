40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of traditional type checking in C {{is limited by}} the presence of type conversions using type casts. Because the C standard allows arbitrary type conversions between pointer types, neither C compilers, nor tools such as lint, can guarantee type safety in the presence of such type conversions. In particular, by using casts involving pointers to structures (C structs), a programmer can interpret any memory region to be of any desired type, further compromising C's weak type system. Not only do type casts make program vulnerable to type errors, they hinder program comprehension and maintenance by creating latent dependencies between seemingly independent pieces of code. To address these problems, we have developed a stronger form of type checking for C programs, called <b>physical</b> type <b>checking.</b> <b>Physical</b> type <b>checking</b> takes into account the layout of C struct fields in memory. This paper describes an inference-based <b>physical</b> type <b>checking</b> algorithm and its implementation. Ou [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The check {{given to}} the victim is {{typically}} counterfeit but drawn on a real account with real funds in it. With correct banking information a check can be produced that looks genuine, passes all counterfeit tests, and may initially clear the paying account if the account information is accurate and the funds are available. However, whether it clears or not, it eventually becomes apparent either to the bank or the account holder that the check is a forgery. This can {{be as little as}} three days after the funds are available if the bank supposedly covering the check discovers the check information is invalid, or it could take months for an account-holder to notice a fraudulent debit. It has been suggested that in some cases a genuine check, from the payer's account, is issued with intent to defraud: the issuer gets a contact at the paying bank to falsely claim it is a fake weeks or months later when the <b>physical</b> <b>check</b> arrives back at the paying bank, so that the issuer regains the funds initially debited.|$|E
