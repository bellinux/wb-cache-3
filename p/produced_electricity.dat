25|$|Renewable energy {{accounted}} for more than 85.4% of the domestically <b>produced</b> <b>electricity</b> used in Brazil, according to preliminary data from the 2009 National Energy Balance, conducted by the Energy Research Corporation (EPE). After the oil shocks of the 1970s, Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy, mainly sugarcane ethanol. Its large sugarcane farms helped. In 1985, 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. The success of flexible-fuel vehicles, introduced in 2003, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) {{are also}} {{sometimes}} treated as carbon offsets, although the concepts are distinct. Whereas a carbon offset represents {{a reduction in}} greenhouse gas emissions, a REC represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources. To convert RECs into offsets, the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions, typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally <b>produced</b> <b>electricity</b> from the local grid. This is known as an indirect offset (because the reduction doesn't {{take place at the}} project site itself, but rather at an external site), and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to [...] "additional" [...] emission reductions and who should get credit for any reductions that may occur. Intel corporation is the largest purchaser of renewable power in the US.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of {{industrialisation}} and coalmining along the Neath valley, it no longer suited {{its role as a}} fashionable and picturesque residence. In the 20th century Rheola was the home of Col J. Edwards Vaughan at least until 1926. In 1939 the estate was bought by the British Aluminium Company, [...] who used the house as offices, and built an aluminium smelting plant on a large plot between the house and road. Aluminium smelting requires large amounts of electricity, and the original plan had been to use locally <b>produced</b> <b>electricity,</b> generated with local coal supplies. However World War II broke out before the generators were imported from Switzerland, so the smelting plant attempted to run using national grid electricity, and this was discontinued by 1943. The factory was then in use as a strip mill. The industrial activity had involved an area of hardstanding covering almost , which then was used for screening coal from the nearby coalmines. By 1981 it had ceased to be needed for coal screening, and the estate was sold to local construction and demolition company RM Rees. The industrial buildings were used for architectural salvage and a weekly market. The house was in serious decline, as were the grade II listed stables and coach house.|$|E
