40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to select a suitable test to measure feather <b>pecking</b> in laying hens. <b>Pecking</b> behaviour in individual and social feather <b>pecking</b> tests was compared with <b>pecking</b> behaviour in the homepen. Two lines of laying hens were used that differ in their propensity to display feather pecking: the high feather <b>pecking</b> (HFP) and low feather <b>pecking</b> (LFP) lines. Six groups of five birds per line were housed on wood shavings with ad libitum food and water. From 7 to 34 weeks of age, every 3 weeks <b>pecking</b> behaviour in the homepen was observed and three feather <b>pecking</b> tests were conducted as well: one individual test {{with a bunch of}} feathers (10 min) and two social tests (in random order), one with and one without a bunch of feathers (30 min with whole group). Observations focused on gentle and severe feather <b>pecking,</b> bunch <b>pecking,</b> ground <b>pecking</b> and preening. In the individual test, general activity and vocalisations were recorded as well, to measure the response to isolation. In general, HFP birds showed more gentle and severe feather <b>pecking</b> than LFP birds, whereas LFP birds showed more ground <b>pecking</b> and, unexpectedly, more bunch <b>pecking.</b> Birds that showed gentle feather <b>pecking</b> in the homepen also showed gentle feather <b>pecking</b> and bunch <b>pecking</b> in the social tests over all ages. Severe feather <b>pecking</b> in the social test with a bunch of feathers corresponded with severe feather <b>pecking</b> in the homepen. Bunch <b>pecking</b> in the individual test was not a reliable measure for feather <b>pecking</b> in {{this experiment}}. An increasing number of vocalisations in the HFP line and a decreasing number in the LFP line indicated a difference in reaction to the individual test.

40|$|Feather <b>pecking</b> is a {{major problem}} in laying hens. Frustration, i. e. the {{omission}} of expected reward, {{may play a role in}} the development of feather <b>pecking.</b> In two experiments, we studied if feather <b>pecking</b> could be facilitated by short-term frustration in birds with a high feather <b>pecking</b> phenotype and victims of feather <b>pecking</b> (experiment 1), and in birds with a high or low feather <b>pecking</b> genotype (experiment 2). Furthermore, the motivation to <b>peck</b> a key for a food reward was assessed in birds with a high or low feather <b>pecking</b> genotype in experiment 3, as birds that have a stronger motivation may also react stronger to the omission of a reward. We trained birds to <b>peck</b> a key for a food reward in an automated Skinnerbox and tested them in control and frustration sessions. During frustration, the feeder was covered with Perspex. Frustration did not facilitate feather <b>pecking</b> in either experiment. In experiment 1, birds with a high feather <b>pecking</b> phenotype did show more gentle feather <b>pecking</b> and aggressive <b>pecking</b> than victims of feather <b>pecking</b> during some of the control sessions. Furthermore, victims of feather <b>pecking</b> vocalised more than birds with a high feather <b>pecking</b> phenotype. In experiment 2, birds with a high feather <b>pecking</b> genotype scratched more than birds with a low feather <b>pecking</b> genotype, indicating differences in motivation for foraging or dust-bathing behaviour, which shows a relation to feather <b>pecking.</b> Birds with a low feather <b>pecking</b> genotype also had a stronger motivation to <b>peck</b> at a key for a food reward than birds with a high feather <b>pecking</b> genotype. No evidence was found that feather <b>pecking</b> could be facilitated by short-term frustration in a Skinnerbox. However, differences in reaction to frustration and in motivation to <b>peck</b> a key for a food reward in birds with a high or low feather <b>pecking</b> phenotype or genotype indicate that frustration may still play a role in the development of feather <b>pecking...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present new {{insights}} and promising directions for future research on feather <b>pecking</b> in laying hens. Our starting point was a multidisciplinary research program on feather <b>pecking</b> in The Netherlands, in which ethological, physiological, ontogenetic and genetic approaches were combined. The four topics addressed in this paper are: (1) the relation between gentle and severe feather <b>pecking,</b> (2) feather <b>pecking</b> and coping strategy, (3) causation of feather <b>pecking,</b> and (4) the possibility to solve the problem of feather <b>pecking</b> through genetic selection. When the relationship between gentle and severe feather <b>pecking</b> was studied, it was found that both forms of feather <b>pecking</b> are related at the same age. Gentle feather <b>pecking</b> at young age, however, could not be used as a predictor of feather <b>pecking</b> at adult age. Birds from high and low feather <b>pecking</b> lines that showed differences in feather <b>pecking</b> also differed in other behavioural and physiological characteristics. This may reflect line differences in coping strategy. Relating coping strategy with feather <b>pecking</b> may help us to better understand the motivations and characteristics underlying the development of feather <b>pecking.</b> On the causation of feather <b>pecking,</b> there is some evidence that it is redirected ground <b>pecking,</b> deriving either from a foraging or a dustbathing background. However, evidence was found that early feather <b>pecking</b> could also be interpreted as social exploration. Finally, the use of molecular genetics to help solving the problem of feather <b>pecking</b> seems promising. Feather <b>pecking</b> has been shown to be heritable and the first genetic regions (QTL) involved in feather <b>pecking</b> have been identified. To search for a solution for the feather <b>pecking</b> problem it is of importance to identify the mechanisms involved in the development of feather <b>pecking.</b> In this paper, we have combined approaches from different disciplines in order to study feather <b>pecking.</b> The results indicate that combined efforts of multidisciplinary research can be very useful in looking for possible ways to reduce feather <b>pecking</b> in practic...|$|R
40|$|Pigeons emitted almost {{exclusively}} short-duration key <b>pecks</b> (shorter than 20 msec) when on negative automaintenance procedures, in which <b>pecks</b> prevented reinforcement. <b>Peck</b> durations under fixed-interval and fixed-ratio reinforcement schedules were generally {{two to five}} times longer than <b>pecks</b> under a negative automaintenance schedule. However, initial key <b>pecks</b> were of short duration, independent of procedure. The frequency of short-duration <b>pecks</b> was insensitive to differential reinforcement, while the frequency of long-duration <b>pecks</b> was sensitive to differential reinforcement.

5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} 36–48 hours apart, and incubation, mainly by the female, {{starts with the}} first egg. The male may {{incubate}} for short periods, especially around dawn or dusk, but spends the day roosting, sometimes outside his territory or close to other males. If the female is disturbed while breeding, she runs or flutters along the ground feigning injury until she has drawn the intruder away. She may also move the eggs a short distance with her bill. Each egg hatches after about 17–21 days. The semi-precocial downy chicks are mobile when hatched, but are brooded to keep them warm. They fledge in 16–17 days and become independent of the adults around 32days after hatching. A second brood may be raised by early nesting pairs, {{in which case the}} female leaves the first brood a few days before they fledge; the male then cares for the first brood and assists with the second. Both adults feed the young with balls of insects which are either regurgitated into the chick's mouth or <b>pecked</b> by the chick from the adult's open bill.|$|E

25|$|The carvings {{and designs}} were most usually {{completed}} before the stone was erected, though some stones {{show signs of}} being carved in place.

40|$|In {{two lines}} of White Leghorns that differ in their {{propensity}} to feather <b>peck,</b> feather <b>pecking</b> was already present 1 day after hatching. A significant line difference developed within 3 days and this difference remained in the following weeks. There was no clear relationship between feather <b>pecking</b> and ground <b>pecking,</b> instead feather <b>pecking</b> was associated with other socially orientated <b>pecks.</b> When chicks were confronted with feathers as an inanimate stimulus <b>pecking</b> at these feathers did not reflect <b>pecking</b> in a social context. These results suggest that feather <b>pecking</b> has an underlying social component, rather than being a redirected behaviour. To test the influence of social factors on feather <b>pecking,</b> chicks from the high feather <b>pecking</b> line were subjected to regular rehousing or regular rehousing plus confrontation with unfamiliar peers. Gentle feather <b>pecking</b> increased significantly in groups that were rehoused with unfamiliar peers. Directly after confrontation chicks displayed a preference in {{the total number of}} <b>pecks</b> toward these unfamiliar birds. Gentle feather <b>pecking</b> as a separate <b>pecking</b> orientation showed a similar trend. Increased righting times in a tonic immobility test were recorded in the experimental groups, hence frequent confrontation with unfamiliar peers may be experienced by chicks as stressful, which is consistent with the hypothesis that stress mediates the expression of feather <b>pecking.</b> In contrast to the dominant hypotheses in the field, we argue that gentle feather <b>pecking</b> at an early age {{plays an important role in}} the building (social exploration) and maintenance of social relationships between chicks. ...|$|R

40|$|Feather <b>pecking</b> {{is a major}} {{welfare and}} {{economic}} problem in laying hens. It is characterised by <b>pecking</b> at- and pulling out of feathers of conspecifics. A bird's propensity to develop feather <b>pecking</b> may be related with other behavioural characteristics, such as reaction to frustration (the omission of expected reward) and social motivation. Furthermore, differences in feather <b>pecking</b> between lines indicate that genetic background plays an important role. In this thesis, the relationship between feather <b>pecking</b> and other behavioural characteristics was studied in two lines that differed in feather <b>pecking</b> behaviour: the high (HFP) and low (LFP) feather <b>pecking</b> lines. The importance of the social environment was evaluated in an experiment where different tests to measure feather <b>pecking</b> were compared. Furthermore, the reaction to frustration was studied in these lines and it was studied whether frustration can facilitate feather <b>pecking</b> directly. In a behaviour genetics study, it was studied whether behavioural traits measured at young age were predictive of feather <b>pecking</b> at adult age. It {{was found that the}} social environment {{plays an important role in}} the development of feather <b>pecking.</b> <b>Pecking</b> at a bunch of feathers in an individual context is not comparable with feather <b>pecking</b> in a social group. Although HFP and LFP lines showed differences in reaction to frustration, short-term frustration in a Skinnerbox could not facilitate feather <b>pecking.</b> Finally open-field behaviour at young age was found to be predictive of <b>pecking</b> behaviour at adult age. These results were used to develop a model on the relationship between feather <b>pecking</b> and other behavioural characteristics, that may be helpful to solve the problem of feather <b>pecking</b> in laying hens...|$|R

25|$|Often {{in social}} life, animals {{fight for the}} right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of {{fighting}} for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called pecking order among poultry. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate for a certain time length, they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being <b>pecked.</b> A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Higher level chickens are easily distinguished by their well-cured aspect, as opposed to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is broken only when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.|$|E
