5000|$|Zero <b>page</b> <b>addressing</b> now {{has mostly}} {{historical}} significance, since the developments in integrated circuit technology have made adding more registers to a CPU {{less expensive and}} CPU operations much faster than RAM accesses. Some computer architectures still reserve the beginning of address space for other purposes, though; for instance, Intel x86 systems reserve the first 512 words of address space for the interrupt table if they run in real mode. A similar technique of using the zero page for hardware related vectors was employed in the ARM architecture, leading in some badly written programs to the infamous [...] "ofla" [...] behaviour, which is when a program tries to read information from an unintended memory area, and winds up mistaking executable code for text or vice versa. This is especially a problem if the zero page area is used to store system jump vectors and the firmware is tricked into storing data there.|$|E

40|$|We present storage {{organization}} schemes and a tuple density {{model of a}} relation, for the efficient processing of information in a relational database. The underlying concept used {{in the design of}} the storage schemes and the density model is that of a multidimensional array. These organizational schemes are: Multidimensional Paging, Dynamic Multipaging, and two dynamic multidimensional hashing schemes, DMHL and DMHE. The DMHL and DMHE schemes are the respective extensions of linear hashing and extendible hashing for multidimensional data organization. Storage mapping functions for extendible arrays are developed as the <b>page</b> <b>addressing</b> functions in the dynamic multidimensional structures. Performance of the multipaging schemes are examined through empirical studies. We show how relations are structured with these organizational methods to provide symmetric access to the data on any combination of attributes. Further we derive size estimation formulae for the result of the various relational operations using the density model...|$|E
