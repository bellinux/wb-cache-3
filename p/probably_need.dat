Homer and Marge had to cope with Bart, who was two years old at the time. Marge reveals to her husband and their son that she is pregnant again, and points out to Homer that they will <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> a bigger place.

25|$|Turacin and turacoverdin, being copper-based pigments, require large {{quantities}} of copper {{in order to be}} manufactured. As turacos are primarily arboreal species, they are able to accumulate copper through a diet rich in fruits, flowers, buds, and other plant matter. Church and Moreau estimated that 3 months' worth of fruit intake contribute to producing the pigment present in the newly grown plumage of the turaco species T. corythaix (the Knysna turaco). It has also been observed that it takes young turacos around a year to acquire their colorful adult plumage, and some authors have speculated that they <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> that long to acquire the necessary copper. It has also been noted that turacos all live across Central Africa, which corresponds geographically with one of the world's richest copperbelts. It is unknown whether turaco diets are especially rich in copper as compared to the diets of other birds, or whether turacos are especially effective at extracting copper from their foods. It is also unknown whether turaco species lacking turacin and turacoverdin-induced pigmentation have a comparatively copper-deficient diet, absorb less copper from their diet, or lack the enzymes required to synthesize the pigments.|$|E

We'd sort of forgotten the single was even coming out, but the video makes it all seem quite exciting." [...] The Sun commented that [...] "has done the impossible – made the blue rinse sexy". Anna Pickard from The Guardian heavily compared Aguilera to Britney Spears in the video, saying: [...] "We're at a final count of four Christinas to five Britneys. [...] We can't be seen to have achieved a perfect Xtina/Britney balance. [...] We'd <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> a guest appearance from Madonna for that".

2500|$|Aboriginal woman Karina Lester and Chief Executive Craig Wilkins of the Conservation Council of South Australia raised {{concerns}} that the submission process was unnecessarily complicated as written submissions were required to be signed by a Justice of the Peace. Lester and Wilkins argued {{that this would be}} particularly difficult for members of regional and remote communities. Lester also pointed out that the language of the Commission's presentations and issues papers made them difficult for aboriginal people to comprehend. Lester drew attention to her father, Yami Lester, who lost his sight after exposure to radioactive fallout from British nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and 1960s. She told the ABC: [...] "My father (lives) 27 kilometres west form Marla Bore, (he) doesn't drive, wouldn't have a JP on hand, and would <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> to travel down to Coober Pedy... but he certainly has a story to tell and certainly would love to have input into the Royal Commission."The Royal Commission responded by agreeing to accept oral submissions in addition to formal written submissions.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of people have said that we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well as we should have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E
