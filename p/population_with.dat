50|$|The ANOVA {{tests the}} null {{hypothesis}} that samples in all groups are drawn from <b>populations</b> <b>with</b> the same mean values. To do this, two estimates are made of the population variance. These estimates rely on various assumptions (see below). The ANOVA produces an F-statistic, {{the ratio of the}} variance calculated among the means to the variance within the samples. If the group means are drawn from <b>populations</b> <b>with</b> the same mean values, the variance between the group means should be lower than the variance of the samples, following the central limit theorem. A higher ratio therefore implies that the samples were drawn from <b>populations</b> <b>with</b> different mean values.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the process of}} allele {{frequency}} change in finite <b>populations</b> <b>with</b> overlapping generations {{with the purpose of}} evaluating the possibility of estimating the effective size from observations of temporal frequency shifts of selectively neutral alleles. Focusing on allele frequency changes between successive cohorts (individuals born in particular years), we show that such changes are not determined by the effective population size alone, as they are when generations are discrete. Rather, in <b>populations</b> <b>with</b> overlapping generations, the amount of temporal allele frequency change is dependent on the age-specific survival and birth rates. Taking this phenomenon into account, we present an estimator for effective size that can be applied to <b>populations</b> <b>with</b> overlapping generations...|$|R
