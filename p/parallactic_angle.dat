The simulation tool used {{as a starting point}} for this study is the software package CAOS 2. 0 (Code for Adaptive Optics Systems, version 2. 0), for its AO-simulation capabilities and its modular structure. It is used here in order to generate the turbulence-corrupted and subsequently adaptive-optics-corrected interferometric point-spread functions corresponding to the simultaneous observation of both a scientific object and a reference star, for three <b>parallactic</b> <b>angles</b> corresponding to three observation runs during the night. The obtained data are therefore used as the inputs of a multiple deconvolution method planned for imaging with the LBT interferometer.

40|$|The {{search for}} and {{characterization}} of exoplanets and other sub-stellar companions are hot topics in contemporary astronomy. Currently, {{the characterization of}} the atmospheres of exoplanets through direct imaging leverages on the analysis of only the intensity of their light {{as a function of}} wavelength and time. Additional information on the composition and structure of planetary atmospheres - that cannot be obtained with spectroscopy - can be deduced with polarimetry, i. e. measuring the direction of oscillation of the electric fields of light. Not only the starlight that an exoplanet reflects is expected to be polarized, but also the thermal emission of a planet, as this radiation from inside the atmosphere will be scattered by cloud and haze particles on its way up. Indeed, the polarized thermal radiation of several field brown dwarfs has already been measured and is attributed to the scattering of the radiation by patchy clouds in their atmospheres. The degree of linear polarization of hot exoplanets at near-infrared wavelengths is expected to generally be larger than 0. 1 % and could be up to several percent in some cases. Measurements of the polarized thermal emission of exoplanets can provide information on the presence and patchiness of atmospheric clouds and hazes, the cloud top pressure, spatial structure such as rotational flattening and cloud bands, the atmospheric rotation rate, and the surface gravity and mass of the companion. By determining the angle of linear polarization, the planet's projected spin axis could be constrained. The recently commissioned VLT instrument SPHERE is a high spatial resolution, high-contrast, direct imaging instrument that is specifically designed to detect and characterize giant exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. SPHERE's near-infrared instrument arm IRDIS has a dual-beam polarimetric mode that is primarily used for high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks, as it is expected to be too insensitive to directly measure the polarized thermal emission of exoplanets. However, IRDIS has already detected exoplanets with huge signal-to-noise ratio using angular differential imaging (ADI) of thermal fluxes. The aim of this thesis is therefore to investigate the feasibility of combining ADI and accurately calibrated polarimetry with SPHERE/IRDIS to for the first time detect and possibly characterize exoplanetary atmospheres through direct imaging polarimetry at near-infrared wavelengths. To assess whether IRDIS can detect the expected polarization signal of exoplanets, and using HR 8799 's planetary system as a study case, IRDIS' polarimetric sensitivity is estimated by extrapolating the results from VLT/NaCo observations to IRDIS, and by simulating single-beam polarimetric measurements with real IRDIS data. Based on these estimates, SPHERE/IRDIS is expected to reach sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity when combining extreme adaptive optics, coronagraphy, ADI with advanced data reduction techniques and dual-beam polarimetry. A model describing the modification of the polarization signal induced by the telescope and instrument is established and validated with available internal calibration measurements and observations of a standard star. It appears that for some filters and particular combinations of the <b>parallactic</b> and altitude <b>angle,</b> only a very small part (~ 10 %) of the incident linearly polarized signal is actually measured by the instrument. This loss of signal is accompanied by large offsets in the angle of linear polarization. It is also found that the instrumental polarization of the telescope and SPHERE's first mirror varies with telescope altitude angle and can reach values of a few percent. To limit the instrumental polarization and the loss of signal, an observation strategy is presented for IRDIS' polarimetric mode. In addition, a data reduction method is developed that uses the instrument model to derive an exoplanet's true degree and angle of linear polarization from the measured polarization signal. It is estimated that, after correcting for the modification of the polarization signal induced by the complete optical system, a polarimetric accuracy of ≤ 0. 1 % is reached. Given that an exoplanet will generally be between a few tenths of a percent and a percent polarized, it is concluded that, if SPHERE/IRDIS can indeed attain the predicted sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity when combining angular differential imaging and polarimetry, exoplanetary atmospheres can be characterized for the first time through direct imaging polarimetry.

40|$|Historically, long-slit spectroscopic {{observations}} {{were carried out}} using the <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> for the slit orientation if slit loss was an important consideration (either to maximize the signal-to-noise or to do spectrophotometry). This requires periodic realignment of the slit position angle as the <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> changes. This is not possible for multi-slit observations where one slit position angle must be chosen for the entire exposure. Common wisdom suggests using the <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> at the meridian (HA= 0). In this paper, I examine what the best strategy is for long, multi-slit exposures. I find that in extreme cases (very long exposure time) the best choice is to orient the slit perpendicular to the <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> at the meridian. There are two effects to consider: the increasing dispersion with increasing airmass and the changing angle between the <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> and the slit. In the case of traditional slit orientation, the two effects amplify each other, thus rendering a significant fraction of the observation useless. Using the perpendicular orientation, the two processes work against each other, thus most of the observation remains useful.

We have selected ∼ 2000 subgiants candidates from the RAVE survey using RAVEs stellar parameters [6, 8]. We have also selected 404 subgiants (no binaries) from the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS) [3] in the Mv −Teff plane. We performed follow-up observations with the Double Beam Spectrograph (DBS) instrument mounted at the ANU 2. 3 m telescope in Siding Spring Observatory. We use a long slit of 5 ′ ′ width and the 300 B grating, giving a spectral resolution of R = /∼ 400. The recorded spectra cover the wavelength range from 3200 Å to 6600 Å. Observations consist of a sequence of target exposure, standard stars, calibration lamps, flats and bias. During the observational campaign we used a wide slit of 5 ′′, which assures that 100 % of the star light is collected (depending on the seeing), while avoid tracking problems. We also placed the slit parallel to the direction of atmosphere dispersion, i. e, aligning the slit at the <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> to avoid recording incorrect intensities as...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, tests and preliminary {{results of a}} real-time parallel signal processor built to aid {{a wide variety of}} pulsar observations. The signal processor reduces the distortions caused by the effects of dispersion, Faraday rotation, Doppler acceleration and <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> variations, at a sustained datarate of 32 M samples/sec. It also folds the pulses coherently over the period and integrates adjacent samples in time and frequency to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting data are recorded for further off-line analysis of the characteristics of pulsars and the intervening medium. The signal processing for analysis of pulsar signals is quite complex, imposing the need for a high computational through put, typically of the order of a Giga operations per second (GOPS). Conventionally, the high computational demand restricts the flexibility to handle only a few types of pulsar observations. This instrument is designed to handle a wide variety of Pulsar observations with the Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT), and is flexible enough to be used in many other high-speed, signal processing applications. The technology used includes field-programmable-gate-array (FPGA) based data/code routing interfaces, PC-AT based control, diagnostics and data acquisition, digital signal processor (DSP) chip based parallel processing nodes and C language based control software and DSP-assembly programs for signal processing. The architecture and the software implementation of the parallel processor are fine-tuned to realize about 60 MOPS per DSP node and amultiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) capability...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with algorithms for calibration of direction dependent effects (DDE) in aperture synthesis radio telescopes (ASRT). After correction of Direction Independent Effects (DIE) using self-calibration, imaging performance can be limited by the imprecise knowledge of the forward gain of the elements in the array. In general, the forward gain pattern is directionally dependent and varies with time due {{to a number of}} reasons. Some factors, such as rotation of the primary beam with <b>Parallactic</b> <b>Angle</b> for Azimuth-Elevation mount antennas are known a priori. Some, such as antenna pointing errors and structural deformation/projection effects for aperture-array elements cannot be measured a priori. Thus, in addition to algorithms to correct for DD effects known a priori, algorithms to solve for DD gains are required for high dynamic range imaging. Here, we discuss a mathematical framework for antenna-based DDE calibration algorithms and show that this framework leads to computationally efficient optimal algorithms which scale well in a parallel computing environment. As an example of an antenna-based DD calibration algorithm, we demonstrate the Pointing SelfCal algorithm to solve for the antenna pointing errors. Our analysis show that the sensitivity of modern ASRT is sufficient to solve for antenna pointing errors and other DD effects. We also discuss the use of the Pointing SelfCal algorithm in real-time calibration systems and extensions for antenna Shape SelfCal algorithm for real-time tracking and corrections for pointing offsets and changes in antenna shape.

40|$|We present Submillimeter Array {{observations}} of high frequency SiO masers around the supergiant VX Sgr and the semi-regular variable star W Hya. The J= 5 - 4, v= 1 28 SiO and v= 0 29 SiO masers of VX Sgr are {{shown to be}} highly linearly polarized with a polarization from ~ 5 - 60 %. Assuming the continuum emission peaks at the stellar position, the masers are found within ~ 60 mas of the star, corresponding to ~ 100 AU {{at a distance of}} 1. 57 kpc. The linear polarization vectors are consistent with a large scale magnetic field, with position and inclination angles {{similar to that of the}} dipole magnetic field inferred in the H 2 O and OH maser regions at much larger distances from the star. We thus show for the first time that the magnetic field structure in a circumstellar envelope can remain stable from a few stellar radii out to ~ 1400 AU. This provides further evidence supporting the existence of large scale and dynamically important magnetic fields around evolved stars. Due to a lack of <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> coverage, the linear polarization of masers around W Hya could not be determined. For both stars we observed the 28 SiO and 29 SiO isotopologues and find that they have a markedly different distribution and that they appear to avoid each other. Additionally, emission from the SO 5 _ 5 - 4 _ 4 line was imaged for both sources. Around W Hya we find a clear offset between the red- and blue-shifted SO emission. This indicates that W Hya is likely host to a slow bipolar outflow or a rotating disk-like structure. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ.

40|$|We report linearly {{polarized}} continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at ∼ 492 GHz, {{based on the}} Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We used the observations of the likely unpolarized continuum emission of Titan, and the observations of Ci line emission, to gauge the degree of spurious polarization. The Stokes I flux of 3. 6 ± 0. 72 Jy during our run is consistent with extrapolations from the previous, lower frequency observations. We found that the continuum emission of Sgr A* at ∼ 492 GHz shows large amplitude differences between the XX and the YY correlations. The observed intensity ratio between the XX and YY correlations {{as a function of}} <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> may be explained by a constant polarization position angle of ∼ 158 ^∘± 3 ^∘. The fitted polarization percentage of Sgr A* during our observational period is 14 %± 1. 2 %. The calibrator quasar J 1744 - 3116 we observed at the same night can be fitted to Stokes I = 252 mJy, with 7. 9 %± 0. 9 % polarization in position angle P. A. = 4. 1 ^∘± 4. 2 ^∘. The observed polarization percentage and polarization position angle in the present work appear consistent with those expected from longer wavelength observations in the period of 1999 - 2005. In particular, the polarization position angle at 492 GHz, expected from the previously fitted 167 ^∘± 7 ^∘ intrinsic polarization position angle and (- 5. 6 ± 0. 7) × 10 ^ 5 rotation measure, is 155 ^+ 9 _- 8, which is consistent with our new measurement of polarization position angle within 1 σ. The polarization percentage and the polarization position angle may be varying over the period of our ALMA 12 m Array observations, which demands further investigation with future polarization observations.

40|$|International audiencePOLARBEAR is a {{ground-based}} experiment to measure polarization anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background. It {{is designed to}} have a combination of sensitivity, foreground mitigation, and rejection of systematic errors {{to search for the}} B-mode signature of Inflationary gravity waves over much of the parameter range suggested by simple power-law Inflation models. POLARBEAR is designed to detect a gravitational-wave signature with a tensor-to-scalar ratio r as low as 0. 025 (95 % confidence). POLARBEAR will also measure polarized lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background which will give valuable information on large-scale structure at z> 1 and bound the total mass of the neutrinos. POLARBEAR will have a 3. 5 meter primary meter giving it an angular resolution of 3. 0 ' at its main observation frequency band centered at 150 GHz. The 250 mK focal plane design contains 637 dual-polarization pixels (1274 bolometers) that are coupled to the telescope using microlithographed planar antennas. The experiment will be sited in the Atacama Desert in Chile at 5000 meter (16, 500 ft) altitude starting in 2009 after a prototype testing stage at Cedar Flats California. The first configuration of the experiment will observe at only one frequency band with the first season at 150 GHz and the second at 220 GHz. The optics will be upgraded to have simultaneous observations in those two bands in the third season of observations. POLARBEAR and QUIET will observe the same sky patches, and together they will have frequency bands at 30, 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz giving broad coverage of galactic foregrounds and a valuable cross-check by comparison of polarization maps. In POLARBEAR, polarization systematic errors are mitigated by a continuously rotating 50 K half-wave plate and an observation strategy that takes advantage of <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> rotation to rotate the experiment relative to polarization patterns on the sky...|$|E
40|$|Recent sub-millimetric {{observations}} at the Plateau de Bure interferometer evidenced {{a cavity}} at ~ 46 AU in radius into the proto-planetary disk around the T Tauri star LkCa 15 (V 1079 Tau), {{located in the}} Taurus molecular cloud. Additional Spitzer observations have corroborated this result possibly explained {{by the presence of}} a massive (>= 5 MJup) planetary mass, a brown dwarf or a low mass star companion at about 30 AU from the star. We used the most recent developments of high angular resolution and high contrast imaging to search directly for the existence of this putative companion, and to bring new constraints on its physical and orbital properties. The NACO adaptive optics instrument at VLT was used to observe LkCa 15 using a four quadrant phase mask coronagraph to access small angular separations at relatively high contrast. A reference star at the same <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b> was carefully observed to optimize the quasi-static speckles subtraction (limiting our sensitivity at less than 1. 0). Although we do not report any positive detection of a faint companion that would be responsible for the observed gap in LkCa 15 's disk (25 - 30 AU), our detection limits start constraining its probable mass, semi-major axis and eccentricity. Using evolutionary model predictions, Monte Carlo simulations exclude the presence of low eccentric companions with masses M >= 6 M Jup and orbiting at a >= 100 AU with significant level of confidence. For closer orbits, brown dwarf companions can be rejected with a detection probability of 90 % down to 80 AU (at 80 % down to 60 AU). Our detection limits do not access the star environment close enough to fully exclude the presence of a brown dwarf or a massive planet within the disk inner activity (i. e at less than 30 AU). Only, further and higher contrast observations should unveil the existence of this putative companion inside the LkCa 15 disk. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
