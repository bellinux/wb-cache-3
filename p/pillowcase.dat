40|$|Copper plays a {{key role}} in many of the {{physiological}} processes that occur in the skin. Previously it was found that sleeping on <b>pillowcases</b> impregnated with microscopic copper oxide particles results in reduction of wrinkles and fine lines. In the current study, it was examined if sleeping on copper oxide impregnated <b>pillowcases</b> results also in skin lifting and skin brightness. A four week, double blind, randomized study was performed, during which 45 women, aged 37 – 54, slept on copper oxide containing <b>pillowcases</b> (test group, n = 23) or on control <b>pillowcases</b> without copper oxide (control group, n = 22). Facial and eye skin surface was measured using an F-ray 3 D measurement system and surface analysis was conducted using Image-pro® plus. Skin brightness was measured using a tristimulus colorimeter. Sleeping on the test <b>pillowcases</b> resulted in statistically significant skin lifting on the cheek area (p = 0. 039) and eye area (p = 0. 001) after four weeks of use as compared to baseline. The mean skin brightness in those sleeping on the test <b>pillowcases</b> increased after two (p = 0. 024) and four weeks (p = 0. 008). No statistically significant changes occurred during the study in the study participants using the control <b>pillowcases.</b> Statistically significant differences between both groups were recorded at two and four weeks for skin brightness and skin lifting, respectively. In conclusion, sleeping on copper oxide containing <b>pillowcases</b> results in facial skin lifting and brightness of the skin...|$|R
