25|$|Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae {{family are}} also antigenically stable, {{meaning that the}} glycoproteins on the viruses are {{consistent}} between different strains of the same type. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another and so there is no antigenic shift. The second reason relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that <b>paramyxoviruses</b> should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses {{would not be able to}} survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years.In 1946, [...] Bovine virus diarrhea was discovered, which is still possibly the commonest pathogen of cattle throughout the world and in 1957, equine arterivirus was discovered.

In the 1960s more viruses were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg (b. 1925), and in 1965, Howard Temin (1934–1994) described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the key enzyme that retroviruses use to translate their RNA into DNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard [...] Temin and David Baltimore (b. 1938). This was important to the development of antiviral drugs – a key turning-point in the history of viral infections. In 1983 Luc Montagnier (b. 1932) and his team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E

5000|$|The genus Avulavirus is one {{of seven}} genera in the family Paramyxoviridae and {{contains}} viruses {{that used to be}} classified in the genus Rubulavirus.

Avulaviruses have a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase attachment protein and do not produce a non-structural protein C. The most important and best characterized avulavirus is Newcastle disease virus, a variant of avian <b>paramyxovirus</b> 1 (species Avian avulavirus 1). Avulaviruses can be separated into distinct serotypes using hemagglutination assay and neuraminidase assay.

40|$|The {{effects of}} monospecific {{antibodies}} to the viral glycoprotein with hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activity (HN) and the viral glycoprotein with membrane-fusing activity (F) of the <b>paramyxovirus</b> simian virus 5 (SV 5) on {{the spread of}} infection in two cell types have been investigated. In CV- 1 cells, infection can spread by either released progeny virus adsorbing to and infecting other cells, or by fusion of an infected cell with an adjacent cell {{as a result of}} the cell-fusing activity of the F glycoprotein. In these cells, antibodies specific for the HN glycoprotein prevented the dissemination of infection by released infectious virus, but spread by cell fusion was not inhibited. Antibodies to the F glycoprotein completely prevented the spread of infection in these cells. In Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, which are relatively resistant to SV 5 -induced fusion, antibodies to either the HN or F glycoproteins were capable of preventing the dissemination of infection. These results indicate that effective immunological prevention of the spread of <b>paramyxovirus</b> infection requires the presence of antibodies that inactivate the F glycoprotein. This requirement for anti-F antibodies has obvious implications for the design of effective <b>paramyxovirus</b> vaccines and provides an explanation for previous failures of formalin-inactivated <b>paramyxovirus</b> vaccines as well as additional insight into the possible immunopathological mechanisms involved in the atypical and severe infections that have occurred in individuals who received inactivated <b>paramyxovirus</b> vaccines and were subsequently infected by the virus...|$|R

40|$|Several {{members of}} the <b>paramyxovirus</b> family {{constitute}} major human pathogens that, collectively, are responsible for major mor-bidity and mortality worldwide. In an effort to develop novel therapeutics against measles virus (MV), a prominent member of the <b>paramyxovirus</b> family, the authors report a high-throughput screening protocol that uses a nonrecombinant primary MV strain as targets. Implementation of the assay has yielded 60 hit candidates from a 137, 500 -entry library. Counterscreening and gener-ation of dose-response curves narrows this pool to 35 compounds with active concentrations ≤ 15. 3 µM against the MV-Alaska strain and specificity indices ranging from 36 to> 500.

40|$|<b>Paramyxovirus</b> spread {{generally}} involves {{assembly of}} individual viral particles which then infect target cells. We show that infection of human bronchial airway cells with human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a recently identified <b>paramyxovirus</b> which causes significant respiratory disease, results in formation of intercellular extensions and extensive networks of branched cell-associated filaments. Formation of these structures {{is dependent on}} actin, but not microtubule, polymerization. Interestingly, using a co-culture assay we show that conditions which block regular infection by HMPV particles, including addition of neutralizing antibodies or removal of cell surface heparan sulfate, did not prevent viral spread from infected to new target cells. In contrast, inhibition of actin polymerization or alterations to Rho GTPase signaling pathways significantly decreased cell-to-cell spread. Furthermore, viral proteins and viral RNA were detected in intercellular extensions, suggesting direct transfer of viral genetic material to new target cells. While roles for <b>paramyxovirus</b> matrix and fusion proteins in membrane deformation have been previously demonstrated, we show that the HMPV phosphoprotein extensively co-localized with actin and induced formation of cellular extensions when transiently expressed, supporting a new model in which a <b>paramyxovirus</b> phosphoprotein is {{a key player in}} assembly and spread.

In this study, details of this structural similarity are worked out. Detailed multiple sequence alignment of <b>paramyxovirus</b> HN proteins and influenza virus N proteins was based on the schematic representation of the previously proposed structural similarity. This multiple sequence alignment of <b>paramyxovirus</b> HN proteins was used as an intermediate to align the morbillivirus hemagglutinin (H) proteins with neuraminidase. Hypothetical 3 D structures were built for <b>paramyxovirus</b> HN and morbillivirus H, based on homology modelling. The locations of insertions and deletions, glycosylation sites, active-site residues, and disulfide bridges agree with the proposed 3 D structure of HN and H of the Paramyxoviridae. Moreover, details of the modelled H protein predict previously undescribed enzymatic activity. This prediction was confirmed for rinderpest virus and peste des petits ruminants virus. The enzymatic activity was highly substrate specific, because sialic acid was released only from crude mucins isolated from bovine submaxillary glands. The enzymatic activity may indicate a general infection mechanism for respiratory viruses, and the active site may prove to be a new target for antiviral compounds...|$|R
