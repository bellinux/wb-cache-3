40|$|Abstract. The {{presence}} of an extensive Permian salt basin underlying the Central Graben in the UKCS Northern North Sea has strongly influenced patterns of tectonics and sedimentation in the area throughout the Mesozoic and Tertiary. The salt accumulated in the northern of two Zechstein basins lying north of the east-west trending Variscan mountain front. Salt withdrawal and dissolution during the Triassic and early/mid-Jurassic {{led to the formation}} of a series of roughly north-south oriented salt ridges and intervening depo-axes, the latter providing the accommodation space for the deposition of continental, mainly fluvio-lacustrine, sediments. The major late Jurassic rift event in the North Sea utilized the inherent Triassic tectono-sedimentary grain with the salt acting as an important detachment between the underlying rejuvenated <b>Permian</b> fault <b>system</b> and the incipient late Jurassic faults. Cretaceous thermal subsidence was locally enhanced by halokinesis in the region of the salt basin.

Both the present-day appearance of the TLE, in particular of the South Eifel region, {{as well as the}} development of the TLB were classically interpreted to be of practically identical origin and linked to the Eifel Depression (e.g., Lucius 1948; Murawski et al. 1983; Wagner et al. 2012). Already challenged by Weiler (1972), this interpretation has been questioned (Dittrich 1989; Schintgen and Förster 2013). Detailed studies by Dittrich (2014; and references therein) show that the eastern part/margin of the TLE has been intensively deformed and subsided during the Cenozoic. In the following, the Cenozoic structural evolution of the Müllerthal-Südeifel region is reinterpreted for geothermal exploration using new data by Schintgen and Förster (2013). The present-day appearance of the TLE is likely the result of consecutive and superimposed large-scale structures formed in different geodynamic contexts. First, the Mesozoic TLB is suggested to have formed along the weakness zone of a <b>Permian</b> graben <b>system</b> (Schintgen and Förster 2013).

40|$|AbstractThe Middle <b>Permian</b> <b>system</b> in the Sichuan Basin {{represents}} favorable {{conditions for}} the formation of natural gas reservoirs. However, only fracture-vuggy limestone gas reservoirs were discovered in early exploration, whose scales and results were limited. In 2014, a high-yield industrial gas flow was produced there in Well Shuangtan 1, the major risk-exploration well, which means a great breakthrough in natural gas exploration in the Middle <b>Permian</b> <b>system,</b> Sichuan Basin. This plays a strategically important and guiding role in oil and gas exploration in ultra-deep marine formations. This paper illustrates the deployment background of Well Shuangtan 1, major exploration achievements and its significance in the gas exploration in the Middle <b>Permian</b> <b>system,</b> Sichuan Basin. Moreover, exploration potential and subsequent exploration targets of Middle Permian are analyzed in terms of its hydrocarbon source conditions, sedimentary characteristics, reservoir characteristics and areal extension, resources and favorable exploration zones. It is concluded that the Middle <b>Permian</b> <b>system</b> in the Sichuan Basin is a continent-connected carbonate platform with carbonate deposits being dominant. There are three types of reservoirs, including pore dolomite, karst fracture-vuggy, and fracture, which present considerable natural gas resources and huge exploration potential. Favorable exploration zones classification of Middle Permian in the Sichuan Basin indicates that the most favorable exploration zones are mainly distributed in the central-western Sichuan Basin. In particular, the northwestern Sichuan Basin is the most favorable exploration area which is characterized by the most excellent hydrocarbon source conditions, developed dolomite reservoirs and zonal distribution of structures...|$|E

After increasing the productivity of the well by several stimulation treatments, a second well was drilled from 2006 - 2007 to install a well doublet. The design of the new well differs considerably from gas well designs since geothermal wells need to satisfy some requirements like large diameters for housing the submersible pump, directional drilling to allow a set of parallel hydraulic fractures and drilling under near-balanced mud pressure conditions to minimize formation damage. Recently, a massive stimulation campaign increased the productivity of the new well considerably.

40|$|People {{studying}} and collecting sedimentary rocks, minerals, and fossils in eastern Nebraska often find that locating rock exposures can be difficult. Most {{of the rolling}} hills in the eastern sixth of the state are underlain by thick, interlayered, glacial deposits, loess (windblown silt), and alluvium (stream-deposited sediments) of very young geologic age (fig. 1). These sediments cover the bedrock in most of that area. Natural exposures and human excavations of bedrock are mostly confined to the sides and floors of stream valleys. However, in the southeasternmost counties of the state, the younger sediment cover is commonly thin or absent. Pawnee and Richardson counties are particularly good places to look at bedrock exposures because natural outcrops and those made by humans are so common. Rocks of Late Paleozoic age, belonging to the Pennsylvanian and <b>Permian</b> <b>systems,</b> are exposed at the surface in Pawnee and Richardson counties (figs. 2, 3). These rocks include sandstone, siltstone, claystone, shale, limestone, and coal. They are usually in nearly horizontal layers, except {{where they have been}} deformed by folding or faulting along the Humboldt Fault Zone (fig. 2), which runs north to south in western Richardson County. Massive limestones form ledges, which are somewhat more resistant to erosion than the other rock types just mentioned and often cap the tops of hills in this area, just as they do farther to the south in Kansas. In fact, if the younger deposits were removed, much of the area in eastern Nebraska would resemble the surface features of Nemaha and Brown counties in eastern Kansas. Early {{in the study of the}} Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks of eastern Nebraska, geologists recognized that these strata included certain repetitions of sedimentary rocks. They also recognized that certain kinds of fossils were restricted to particular kinds of rock and that these fossils occurred in repetitive sequences when such rocks were present. The objectives of this educational circular are: 1) to describe the repetitive sequences of Pennsylvanian and Permian rock types seen in Pawnee and Richardson counties; 2) to describe the kinds of fossils found in each kind of rock; 3) to explain how the fossils and rocks can be used to interpret the causes of these deposits and the ancient environments about 300 million years ago; and 4) to provide a guide to Significant surface exposures. The rocks and fossils in the Pennsylvanian and Permian strata of Pawnee and Richardson counties can be examined at a number of localities. These places can be visited during a one- or two-day trip to the area. Most of these sites are on public land, but a few are on private land. You must get the landowner 2 ̆ 7 s permission before you visit a private locality. The route of the field trip is shown on figure 4. DRIVE CAREFULLY! Also keep in mind that the appearance of rock outcrops can change because of erosion, slumping, and removal of material for construction. Appendix I offers information on the rock units seen on this field trip. Appendix II is a road-log for the route you will travel. Appendix III is a glossary of terms used in this circular. We hope that you will find this educational circular and the field trip as interesting as we did when we put it together. The questions addressed in the circular are those asked by geologists. Part of the fun of your experience will be to check our observations and perhaps produce alternative answers and other questions that we have not asked. Enjoy your trip...|$|R

The eolian sequence is composed of more than 30 superimposed rg units separated by erg-order deflation (super bounding) surfaces. Each erg unit (6 to 72 m in thickness; mean = 22 m) is initiated by flat-bedded eolian sandstones (0. 5 to 7. 0 m in thickness; mean = 2. 9 m) of amalgamated interdraa or interdune origin and is topped by cross-bedded draa or dune sandstones (3 to 70 m in thickness; mean = 18 m).

40|$|Intensive {{carbonate}} {{and clay}} mineral authigenesis took place throughout the Late <b>Permian</b> Bowen-Gunnedah-Sydney basin <b>system</b> in eastern Australia. We conducted isotopic and trace element analyses of carbonate and clay minerals from clastic sedimentary rocks of the Gunnedah Basin and the Denison Trough in the Bowen Basin. Rb-Sr isochron age {{data of the}} illitic clays are consistent with episodic hydrothermal fluid flow events that occurred in association with Gondwana rifting accompanied by alkaline magmatism at similar to 85 Ma and similar to 95 Ma. Stable isotope data of carbonate and clay minerals from the Gunnedah Basin are indicative of meteoric waters from a high-latitude environment as the main fluid source, whereas trace element, Sr and Nd isotope data highlight mixing of meteoric fluids with magmatic and/or crustal components, with a possible input from marine carbonates for some samples. Trace metals, oxygen and strontium isotopes of dawsonites from the Denison Trough are interpreted to have been mobilised by fluids that interacted with evolved clastic sedimentary and marine carbonate end members. According to the carbon isotope data, CO 2 for calcite and ankerite precipitation was sourced mainly from thermal degradation of organic matter and magmatism, whereas the CO 2 used for dawsonite formation is inferred to have been derived from magmatic and marine sources. In the low permeability environments (particularly in coal seams), the increasing accumulation and oversaturation of CO 2 particularly promote the precipitation of dawsonite. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The most {{spectacular}} extinction event in Earth's history occurred across the Permian-Triassic boundary. In the northern Bowen Basin, a major coal-bearing sedimentary basin in eastern Australia, a long-lived (c. 9 Myr), cold climate, peat mire ecosystem collapsed at the Permian-Triassic boundary when {{the vast majority}} (c. 95 %) of peat-producing plants became extinct. The environmental change marked by the Permian-Triassic boundary is expressed as an abrupt and sharp change in sedimentary regime at the contact between the Rangal Coal Measures and the Sagittarius Sandstone. The stratigraphic record shows no diminution in the thickness, lateral extent or spatial distribution of coal seams prior to the boundary event. The abrupt ecological shift at the Permian-Triassic boundary was coincident with and interrelated {{to a change in}} landscape attributes and fluvial style. The boundary shift is considered to reflect a short-period radical atmospheric change accompanied by an abrupt change in plant ecosystems. However, palynological data indicate that it was preceded by a more gradual gross taxonomic progression in the floral succession. The boundary shift is unlikely to reflect change in the tectonic setting of the northern Bowen Basin because the detrital character of clastic sediment supply shows no provenance change within the boundary sequence. The Late Permian fluvial style is characterised by large-scale (up to 1 km wide), sandstone-dominated, low sinuosity, trunk river channel deposits. The trunk river channels were flanked by extensive levee/composite crevasse-splay systems. Channel tracts were relatively stationary in position over enduring periods, and developed stacked sediment accumulations up to 30 m thick. The constrained character of the Late <b>Permian</b> trunk river <b>systems</b> was most likely due to progressive compaction of thick tracts of peat substrate, and the stabilising effect of vegetation adjacent to the channel complex. The well-developed crevasse splays, coupled with the low sinuosity style of the fluvial channels, might suggest a perennial fluvial system, characterised by short discharge periods, as common in high-latitude settings. The fluvial architecture of the Sagittarius Sandstone, the basal formation of the Lower Triassic Rewan Group, is characterised by sheet-like elements, suggestive of broad, shallow channels in a deforested braid-plain setting. The channel deposits are considered to represent highly mobile sandy systems, dominated by a flashy runoff regime. The mass extinction of plants in the northern Bowen Basin at the Permian-Triassic boundary thus {{had a significant impact on}} the Early Triassic landscape and fluvial architecture...|$|R

In the Aladag Unit, the Permian-Triassic boundary beds are entirely composed of carbonates. The Permian portion of these beds belongs to the Paradagmarita Zone, whereas the lowermost Triassic contains the Lower Griesbachian marker Rectocornuspira kalhori. The uppermost Permian carbonates, composed of meter-scale upward shallowing subtidal cycles, are characterized by oolitic limestones of regressive character at the top and are overlain sharply by Lower Triassic stromatolites. Cyclic Upper Permian carbonates are interpreted as highstand sytems tract deposits of the last third-order sequence of the <b>Permian</b> <b>System.</b> The Permian-Triassic boundary is an unconformity corresponding to both erosional and non-depositional hiatuses. The gap at the Permian-Triassic boundary partially corresponds to the shelf-margin systems tract and partly to the transgressive systems tract of the overlying third-order sequence. Stromatolites are interpreted as transgressive systems tract deposits.   Special issue International Conference on Paleozoic Foraminifera, Paleoforams 2001 Edited by Demir Altiner (Guest Editor) </p...|$|E
40|$|Inspired by {{successful}} {{development of}} shale gas in USA and influenced by hydrocarbon resources shortage currently, China has strengthened shale gas research and accelerated its exploration process. In order to enrich coalbed methane (CBM) and shale gas geological theory and promote their development process, this paper compared shale gas with CBM in accumulation, distribution, reservoir and production. It expatiated on {{the background and}} significance of the combined research and development, and analyzed the geological foundation and future prospects. Our investigation demonstrated {{that there are many}} sets of coal-bearing strata in Shanxi formation of <b>Permian</b> <b>system</b> in Ordos in North China, Longtan formation of Upper Permian and Xujiahe formation of Upper Triassic in Southern Yangtze region, Xishanyao formation of Middle Jurassic in Turpan-Hami Basin and Junggar Basin in Northwest China, and Shahezi formation of Cretaceous in Songliao Basin in northeast China. In these regions, shales which are interbeded with coal seams have the characters of big thickness, continuous distribution, high content of organic matter, good parent material and high maturity, accord with the basic geological conditions to format shale gas and CBM reservoir and composite gas reservoir, thus form appropriate regions and layers to carry out joint research and exploration with good prospects for development...|$|E
