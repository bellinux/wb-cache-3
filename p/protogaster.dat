5|$|Limnoperdon incarnatum was {{originally}} {{thought to be}} associated with the Gasteromycetes, an artificial assemblage of species united by the fact that their spores mature inside the fruit bodies and are not forcibly discharged from the basidia. Other morphologically similar genera include the Gasterella of the family Gasterellaceae, and the <b>Protogaster</b> of the family Protogastraceae; however, it was excluded from these genera because of significant differences in spore color and structure, presence of clamp connections, and structure of the basidia. For these reasons the new family Limnoperdaceae was described to contain the new species, and it was classified along the Protogastraceae in the (now defunct) order Protogastrales. More recently, molecular phylogenetics has been used to clarify the relationship Limnoperdon with other fungi. In 2001, David Hibbett and Manfred Binder established the membership of Limnoperdon incarnatum in the euagarics clade, a phylogenetically related group of species traditionally forming the order Agaricales. Additional molecular studies have placed Limnoperdaceae in the pluteoid clade of the Agaricales, a grouping that includes the families Pluteaceae, Amanitaceae, and Pleurotaceae; other studies that used comparisons of ribosomal DNA sequences placed Limnoperdon near the gilled genera Melanoleuca or Resupinatus, of the Tricholomataceae family.|$|E
50|$|Protogastraceae is {{a family}} of fungi in the order Boletales that {{contains}} the single genus <b>Protogaster.</b> The genus in turn contains the single species <b>Protogaster</b> rhizophilus, found on the roots of Viola in the USA. The family was described by American mycologist Sanford Myron Zeller in 1934, the genus and species by Roland Thaxter.|$|E
