5|$|Another {{widespread}} trait among modern birds is <b>parental</b> <b>care</b> {{for young}} after hatching. Jack Horner's 1978 {{discovery of a}} Maiasaura ("good mother lizard") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that <b>parental</b> <b>care</b> continued long after birth among ornithopods, suggesting this behavior might also have been common to all dinosaurs. There is evidence that other non-theropod dinosaurs, like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods, also nested in large groups. A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm. <b>Parental</b> <b>care</b> being a trait common to all dinosaurs is supported by other finds. For example, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus) was found without teeth, indicating that some <b>parental</b> <b>care</b> was required to feed the young dinosaurs. Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching.|$|E

This study evaluated stress sensitization and inoculation models {{of the impact of}} early parental death on stress exposure and reactivity in late adolescence/young adulthood. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and diary reports of minor stress were collected every 30 min during waking hours over a 24 -hr period from 91 late adolescents/young adults (43 early bereaved, 48 nonbereaved). Across the sample, minor stressors were associated with elevated BP and negative affect. The bereaved group had lower BP than did the nonbereaved group. Within the bereaved group, higher perceived caring from the surviving parent was associated with fewer reports of minor stress and lower stress-related negative affect. Higher perceived <b>parental</b> <b>caring</b> during childhood was associated with lower BP across the sample and more frequent hassles in the nonbereaved group.

The present cross-sectional study examined the relationship between perceptions of <b>parental</b> <b>caring,</b> current psychiatric and somatic symptoms, and defensiveness, in a University of Arizona sample of females and males. Method: The Harvard Parental Caring Scale (HPCS), the SCL 90 R, and the Marlowe-Crowne (MC) scale (a measure of defensiveness) were administered to 398 students at the University of Arizona. Results: Cronbach alphas were. 83 for HPCS ratings of mothers and. 88 for fathers. High HPCS ratings were associated with reduced symptoms reports in both females and males (p <. 00002). Ratings of HPCS showed a small correlation with defensiveness (r =. 141). The relationship between HPCS and symptoms was strongest in the least defensive subjects. Conclusions: Positive perceptions of love and caring from parents, typically the most important source of social support for children, are associated with reduced psychiatric and somatic symptoms. Defensiveness may play a protective role psychologically (but not necessarily physiologically) in reducing the conscious awareness of symptoms accompanying low perceptions of <b>parental</b> love and <b>caring.</b> Key words: stress, social support, caring, love, health...|$|R

Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if the independent variables of self-esteem, levels of <b>parental</b> <b>caring</b> and closeness and levels of communication with parents predicted the dependent variable of pregnancy. After controlling for age and levels of parental education, self-esteem was the only statistically significant variable that was associated with pregnancy.

50|$|Since {{parents are}} {{role models for}} their children, it is {{critical}} to understand parental behaviour in the context of adolescent sexuality. Unsafe parental behaviour (such as smoking) are linked to adolescent engagement in risky behaviour. The fact that a parent smokes increases the likelihood of an adolescent engaging in problem behaviour, including risky sexual behaviour. The idea that risk is reproduced in generations is evident; parental behaviour is mirrored by the adolescent. Kim, Schooler and Sorsoli demonstrated “that adolescents’ perceptions of <b>parental</b> <b>caring</b> are an important mechanism in the association between parental television involvement and adolescents’ self-esteem, body image and sexuality”. Parental involvement is desirable when viewing sexual behaviour on TV; the shared experience enables parents to clarify what is seen. Parents and peers both influence adolescent sexuality.|$|R

Although over time, family networks tend to shift the center of gravity from sending to receiving country, that process is long, uncertain, and rarely complete. Inertia exercises significant influence on the location of kinship ties: older parents are less likely to leave; in turn, their continuing home country residence is a constraint on the movement of others, as demands for <b>parental</b> <b>caring</b> can keep adult children in place. Those persisting ties motivate continuing contacts; as noted in a recent study of migrants in Spain, frequent contact is more prevalent among those with immediate kin still in the home country as opposed to those whose closest family ties had undergone emigration (Park & Waldinger, 2017).|$|R

5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed).

Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no <b>parental</b> <b>care.</b> When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. <b>Parental</b> <b>care</b> is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E
