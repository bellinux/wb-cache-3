5|$|Lotus Temple, is a Bahá'í House of Worship {{completed}} in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, {{it serves as}} the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent {{and has become a}} prominent attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Like all other Bahá'í Houses of Worship, is open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction, as emphasised in Bahá'í texts. The Bahá'í laws emphasise that the spirit of the House of Worship be that it is a gathering <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions. The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E

For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community. The firm of the 21st century is not just a hierarchy which ensures maximum efficiency and profit; it is also the community where people belong to and grow together, where their affective and innovative needs are met.|$|E
25|$|The talk {{board is}} {{identical}} to the main message board {{except for the fact that}} it is not possible to post images. It was created in response to the arrival of 4rthur, a (now defunct) talk based offshoot of b3ta which drew a couple of hundred members away, and, more recently, cliqr, Dynafoo (both also defunct now) and c4mbodia. Also, the site owners wanted a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> could banter without worrying about creating images.|$|E
25|$|The {{area the}} line was being built was without road connection, and the steep terrain made it {{difficult}} to place the railway elsewhere than close by the fjords. As this was also the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> lived, it caused a conflict of interest. According to the peace-time compulsory purchase law, the state was forced to pay due compensation for any land they needed to build public infrastructure. However, the Germans showed no interest in following these laws, took what property they needed, often without even informing the locals. In Lappstorvika, the road became so dilapidated that the locals chose to move away until after the war.|$|E

500|$|... "Al Aaraaf" [...] is {{the longest}} poem Poe wrote and was {{inspired}} by Tycho Brahe's discovery of a supernova back in 1572 which was visible for about seventeen months.

Al-A`raaf (Arabic الأعراف, alternatively transcribed Aʿraf or Al Orf) was a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> who have been neither markedly good nor markedly bad had to stay until forgiven by God and let into Paradise, as discussed in Sura 7 of the Qur'an.

500|$|During its 120years of operation, Kew's title changed {{numerous}} times. [...] This {{has been}} in response to society's changing views towards the treatment and care of mentally ill persons; improvements in treatment leading to better health outcomes {{and changes in the}} Victorian Government's various Health Acts. [...] From its establishment until 1905 the institution at Kew was known as an asylum – a title which emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> could possibly be cured. [...] Kew was also for a short period known as the Metropolitan Lunatic Asylum at Kew, possibly to differentiate it from its sister country asylums at Ararat and Beechworth. During this period, all people committed to the asylum were termed 'inmates' rather than patients – again emphasising detention rather than cure.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Seeley's series Hack/Slash through Image Comics, {{publisher}} Eric Stephenson suggested Seeley write another monthly book. Seeley {{knew he wanted to}} work with Norton again, and the two discussed ideas over the following months, mostly during lunch breaks. Seeley was interested setting a story in a small town so he could write about the kind of crimes that happen in a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> prefer to live far away from each other. Norton was interested in telling a new kind of zombie story, since he felt The Walking Dead had perfected the zombie survival story. They combined the two ideas to create the premise for Revival. They pitched the series as Fargo meets The Walking Dead, using the terms [...] "Rural Noir" [...] and [...] "Farm Noir" [...] to describe the hardboiled detective story set in a small town.|$|E
500|$|Southdale Center was {{developed}} by the Dayton Company and designed by Victor Gruen, an Austrian immigrant and socialist. Gruen was a European-style socialist; he found individual stores in downtown venues to be inefficient, and the suburban lifestyle of 1950s America too [...] "car-centric" [...] and wanted to design a building that would be a communal gathering <b>place,</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> would shop, drink coffee, and socialize, as he remembered from his native Vienna. Southdale Center was loosely modeled on the arcades of several heavily populated European cities and purposely included [...] "eye-level display cases" [...] to [...] "lure customers into stores". Gruen imaged that Southdale would eventually include [...] "a medical center, schools and residences, not just a parade of glitzy stores." [...] The first plans unveiled for the shopping center were announced in 1952 by Gruen and Minnesota native, Donald Dayton.|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 1998, Houston Police Department {{officers}} {{acting on}} a tip regarding drug related activities entered a Gulfton apartment complex and shot and killed Pedro Oregon Navarro. The circumstances of the event were disputed. By October 19 of that year a Harris County grand jury cleared the officers of charges related to the incident. Nestor Rodriguez, {{a professor of sociology}} at the University of Houston, described Gulfton as [...] "a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> are just struggling to get by." [...] Consequently, there were fewer [...] "displays of outrage" [...] than would have been expected if the incident had occurred in one of the [...] "older, well-established Latino communities." [...] Oregon's killing was controversial because illicit drugs were not found on the property. Oregon's family sued the City of Houston arguing that the raid was inappropriate. The city countered that its officers acted in an appropriate manner. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2000.|$|E
500|$|Maxentius' {{rule was}} {{nevertheless}} insecure. His early support dissolved {{in the wake}} of heightened tax rates and depressed trade; riots broke out in Rome and Carthage; and Domitius Alexander was able to briefly usurp his authority in Africa. By 312AD, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported, even among Christian Italians. In the summer of 311AD, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's [...] "murder". To prevent Maxentius from forming an alliance against him with Licinius, Constantine forged his own alliance with Licinius over the winter of 311–312AD, and offered him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximinus considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for a military support. Maxentius accepted. According to Eusebius, inter-regional travel became impossible, and there was military buildup everywhere. There was [...] "not a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> were not expecting the onset of hostilities every day".|$|E
500|$|Smythe also envisioned {{building}} a new shrine for his team. He described it as [...] "a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> can go in evening clothes, {{if they want to}} come there for a party or dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton's department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe would never get the arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. [...] They referred to the arena plan as [...] "Smythe's Folly". [...] To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4½ months after breaking ground, Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. [...] In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers.|$|E

500|$|Guests were {{expected}} to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing [...] "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; {{those who were not}} wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> could have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Blair {{expressed}} {{frustration that}} Carmella {{had become a}} [...] "very tortured, depressive character {{and there was no}} {{light at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> have no idea what I have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E
