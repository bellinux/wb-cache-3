NMDAR2b experienced the greatest change in activity.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{prevailing}} questions in current metaphor research has been whether {{and to what extent}} conventionality of a metaphor influences its processing. The career of metaphor hypothesis (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005; Gentner & Bowdle, 2001) suggests that conventional metaphors are <b>processed</b> <b>through</b> categorization whereas novel ones are <b>processed</b> <b>through</b> comparison. The dual reference theory (Glucksberg & Haught, 2006 a, 2006 b), on the other hand, proposes that it is the grammatical form of a figurative statement that determines how it will be processed. More specifically, metaphors which share the grammatical form of literal categorizations are <b>processed</b> <b>through</b> categorization and similes which share the grammatical form of literal comparisons are <b>processed</b> <b>through</b> comparison. The present study investigated the claims of these theories and found support for the career of metaphor hypothesis by showing that conventional figurative statements appeared to be <b>processed</b> <b>through</b> categorization whereas novel statements appeared to be <b>processed</b> <b>through</b> comparison. Key Words: Metaphor; conventionality; categorization; comparison...|$|R

Commencement exercises begin each year at 1:50 pm {{as members of the}} senior class gather in the Stoutenburg Gymnasium and <b>process</b> <b>through</b> the campus, crossing by the Cushing Center and Hilary Hall and arriving at Alumni Hall for the commencement ceremony. The graduating class processes onto the quad to the designated seating area directly in front of Alumni Hall as a hired brass ensemble plays the Pomp and Circumstance March. If the weather is inclement, commencement takes place in the Thomas F. Sullivan Arena. The academic processional of the College's Mace, color guard, graduands, members of the monastic community, and the faculty can take over twenty minutes. The national anthem is performed by a student or students selected. The performer is usually a member of the Saint Anselm College Choir. Next, a student selected by the administration delivers the coveted student address that he/she submitted for consideration. This is followed by the College President's address. The faculty award of the year from the Saint Anselm College Chapter of the American Association of University Professors is presented to a deserving faculty member. The student award for service and citizenship is presented to a community service-minded senior in recognition for an outstanding community project. This award is not given every year, only when there is consensus among administration that a particular student is deserving. Honorary doctorates are then conferred among selected honorary degree recipients. After the keynote address by one of the honorary degree recipients, the graduates are awarded their degrees of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. After the benediction, graduates flip their graduation tassel to the opposite side of their cap and process out to the recessional song as the Abbey bells resound throughout campus. Finally, family and friends meet with the new graduates to take photographs.|$|E
