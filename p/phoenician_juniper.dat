5|$|Out of the 804 {{species of}} flora {{distributed}} throughout the park, six are endemic, completely exclusive to the park area, and cannot be observed anywhere else on earth, while another 30 are indigenous. The most common and widely distributed plant species throughout the national park are Mediterranean maquis shrubs such as the <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> (Juniperus phoenicea). Other common vegetative species within the area include the oleaster-leafed pear (Pyrus elaeagnifolia), Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), and elm-leaved sumach (Rhus coriaria).|$|E
50|$|The main {{peaks of}} the range are the 1,078 m high Tossal de la Vila, Penya Blanca (951 m) and Tossal de la Toiola (939 m). This range {{is one of the}} most {{important}} areas in Europe where there are still pristine woods and thickets of <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper,</b> sometimes mixed with Kermes oak. The Spanish Ibex is abundant in the range.|$|E
50|$|Dana is {{the most}} diverse area of plant life in the country, {{consisting}} of numerous vegetation types including: <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper,</b> evergreen oak, sand dunes, acacia, and rocky sudanian. Dana is the southernmost area {{in the world to}} host the Mediterranean cypress, Cupressus sempervirens. Of the hundreds of plants species inhabiting Dana, three can be found nowhere else in the world. Many plants, especially trees and shrubs, grow in the highlands of the nature reserve.|$|E

50|$|The botanical {{identity}} of algum {{is not known}} for certain, though some references suggest it may be juniper (Juniperus). Several species of juniper occur in the Middle East region, including Juniperus excelsa (Greek juniper), Juniperus foetidissima (stinking juniper), Juniperus phoenicea (<b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper),</b> and Juniperus drupacea (Syrian juniper). It {{is likely that the}} woods of these species, which are all very similar in woodworking properties, would have not been distinguished from each other in the wood trade. The difficulty in identifying this wood {{is due in part to}} uncertainty over the location of the Biblical city of Ophir. If Ophir is located in India, as some think, the wood likely would be red sandalwood or Pterocarpus santalinus.|$|E
50|$|The {{islands are}} covered in Mediterranean {{coniferous}} forest and macchia vegetation such as the strawberry tree, phillyrea, the heather, rhamnus, the kermew oak, often {{in the form of}} treelike shrubs, and evergreen trees such as the maple, the wild olive, the <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> and the rare tree Amelanchier chelmea. Phrygana is also common and consists of many species. Of particular interest are the chasmophytes with several endemic species such as Campanula reiseri, Linum gyaricum, Arenaria phitosiana and others. Underwater sea-grass beds of Posidonia oceanica, which is particularly important for the development of other organisms and the retention and cycling of suspended particles and various substances in the marine environment, are widely spread and in good condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of Asinara is {{a typical}} Mediterranean macchia, with lentisk, Euphorbia, tree heath (Erica arborea), Calicotome spinosa, Phillyrea angustifolia, <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> and cistus. The flora consists of 678 species, 29 of which are endemic. Some, such as Centaurea horrida, Limonium laetum and Limonium acutifolium, are exclusive to northern Sardinia, while others are characteristic of the Sardinian - Corsican region. The fauna numbers around 80 wild species of terrestrial vertebrates, including mouflon, wild boar, horses, Sardinian donkeys and the white Asinara donkey, which was introduced onto the island {{at the beginning of}} the 1800s, and probably abandoned when the inhabitants were moved to Stintino. Birds include the rare Audouin's gull, cormorants, peregrine falcons and the Barbary partridge. Asinara is the only place in Sardinia where the magpie is present.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} of Sant'Anna Arresi contains the frazione (subdivision) Porto Pino, Is Pillonis. Porto Pino has a spotless beach that stretches for almost 2 km with dunes that can reach {{as high as}} 29 m. As its name suggests, {{the importance of this}} area from a naturalistic point of view comes from the presence of the Aleppo pine, which is present in a dense wood of about 90 ha. As well as the pines, squat and <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> can be found all around. The rare kermes oak which in its bushy state is found only in very few places on the island increases the botanic interest of Porto Pino. The wetland {{at the back of the}} beach is known mainly for its ornithology, many species of birds can be found, among which are cormorants, green cormorants and shags.|$|E
50|$|Zembra has {{a fragile}} {{ecosystem}} {{and has been}} classified as a protected area by UNESCO since 1977. The island's vegetation consists of about 266 plant species which are distributed according to topography of land. The native soils include rock, clay, sand and magnesium lime. The flora is characterised by a canopy of dense bush, including olive and <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> and gorse, {{and the presence of}} rare plants which favour of saline soils.. There are also invertebrates and terrestrial mammals introduced by man, such as rabbit, Corsican sheep, black rat and feral cat. In addition, Zembra is located on an avian migration route between Tunisia and the Strait of Sicily, and hosts more than 25,000 pairs of migrating birds which nest in the rocky cliffs. The island is home to the largest colony of shearwaters in the Mediterranean. Dolphins are also common in the waters surrounding the island.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Graham quoted Al-Andalus {{geographer}} {{and historian}} Al-Bakri, {{who wrote in}} the 11th century that, [...] "We arrived at Sbiba, a town of great antiquity, built of stone, and containing a college and several baths. The whole country around is covered with gardens, and produces a saffron of the greatest excellence." [...] René Louiche Desfontaines, in 1784, wrote that for several hours he marched through a forest of pines and <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> before descending into the verdant plain in which Sbiba is situated. In 1862, Victor Guérin wrote that, it was long deserted and uninhabited; he commented that, on this vast site {{he could not find}} a [...] "miserable hamlet of five or six huts", and only a [...] "dozen tents belonging to the Madjer tribe". Robert Lambert Playfair, while travelling the same route taken by Desfontaines in 1877, wrote the forests which Desfontaines alluded to have disappeared. By 1886, Graham wrote, the site was an abandoned village, with no settlement within 30 mi, in an old field wilderness.|$|E

40|$|Through plant {{geography}} {{research into the}} evergreen macchia vegetation {{on the island of}} Murter done in the last ten years, two clearly differentiated alliances inside the class Quercetea ilicis Br. -Bl. 1947 – Quercion ilicis Br. -Bl. (1931) 1936 and Oleo-Ceratonion Br. -Bl. 1936 have been determined. In the alliance Quercion ilicis are the following associations: Myrto-Quercetum ilicis Trinajstić (1976) 1985; Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis H-ić (1956) 1958; Ostryo-Quercetum ilicis Trinajstić (1965) 1974 and in the alliance Oleo-Ceratonion the associations of the xerothermal <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> macchia – Pistacio lentisci-Juniperetum phoeniceae Trinajstić 1987 and Querco ilicis-Pinetum halepensis Loisel 1971. Xerothermal <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> macchia constitutes a stage of the progression towards the development of evergreen forest vegetation after the termination of anthropogenic impact. It develops in the neglected olive-groves, vineyards, garrigues and rocky pasture lands on the island and the surrounding small islands. A total of 27 phytocenological relevés were made. Relevés were made and analyzed using the classical Braun-Blanquet method.

40|$|Areas {{where the}} <b>Phoenician</b> <b>juniper</b> (Juniperus phoenicea) is very abundant, {{as well as}} communi-ties in which this species is dominant, {{represent}} a special form of forest community, commonly de-veloped as xerothermic macchia known as Pistacio lentisci – Juniperetum phoeniceae and included in the Oleo-Ceratonion alliance. This association represents an important progressive stage in the suc-cession towards evergreen vegetation, developed mostly after forest fires. In this paper, we ana-lysed the floristic characteristics of the Pistacio lentisci – Juniperetum phoeniceae association on the is-lands of ^iovo, [olta, Bra~, Hvar, Kor~ula and Lopud, including the peninsula of Pelje{ac and the Dubrovnik coastal regions (Dubrova~ko primorje).
