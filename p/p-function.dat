40|$|Classical Schur <b>P-functions</b> are the {{particular}} case of Hall-Littlewood polynomials when the parameter {{is equal to}} - 1. We introduce factorial (interpolation) analogues of Schur <b>P-functions.</b> A dimension of a skew shifted Young diagram {{is the number of}} standard tableaux of the given shape. Also these numbers are equal up to simple factors to the decomposition coefficients of the restriction of an irreducible representation of a spin-symmetric group to a smaller spin-symmetric group. In terms of the factorial Schur <b>P-functions</b> we obtain an explicit formula for the dimension of a skew shifted Young diagram. The main application of this formula is the new derivation of Nazarov's classification of undecomposable projective characters of the infinite symmetric group.

50|$|The minimal basis set {{is close}} to exact for the gas-phase atom. In the next level, {{additional}} functions are added to describe polarization of the electron density of the atom in molecules. These are called polarization functions. For example, while the minimal basis set for hydrogen is one function approximating the 1s atomic orbital, a simple polarized basis set typically has two s- and one <b>p-function</b> (which consists of three basis functions: px, py and pz). This adds flexibility to the basis set, effectively allowing molecular orbitals involving the hydrogen atom to be more asymmetric about the hydrogen nucleus. This {{is very important for}} modeling chemical bonding, because the bonds are often polarized. Similarly, d-type functions can be added to a basis set with valence p orbitals, and f-functions to a basis set with d-type orbitals, and so on.|$|E
