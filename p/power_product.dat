For this purpose we have drawn a historical time line of the design features of PV <b>powered</b> <b>products</b> {{in the context of}} main stream design and styling. Our time frame is 1970 till 2016, focusing in first instance on consumer <b>products</b> and PV <b>powered</b> lamps. We will discuss how we learn from these experiences for the design and styling of future PV <b>powered</b> <b>products.</b> Because design and styling {{is considered one of the}} key features to a well-designed product, this study is relevant for the acceptability of PV products in nowadays consumer markets. Despite many studies on the technical functioning and energy performance of PV <b>powered</b> <b>products,</b> little attention has been paid to a constructive analysis of design and styling. Therefore with this study we make a start with identifying which design and styling factors can contribute to a higher appreciation for PV <b>powered</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Both uses of {{this notion}} can be found, {{and in many}} cases the {{distinction}} is simply ignored, see for instance examples for the first and second meaning. In informal discussions the distinction is seldom important, and tendency is towards the broader second meaning. When studying the structure of polynomials however, one often definitely needs a notion with the first meaning. This is for instance the case when considering a monomial basis of a polynomial ring, or a monomial ordering of that basis. An argument in favor of the first meaning is also that no obvious other notion is available to designate these values (the term <b>power</b> <b>product</b> is in use, in particular when monomial is used with the first meaning, but it does not make the absence of constants clear either), while the notion term of a polynomial unambiguously coincides with the second meaning of monomial.|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this dissertation is the observation that today {{a vast amount of}} 'PV powered' products are already on the market. However, in these PV <b>powered</b> <b>products</b> quite often the choice of PV cells seems random and PV cells function mostly as add-on units to give the product a 'green' energy image. Because of this 'add-on' approach, the PV cells remain foreign bodies which are not well-integrated into the total product design. As a result in today's PV <b>powered</b> <b>products</b> often a sub-optimal matching between the PV cell characteristics, energy storage and the product user contexts. Therefore, the keyword to obtain a mature and sustainably designed PV <b>powered</b> <b>product</b> will be matching. As a result the research question is formulated as: What systematic matching can be achieved between the elements and interfaces of the energy chain of photovoltaic <b>powered</b> mobile/wireless <b>products?</b> The emphasis of this dissertation will be on the optimal matching in the energy chain of PV <b>powered</b> <b>products.</b> For this purpose, an Energy Matching Model of the energy chain is developed. This dissertation will present how, why and under what circumstances a novel Energy Matching Model and associated Figure of Matching algorithm can support industrial designers in developing sustainable photovoltaic <b>powered</b> <b>products.</b> This PhD research project is executed {{within the framework of the}} SYN-Energy program which explores the feasibility of a transition towards the use of photovoltaic (PV) cells in consumer and professional products.
