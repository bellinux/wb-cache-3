40|$|Because the {{capability}} of terrestrial ecosystems to fix carbon is constrained by nutrient availability, understanding how nutrients limit plant growth is a key contemporary question. However, what drives nutrient limitations at global scale remains to be clarified. Using global data on plant growth, plant nutritive status, and soil fertility, we investigated to which extent soil <b>parent</b> <b>materials</b> explain nutrient limitations. We found that N limitation was not linked to soil <b>parent</b> <b>materials,</b> but was best explained by climate: ecosystems under harsh (i. e., cold and or dry) climates were more N-limited than ecosystems under more favourable climates. Contrary to N limitation, P limitation was not driven by climate, but by soil <b>parent</b> <b>materials.</b> The influence of soil <b>parent</b> <b>materials</b> {{was the result of}} the tight link between actual P pools of soils and physical–chemical properties (acidity, P richness) of soil <b>parent</b> <b>materials.</b> Some other ground-related factors (i. e., soil weathering stage, landform) had a noticeable influence on P limitation, but their role appeared to be relatively smaller than that of geology. The relative importance of N limitation versus P limitation was explained by a combination of climate and soil parent material: at global scale, N limitation became prominent with increasing climatic constraints, but this global trend was modulated at lower scales by the effect of <b>parent</b> <b>materials</b> on P limitation, particularly under climates favourable to biological activity. As compared with soil <b>parent</b> <b>materials,</b> atmospheric deposition had only a weak influence on the global distribution of actual nutrient limitation. Our work advances our understanding of the distribution of nutrient limitation at global scale. In particular, it stresses the need to take soil <b>parent</b> <b>materials</b> into account when investigating plant growth response to environment changes...|$|R

25|$|Removal of {{soil and}} rock {{overburden}} covering the coal resource may cause burial and loss of topsoil, exposes <b>parent</b> <b>material,</b> and creates large infertile wastelands. Soil disturbance and associated compaction result in conditions conducive to erosion. Soil removal from the area to be surface-mined alters or destroys many natural soil characteristics, and reduces its biodiversity and productivity for agriculture.

25|$|The thermo-mechanically {{affected}} zone (TMAZ) occurs {{on either side}} of the stir zone. In this region the strain and temperature are lower and the effect of welding on the microstructure is correspondingly smaller. Unlike the stir zone the microstructure is recognizably that of the <b>parent</b> <b>material,</b> albeit significantly deformed and rotated. Although the term TMAZ technically refers to the entire deformed region it is often used to describe any region not already covered by the terms stir zone and flow arm.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{types are}} highly {{variable}} in the tropics and {{are the result of}} a combination of several variables such as climate, vegetation, topographic position, <b>parent</b> <b>material,</b> and soil age. Most tropical soils are characterized by significant leaching and poor nutrients, however there are some areas that contain fertile soils. Soils throughout the tropical rainforests fall into two classifications which include the ultisols and oxisols. Ultisols are known as well weathered, acidic red clay soils, deficient in major nutrients such as calcium and potassium. Similarly, oxisols are acidic, old, typically reddish, highly weathered and leached, however are well drained compared to ultisols. The clay content of ultisols is high, making it difficult for water to penetrate and flow through. The reddish color of both soils is the result of heavy heat and moisture forming oxides of iron and aluminium, which are insoluble in water and not taken up readily by plants.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the formation of and widespread distribution of tektites requires the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism {{for the formation of}} tektites is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity impact, have been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that <b>parent</b> <b>material</b> from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified Impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required in order for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.|$|E
500|$|The {{surface soil}} in the Randolph area is {{composed}} mostly of silt loam of different qualities and {{at different stages of}} erosion. About 15% of the surface soil consists of [...] "Adler silt loam" [...] with a slope of 0–1%, found in the frequently flooded plains at Randolph. About 20% of the soil is severely eroded [...] "Memphis silt loam" [...] with 12–25% slopes, and ca. 35% of the soil consists of [...] "Memphis silt loam" [...] with 20–40% slopes. Less than 8% consists of moderately eroded [...] "Memphis silt loam" [...] with slopes from 1–5%. The remaining surface soil is composed of other silts, sands or clays, including [...] "Robinsonville fine sandy loam" [...] (ca. 6%) and [...] "Tunica clay" [...] (ca. 1.5%). Approximately 1.5% of the area is covered by water. The <b>parent</b> <b>material</b> of the [...] "Memphis silt loam" [...] is Pleistocene loess. Loess is a fine-grained, slightly coherent, silty, windblown sediment. Eroded loess consists of extremely fine, sandy particles and forms silt in environments that provide sufficient moisture of the soil, usually caused by occasional flooding or precipitation. Soil derived from eroded loess is sometimes also referred to as loess.|$|E

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} {{nature of}} soils makes it imperative {{to study the}} associations of soils and regional landscapes for sustainable land use planning and management. This paper examines soil properties involving four catenas on two parent rock formations in two ecological zones. It simultaneously studied the vertical and lateral variations of soil properties in relation to <b>parent</b> <b>materials,</b> slope positions and pedogenetic-geomorphic processes along hillslopes extending over basement complex and sedimentary rock formations of the Lower Ogun River Floodplain. The different <b>parent</b> <b>materials</b> from different <b>parent</b> rocks, slope positions and pedogenetic-geomorphic processes accounted for the intra-profile and inter-profile variations of topsoil and subsoil properties in the landscape. The study demonstrated that in a given hillslope, topsoil and subsoil properties show more significant differences (p< 0. 05) between diverse rock formations, distinct <b>parent</b> <b>materials</b> and different slope positions than within them. This suggests that the soils are genetically linked due {{to the influence of}} relief (differences in elevations) along the hillslope and geomorphic factors (<b>parent</b> <b>materials)</b> which affirms catenary associations of soils along the hillslopes...|$|R

2500|$|The Midlands and the Lower Derwent {{present a}} {{different}} story {{from the rest of}} the state. Owing to a relatively dry climate and alkaline (mostly dolerite) <b>parent</b> <b>material,</b> these soils are relatively unleached and contain lime in the deeper subsoil. They are mostly classified as [...] "prairie soils" [...] or [...] "brown earths" [...] and bear some resemblance to the chernozems of Russia and North America, although they are much lower in available phosphorus and somewhat acidic in the surface levels. Their higher nutrient levels, however, allow them to support productive pasture, and large numbers of sheep are grazed in these regions. Some grain crops are also grown in the driest areas. In the alluvial areas of southeastern Tasmania, rich alluvial soils permit apples to be grown.|$|E
2500|$|On August 6, 2008, federal {{prosecutors}} declared Ivins {{to be the}} sole culprit of the crime when Jeffrey Taylor, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia laid out the case against Ivins to the public.

[...] But other experts disagree, including biological warfare and anthrax expert, Meryl Nass, who stated: [...] "Let me reiterate: No matter how good the microbial forensics may be, they can only, at best, link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab. They cannot link it to any individual." [...] At least 10 scientists had regular access to the laboratory and its anthrax stock, and possibly quite a few more, counting visitors from other institutions, and workers at laboratories in Ohio and New Mexico that had received anthrax samples from the flask.

2500|$|... inner (large-core) planets form by {{condensation}} and raining-out {{from within}} giant gaseous protoplanets at high pressures and high temperatures. Earth's complete condensation included a c. 300 Earth-mass gas/ice shell that compressed the rocky kernel to about 66% of Earth's present diameter (Jupiter equates to about 300 Earth masses, which equals c. 2000 trillion trillion kg; Earth is at about 6 trillion trillion kg). T Tauri (see T Tauri type stars) eruptions of the Sun stripped the gases {{away from the}} inner planets. Mercury was incompletely condensed and a portion of its gases were stripped away and transported to the region between Mars and Jupiter, where it fused with in-falling oxidized condensate from the outer reaches of the Solar System and formed the <b>parent</b> <b>material</b> for ordinary chondrite meteorites, the Main-Belt asteroids, and veneer for the inner planets, especially Mars. [...] The differences between the inner planets are primarily the consequence of different degrees of protoplanetary compression.
