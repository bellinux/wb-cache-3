40|$|Tactile sensors of {{comprehensive}} functions are urgently {{needed for the}} advanced robot to co-exist and co-operate with human beings. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tactile</b> sensors based on air bladder possess some noticeable advantages for human-robot interaction application. In this paper, we construct a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tactile</b> sensor and apply it on the fingertip of robot hand to realize the sensing of force, vibration and slippage via the change of {{the pressure of the}} air bladder, and we utilize the sensor to perceive the object’s features such as softness and roughness. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tactile</b> sensor has good linearity, repeatability and low hysteresis and both its size and sensing range can be customized by using different material as well as different thicknesses of the air bladder. It is also simple and cheap to fabricate. Therefore, the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tactile</b> sensor is suitable for the application of co-operative robots and can be widely utilized to improve the performance of service robots.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery (MIS) led to significant benefits for patients {{at a cost of}} increase technical difficulty for surgeons. Robotic {{minimally invasive surgery}} (RMIS) was introduced to help eliminate some of the outstanding challenges by introducing improvements such as enhanced 3 D vision and additional degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, RMIS resulted in a complete loss of haptic feedback, a problem that has persisted even {{after more than a decade}} of technology development. The limitations introduced by the loss of feedback in robotic surgery gave birth to innovations and significant research on haptic feedback systems (HFS). These systems aimed to provide an artificial sense of touch. Researchers have focused on many varieties of feedback technologies, most often relying on one specific feedback modality to help improve performance in a few, limited robotic surgical procedures. This research project set out to investigate multi-modal haptic feedback systems capable of providing benefits for many different robotic surgical applications. Having inherited an existing <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> system designed for reducing crush injuries in robotic surgical procedures, this project implemented various critical enhancements for <b>pneumatic</b> normal force <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback.</b> Improvements to the sensing technology such as design of shear sensing mechanisms helped expand the application of haptics beyond grip force reduction. The development and integration of additional modalities of feedback including kinesthetic force feedback and vibration feedback, and design of a highly configurable software architecture allowed the application of the multi-modal HFS in several different RMIS applications. Evaluation of the system for knot tying in robotic surgery showed significant benefits in reducing suture breakage and improving knot quality. Application of the multi-modal HFS for palpation in robotic surgery helped improve detection non-compressible structures such as tumors and vessels in soft tissue phantoms. Finally, the system improved upon the previously developed unimodal <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> systems with regards to reduction of grip force in RMIS. The results of these investigations highlight the importance of developing multi-modal haptic feedback systems that are able simulate the synergistic relationship between the various feedback modalities involved in real human touch. Robotic surgical systems have long been held back by their lack of comprehensive haptic feedback solutions. Multi-modal haptic feedback systems hold the promise of eliminating this long-standing problem and helping expand the application of robotics in surgical sciences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> on touch {{surfaces}} {{has shown}} to greatly improve the interaction in {{quantitative and qualitative}} metrics. Recently, researchers have assessed the notion of remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback,</b> i. e., the spatial separation of touch input and resulting tactile output on the user’s body. This approach {{has the potential to}} simplify the use of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> with arbitrary touch devices and allows the design of novel tactile stimuli by stimulus combination. However, a formal comparison of direct and remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> during touch input is still missing. Therefore, we conducted three consecutive laboratory studies. First, we compared the effects of both direct and remote tactile stimuli on the user’s performance during touchscreen interactions. No difference was found in the positive effects of both types of feedback. Second, we evaluated the impact of the remote tactile actuator’s position on the user’s body. For remote tactile stimuli, we found improved accuracy and interaction speed, regardless of the body location. Third we analyzed remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> under additional cognitive load. The results support the positive effects of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> on user performance and subjective evaluation. These findings encourage us to further exploit the potential of remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> to simplify and expand the multimodal interaction with arbitrary touch interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Touchscreen mobile devices, {{which do}} not have a {{physical}} keypad or keyboard, have become very popular. In these devices the interaction is done primarily with virtual buttons as all or most of the physical buttons have been removed. Due to this fact these devices have one major weakness compared to the traditional mobile devices: the lack of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback.</b> This makes the mobile device usage challenging as the user can only rely on visual and audio feedback. Mobile devices are often used in situations where the user cannot devote all his visual attention to the device and the audio feedback cannot be heard. Therefore the absence of the tactility makes the mobile device usage difficult. Adding <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> to touchscreens might solve this problem.
