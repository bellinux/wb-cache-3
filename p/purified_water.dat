500|$|During the 20th century, {{the citadel}} {{witnessed}} significant urban and social changes. A [...] high steel water tank was erected on the citadel in 1924, providing the inhabitants with <b>purified</b> <b>water,</b> but also causing water {{damage to the}} foundations of the buildings due to increased water seepage. The number of inhabitants gradually declined over the 20th century as the city {{at the foot of the}} citadel grew and wealthier inhabitants moved to larger, modern houses with gardens. In 1960, over 60 houses, a mosque and a school were demolished to make way for a straight road connecting the southern gate with the northern gate. Some reconstruction works were carried in 1979 on the citadel's southern gate and the hammam. In 2007, the remaining 840 families were evicted from the citadel as part of a large project to restore and preserve the historic character of the citadel. These families were offered financial compensation. One family was allowed to continue living on the citadel to ensure that there would be no break in the possible 8,000 years of continuous habitation of the site, and the government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel once it is renovated. In 2004, the Kurdish Textile Museum opened its doors in a renovated mansion in the southeast quarter of the citadel.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{technological}} {{solution was}} implemented in 1885 – obtaining fresh {{water from the}} sea by desalination. This had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1869, when it was envisaged that condensers would be used to produce [...] of pure water per day from seawater. The idea was initially rejected due to the high cost but by the mid-1880s concern was growing that Gibraltar's water supply would be inadequate {{in the event of a}} new siege. The War Office had a change of heart and agreed to fund the project. The first <b>purified</b> <b>water</b> from the newly installed condensers was produced in March 1885. Because Gibraltar still had no distribution network for drinking water, it could only be delivered from barrels in donkey carts or by hand. Despite the cost, the new water supply enabled the inhabitants of Gibraltar, for the first time in their history, to rely on a source of pathogen-free water. The new system proved its worth only a few weeks after it was installed when cholera broke out in the town of La Línea de la Concepción just across the border with Spain. 191 of La Línea's 12,000 inhabitants died of the disease, but only 22 died in Gibraltar – about five per cent of the death toll in the previous epidemic.|$|E
