40|$|The basic {{structure}} of a system called Certified Footprints of Products (CFP system) is outlined in this discussion paper. The CFP system could produce strict and reliable data needed for generating product-oriented carbon footprints in Finland. Central parts of the CFP system are a national CFP <b>programme,</b> <b>product</b> category rules (PCRs), a chain or actor-wise monitoring plan, validation of the monitoring plan, and reporting and verification of data, and an ICT-system to support data sharing. The system is designed around activity-based monitoring data, and every actor {{would be responsible for}} data on its own activities. Linkages to existing environmental management systems are taken into account. The CFP system is still just a theoretical structure. It needs further development prior to full-scale introduction. For the food sector, a new architecture for data acquisition and quality assurance, development of existing mechanisms and consolidation of them in the CFP system are needed. Additional research is needed regarding emissions from agricultural production...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of programme-targeted method {{in the budget}} process in Ukraine demonstrates the difference between public administration using programs (budget programs) and based on programme management. The budget program has {{the structure of a}} programme document, but the content corresponds to the reformatting line-item budget. There are two main problems of application of the programme management methodology in fiscal policy: a sequence of programme objectives and heterogeneity of time. For fiscal policy the selection and distribution of programme objectives (results, effects) in space and time is a key component of management. Despite the complexity and uncertainty of any calculation of the <b>programme</b> <b>product</b> cost should take into account that the sequence of the outcomes affects the total programme result. In this context, the choice of performance, productivity and efficiency indicators based on different time of occurrence and characteristics of the result, product and effect of the financial instruments use to govern financial mechanism as part of the programme management. Results should be evaluated on the ability to become a product that takes effect. The effect of the financial tools application is spaced in time from the result. Efficiency should not be understood as a ratio, but as the correlation with the anticipated cost (value) remote effect, which does not coincide with the result of the programme delivered on time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A company crisis can {{be defined}} as a short-term, undesired, {{unfavourable}} and critical state in the company (organization) which has derived from both internal and external causes and which directly endangers the further existence and growth of the company. In crisis not only short-term measures but also long-term vision and business directions must be prepared and implemented {{in order to be able}} to provide further existence and development. One of the most important area is marketing restructuring which represents a transition from the prior structural combination of programmes and markets to a new structure that must enable greater profitability and effectiveness of operations. In regard to such a restructuring, one must take into account the inter-linked relationship of the market (the chosen segment of customers) and of the <b>programme</b> (<b>product,</b> service), since, in principle, it is true that the identical programme of offer cannot be placed on the new market or the new programme in the prior market (segment). If the marketing restructuring is one of the most important restructuring area in the company in times of crisis it should be based upon marketing concept in order to follow the right direction of the renewal. However, empirical evidence from the author’s research has shown that companies in acute crisis pay surprisingly little attention to their marketing restructuring, even though in this case this is the most important area of reorganization. In the article some guidelines for the marketing restructuring for achieving the company renewal based on marketing knowledge and practice are presented...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of product}} {{placements}} has evoked interest by marketers for many years. Yet, {{little research has}} been done on this medium within the South African context; therefore {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate consumer attitudes towards prominent product placements and the principal actor using the brand in the film or broadcast <b>programme.</b> <b>Product</b> placements are seen as a subtle means of advertising that should be used in conjunction with the traditional mass media. It has been used for many years and can be defined as the compensated inclusion of a branded product or brand identifiers, through audio and/or visual means within mass media programming (films and broadcast programmes) for promotional purposes. The survey method entailed that respondents had to observe a series of scenes from a film clip containing product placements; thereafter they were required to complete a questionnaire. Two hundred respondents, between the ages of 18 to 24 participated in this survey. Results indicated that their ability to recall prominently placed products is greater than their ability to recall subtly placed products. It further indicates that a principal actor using a brand in a film or broadcast programmes does not necessarily influence consumers’ affective behaviour. It is suggested that product placements will become a strategic and viable marketing option in the mobile environment for targeting specific groups. Advertising companies seek more venues for products. From these findings it can be concluded that if marketers and advertisers consider product placements as an integrated marketing communication vehicle, they must request that their brands are placed prominently in a film and broadcast programmes to ensure maximum exposure and greater awareness among consumers. The results also provide useful insight to media planners as to whether product placement is effective when the principal actor uses it...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{companies}} {{on a global}} market are experiencing constantly changing business demands and increased competition. Increasing focus in product development is now put on issues like understanding users and their needs, the context where users’ activities take place and creating sustainable solutions (McAloone, et. al., 2007). In manufacturing companies, engineering designers {{play a significant role}} in realising what is captured in these words. Future engineering designers will hold wider responsibilities for such tasks (McAloone, et. al., 2007; Larsson, et. al., 2005), thus challenging current engineering design education. Educating engineering designers today significantly differs from traditional engineering education (McAloone, et. al., 2007). However, a broader view of design activities gains little attention. The project course Product/Service-Systems, which is coupled to the lecture based course Product life and Environmental issues at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the master programme in Product Development at the Luleå University of Technology (LTU), Sweden, are both curriculums with a broader view than traditional (mechanical) engineering design. Based on these two representatives of a Scandinavian approach, the purpose in this presentation is to describe two ways of educating engineering designers to enable them to develop these broader competencies of socio-technical aspects of engineering design. Product Development at LTU A process, called Participatory Product Innovation (P 2 I) underpins the master <b>programme</b> <b>Product</b> Development and originates from the Design for Wellbeing (DfW) framework (Larsson, et. al., 2005). This is an inclusive framework which seeks to bring together business, human issues and technology in a comprehensive approach to support the creation of tomorrow’s innovations. A main principle is that many different disciplines should contribute to spur innovation by collaboration across disciplines (Larsson, et. al., 2007). The P 2 I process starting position is in Needfinding (Patnaik and Becker, 1999), were the students conduct observations and interviews to gain access to ualities in the users’ context. An identified challenge here is to keep people in view and not jump into conclusions, i. e., to understand a situation perceived by its actors as problematic and to widen the design space. Product/Service-Systems at DTU Besides the teaching of traditional engineering skills, the curriculum for the project course aims to build up multidisciplinary competences such as understanding the socio technical aspects of product design and synthesis of products and delivery systems. The students are assigned to redesign an existing physical product, such as a washing machine, and turn it into a product/service-system. The main objective for the project is that the resulting solution should have a substantially lower environmental impact whilst maintaining a similar functional performance as the initial product. The student teams are first guided through an analysis of the initial product’s product life cycle, yielding insights into four aspects of product design: 1. indentification of current environmental impacts, 2. life phase systems the product encounters, 3. activities that involve the human actor (i. e. customer) and the product, 4. actor-network that support and supply these activities throughout the product’s life. Based on the analysis, goals are set for the improved solution and concepts are developed for a new product/service-system. This way the students are lead through engineering and socio-technical analysis tasks and thereby laying the foundation for their synthesis work in the concept development phase of the project. Concluding Remark By emphasising socio technical aspects in a process model or in a project course, the students are more likely to consider users, their context and sustainable solutions. This we see as essential competencies in product/service-system design and functional product development. References Larsson, A., Larsson, T., Leifer, L., Van der Loos, M., Feland, J.

40|$|A {{challenge}} for design educators lies in balancing demands from employers for graduates who are "ready for work" on graduation and universities' academic goals for excellence by creating graduates with {{knowledge and skills}} that reflect the cognate basis of the discipline they are studying.

40|$|More than {{a quarter}} of {{children}} in Ireland are living in, or are at risk of, poverty. Children who grow up in poverty are more likely to leave school early and without having attained the fundamental literacy skills. Literacy is widely acknowledged as the foundation for academic attainment across the curriculum. Children who fall behind in literacy at an early stage are likely to remain behind (Brooks, 2007; Francis et al, 1996; Juel, 1988), with consequences for later academic achievement and access to employment. The importance placed on the development of children's literacy has resulted in the design of numerous interventions for children in the form of <b>programmes,</b> <b>products,</b> practices and policies. Whilst many of these initiatives take place within normal school hours, after-school programmes are increasingly being adapted from their traditional role, which focused on childcare and recreational activities, to one focused on academic achievement. Some interventions have been shown to improve literacy outcomes in the short term; however, questions remain about whether these improvements are sustained over the longer term. With this in mind, the current report outlines the results of a follow-up to a randomised controlled trial evaluation of an after-school literacy programme (Doodle Den) ...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{products}} is a multi-disciplinary process of identifying and envisaging user needs and bringing those needs into life. This {{has to be}} done in a cost-efficient manner, while ensuring products that exceed expectations on quality standards in form, fit, and function and – stand out from competition. These facts, have made it necessary to incorporate project-based learning in collaboration with industry in a product development curriculum, in which students gain experiences in developing products and insights in industrial activities. As a result these students can grasp inter-related aspects of subjects associated to product development better. Some ten years ago, Chalmers University of Technology made it possible for students not only from mechanical engineering to take a project course in Product Development, but also students from automation and control, industrial economics, and students studying either a MSc or MArt in Industrial Design. This was done mainly to address the multi-disciplinary nature of designing, so that students could get the opportunity to appreciate the skills attained by students from other disciplines and learn from each other. Since Chalmers University of Technology now shift its educational framework according to the Bologna process, and starting 44 new Master’s <b>programmes</b> (<b>Product</b> Development being one of them) we will take the opportunity to summarise our experiences of providing these cross-functional product development projects, with 4 th year students, where student groups plans and carries out all phases in a product development project to solve an industrial problem in close collaboration with an industry partner.

40|$|In {{the last}} century {{there has been a}} vast {{increase}} in global competitiveness. The flow of products across borders is greater than ever before and the focus on price and performance increased. Companies feel this increased competition and need to develop products that meet the customer’s individual needs {{and at the same time}} still be competitive on the price. It is in these situations design for product platform show their strength. It offer the companies the opportunity to sell products to different market segments and at the same time provide increased reuse of assets within the company. For products with a structure that allows configuration possibilities, there have been several methods of modularisation and product platform designed to accommodate these challenges. For products not suitable for a configuration design, there have been no models to follow. This thesis proposes the Corporate Platform model to develop a <b>product</b> <b>programme.</b> The model focuses on how to structure the <b>product</b> <b>programme</b> in order to deliver customised products and at the same time focus on reuse within the company. The model has been developed around the crash box product manufactured by Hydro Aluminium Structure. This is a component in the bumper system of cars and its purpose is to absorb all the energy in a low speed crash (16 km/h). The Corporate Platform model is intended for the design team and their managers in the process of developing a structured <b>product</b> <b>programme</b> for all the product variants. It is primarily developed to industrialize the development process of customised product variants. The <b>product</b> <b>programme</b> involves an understanding of the market, the product and the manufacturing processes as well as the dynamic aspects related to the product’s life, in order to provide insight into lean product variant design. The model focuses not only on one product variant, as a traditional product development methods does, but all the aspects of several product platforms with a range of product variants. Central relationships in product variant design are made explicit and related to strategic thinking. The model consists of three elements: Market, Product Platform and Manufacturing. • Market covers the inputs and drivers for the product variant design and the process of segmentation of the customer’s product preferences. • Product Platform development focuses on arranging and aligning the product features to sort out the balance between distinctiveness and commonalities in the products. This is aligned with the existing products and supplemented with new product concepts, so that the decided product range can be met. All this is in close relationship with the production processes for the products. • Manufacturing focuses on the transfer of best design and production knowledge from one product variant onto the next. These three elements form the base from which customised product variants can be leveraged. The models also put the attention on the dynamic aspects in launching and managing new industrial processes with their associated product variants.
