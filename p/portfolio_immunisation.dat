It is shown that calculations which assume, usually implicitly, that the flow-through of inflation to cash flow is zero, produce misleadingly high durations for property and equities. These are typically in the range 15 to 25 years. Simulations using the formulae show that property has some bond-like characteristics. The results indicate that, for realistic flow-through rates, equities have a higher duration than property. The flow-through rate {{is the most important}} variable in the estimation of equities. Using historical data, equity duration is estimated at 8. 65 years and property’s at 3. 15 years. These are substantially lower than those commonly cited. If these values can be substantiated, and if higher values are used in practice, <b>portfolio</b> <b>immunisation</b> strategies may need to be reconsidered...|$|E

We consider both duration, and duration and convexity matching immunisation strategies. Our {{results show that the}} immunisation performance of minimum M-square portfolios is very sensitive to the holding period. Minimum M-square portfolios have the best performance for short holding periods. However, all minimum M-square <b>portfolios</b> have good <b>immunisation</b> performance irrespective of the risk measure used, especially with duration and convexity matching strategies. immunisation performance; minimum M-square portfolios; Monte-Carlo simulation; revenue management; immunisation strategies; holding periods; interest rate changes; portfolio formation. ...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines against {{microbial}} diseases {{have improved}} {{the health of}} millions of people. In the next decade and beyond, many conceptual and technological scientific advances offer extraordinary opportunities to expand the <b>portfolio</b> of <b>immunisations</b> against viral and bacterial diseases and to pioneer the first vaccines against human parasitic and fungal diseases. Scientists in {{the public and private}} sectors are motivated as never before to bring about these innovations in immunisation. Many societal factors threaten to compromise realisation of the public health gains that immunisation can achieve in the next decade and beyond [...] understanding these factors is imperative. Vaccines are typically given to healthy individuals and safety issues loom high on the list of public concerns. The public needs to regain confidence in immunisation and trust the organisations responsible for the research, development, and implementation of vaccines. In the past, by use of a judicious amalgam of knowledge and empiricism, successful vaccines were largely developed by microbiologists who identified antigens that induced immune responses to conserved pathogen components. In the future, vaccines need to be developed against deadly diseases for which this strategy is often not feasible because of the extensive antigenic variability of relevant pathogens. High microbial diversity means that immunity after natural infection is often ineffective for prevention of disease on subsequent exposure, for example in HIV infection and malaria. Additionally, vaccines need to be generated to protect the people who are most vulnerable because of age or underlying diseases. Thus, in the future, a much deeper understanding of the immunological challenges [...] including the diversifying role of host genetics and environmental factors, leading perhaps to more personalised approaches-will be the touchstone for rational design and development of adjuvants that result in novel safe and effective vaccines...|$|R
