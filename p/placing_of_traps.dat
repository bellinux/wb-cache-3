25|$|Combat {{focuses on}} the player's ability to prepare, position, and form a {{cohesive}} team with their party members. Inquisition features two forms of combat systems. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action role-playing games, including Dragon Age II. During combat, players can switch to control other party members, while artificial intelligence will {{take control of the}} Inquisitor and other members in the party. This system is action-oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of classic role-playing games, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the party members and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and allows for the <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> <b>traps</b> while the game is paused. The Inquisitor also has the ability to close and manipulate the rift, which can stun all the enemies nearby.|$|E

40|$|Multiple sinks {{competition}} is investigated for a walker diffusing on directed complex networks. The asymmetry of the imposed spatial support makes the system non transitive. As a consequence, {{it is always}} possible to identify a suitable location for the second absorbing sink that screens at most the flux of agents directed against the first trap, whose position has been preliminarily assigned. The degree of mutual competition between pairs of nodes is analytically quantified through apt indicators that build on the topological characteristics of the hosting graph. Moreover, the positioning <b>of</b> the second <b>trap</b> can be chosen so as to minimize, {{at the same time}} the probability of being in turn shaded by a thirdly added <b>trap.</b> Supervised <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> absorbing <b>traps</b> on a asymmetric disordered and complex graph is hence possible, as follows a robust optimization protocol.

40|$|A common {{technique}} {{used to control}} phorid fly infestations on stingless bee?s nests is the use <b>of</b> <b>traps</b> with commercial vinegars, especially the red wine vinegar, which is stated to be more efficient than the white wine vinegar. However, the claims on its greater efficacy are only circumstantial, not based on experiments. Thus, {{the aim of this}} work was to test the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>traps</b> composed <b>of</b> red wine or white wine commercial vinegars on the attractiveness of adult Pseudohypocera kerteszi Enderlein (Diptera Phoridae) females that infested colonies of Melipona fasciculata Smith, and Melipona seminigra Friese. The comparisons were made by <b>placing</b> one <b>trap</b> <b>of</b> red wine vinegar and other of white wine vinegar in infested colonies of the studied species for a week to check for possible differences in their attractiveness on phorids. We also tested the possibility that traps could attract phorid flies from outside the nests, thus potentially increasing an infestation. This was tested by <b>placing</b> <b>traps</b> <b>of</b> red wine vinegar in empty hives in the meliponary, thus eliminating bee?s odours and food stores as factors that could attract phorid flies. There was no difference on the attractiveness <b>of</b> <b>traps</b> composed <b>of</b> red wine or white wine vinegars (Wilcoxon matched-pairs test), and traps did not any attract phorid flies from the outside to the interior of hives. Thus, the red wine and white wine vinegars can be equally used to capture phorid flies that invade nests of stingless bees, and they do not attract flies from outside the nests, thus not increasing infestations. The other objective of this work was to correlate the body size, particularly the maximum head width of the captured phorids and their abundance, with the monthly rainfall levels during the experimental period. We noticed an increase of abundance of phorid flies on the rainy periods, but there was no correlation with body size, which we suggest to be a consequence of the weakening of bee colonies that normally occur during the rainy season, which ease the invasion of them by phorid flies from the environment. 201...|$|R

We postulated that scents at latrines {{may serve as}} an attractant to other carnivores and evaluated this premise by using camera traps to compare carnivore detection rates (overall and by species) and richness (overall and for each survey month) between latrine (n= 5) and non-latrine riparian areas (n= 5). On average carnivore richness was about 1. 7 times {{higher than that of}} a non-latrine, and mean richness was higher at latrines for all survey months. Likewise, the overall carnivore detection frequency was 3. 5 times greater at latrines, and the detection frequencies for red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), river otters, mink (Neovison vison), long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were greater at latrines. American black bears (Ursus americanus) and eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) where detected more frequently at non-latrines.
