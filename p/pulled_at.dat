5|$|By 2002 Sarumpaet had {{returned}} to Indonesia, where she debuted a stageplay entitled Alia, Luka Serambi Mekah (Alia, Wound of Serambi Mekah) at Ismail Marzuki Park in Jakarta; it was her first stageplay {{since the fall of}} Suharto. Dealing with Indonesian military operations in Aceh, the play was later performed in five other cities. In December 2002 it was scheduled to be broadcast on TVRI in commemoration of Human Rights Day, but <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> the last minute due to intervention from the military. In 2001, she and her troupe put on Dalam Kegelapan Panjang (In a Long Darkness), which dealt with the children of victims of the anti-communist purges of 1965–1966.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, {{so it had}} become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, so there was no possibility of delaying the release.|$|E
25|$|Matilda {{was born}} around 1080 in Dunfermline, the {{daughter}} of the Scottish king Malcolm III and the Anglo-Saxon princess Saint Margaret. She was christened Edith, with the Anglo-Norman prince Robert Curthose standing as godfather at the ceremony. The English queen Matilda of Flanders was also present at the baptismal font and served as her godmother. Edith <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> Queen Matilda's headdress, which was seen as an omen that the infant would be queen one day.|$|E

The episode was originally scheduled to air on MTV Latin America in February 2010 but was <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> the last minute, allegedly due to its perceived negative portrayal of Mexican President Felipe Calderón.|$|E
500|$|... "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] was {{the first}} song {{released}} as a single. It reached number one in Raven's native Norway, and the top ten in both the United Kingdom and Germany. [...] "Blind As a Bat" [...] {{was scheduled to be}} released in the UK on December 18, but was then put back to February 26, as two CDs. In turn, this single was <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> the last minute, in favor of [...] "Cry Over Me", which was released on May 7, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Maurice Ravel [...] did {{not have}} {{confidence}} in me for the Boléro. He was afraid that my Mediterranean temperament would overtake me, and that I would rush the tempo. I assembled the orchestra at the Salle Pleyel, and Ravel took a seat beside me. Everything went well until the final part, where, in spite of myself, I increased the tempo by a fraction. Ravel jumped up, came over and <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> my jacket: [...] "not so fast", he exclaimed, {{and we had to}} begin again.|$|E
2500|$|Hurricane Mk IIB {{conversion}} {{armed with}} two 40mm (1.57in) anti-tank autocannons in a gondola-style pod, one under each wing {{and a single}} Browning machine gun in each wing loaded with tracers for aiming purposes. The first aircraft flew on 18 September 1941 and deliveries started in 1942. Serial-built aircraft had additional armour for the pilot, radiator and engine, and were armed with a Rolls-Royce gun with 12 rounds, later changed to the 40mm (1.57in) Vickers S gun with 15 rounds. The outer wing attachments were strengthened so that 4G could be <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> a weight of 8,540 lb (3,874 kg). The weight of guns and armour protection marginally impaired the aircraft's performance. These Hurricanes were nicknamed [...] "Flying Can Openers", perhaps a play on the logo of No. 6 Squadron, which flew the Hurricane starting in 1941.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of secrecy {{surrounding}} the developments of Lambert's automobile. Operational tests were conducted with the window blinds <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> the farm implement showroom where he ran it. Outside road tests were conducted at night on roads that were not used. That was a good thing since many times there were long intervals between being able to get the automobile started again after it stopped. It turned out that the villagers didn't even know what Lambert was working on since it was such a new concept. They didn't realize the significance of Lambert's horseless carriage. Lambert is said to have had the first automobile accident. One time when he was testing his [...] "horseless carriage" [...] at night in a secret run he drove his vehicle into a tree stump and ran into a hitching post.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart aired archive {{footage of}} Cramer admitting to {{the ease of}} {{manipulating}} markets and commented that Cramer's on-air personality lacks honesty: [...] "I understand {{you want to make}} finance entertaining, but it's not a fucking game. And when I watch that, I get, I can't tell you how angry that makes me. Because what it says to me is: you all know. You all know what's going on. You know, you can draw a straight line from those shenanigans to the stuff that was being <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> Bear, and AIG, and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street side bet." [...] Stewart said of Cramer in particular, [...] "I can't reconcile the brilliance and knowledge that you have of the intricacies of the market with the crazy bullshit I see you do every night." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{final game}} ever {{played at the}} stadium was the {{afternoon}} of September 28, 2003, a 5-2 Phillies loss to the Atlanta Braves. [...] The final win was recorded by Greg Maddux of the Braves, the final loss by the Phils' Kevin Millwood. The final Phillies run was scored by Marlon Byrd {{at the top of}} the 3rd inning, and the final run altogether by the Braves' Andruw Jones on a double by Robert Fick (who also had the last hit at Tiger Stadium as a Detroit Tiger 4 years earlier) {{at the top of the}} 5th. The final hit at the Vet was a single by the Phills' Pat Burrell at the bottom of the 9th. The next batter, Chase Utley, grounded into a double play to end the game and the Vet. [...] However, the ceremony that followed <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> the heartstrings of the sellout crowd. Both Paul Owens, a former general manager, and Tug McGraw, a former pitcher, made their final public appearances at the park that day; later that winter both men died. The last publicly broadcast words uttered in the park were by Harry Kalas — a veteran announcer who helped open the facility on April 10, 1971 — who paraphrased his trademark home run call: [...] "And now, Veterans Stadium is like a 3-1 pitch to Jim Thome or Mike Schmidt. It's on a looooooong drive...IT'S OUTTA HERE!!!" [...] The team moved into Citizens Bank Park in 2004, with the first game being played there on April 12, 2004.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as [...] "a wild character {{if there ever was}} one." [...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable in light of what he <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled out to the kitchen, plucked the football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E
