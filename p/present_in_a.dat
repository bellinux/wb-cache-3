5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact birth date as <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> register kept by his father. It was also then that he mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and foe).|$|E

The team used the radial velocity data to refine the parameters of HD 154672 b from what was published in its discovery paper a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissolved}} {{inert gases}} {{come out of}} solution within the tissues {{of the body and}} form bubbles, they may cause the condition known as decompression sickness, or DCS, also known as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease. However, not all bubbles result in symptoms, and doppler bubble detection shows that venous bubbles are <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significant number of asymptomatic divers after relatively mild hyperbaric exposures.|$|E

Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the eighth}} or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) {{in the human}} body, so that a 60kg adult {{contains}} {{a total of about}} 120g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant (with the exception of the ubiquitous CHON elements). Potassium ions are <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of proteins and enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters consume over 100 {{different}} prey species. In {{most of its}} range, the sea otter's diet consists {{almost exclusively}} of marine benthic invertebrates, including sea urchins, fat innkeeper worms, a variety of bivalves such as clams and mussels, abalone, other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses. Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> range of sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo clams smaller than 3inches (7cm) across.|$|E

More recent records showed that it is still <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significantly larger area, including the northeast of the island, and locals claim that it also occurs in the swamps near Kao, in the northwest.|$|E
5|$|TCDD is {{the most}} potent {{compound}} (congener) of its series (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, known as PCDDs or simply dioxins) and became known as a contaminant in Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War.

5|$|Two soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Ithan Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{small part of the}} watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent through the middle of the watershed. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep soil that rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. Most of the watershed is considered to have slightly erodible soil.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene are <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> species's population it {{is called}} polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
