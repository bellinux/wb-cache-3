This means that the new concept can be used with only a control software update in an ordinary gearbox. The trade-off between comfort and wear, which is experienced in the traditional control concept, becomes less troublesome.

The work finds the largest potential in using an extra clutch which belongs to a gear higher than the high gear in an upshift.

40|$|A host of {{scholars}} have made great contributions to establishing a theory regarding potential causes on alliance credibility in areas including a {{quantitative and qualitative}} approach. Previous empirical findings support that taking account of only one ally in alliance power increase or decrease, which is a monadic <b>power</b> <b>shift,</b> regardless of the other ally 2 ̆ 7 s <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> is likely to affect alliance credibility; thus the <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> considering only one ally may be a significant contributor for decline of alliance credibility. Morrow and Leeds argue monadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> might trigger a decline of alliance credibility providing a reasoning that one ally 2 ̆ 7 s power increase tends to demand its more autonomy to lead to conflicts of interests causing a decline of alliance credibility, or one ally 2 ̆ 7 s power increase is likely to make it feel less dependent upon alliance {{that might lead to}} weak alliance commitments, thus causing a decline of alliance credibility. However, I argue that depending upon the monadic <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> theory might overlook important dyadic effects. Since actors of alliance tend to interact with one another through cooperation or distrust behavior, taking account of <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> in allied-dyads that reflects a power ratio compared with past dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> may be more plausible than monadic effects. In other words, a <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> of countries does not always invoke a less alliance credibility because dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> in alliance might lead to no change of credible alliance while monadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> tend to decrease alliance credibility. Therefore, I examine the relationship between a dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> and alliance credibility. I argue that dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts,</b> strictly distinct from monadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts,</b> {{have a significant effect on}} alliance credibility. Furthermore, I regarded gap of threat perception as a reasonable proxy for alliance credibility, and the gap of threat perception will be measured by affinity of nations based on the results of the UN roll-call votes because I provide a different approach to replace the existing measurement, fulfillment of alliance commitments, for the same dependent variable. I also refer to national material capabilities index to measure the dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts.</b> The empirical evidence is incommensurate with the hypothesis. The results contradict the hypothesis that when dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> in alliance occur, alliance credibility is likely to decrease. The results suggest that dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> in alliance tends to facilitate increase of alliance credibility while additionally dyadic <b>power</b> <b>shifts</b> in non-allied or all dyads seem to trigger less affinity of nations regardless of my hypothesis that observations are limited to allied dyads...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of fuel consumption of urban vehicles {{is one of}} the challenges of the society today. Many promising technologies such as hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cells are the focus of a lot of research and investments, but high costs prevent their development on a large scale, especially in heavy duty vehicles. Simpler solutions, such as continuously variable transmissions, are then interesting alternatives: they preserve some of the advantages of hybrid solutions significantly reducing the overall cost of the system. Since these technologies allow the decoupling of the engine's velocity from that of the wheels, optimised management of the engine becomes feasible, leading to lower fuel consumption than that of traditional solutions. This work compares the hydromechanical transmission with a traditional power shift in an application where efficiency and comfort are required: a city bus.

A second model of a vehicle with a <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> <b>transmission</b> has been taken as reference solution.

40|$|Wet {{friction}} clutches are machine elements enabling the power transmission from {{an input shaft}} to an output shaft during the operation, based on the friction occurring in lubricated contacting surfaces. These components {{play a critical role}} in vehicles equipped with automatic <b>transmissions,</b> <b>power</b> <b>shift</b> <b>transmissions</b> and limited slip differentials. An unexpected failure occurring in clutches can lead to an unexpected total breakdown of the vehicle. This undesirable situation can put human safety at risk, possibly cause long-term vehicle down times, and eventually result in high maintenance costs. In order to minimize the negative impacts, an optimal maintenance strategy, i. e. a condition based maintenance (CBM), driven by an accurate condition monitoring and prognostics therefore needs to be developed and implemented for wet {{friction clutches}}. A literature study has been carried out during this work in order to establish the state-of-the-art development of clutch monitoring and prognostics systems. Despite the fact that the performance demands for clutches increase, research in this direction is apparently very limited. Several methods related to this aspect have been reported in literature, but, they are not sufficiently pragmatic and flexible to implement for real-life applications. To fill this substantial gap, development of a clutch monitoring and prognostics method that can be easily implemented on real-life applications is the main objective of this thesis. There are two main failure modes that can interrupt the functionality of wet friction clutches as reported in the literature, namely (i) lubricant and (ii) friction material degradations. This thesis mainly focuses on the failure of wet friction clutches caused by the friction material degradation, which is a valid assumption for heavy-duty applications. In this scope, a better understanding of how friction material degradation affects the clutch dynamic behavior during its operation is of paramount importance for developing an effective clutch monitoring and prognostics system. In the first place, this thesis contributes to the contact modeling of nominally flat rough surfaces with asymmetric asperity heights distribution, which is relevant for clutch contact problems. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art of the clutch friction characteristics is established that leads to the derivation of a friction model appropriate for clutches, wherein some considerably important friction phenomena are taken into account. Subsequently, the effects of two major friction material degradation mechanisms, namely (i) adhesive wear and (ii) thermal degradation, on the clutch contact and friction characteristics are theoretically and experimentally investigated, which is the second contribution of this thesis. A novel experimental procedure, which is the third contribution, is proposed in order to systematically evaluate how the sliding friction characteristics of a clutch evolve during the lifetime. This way, the evolution of the frictionmodel parameters can be observed and quantified. A knowledge gained from the aforementioned evolution motivates to model and simulate the dynamic responses of a degrading clutch system. Based on the simulation results, some measurable ``features'' representing the progression of the clutch friction material degradation are derived, which is the fourth contribution. A feasibility study on the derived features recommends to develop two clutch monitoring methods: i. e. (a) post-lockup-features-based method and (b) pre-lockup-features-based method. In the first monitoring method, which is the fifth contribution, the torsional natural frequency and the corresponding damping extracted from the post-lockup torsional vibration signals are proposed as relevant features. The second monitoring method, which is the sixth contribution, utilizes the relative velocity signals of interest for extracting the relevant features, i. e. (i) the normalized engagement duration, (ii) normalized Euclidean distance and (iii) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance. In order to evaluate and verify the developed monitoring methods, accelerated life tests (ALTs) were carried out on some commercial wet clutches using a fully instrumented SAE # 2 test setup which is designed by an industrial partner, Dana-Spicer Off Highway Belgium. The experimental results confirm that the developed monitoring methods are feasible to be used for practical applications. As the last contribution, a data-driven health assessment and prognostics method which can be used to assess the condition and to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of wet friction clutches is developed. This strategy has been successfully evaluated and verified on some commercially available wet clutches. The evaluation and verification show that the developed strategy is prospective for aiding a condition based maintenance for wet friction clutches. nrpages: 284 status: publishe...|$|R
