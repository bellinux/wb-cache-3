It includes separate evaporating and condensing chambers interconnected by separate vapor flow and liquid return conduits. The vapor flow conduit can be opened or {{closed to the}} flow of vapor, whereas the liquid return conduit blocks vapor flow at all times.

40|$|The Ka {{frequency}} band {{has the potential}} to enable rapid deployment of broadband multimedia services around the world. The optimal satellite payload architecture for these services depends on the needs and constraints of the Network Service Provider (NSP) and the limitations of technology. TRW has developed a methodology that enables satellite-based NSPs to understand the business implications of a variety of payload and network architectures. TRW also conducted a study to quantify the differences between competing architectures in terms of throughput and financial performance. For many network operators, moving from a familiar “Bent Pipe ” to the new generation of processing payload architectures raises concerns as to which architecture will maximize return on investment. The results reported in this paper quantify the throughput potential of a Bent <b>Pipe,</b> analog Circuit <b>Switch,</b> and Fast-Packet Switch architectures using a baseline traffic model for geographically dispersed multimedia users. A Bent Pipe architecture is defined as a payload without switching. Payloads with switching are considered processed payload architectures. This paper explains the design differences and business analysis for broadband multimedia services. A multimedia traffic model and economic model demonstrate why the ATM architecture generates more billable-bits per month and enhanced financial performance than either a Bent <b>Pipe</b> or Circuit <b>Switch</b> architecture for geographically dispersed multimedia users...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an advanced miniature heat transport system for thermal control of small spacecraft. The MLHP Thermal Management System {{consists of a}} miniature LHP with multiple evaporators and multiple deployable radiators with variable emittance coatings (VECs) on the radiator surfaces. Thermoelectric coolers are used to control the loop operating temperature. The thermal system combines the functions of variable conductance heat <b>pipes,</b> thermal <b>switches,</b> thermal diodes, and the state-of-the-art LHPs into a single integrated thermal system. It retains all the performance characteristics of state-of-the-art LHPs and offers additional advantages to enhance the functionality, performance, versatility, and reliability of the system. Steady state and transient analytical models have been developed, and scaling criteria have also been established. A breadboard unit has been built for functional testing in laboratory and thermal vacuum environments. Experimental results show excellent performance of the thermal system and correlate very well with theoretical predictions...|$|R
40|$|KNET {{facilitates}} {{distributed computing}} between a UNIX compatible local host and a remote host {{which may or}} may not be UNIX compatible. It is capable of automatic remote login. That is, it performs on the user's behalf the chore of handling host selection, user name, and password to the designated host. Once the login has been successfully completed, the user may interactively communicate with the remote host. Data output from the remote host may be directed to the local screen, to a local file, and/or to a local process. Conversely, data input from the keyboard, a local file, or a local process may be directed to the remote host. KNET takes advantage of the multitasking and terminal mode control features of the UNIX operating system. A parent process is used as the upper layer for interfacing with the local user. A child process is used for a lower layer for interfacing with the remote host computer, and optionally one or more child processes can be used for the remote data output. Output may be directed to the screen and/or to the local processes under the control of a data <b>pipe</b> <b>switch.</b> In order for KNET to operate, the local and remote hosts must observe a common communications protocol. KNET is written in ANSI standard C-language for computers running UNIX. It has been successfully implemented on several Sun series computers and a DECstation 3100 and used to run programs remotely on VAX VMS and UNIX based computers. It requires 100 K of RAM under SunOS and 120 K of RAM under DEC RISC ULTRIX. An electronic copy of the documentation is provided on the distribution medium. The standard distribution medium for KNET is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. It is also available on a 3. 5 inch diskette in UNIX tar format. KNET was developed in 1991 and is a copyrighted work with all copyright vested in NASA. UNIX is a registered trademark of AT&T Bell Laboratories.

5000|$|Register {{switches}} select {{combinations of}} reed ranks to produce contrasting timbres. Most accordions have automatic or preset switches, similar to voice selection on an electronic keyboard, or (more precisely) to a preset combination {{action in a}} <b>pipe</b> organ. These <b>switches</b> control which reed ranks are enabled (opened up) or disabled (closed off): some switches enable a single reed rank, others enable several simultaneous reed ranks. In general, the formula {{for the number of}} potential switch combinations is one less than 2 to the number of unique reed blocks that are within the accordion. For example, if an accordion has 3 reed blocks, there are potentially 2-1 = 7 combinations, though [...] "less useful" [...] ones are often omitted. Unlike individual organ stops, only one combination is active at any given time.|$|R
40|$|A {{detection}} system is provided for sensing a malfunction of a valve having an outlet connected {{to an end}} of a first pipe through which pressurized fluid may be flowed in a downstream direction away from the valve. The system includes a bypass pipe connected at its opposite ends to the first pipe and operative to bypass {{a portion of the}} fluid flow therethrough around a predetermined section thereof. A housing is interiorly divided by a flexible diaphragm into first and second opposite chambers which are respectively communicated with the first pipe section and the bypass pipe, the diaphragm being spring-biased toward the second chamber. The diaphragm housing cooperates with check valves and orifices connected in the two pipes to create and maintain a negative pressure in the first pipe section in response to closure of the valve during pressurized flow through the first <b>pipe.</b> A pressure <b>switch</b> senses the negative pressure and transmits a signal indicative thereof to a computer. Upon cessation of the signal while the valve is still closed, the computer responsively generates a signal indicating that the valve, or another portion of the {{detection system}}, is leaking...|$|R
40|$|The MLHP Thermal Management System {{consists}} of a loop heat pipe (LHP) with multiple evaporators and condensers, thermal electrical coolers, and deployable radiators coated with variable emittance coatings (VECs). All components are miniaturized. It retains all the performance characteristics of state-of-the-art LHPs and offers additional advantages to enhance the functionality, versatility, and reliability of the system, including flexible locations of instruments and radiators, a single interface temperature for multiple instruments, cooling the on instruments and warming the off instruments simultaneously, improving. start-up success, maintaining a constant LHP operating temperature {{over a wide range}} of instrument powers, effecting automatic thermal switching and thermal diode actions, and reducing supplemental heater powers.
