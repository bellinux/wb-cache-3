5|$|Following a brief {{military}} career, including {{service in}} the American Civil War, he became a successful entrepreneur and commercial photographer. His photographic work was highly regarded, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> hand-coloured portraits and landscapes, which he sold mostly to foreign residents and visitors to the country.|$|E
5|$|Hergé took {{influence}} from the published works of French adventurer and gunrunner Henry de Monfreid, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> books Secrets of the Red Sea and The Hashish Cruise.

5|$|A {{large part}} of Mercator's income came from the sales of his {{terrestrial}} and celestial globes. For sixty years they {{were considered to be}} the finest in the world, and they were sold in such great numbers that there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving making the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.|$|E
5|$|By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> {{relationship}} with Hierocles, increasingly provoked {{the soldiers of}} the Praetorian Guard. When Elagabalus' grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided {{that he and his}} mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced. As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old Severus Alexander.|$|E
5|$|David left London in March, {{arriving}} in Rome {{just before the}} Easter celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks {{at home and in}} restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> still lifes, she asked if he would illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E

5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise. This is argued to be due, in part, to a more mature reading of the character's lines from Sylvia Anderson, who provided Penelope's voice from the first episode of the Thunderbirds television series. Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{one of his}} paintings, Telemachus Rescues Antiope {{from the}} Fury of the Wild Boar, was finally {{accepted}} for the Summer Exhibition. Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> use of colour {{and his ability to}} produce realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> favourite Kean—communicated the message of the plays. But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, Veronica and {{her father}} Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{investigate}} more suspects {{in the murder of}} Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> wife Mindy (Jaime Ray Newman) and her lover Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian). Both of them become particularly suspicious when they disappear, and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder to frame Hank.|$|E
5|$|Messi {{enjoys a}} close {{relationship}} with his immediate family members, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} {{defensive}} forwards of his era, Phillips was also known for his all-around skill, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> strong shot and endurance, and was considered, alongside Frank McGee, {{one of the two}} best players in all of hockey.

5|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{also received}} positive reviews. When it {{opened at the}} Madison Square Theatre, a New York Times reviewer complimented Mansfield for his acting and for overcoming the difficulty of presenting the story's allegorical material onstage. According to a New-York Daily Tribune reviewer, Mansfield gave excellent performances as Jekyll and Hyde despite a few technical production flaws. A Life review praised Sullivan's adaptation, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> addition of a love interest for Jekyll, and complimented the performances of Mansfield, Cameron and Harkins.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{called him}} up to the major leagues and he became the team's {{starting}} third baseman in 2014. Many compare his playing style, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> demeanor and work ethic, to that of former Phillies' teammate Chase Utley. As a hitter, he is better as a contact hitter than a power hitter; defensively, he has improved, which has drawn accolades from former Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} he {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists, especially the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall. Most {{of his works}} have survived, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> churches. The city of Chester contains {{a number of his}} structures, the most admired of which are his half-timbered black-and-white buildings and Eastgate Clock. The highest concentration of his work is found in the Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages of Eccleston, Aldford and Pulford.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Sorabji's biography, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> early life and musical beginnings. He studied music with Charles Arthur Trew from the early 1910s until around 1915, during a private {{education}} that {{is thought to have}} ended at about the same time. He reportedly started to learn the piano from his mother at an early age, and he later received help (but no lessons) from his mother's friend Emily Edroff-Smith.|$|E
5|$|Active {{military}} service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, <b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> older brother Benjamin's, {{as well as}} that of John McNeil Jr., husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the Mexican-American War was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's Attorney General. General Zachary Taylor's advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|As a {{commander}} Marlborough preferred battle over slow moving siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (<b>particularly</b> <b>his</b> carefully selected aides-de-camp such as Cadogan), {{as well as}} enjoying a close personal relationship with the talented Imperial commander, Prince Eugene, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often far ahead of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy's characteristics in battle. Marlborough {{was more likely to}} manoeuvre than his opponents, and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet the Duke qualifies more as a great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his predilection for fire, movement, and co-ordinated all-arms attacks, lay at the root of his great battlefield successes.|$|E
