BASEC also verifies that products fully {{comply with the}} relevant specification by full type testing at independent laboratories or by witnessing tests at the client factory. Manufacturers may apply for a license to display the BASEC mark on their products only when BASEC is satisfied that their manufacturing systems are capable of consistently producing cable products. After having attained a BASEC <b>Product</b> <b>Marking</b> License they are subjected to regular factory audits and products surveillance testing. BASEC issues certificates to unique, specific products when they have passed thorough testing and the manufacturer can demonstrate ongoing conformity.|$|E

In cytochemical studies of normal rat liver, reaction <b>product</b> <b>marking</b> acyltransferase activity was associated to the greatest extent with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rer) membranes {{and to a lesser}} extent with ser membranes. In liver from phenobarbital-treated rats, reaction product was largely restricted to ser membranes. The specific activity of the acyltransferases of rough microsomes from normal rat liver was higher than that of the smooth microsomes. On injection of phenobarbital, this fell rapidly after three injections to a low level, at which it remained during subsequent treatment. The specific activity of the smooth microsomes, on injection of phenobarbital, rose to a peak 12 hr after the first injection, after which it fell to a level at an activity above that of smooth microsomes of normal liver. A mechanism is postulated for the biogenesis of smooth membranes in which the phospholipid is synthesized in situ and the protein is synthesized in the rer and moves to the site of newly synthesized phospholipid, where it is inserted to produce a whole membrane...|$|E
40|$|Laser color marking of {{stainless}} steel {{has been in the}} interests of different industries for some time. Still wide use of the process is not seen on consumer products which might be because of lack of their usability information. Laser processing {{of stainless}} steel surfaces creates an oxide layer on the surface. The thickness of this layer defines how white light is reflected from the surface. What in principle is only a thin oxide layer on the surface can be seen as different colors by the viewer. If this oxide layer is thick and solid it will have good corrosion and wear properties. Consumer products are constantly under certain corrosion and wear. In this study, the corrosion and wear properties of laser color marking on AISI Type 304 L (EN 1. 4307) austenitic stainless steel were evaluated based on laser process parameters and colors. The results show that the corrosion properties of marked surface expressed as critical pitting temperatures (CPT) depend on heat input: coarsely the lower heat input the higher CPT. Also scanning velocity has a remarkable effect on CPT. The laser color marking parameters have a significant influence on the wear behaviour of both the surface itself and that of the counter body surface. Laser color marking has high potential to become a widely used technique for <b>product</b> <b>marking</b> and decoration...|$|E
40|$|Subject of Research. Oxide {{films on}} the metal {{surfaces}} can be obtained both by surface-uniform infrared heating and local laser treatment e. g. by sequence of nanosecond laser pulses. Due to interference in created films the coloration of treated area is observed. The present work shows the results of spectrophotometric measurements for various light entrance angles {{in the range of}} 10 - 60 °. Method. AISI 304 stainless steel plates were oxidized by two methods: in muffle furnace FM - 10 (Т= 500 - 600 ° С, t = 5 - 7 min.) and at line-by-line scanning by sequence of nanosecond laser pulses (λ = 1. 06 μm, τ = 100 ns, r = 25 μm,q= 2. 91 ∙ 107 W/cm 2, Nx = 30, Ny = 1). Surface research in optical resolution was realized by Carl Zeiss Axio Imager A 1 M. Reflectance spectra were obtained with spectrophotometer Lambda Perkin 1050 with integrating sphere at different fixed light incidence angles. Topographic features were detected by scanning probe microscopy investigation with NanoEducator equipment. Main Results. The quantitative surface geometry characteristics of AISI 304 stainless steel patterns treated by different methods are obtained. It was found that the increase of light entrance angle has no influence on the form of reflection coefficient dependence from a wavelength, but a blue-shift occurs especially for the case of laser treatment. This difference can be caused by surface topology formed by laser heating and variety of oxide film thickness. This effect results in more significant change in observed sample color for laser treatment then for infrared heating. Practical Relevance. The results obtained in the present work can be used to implement a new element of product protection against forgery with the <b>product</b> <b>marking...</b>|$|E

40|$|Interviewing of {{the guests}} of Druskininkai took place on January 13 – February 4, 2007. Depending {{on the results of}} the interview, we can state that one of the key {{conditions}} for the development of ecological farming in the country is ecological consciousness of the consumers, as the production and consumption of ecological products establishes preconditions {{to improve the quality of}} life. Ecological product demand is increasing, but not enough to forecast the market development. One of the reasons to low increase of the ecological product market is still unformed trading structures of these products. 57 % of the respondents buy ecological products in the supermarkets, 30 % - in the markets, only 4 % - directly from the ecological farms, and 8 % - during the expositions. Realization of ecological products in the supermarkets should speed up the growth of the market of these products. Main problems in selling the ecological products in big supermarkets would be rather high markup as well as the lack of an express ecological <b>product</b> <b>marking.</b> 43 % of the respondents identify ecological products by a special ecological product category (section), i. e. they do not spare time in search of an ecological product. Ecological product demand is increasing; however, the trading infrastructure has not been formed yet. The most popular ecological product trading form is still not clear. Another, the primary, reason to low ecological product demand is low income. Residents and guests of the resort prefer the lower level needs to healthy nutrition. In such situation, one of the principal factors for the development of ecologization is the activities of education and scholastic institutions as well as means of mass communication. Another substantial reason, which the popularity of an ecological product is subject to, is the support, given by the state. As a result, the price difference between an ecological and traditional foodstuff would become smaller. 65 out of 126 respondents could pay 5 %, 20 - 10 %, 15 - 15 % more for an ecological product. Support of the government to the ecological production is an essential factor for the market growth, as the direct payouts compensate the part of major expenses of this production. However, the direct payouts, granted to the producers, do not guarantee the growth of the market of ecological products, if the production structure is not adjusted to the demand. With reference to the interviews, it was observed that there is a lack of information on the benefits of use of ecological products, that proper infrastructure has not yet been developed, as well as that marketing means have not yet been implemented...|$|E
