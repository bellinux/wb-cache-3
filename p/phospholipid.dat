5|$|The {{milk fat}} globule is {{surrounded}} by a <b>phospholipid</b> trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting mammary epithelial cell (lactocyte). This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM only makes up an estimated 2% to 6% of the total milk fat globule, it is an especially rich <b>phospholipid</b> source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the milk fat globule is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols.|$|E
5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} <b>phospholipid</b> monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a <b>phospholipid</b> monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 Î¼m in average diameter, is surrounded by a <b>phospholipid</b> trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E

Evidence from studies in which the bound <b>phospholipids</b> were 'unmasked' by methanol-chloroform confirmed the view that the increased content of freely available <b>phospholipids</b> was related to altered lipid-protein binding rather than to an increase in total <b>phospholipids...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough plasmalogens are the {{predominant}} <b>phospholipids</b> of cardiac sarcolemma, their physiological role {{has not been}} forthcoming. Since the cardiac sarcolemmal sodium-calcium exchanger has been proposed to be regulated by anionic <b>phospholipids,</b> the roles of plasmalogens and anionic <b>phospholipids</b> as regulators of the sodium-calcium exchanger were explored. Reconstituted sodium-calcium exchange activity in plasmalogen-containing proteoliposomes was 10 -fold higher than that in control proteoliposomes comprised of only diacyl <b>phospholipids.</b> Additionally, exchange activity in plasmalogen-containing proteoliposomes was regulated by anionic <b>phospholipids.</b> Thus, plasmalogens provide a critical lipid environment in which anionic <b>phospholipids</b> serve as boundary lipids for the regulation of the trans-sarcolemmal sodium-calcium exchanger...|$|R

An analysis of hydroxy fatty acid content showed that D.confragosa contains, {{as a percentage}} of total fatty acids, 0.02% 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid and 0.01% 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid.|$|E
5|$|In some archaea, the {{lipid bilayer}} is {{replaced}} by a monolayer. In effect, the archaea fuse the tails of two <b>phospholipid</b> molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able to resist harsh environments. For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual <b>phospholipid,</b> cardiolipin. This <b>phospholipid</b> was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E

After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and may remain in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E
5|$|MFGM <b>phospholipid</b> {{components}} such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens.

Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in lipid biosynthesis, such as phosphatidylserine synthase on the ER face and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face. Because mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fission and fusion events, they require a constant and well-regulated supply of phospholipids for membrane integrity. But mitochondria {{are not only}} a destination for the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this organelle also {{plays a role in}} inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of <b>phospholipid</b> biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E
40|$|The role of <b>phospholipids</b> in BK virus {{infection}} and haemagglutination was studied by competition binding experiments and by treatment of susceptible cells with phospholipases. <b>Phospholipids</b> extracted from Vero cells and some commercial <b>phospholipids</b> showed an inhibiting activity on both BK virus infectivity and haemagglutination.

40|$|Origin-recognition complex (ORC), a {{candidate}} initiator of chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes, shares certain biochemical characteristics with DnaA, the initiator of chromosomal DNA replication in prokaryotes. These similarities include origin-specific DNA binding, ATP binding and ATPase activity. DnaA interacts with acidic <b>phospholipids,</b> such as cardiolipin, and its activity is regulated by these <b>phospholipids.</b> In this study, we examined whether Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC also interacts with <b>phospholipids.</b> Among the various <b>phospholipids</b> tested, ORC {{was found to}} bind specifically to cardiolipin. This binding was inhibited by excess concentrations of salts but unaffected by ATP, adenosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate or the origin DNA. Cardiolipin weakly inhibited the ATP-binding activity of ORC, whereas it strongly inhibited ORC binding to origin DNA. Acidic <b>phospholipids</b> other than cardiolipin (phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol) weakly inhibited ORC binding to origin DNA. Furthermore, total <b>phospholipids</b> extracted from yeast nuclear membranes inhibited ORC binding to origin DNA.

5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In <b>phospholipid</b> bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by Î³-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the <b>phospholipid</b> layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100ÂµM.|$|E

5|$|Purified MAM from {{subcellular}} fractionation {{has been}} shown to be enriched in enzymes involved in <b>phospholipid</b> exchange, in addition to channels associated with Ca2+ signaling. These hints of a prominent role for the MAM in the regulation of cellular lipid stores and signal transduction have been borne out, with significant implications for mitochondrial-associated cellular phenomena, as discussed below. Not only has the MAM provided insight into the mechanistic basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for cellular metabolism through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM underscores the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall cellular physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or <b>phospholipid</b> bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar {{membrane}} made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a <b>phospholipid</b> bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell.

The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E

The transbilayer mobility and equilibrium distribution of the labeled <b>phospholipids</b> were assessed by treatment of the intact cells with phospholipases.

5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the <b>phospholipid</b> backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E
5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a <b>phospholipid</b> that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E
