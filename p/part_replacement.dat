25|$|Some life extensionists {{suggest that}} {{therapeutic}} cloning and {{stem cell research}} could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, {{have not yet been}} replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells {{has proven to be a}} viable treatment for bladder disease. Proponents of body <b>part</b> <b>replacement</b> and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.|$|E

50|$|These are {{the least}} {{expensive}} and most widely used pool cleaners with purchase costs ranging in the $100-$300 price range. They are powered solely by the main pump {{of the pool and}} utilize the pool's filter system to remove dirt and debris from the water. These machines effectively diminish the suction of the main pump - using them will increase the electricity costs and require the main pump and filter system to be serviced more frequently. There is minimal maintenance and <b>part</b> <b>replacement</b> costs on these devices over time.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} after sales service on consumer buying behavior in Automobile industry of Pakistan. Data was collected through close ended questionnaire of 250 customers, from the five selective after sales service centers, of the original equipment manufacturers of Pakistan. Ordinary least square estimation procedure has been used. Results show that easy availability of spare parts, easy availability of technician/mechanics, <b>parts</b> <b>replacement</b> warranties and customization services have positive significant impact on consumer buying behavior. On the other hand economical spare parts, compatible spare parts and workshops (service centers) have insignificant impact on consumers buying behavior. It is recommended that manufacturers and importers of automobiles should focus on easy availability of spare parts, easy availability of technician/mechanics, <b>parts</b> <b>replacement</b> warranties and customization services to affect the consumer buying intentions in Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|Product {{remanufacturing}} is {{a widely}} accepted product reuse strategy in most industries due to its unique advantage of retaining a greater portion of added value in the initial manufacturing stage. Remanufacturing involves a sequence of operations including disassembly, cleaning, inspection, <b>parts</b> <b>replacement,</b> reassembly and testing.

50|$|Crate {{engines are}} {{often seen as}} an {{economical}} choice no matter the application. In general automobile engine replacement a crate engine is often very competitively priced {{when compared to the}} cost of a full rebuild of a faulty engine. Installers often opt for the crate engine because of the cost and ease of replacement. Crate engines are typically a bolt in replacement with no internal work being performed to the engine compared to a complete overhaul that required internal <b>part</b> <b>replacement</b> by trained mechanics. Hot Rod and other custom street applications also often choose a crate engine because of the value when compared to a custom built engine.|$|E

In <b>part</b> <b>replacement</b> for these closed pools and those at Scarbrook Road in Old Town a [...] "Water Palace" [...] facility was built on Metropolitan Open Land opposite the old airport for the Conservative council and opened in 1990.

50|$|Harmonic Balancer - Some M112 and M113 engines used in W210 {{models were}} {{equipped}} with a harmonic balancer pulley which, due to a supplier quality problem, may fail and cause engine damage. If the rubber insert of the harmonic balancer pulley delaminates, the pulley may grind through the timing chain cover and oil pan, causing several thousand dollars of damage. Mercedes-Benz USA issued Service Campaign #2005-020003 which included inspection of the part and replacement if necessary at no cost.

50|$|Worst-case {{tolerance}} {{analysis is}} the traditional type of tolerance stackup calculation. The individual variables are placed at their tolerance limits {{in order to make}} the measurement as large or as small as possible. The worst-case model does not consider the distribution of the individual variables, but rather that those variables do not exceed their respective specified limits. This model predicts the maximum expected variation of the measurement. Designing to worst-case tolerance requirements guarantees 100 percent of the parts will assemble and function properly, regardless of the actual component variation. The major drawback is that the worst-case model often requires very tight individual component tolerances. The obvious result is expensive manufacturing and inspection processes and/or high scrap rates. Worst-case tolerancing is often required by the customer for critical mechanical interfaces and spare <b>part</b> <b>replacement</b> interfaces. When worst-case tolerancing is not a contract requirement, properly applied statistical tolerancing can ensure acceptable assembly yields with increased component tolerances and lower fabrication costs.|$|E
