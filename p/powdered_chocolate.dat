40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1099 – 1102 Chocolate is {{a complex}} sample with a high content of organic {{compounds}} and its analysis generally involves digestion procedures that might include the risk of losses and/or contamination. The determination of copper in chocolate is important because copper compounds are extensively used as fungicides in the farming of cocoa. In this paper, a slurry-sampling flame atomicabsorption spectrometric method is proposed for determination of copper in <b>powdered</b> <b>chocolate</b> samples. Optimization was carried out using univariate methodology involving the variables nature and concentration of the acid solution for slurry preparation, sonication time, and sample mass. The recommended conditions include a sample mass of 0. 2 g, 2. 0 mol L 1 hydrochloric acid solution, and a sonication time of 15 min. The calibration curve was prepared using aqueous copper standards in 2. 0 mol L 1 hydrochloric acid. This method allowed determination of copper in chocolate with a detection limit of 0. 4 lg g 1 and precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), of 2. 5 % (n= 10) for a copper content of approximately 30 lg g 1, using a chocolate mass of 0. 2 g. The accuracy was confirmed by analyzing the certified reference materials NIST SRM 1568 a rice flour and NIES CRM 10 -b rice flour. The proposed method was used for determination of copper in three <b>powdered</b> <b>chocolate</b> samples, the copper content of which varied between 26. 6 and 31. 5 lg g 1.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the occurrence of aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2 and ochratoxin A in chocolate marketed in Brazil. A hundred and twenty-five samples of powdered, bitter, dark, milk and white chocolate were evaluated for mycotoxins. Ochratoxin A {{was the most common}} mycotoxin in the evaluated samples, contaminating 98 % of the purchased chocolate. A co-occurrence of aflatoxins was observed in 80 % of all samples evaluated. The bitter, dark and <b>powdered</b> <b>chocolate</b> samples had the largest presence of aflatoxins. On average, the highest levels of ochratoxin A were found in powdered, dark and bitter chocolate, respectively: 0. 39; 0. 34 and 0. 31 μg/kg. Bitter, powdered and dark chocolate had the highest aflatoxin content; an average of 0. 66, 0. 53 and 0. 43 μg/kg, respectively. This is the first report of co-occurrence of ochratoxin A and aflatoxins in chocolate. The consumption of chocolate with high levels of cocoa in the formulation has been stimulated due to health benefits attributed to some cocoa components but on the other hand, these high cocoa content products tend to have the highest amount of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A. To guarantee a safe consumption of chocolate, there should be a continuous monitoring of both ochratoxin and aflatoxin and more studies attempting to understand the dynamics involving mycotoxin-producing fungi and mycotoxin production in cocoa need to be carried out with the aim of preventing mycotoxin accumulation in this commodity...|$|E

The reagent used is 1 -(2 -pyridylazo) - 2 -naphthol (PAN) and the micellar phase is obtained using the non-ionic surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X- 114) and centrifugation. The optimization step was performed using Box–Behnken design for three factors: solution pH, reagent concentration and buffer concentration. A multiple response functionwas established {{in order to get}} an experimental condition for simultaneous extraction of copper and zinc. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the method allows the determination of copper with a limit of detection (3 b/S, LOD) of 0. 1 gL− 1, precision expressed as relative standard deviation (R. S. D.) of 2. 1 and 1. 3 % (N= 10), for copper concentrations of 10 and 50 gL− 1, respectively. Zinc is determined with a LOD of 0. 15 gL− 1 and precision as R. S. D. of 2. 7 and 1. 7 % for concentrations of 10 and 50 gL− 1,respectively. The enhancement factors obtained were 36 and 32 for copper and zinc, respectively.

MÉTODOS: trata-se de estudo do tipo transversal, realizado entre 2005 e 2007. A presente análise refere-se ao período entre a oitava e a 13 ª semana gestacional, sendo realizada com 255 gestantes entre 18 e 40 anos, usuárias de uma Unidade Básica de Saúde no município do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro. A variável "desfecho"foi o consumo de cafeína quantificado por meio de questionário de freqüência alimentar semiquantitativo, previamente validado, o qual continha uma lista de alimentos com 81 itens e oito opções de freqüência de consumo. A ingestão de cafeína foi quantificada a partir do consumo de: {{chocolate}} em pó/Nescau®, chocolate em barra ou bombom, refrigerante, café e mate. A análise estatística foi realizada por meio de modelo hierarquizado de regressão linear múltipla. RESULTADOS: a mediana e o consumo médio de cafeína foram, respectivamente, de 97, 5 e 121, 1 mg (desvio padrão, dp= 128, 4). Já o consumo elevado da substância (> 300 mg/dia) foi observado em 8, 3 % das gestantes. No modelo multivariado, observou-se que mulheres cuja menarca ocorreu mais cedo (&# 946;=- 0, 15), com maior número de pessoas vivendo na casa (&# 946;= 0, 17) e que não faziam uso de medicamentos (&# 946;=- 0, 24) apresentaram maior tendência ao consumo elevado de cafeína e esta foi estatisticamente significativa (p PURPOSE: {{to determine}} caffeine consumption in {{pregnant women and}} to evaluate its association with demographic, socioeconomic, reproductive, lifestyle and maternal nutritional status. METHODS: it is a cross-sectional study performed between 2005 and 2007. The present analysis refers to the period among the 8 th and 13 th gestational week and included 255 pregnant women from 18 to 40 years, clients of a municipal health center in Rio de Janeiro. The outcome variable was caffeine consumption, quantified by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which count with a list containing 81 items and eight options of consumption frequencies; besides it being previously validated {{in a sample of}} employees of the State University of Rio de Janeiro. The caffeine intake was quantified starting from the consumption of: <b>powdered</b> <b>chocolate,</b> chocolate bar or chocolate, soft drink, coffee and mate tea. The statistical analysis was performed by means of fitting a multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: the median and the mean caffeine consumption were, respectively, 97. 5 and 121. 1 mg (standard deviation, sd = 128. 4). The high caffeine consumption (> 300 mg/day) was observed in 8. 3 % of pregnant women.

40|$|The main {{objective}} was to assess and control the contribution of various ingredient components to chocolate behaviour and to optimise ingredients for specific chocolate applications.

Novel <b>powder</b> compositions indicated by this work should also be useful to chocolate makers. The ability to make chocolate under test conditions and to assess the role of milk powders or other ingredients has been put in place for the first time in Ireland. Previous knowledge of milk seasonality and of powder technology has provided a basis for understanding variations in milk <b>powder</b> functionality in <b>chocolate.</b> Spray dried <b>powders</b> with mean free fat values of 50 to 94 %, particle sizes of 30 to 65 mm and vacuole volumes of 0. 0 to 3. 9 ml/ 100 g were produced from milks of varying composition but under the same processing conditions. Advances were made in analysing powder structure through microscopy, particle size and occluded air measurement. Valuable new information has been generated on the changes in free fat, solid fat content, particle size and occluded air in powders. Explanations were provided for the first time for the complex effects of these properties on chocolate viscosity and yield value.
