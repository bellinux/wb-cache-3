5000|$|The formal {{religious}} {{wedding ceremony}} of Kelly and Prince Rainier {{was held on}} 19 April 1956 at the St. Nicholas Cathedral. The high mass was conducted by the Bishop of Monaco. The bride wore an elegant wedding dress. It was a high-necked, long-sleeved gown with a fitted torso and billowing skirt. Grace Kelly worked closely with Helen Rose {{to come up with}} the design for the dress and the two women looked to costumes in the MGM archives for inspiration. A wedding dress from the MGM film Invitation is particularly similar to Grace's dress. The dress materials included [...] "twenty-five yards of silk taffeta, one hundred yards of silk net, <b>peau</b> <b>de</b> <b>soie,</b> tulle and 125-year-old Brussels rose point lace." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{wedding dress}} of the American actress Grace Kelly, worn during her wedding to Prince Rainer III of Monaco on 19 April 1956, is cited {{as one of}} the most elegant and best-remembered bridal gowns of all time, and one of the most famous since the mid 20th century. One author {{describes}} the dress as [...] "adding to the marital fervor and elevating matrimonial fashion" [...] and a major influence on women who strove to [...] "emulate Kelly's <b>peau</b> <b>de</b> <b>soie</b> and lace masterpiece". It was designed by Helen Rose of MGM. The dress consisted of a bodice with an attached under-bodice and skirt support. There were two petticoats, one being an attached foundation. The wedding attire included a headdress, veil, shoes and the lace- and pearl-encrusted prayer book which she carried down the aisle. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the wedding, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (which now owns the dress) displayed it at the museum between 1 April and 21 May 2006 and reported it to have been arguably its most popular exhibit.|$|E
