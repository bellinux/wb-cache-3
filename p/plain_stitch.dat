Most knitters probably aren’t even aware of the many processes that their fingers perform in the making of a single stitch. [...] However, large gauge needles emphasize those actions and knitting becomes increasingly more awkward when the needle diameter is greater than the width of the knitter's finger. [...] On a one-inch diameter (size 50) needle for instance, the shaft begins to taper one and three quarter inches from the tip. This means that the stitches are spread much further apart on mega knitting needles, making them more difficult to control. [...] The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers don’t have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important.

50|$|To {{produce a}} sweater, the knitter casts on {{stitches}} {{in the usual}} manner, evenly divided onto at least eight double pointed needles. The number of needles varies according {{to the size of}} the sweater, the weight of the yarn, and the length of the needle. There is one extra for the knitting. For sweaters, the knitters always work in the round for a pullover, or back and forth in one piece for a cardigan. After the knitter has divided the stitches on the proper number of needles, she knits a band of ribbing of her chosen design, then increases the number of stitches and continues in stocking or <b>plain</b> <b>stitch.</b> Pockets of the knitter's design are often knit in.|$|E

50|$|The thread {{used for}} {{stitching}} may be wool, silk, cotton or combinations, such as wool-silk blend. Variety fibers {{may also be}} used, such as metallic cord, metallic braid, ribbon, or raffia. <b>Stitches</b> may be <b>plain,</b> covering just one thread intersection with a single orientation, or fancy, such as in bargello or other counted-thread <b>stitches.</b> <b>Plain</b> <b>stitches,</b> known as tent stitches, may be worked as basketweave, continental or half cross. Basketweave uses the most wool, but does not distort the rectangular mesh and makes for the best-wearing piece.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to clarify the relation between the grades of hand-sewing skills of university students and their experiences of clothing construction in previous schools. This study was composed of a questionnaire on the experiences of clothing construction, the scores of a practical examination on hand-sewing skills, and the scores of sewing skills learned under technical guidance. Research was conducted on 72 students, 33 men and 39 women, who were studying to obtain an elementary school teacherʼs license. The survey was conducted in October and November 2009. The following results were obtained : 1) Although most of the students had had experience of learning clothing construction in elementary school and junior high school, many of them had little experience of this at high school. Those who had sewing experience at home tended to be women rather than men. There {{was no significant difference in}} the contents of clothing construction between elementary school, junior high school, and high school. Therefore, pouches and aprons had been made regardless of the grade of school. 2) Comparing women and men on hand-sewing skills, women had significantly higher scores for the <b>plain</b> <b>stitch,</b> the half-back stitch, and the hem stitch, and no significant difference was found for the back stitch. 3) Furthermore, when hand-sewing skills were analyzed, it turned out that these were correlated to skill in the <b>plain</b> <b>stitch</b> and half-back stitch...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to clarify the level of university students' hand sewing skills and knowledge, and to examine the retention of the learning up to the high school. Moreover, teaching contents necessary for elementary school students to acquire hand sewing skills are also considered. This research was composed of a questionnaire on hand sewing knowledge, a questionnaire on the memory of courses and confidence in skills, a practical examination to evaluate hand sewing skills and a survey of the actual state of basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth. The research was conducted on 417 university students. 209 men and 208 women, the survey being conducted in June and December 2015. and in June and November 2016. The following results were obtained: 1) There were many items regarding which the students only half understood regarding hand sewing knowledge. The problem in the questionnaires was a low response rate and a low percentage of correct answers. 2) The evaluations for hand sewing skills were significantly higher for women than for men with ball knots, ball beads, <b>plain</b> <b>stitch,</b> half backstitch, and back stitches. Around 10 percent of all students could not sew a half backstitch, a backstitch or a hem stitch. 3) About half the students could not sew a straight stitch. Moreover, about half the students could not hold cloth suitably to perform a <b>plain</b> <b>stitch.</b> It was found that students who could hold cloth correctly were able to perform a straight stitch. 4) Furthermore, basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth were found {{to be related to the}} skill evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{structural}} {{analysis of sample}} knitted fabrics and the knit geometric theory, we have built an algorithm that can make three-dimensional structure models for weft knitted fabrics such as welt stitches, tuck stitches, cross stitches, rib stitches and purl stitches. In order to reduce computational complexity, we have set the anchoring point on the diametral plane of yarn in the knitting chart. Drawing from the beginning knitting point to the finished knitting point, a smooth knit curve model can be obtained with the cardinal spline curve. Using this algorithm, we have developed the weft knit three-dimensional structure modeling software that can display the three-dimensional model of knitted fabrics including welt stitches; tuck stitches, cross stitches, rib stitches and purl stitches. Our work confirms 3 -D modeling of three foundation knits of weft knit (<b>plain</b> <b>stitches,</b> purl stitches, rib stitches), tuck stitches, welt stitches and cross stitches with a commercially available PC. This software {{can be used by}} someone with no understanding of knitting to gain an understanding of the knitting process, and determine the structure of a knitted fabric product. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} properties of Milano rib knit fabric reinforced composites have been previously characterized [1 – 5]. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to theoretically pre-dict the stiffness and tensile strength of these composites. Attention has been focused on simplicity and user-friendliness. The complicated Milano rib knit fabric structure has been approximated by several simpler <b>plain</b> <b>stitches,</b> for which an analytical geometric model is applicable. After discretizing the representative volume element of the Milano fabric com-posite into sub-elements which contain only straight yarn segments, the overall stiffness and strength of the composite are obtained by assembling the contributions of a number of unidirectional fibrous composites. A recently developed micromechanics model, the bridging model [6], is applied to estimate the stiffness and strength of each unidirectional composite. The predicted stiffness and strength of the Milano fabric composites have been compared with the available experimental results. Reasonably good correlation has been found between the predictions and the experiments.

2500|$|The fabric {{produced}} using a {{knitting machine}} is {{of a more}} even texture than hand-knitted fabric, which is particularly noticeable on large areas of <b>plain</b> stockinette <b>stitch,</b> and can be an advantage. [...] Some stitch patterns (e.g., tuck stitches) are much easier to produce with a knitting machine. [...] Others (e.g. garter stitch) can also be produced with machine knitting but can take a little longer but still much faster than hand knitting. [...] The standard gauge 200-needle machine can knit the finest yarns up to a good sport-weight, while the heavier yarns knit better on a mid-gauge or bulky knitting machine.|$|R

40|$|The Indian folk arts with {{printing}} and embroidery play {{important role in}} creating new designs. Escalating demands of consumers requires modification in the fashion industry with respect to design, colour, style and technique. So {{an attempt was made}} to develop a design pool using folk art of Uttarakhand (aipan) for applique work. This also provides the opportunity to use the adapted traditional motifs on textiles and to preserve the beautiful traditional folk art. Aipan motifs were adapted for center design, border design, and buti design. Total thirty motifs / designs were developed keeping in mind their suitability for articles like bags, pencil purse and mobile holder. All the developed designs were subjected to visual evaluation for selection of two best designs in each category by the panel of thirty judges to find out the suitability of the developed designs for appliqué work. Thus total six motifs were selected for preparation of the five arrangements for each article. Four final selected arrangements with appliqué work were prepared using different embroidery stitches (slip hemming, couching, buttonhole and chain <b>stitch).</b> <b>Plain</b> red poplin and left-out fabrics were used to prepare articles.

40|$|Com o objetivo de comparar três técnicas de neuroanastomose, foram utilizados 54 ratos fêmeas, distribuídos em três grupos de 18 animais, cujos nervos ciáticos direitos foram transeccionados e, em seguida, tratados mediante o emprego das seguintes técnicas: três pontos de sutura epineural, um ponto de sutura epineural associado à bainha de BioFill® e um ponto de sutura epineural com cola de fibrina. A presença do {{material}} de sutura foi responsável pelo mau direcionamento das fibras nervosas e formação de neuroma na área da anastomose devido à colisão das fibras nervosas em regeneração com a reação granulomatosa ao fio de sutura. Alterações como degeneração Walleriana, formação de neuroma e proliferação de tecido fibroso foram observadas nos três tratamentos, sendo mais evidentes no grupo que recebeu três pontos de sutura epineural. Os resultados histológicos superiores obtidos com o emprego da bainha de BioFill® e da cola de fibrina comprovaram a eficiência dessas duas técnicas na reparação de nervos periféricos lesados. O uso da bainha de BioFill® oferece vantagens como disponibilidade, simplicidade técnica e baixo custo, tornando-a a melhor alternativa na reparação microcirúrgica do nervo periférico. Aiming {{to compare}} three neuroanastomosis techniques, 54 female rats {{were divided into}} three groups of 18 animals each. The right-side ciatic nerves of these animals were trans-sectioned and, immediately, treated {{by means of the}} following techniques: three <b>plain</b> epineural suture <b>stitches,</b> one epineural suture stitch together with a BioFill® sheath, and one perineural suture stitch with fibrine glue. Analysis of the results was based on histopathological aspects of the anastomotic area. It was noted that the presence of the suture material was responsible for the poor directioning of the nerve fibers and formation of a neurome in the anastomosis area, due to the collision of the regenerating nervous fibers with the granulomatous reaction to the suture string. Thus, changes such as Wallerian degeneration, formation of a neurome and proliferation of fibrous tissue were noticed in all three treatments, being more evident in the group that received three stitches of epineural suture. Based on histological results obtained from the use of the BioFill® sheath and the fibrine glue, the efficiency of these techniques for repairing damaged peripheral nerves was evident. However, the use of the BioFill® sheath ensures advantages such as availability, technical simplicity and low cost. Therefore, it becomes a better alternative for microsurgical repair of peripheral nerve...|$|R
