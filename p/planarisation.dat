In this paper, we present centrality-based <b>planarisation</b> algorithms with four variations: vertex addition, vertex deletion, edge addition and edge deletion. Our research is inspired by domain specific problem of drawing a social network in 2. 5 dimensions which emphasizes important actors by placing on the top layer. More specifically, we compare five different vertex (or edge) centralities in order to investigate the impact of different vertex (or edge) orderings on the resulting maximal induced planar subgraphs. We present extensive experimental results using both the standard Graph Drawing test suites and popular network models. We further extend our centrality-based <b>planarisation</b> algorithm to compute the thickness (both vertex thickness and edge thickness) of graphs. ...|$|E

For an Al-content of xAl= 0. 16, adequate for waveguide layers in 1. 55 mu m laser structures, a short processing time of 5 min already leads to high-quality regrowth. Regrowth of InP on wet and dry etched AlGaInAs DFB gratings results in smooth and planar surfaces, with the <b>planarisation</b> of the growth front occurring within a thickness of 200 nm.

The vertex deletion number of a graph G = (V,E) is the smallest integer k ? 0 such that there is an induced planar subgraph of G obtained by the removal of k vertices of G. Considering that the corresponding decision problem is NPcomplete and an approximation algorithm for graph <b>planarisation</b> by vertices deletion does not exist, this work proposes an evolutionary algorithm that uses a constructive heuristic algorithm to planarise a graph.

The APL is a stacked layer {{consisting of a}} Flowfill layer with excellent gap-fill properties in between a PECVD base and cap layer. The standard version of the material {{has been found to}} be a high quality silicon dioxide with properties comparable to thermal oxide.

This layer consists of a SiO 2 -network with methyl-groups incorporated. The C-concentration is found to be around 12 per cent. For low-k APL a standard oxide CMP process was not applicable. The removal rate is rather sensitive to the transition between cap and low-k Flowfill layer. In order to achieve a desired s electivity of 1 : 1 between cap and low-k Flowfill layer some modifications of the slurry chemistry are considered. The chemical attack of the Si-CH 3 bond and the hydrophobicity of the low-k Flowfill surface play a crucial role in the process mechanism...|$|E

We find that the Seebeck coefficient first slightly increases with the degree of order, but then again decreases for the most crystalline P 3 HT films.

Overall, the Seebeck coefficient varies between about 40 to 60 μV K - 1. In contrast, the electrical conductivity steadily increases with the degree of order, reaching a value of more than 10 S cm - 1, which we explain with the pronounced influence of the semi-crystalline nanostructure on the charge-carrier mobility.

40|$|Tensile {{strained}} Si on SiGe Strain Relaxed Buffers (SRB) is {{an interesting}} candidate to increase both electron and hole mobility which results in improved device performance. Most of this work was/is based on thick (several pm), step-graded SRBs with or without Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) <b>planarisation.</b> This approach bears several disadvantages such as issues with STI formation in the thick SiGe structure, and considerable self-heating effects due to the lower thermal conductivity of the SiGe material. Further, pMOS improvement requires SRBs with high Ge contents (> 30 %), which complicates device fabrication even more. To overcome these issues, we developed a new and cost efficient type of thin SRB (similar to 200 nm). The concept {{is based on the}} introduction of a thin carbon-containing layer during growth of a constant composition SiGe layer. The process relies on standard Chemical Vapor Deposition epitaxial technology without need for CMP. It is designed to allow both non-selective growth on blanket wafers and selective growth in the active area of structured wafers with Shallow Trench Isolation (STI). The selective epitaxial process for strained Si on thin SRBs proposed here, allows relatively simple and cost-effective fabrication of strained Si layers on existing STI structures without any process modification. Further, it offers a very flexible fabrication scheme to independently improve nMOS and pMOS devices.

40|$|The large-area, roll-to-roll (R 2 R) {{fabrication}} of organic thin-film circuits on plastic foils demands low-cost manufacturing and {{the integration of}} devices onto flexible plastic substrates. We have developed a fully dry process [1] to fabricate low-voltage organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) with 10 -nm thick dielectric amenable to R 2 R processing. Two commercially available polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic foils (DuPont Teijin [2]) were compared for use as possible flexible substrates. Teonex Q 65 FA features an adhesive layer on the bottom side to prevent its slippage during the R 2 R process, while Optfine PQA 1 includes a <b>planarisation</b> layer on the top (device) side. The PEN films were pre-annealed at 160 °C for 24 hours prior to OTFT fabrication. 160 °C is the maximum temperature used in our OTFT fabrication process and the pre-annealing should mitigate the layer-to-layer misalignment during the OTFT fabrication. Teonex Q 65 FA remained flat after the pre-annealing step, while the radius of curvature of Optfine PQA 1 changed from  17 cm to 1. 5 cm after the anneal. Consequently, we fabricated Al/AlOx/C 8 PA/DNTT/Au and Al/AlOx/DNTT/Au OTFTs on non-annealed Optfine and pre-annealed Teonex foils. Dinaphthothienothiophene (DNTT) was chosen due to its excellent air-stability {{and the addition of}} n-octylphosphonic acid (C 8 PA) improves its growth. 15 nm of DNTT was deposited at room temperature at rates of 0. 4 Å/s and 0. 6 Å/s on the Teonex and Optfine, respectively. The initial OTFT performance was evaluated by measuring the transfer characteristics between 0 and − 2 V and extracting the field-effect mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, etc. Bias stress was performed approximately one week after the initial measurements at a gate voltage of − 2 V while the source and drain were grounded. Referring to Table 1, one week of storage in vacuum between the initial and bias stress measurements, led to a reduction in OTFT threshold voltage and an increase in the mobility and the OFF-current. Figure 1 shows the as-fabricated OTFT parameters extracted from transfer characteristics measured at a drain voltage of − 2 V. For both PEN substrates tested, the inclusion of the C 8 PA monolayer increases field-effect mobility, ON-current and ON/OFF-current ratio and reduces subthreshold slope and OFF-current. The substrates affect OTFT performance in a mixed way. Comparing OTFTs with C 8 PA monolayer Teonex PEN has a slightly lower subthreshold slope and OFF-current than the Optfine PEN film. However, the Optfine film exhibits about a factor of three higher field-effect mobility (0. 14 cm 2 /Vs) and about an order of magnitude higher ON-current. The OTFTs on Optfine PEN substrate also appear to remain more stable after the application of bias stress in terms of mobility, even though their threshold voltage {{at the beginning of the}} bias stress was  − 0. 4 V lower than that of OTFTs fabricated on Teonex PEN. In conclusion, Teonex PEN was found to be easier to handle, since it remained flat upon heating at 160 °C. However, the AlOx/C 8 PA transistors exhibited about a factor of three lower field-effect mobility when compared to Optfine PEN OTFTs. The <b>planarisation</b> layer on Optfine PEN leads to improved OTFT mobility compared to Teonex PEN; however the Optfine PEN curved significantly upon heating and therefore presents a significant challenge if used as a free-standing substrate with our OTFT fabrication procedure...|$|E
40|$|Under certain {{conditions}} the conjugated polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) self-assembles into high-aspect-ratio nanostructures (known as nanofibres, nanowires, or nanoribbons) when cooled below its solubility limit in a marginal solvent such as anisole. Such nanostructures are potentially beneficial for organic photovoltaic device performance. In this work, Langevin dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model of P 3 HT in implicit anisole solvent {{are used to}} study the self-assembly of P 3 HT nanostructures for polymer chain lengths and concentrations used experimentally to prepare P 3 HT nanofibres. The coarse-grained model is parametrised to match the local structure and dynamics of an atomistic model with explicit solvent. Nanofibres are also prepared experimentally and characterised by atomic force microscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy. The simulations match the experimental phase behaviour of P 3 HT in anisole, showing aggregation of P 3 HT at 293 and 308 K but not at 323 or 353 K. Single-chain simulations at 293 K reveal two distinct nano-scale aggregate morphologies: hairpins and helices. Hairpin aggregates, which are the precursors of nanofibres, are slightly favoured energetically at 293 K for nuclei of the critical size of ≈ 80 monomers for aggregation. Consequently, chains in multi-chain aggregates adopt the hairpin morphology exclusively in simulations at experimental concentrations at 293 K. The simulated aggregate sizes match experimentally measured nanofibre widths. An estimate of the shift in UV-vis absorption of P 3 HT due to the change in conjugation length with aggregation in the simulations agrees reasonably well with experiment and shows {{that most of the}} spectral red shift that occurs with nanofibre formation is due to increased <b>planarisation</b> of the P 3 HT chains.

40|$|Polarised spectroscopic {{techniques}} {{were used to}} investigate the underlying physics of steady-state and ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation in conjugated polymers. Depolarisation is due to fluorescence anisotropy: the angular difference between the absorption and emission transition dipole moments of a molecule. Polarised spectroscopy results from a polymer with a flexible backbone, poly (9, 9 -di(ethylhexyl) fluorene) were compared with those from two rigid backbone polymers: methyl-substituted ladder-type poly (para-phenylene) and the newly synthesised naphthylene ladder-type polymer (2, 6 -NLP). This revealed {{that there is an}} intrinsic anisotropy directly associated with the molecular backbone. This work is the first reported on 2, 6 -NLP. Fluorescence anisotropy was shown to be dependent upon the conjugation length; the transition dipole moments show larger angles for short lengths, tending to a minimum as the length increases. For rigid-rod polymers, this behaviour is replicated at each vibronic position. In the flexible polymer, <b>planarisation</b> of the backbone elongates the excited state over more conjugated bonds, changing the angle between the transition dipole moments, whereas in rigid-rod polymers, such elongation can only be electronic. Linear dichroism results obtained for all the polymers has shown the angle between the absorption transition dipole moment and the molecular backbone is large and that the emission transition dipole moment is aligned with the backbone. “Off-chain” to “on-chain” transition dipole moments arise from transitions from localised to delocalised states suggesting that the excited state in conjugated polymers is delocalised. Time-dependent measurements show that the main fluorescence depolarisation mechanism occurs in under 5 ps for both flexible and rigid polymers. The ultrafast timescale and the similarity of the two systems requires the process to be electronic in origin and not linked to a physical deformation. This work proposes that ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation {{is a result of the}} delocalisation of the electronic state as the conjugation length extends over more of the polymer.

40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} {{the uses of}} {{fluorination}} {{in the context of}} π-conjugated polymers. Using extensively studied model systems such as poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and poly(2, 5 -bis(3 - alkylthiophen- 2 -yl) thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene) (PBTTT), we are able to probe the influence of thiophene fluorination on the electronic structure and thin-film morphology, two defining aspects of organic semiconductor performance in electronic devices such as organic field effect transistors (OFET). Experimental data obtained from Ultraviolet photoelectron, UV-Visible and Raman spectroscopy along with differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction suggest that fluorination leads to a stabilisation of the frontier molecular orbital levels and increased backbone planarity. The latter manifest itself as an enhanced propensity to aggregate and much higher melting point. Hole carrier mobilities in OFET devices are considerably enhanced in the backbone-fluorinated polymers, an observation attributed to the increased planarity of the polymer backbone. Computational calculations also predict an increased backbone rigidity and a strong preference for the coplanar arrangement of fluorinated thiophene rings. The origins of such <b>planarisation</b> are thought to be intramolecular in nature, likely from sulfur-fluorine inter-ring interactions as evidenced by S-F short contacts observed in the single crystal X-ray structure of a bithiophene monomer precursor. By synthesising well-defined diblock and alternating copolymers, backbone fluorination is then explored as a potential tool to control phase separation and dielectric constants, two key factors involved in the context of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The utility of fluorine atoms as a good leaving-group in nucleophilic aromatic displacements on electron-poor aromatic systems is then used to produce a P 3 HT derivative end-capped with pentafluorobenzene. This polymer can then be reacted with good nucleophiles in mild conditions. As a proof of concept, three functional moieties are tethered to the P 3 HT derivative in this manner, opening the door towards sensing applications and hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor interface engineering.

40|$|Anions {{have many}} {{important}} roles in biological systems, {{as well as in}} the environment and as such there is significant interest in their binding and sensing. In induced-fit anion sensing, the binding of an anion causes a shift in the equilibrium of conformers of the molecule, which in turn may lead to a change in a physical property. In this thesis four experimental chapters describe the synthesis and anion sensing properties of a series of induced-fit anion sensors derived from a hexa-substituted triethylbenzene and diphenylacetylene motif. Chapter one provides an introduction to anion recognition and sensing, whilst Chapter two describes a new synthetic method towards triethylbenzene receptors involving the solvent-drop grinding technique. Facile synthesis of known and novel anion receptors was achieved. Chapter three describes the use of the triethylbenzene motif, functionalised with quinolinium groups to sense anions. The receptor binds anions strongly, with complex binding observed, involving a host dimer, 2 : 1 host:guest and 1 : 1 host:guest stoichiometries. The receptor functions as a turn-off fluorescence sensor with selectivity for acetate. Chapter four describes the further functionalisation of the triethylbenzene core with the viologen moiety, leading to a series of tri- and tetrapodal anion receptors. These receptors show a colourimetic response to carboxylates through a charge transfer interaction. These receptors bind several different anions strongly. However a colourimetric response is only observed with carboxylates. Chapter five describes the use of diphenylacetylene derivatives functionalised with urea groups which have also been investigated as induced-fit anion sensors. The receptors show a high degree of preorganisation, except for free rotation around the acetylene bond. The receptors bind a range of anions to varying extents, with strong binding observed with basic anions. Upon the addition of anions, several different fluorescent responses are observed depending on the receptor design. A turn-on fluorescent response is observed with diphenylacetylene and diphenylbutadiyne derivates due to <b>planarisation</b> of the receptor. Fluorescent quenching is also observed with several receptors and can allow for the discrimination of several anions when the receptors are used as part of an array. The diphenylbutadiyne derivative can also be incorporated into a dipstick which shows a turn-off response in the presence of chloride. ...|$|E

With {{the emergence of the}} Internet of Things (IoT), wireless body area networks (WBANs) are becoming increasingly pervasive in everyday life. Most WBANs are currently working at the IEEE 802. 15. 4 Zigbee standard. However there are growing interests to investigate the performance of BANs operating at higher frequencies (e. g. millimetre-wave band), due to the advantages offered compared to those operating at lower microwave frequencies. This thesis aims to realise printed conductive traces on flexible substrates, targeted for high frequency wearable electronics applications. Specifically, investigations were performed in the areas pertaining to the surface modification of substrates and the electrical performance of printed interconnects. Firstly, a novel methodology was proposed to characterise the dielectric properties of a non-woven fabric (Tyvek) up to 20 GHz. This approach utilised electromagnetic (EM) simulation to improve the analytical equations based on transmission line structures, in order to improve the accuracy of the conductor loss values in the gigahertz range. To reduce the substrate roughness, an UV-curable insulator was used to form a <b>planarisation</b> layer on a non-porous substrate via inkjet printing. The results obtained demonstrated the importance of matching the surface energy of the substrate to the ink to minimise the ink de-wetting phenomenon, which was possible within the parameters of heating the platen. Furthermore, the substrate surface roughness was observed to affect the printed line width significantly, and a surface roughness factor was introduced in the equation of Smith et al. to predict the printed line width on a substrate with non-negligible surface roughness (Ra ≤ 1 µm). Silver ink de-wetting was observed when overprinting silver onto the UV-cured insulator, and studies were performed to investigate the conditions for achieving electrically conductive traces using commercial ink formulations, where the curing equipment may be non-optimal. In particular, different techniques were used to characterise the samples at different stages in order to evaluate the surface properties and printability, and to ascertain if measurable resistances could be predicted. Following the results obtained, it was demonstrated that measurable resistance could be obtained for samples cured under an ambient atmosphere, which was verified on Tyvek samples. Lastly, a methodology was proposed to model for the non-ideal characteristics of printed transmission lines to predict the high frequency electrical performance of those structures. The methodology was validated on transmission line structures of different lengths up to 30 GHz, where a good correlation was obtained between simulation and measurement results. Furthermore, the results obtained demonstrate the significance of the paste levelling effect on the extracted DC conductivity values, and the need for accurate DC conductivity values in the modelling of printed interconnects...|$|E
40|$|A {{fluorescent}} {{solar collector}} (FSC) is an optoelectronic waveguide device that can concentrate both diffuse and direct sunlight onto a solar cell {{which is then}} converted to electricity. Fluorescent collectors offer the potential {{to reduce the cost}} of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, but so far their effectiveness has been demonstrated only theoretically. The major problems in the device obtaining high practical efficiency are photon transport losses and material instability. This aim of this research is to increase the fundamental understanding of photon transport losses in fluorescent collectors, and to explore the method in overcoming the losses in fluorescent solar collectors. This thesis presents the theoretical and experimental results obtained during the development and characterisation of fluorescent collectors, a thin film c-Si solar cell used to detect photons from the fluorescent solar collector. A method for preparing fluorescent collector plates was by spin-coating dye-doped PMMA (Polymethylmethacrylate) on glass slides (BK 7 glass). An optical characterisation technique for determining reabsorption loss of the fluorescent collectors was developed and used to evaluate the performance of the fluorescent collector base on laser dyes. The validity of this approach was verified by comparing the results with theoretical solutions, derived using a model adapted from the Weber and Lambe, and the modified Weber and Lambe, theories. Different losses in the FSC are studied in this work and we investigate the effect of surface scattering in a realistic FSC. To characterise the photon transport inside the collector, we monitor the angular distribution of a collimated light beam, which enters the collector from the edge, after propagation and total internal reflection. We find that the surface scattering process is described well by Fraunhofer diffraction at surface inhomogeneities of a size, roughly 11 ?m. The major losses in FSC are found to be caused by the surface roughness, which increases the probability of the escape cone losses in FSC from the top surface. This loss can be suppressed to less than 2 % using an index matching <b>planarisation</b> layer. The influence of the bulk and surface scattering on the performance of the FSC are presented in this work, which were compared with the experiment and theory. The angular dependence of the edge fluorescence was studied in this work, and it showed the edge fluorescence decreases by increasing the detection angle, and the value of reabsorption also decreases by increasing the detection angle, up to 20 °, before increasing again. It was shown, also, that that the quasi blackbody function agrees well with angular dependence of the edge fluorescence spectral, divided by the cos(detection angle) region where the absorption and fluorescence band of the dye overlap. Also, the modified Weber and Lambe theory for the angular dependence of the fluorescence agreed well with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Das Ad-hoc Mobile Robotic Network (AMRoNet) besteht aus einer großen Ansammlung beweglicher Roboter, die ein drahtloses Netzwerk für gemeinsame Aufgabenerfüllung schaffen. Die Selbstorganisierung ist ein Schlüsselelement, sodass AMRoNets für viele Anwendungsszenarien wie das Aufspüren und Kontrollieren und in Such-und Rettungseinsätzen in Städten in Frage kommt. Selbstorganisation, Selbstkorrektur und Selbstoptimierung sind Schlüsselkennzeichen der sich selbst organisierenden Netzwerke. In AMRoNets, wird die Selbstkonfiguration durch Selbstentfaltung erzielt. Diese ermöglicht es den Schwingungsknoten, von einer relativ geschlossenen Anfangskonfiguration ausgehend, sich in einem Gebiet auszubreiten, wobei unter Benutzung einfacher lokaler Regeln die Reichweite und die Netzwerkverbindung maximiert wird. Selbstkorrigierende Mechanismen ermöglichen eine automatische Neukonfiguration des Netzwerks im Falle von Fehlschlägen. Wir betrachten ein Sensing und ein Communication range-basiert Coverage Maximierungsprobleme. Für das Erstere führen wir einen neuen swarm-based Algorithmus und das Letztere einen greedy {{deployment}} Algorithmus ein. Die Selbstoptimierungsfähigkeit ermöglicht dem Netzwerk, sich regelmäßig anzupassen und sich erfolgreich in weiträumigen Netzwerken auszubreiten. Wir konzentrieren uns auf den Routing der sich selbst optimierenden Netzwerke. Geographic routing ist ein vielversprechender Ansatz für das AMRoNet routing. Das ständige Versagen im Bereich des Geographic routing findet hauptsächlich wegen <b>planarisation</b> Irrtümern ein. Um dieses Problem in den Griff zu bekommen, schlagen wir einen neuen localized planarization Algorithmus vor, der auf einem topological cluster-based overlay graph Konstruktion basiert. Ad-hoc Mobile Robotic Network (AMRoNet) {{consists of}} a large collection of mobile robots which creates a wireless network for collaborative and co-operative task accomplishment. Self-organization is a key feature that makes AMRoNets adaptive and useful in many application scenarios such as sensing and monitoring and urban search and rescue. Self-configuration, self-healing and self-optimization are three key features of self-organizing networks. In AMRoNets, self-configuration is achieved through self-deployment which enables the nodes to start from a relatively compact initial configuration and spread out in an area, maximizing the coverage and keeping the network connectivity, using simple local rules. Self-healing mechanisms allow automatic reconfiguration of the network in case of failures. We consider a sensing range-based and a communication range-based coverage maximization problems. For the former, we introduce a new swarm-based algorithm which outperforms most prominent state-of-the-art algorithms and for the latter, a greedy deployment algorithm achieving near optimal performance. Self-optimization capability enables the network to adjust regularly and route efficiently in large-scale networks. We concentrate on the routing aspect of the self-optimizing networks. Geographic routing is a promising approach for AMRoNet routing, but challenges in real wireless networks such as irregular radio ranges and imprecise location information makes it impractical in AMRoNets. The persistent failures in Geographic routing occur mainly due to planarization errors. To solve them, we propose a new localized planarization algorithm based on a topological cluster-based overlay graph construction, which uses an explicit planarization technique for planarizing overlay graphs. Empirical analysis shows this approach is location fault tolerant and produces planar graphs in all our realistic wireless network simulations.

40|$|Semiconductor {{wafer bonding}} {{has been a}} subject of interestfor many years and {{a wide variety of}} wafer bonding techniqueshave been {{reported}} in literature. In adhesive wafer bondingorganic and inorganic adhesives are used as intermediatebonding material. The main advantages of adhesive wafer bondingare the relatively low bonding temperatures, the lack of needfor an electric voltage or current, the compatibility withstandard CMOS wafers and the ability to join practically anykind of wafer materials. Adhesive wafer bonding requires nospecial wafer surface treatmentssuch as <b>planarisation.</b> Structures and particles at the wafer surfaces can be toleratedand compensated for some extent by the adhesive material. Adhesive wafer bonding is a comparably simple, robust andlowcost bonding process. In this thesis, adhesive wafer bondingtechniques with different polymer adhesives have beendeveloped. The relevant bonding parameters needed to achievehigh quality and high yield wafer bonds have been investigated. A selective adhesive wafer bonding process has also beendeveloped that allows localised bonding on lithographicallydefined wafer areas. Adhesive wafer bonding has been utilised in variousapplication areas. A novel CMOS compatible film, device andmembrane transfer bonding technique has been developed. Thistechnique allows the integration of standard CMOS circuits withthin film transducers that can consist of practically any typeof crystalline or noncrystalline high performance material(e. g. monocrystalline silicon, gallium arsenide,indium-phosphide, etc.). The transferred transducers or filmscan be thinner than 0. 3 µm. The feature sizes of thetransferred transducers can be below 1. 5 µm and theelectrical via contacts between the transducers and the newsubstrate wafer can be as small as 3 x 3 µm 2. Teststructures for temperature coefficient of resistancemeasurements of semiconductor materials have been fabricatedusing device transfer bonding. Arrays of polycrystallinesilicon bolometers for use in uncooled infrared focal planearrays have been fabricated using membrane transfer bonding. The bolometers consist of free-hanging membrane structures thatare thermally isolated from the substrate wafer. Thepolycrystalline silicon bolometers are fabricated on asacrificial substrate wafer. Subsequently, they are transferredand integrated on a new substrate wafer using membrane transferbonding. With the same membrane transfer bonding technique,arrays of torsional monocrystalline silicon micromirrors havebeen fabricated. The mirrors have a size of 16 x 16 µm 2 anda thickness of 0. 34 µm. The advantages of micromirrorsmade of monocrystalline silicon are their flatness, uniformityand mechanical stability. Selective adhesive wafer bonding hasbeen used to fabricate very shallow cavities that can beutilised in packaging and component protection applications. Anew concept is proposed that allows hermetic sealing ofcavities fabricated using adhesive wafer bonding. Furthermore,microfluidic devices, channels and passive valves for use inmicro total analysis systems are presented. Adhesive wafer bonding is a generic CMOS compatible bondingtechnique {{that can be used for}} fabrication and integration ofvarious microsystems such as infrared focal plane arrays,spatial light modulators, microoptical systems, laser systems,MEMS, RF-MEMS and stacking of active electronic films forthree-dimensional high-density integration of electroniccircuits.

40|$|The use of Mid-infrared (mid-IR) imagers {{has great}} {{potential}} {{for a number of}} applications in gas sensing and medical diagnostics, but so far for many of those non-defence fields it has been significantly limited by their high price tag. One of the reasons behind the great cost of mid-IR imagers is that most of them need to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Thanks to {{more than half a century}} of research, state-of-the-art mid-IR photodetectors have finally achieved premium detection performance without the need for cryogenic cooling. Some of them have even demonstrated very promising results, suggesting room temperature operation is on the horizon. As a result, the cost associated with cooling equipment has been significantly suppressed. However, most mid-IR imagers are still based on hybrid technologies needing a great number of die-level process steps and being prone to connection failure during thermal cycles. The high manufacturing cost this entails is also preventing a wider diffusion of mid-IR imagers. Currently, there is still a lack of an effective monolithic approach able to achieve low-cost mass production of mid-IR imagers in the same way as monolithic integration has been widely used for imagers working at visible wavelengths. This thesis presents a novel monolithic approach for making mid-IR imagers based on co-integration of mid-IR photodetectors with GaAs-based MESFETs on the same chip. The initial focus of the project was the development of the fabrication steps for delivery of prototype devices. In order to achieve monolithic fabrication of pixel devices made in either indium antimonide (InSb) or indium arsenide antimonide (InAsSb) on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate, various highly controllable etch processes, both wet and dry etch based, were established for distinct material layers. Moreover, low temperature annealed Ohmic contacts to both antimonide-based materials and GaAs were used. The processing temperatures used never exceeded 180 ˚C, preventing degradation of photodetector performance after fabrication of transistors, thus avoiding well-known thermal issues of InSb fabrication. Furthermore, an intermediate step based on polyimide was developed to provide a smoothing section between the lower MESFET and upper photodetector regions of the pixel device. The polyimide <b>planarisation</b> enabled metal interconnects between the fabricated devices regardless of the considerable etch step (> 6 µm) created after multiple mesa etches. Detailed electrical and optical measurements demonstrated that the devices were sensitive to mid-IR radiation in the 3 to 5 µm range at room temperature, and that each pixel could be isolated from its contacts by switching off the co-integrated MESFET. Following the newly developed fabrication flow, InSb-based mid-IR imaging arrays (in two sizes, 4 × 4 and 8 × 8) are presented here for the first time, with pixel addressing achieved by monolithically integrated GaAs MESFETs. By demonstrating real-time imaging results obtained from these array devices at room temperature, implementation of a new type of monolithic focal plane array for mid-IR imaging has been confirmed. The device is suitable for further scaling (up to 64 × 64 pixel and beyond) and potential commercialisation. More importantly, the monolithic approach developed in this work is very flexible, as a number of III-V materials with mid-IR detecting capabilities can be grown on GaAs substrates, meaning alternative semiconductor layer structures could also be investigated in the near future...|$|E
40|$|The region {{between the}} {{infrared}} and microwave {{region in the}} electromagnetic spectrum, the Terahertz (THz) gap, provides an exciting opportunity for future wireless communications as this band has been under utilised. This doctoral work takes a two-pronged approach into closing the THz gap with low-dimensional materials. The first attempt addresses {{the need for a}} compact THz source that can operate at room temperature. The second approach addresses the need to build optical elements such as filters and modulators in the THz spectrum. Terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz QCLs) {{are one of the most}} compact, powerful sources of coherent radiation that bridge the terahertz gap. However, their cryogenic requirements for operation limit the scope of the applications. This is because of the electron-electron scattering and heating of the 2 -dimensional free electron gas which leads to significant optical phonon scattering of the hot electrons. Theoretical studies in laterally confined QCL structures have predicted enhanced lifetime of the upper state through suppression of the non-radiative intersubband relaxation of carriers, which leads to lower threshold, and higher temperature performance. Lithographically defined vertical nanopillar arrays with electrostatic radius less than tens of nm offer a possible route to achieve lateral confinement, which can be integrated into QCL structures. A typical gain medium in a QCL consists of at least 100 repeat periods, with a thickness of 6 - 14 micron. For practical implementation of the top-down approach, restrictions are imposed by aspect ratios that can be achieved in present dry-etching systems. Typically, for sub- 200 nm radius pillars, the thickness ranges from 1 - 3. 5 micron. It is therefore necessary to work with THz QCLs based on 3 - 4 quantum well active regions, so as to maximise the number of repeat periods (hence gain) within an ultra-thin active region. After an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 presents a theoretical treatise on the realistic electrostatic potential in a lithographically defined nanopillar by scaling from a single quantum well (resonant tunnelling diode) to a THz QCL. Chapter 2 also discusses, the effect of lateral confinement on the intersubband states and the plasmonic mode in a THz QCL. One of the key experimental challenges in scaling down from QCLs to quantum-dot cascade lasers is the electrical injection into the nanopillars. This involves insulation and <b>planarisation</b> of the high aspect-ratio nanopillar arrays. Furthermore, the choice of the planarising layer is critical since it determines the loss of any optical mode. This experimental challenge is solved in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents the electro-optic performance of low-repeat period QCLs with an active region thickness that is less than 3. 5 micron. Another topic of recent interest in the THz optics community is plasmonics in graphene. This is because the bound electromagnetic modes (plasmons) are tightly confined to the surface and can also be tuned with carrier concentration. Plasmonic resonance at terahertz frequencies can be achieved by gating graphene grown via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) to a high carrier concentration. THz time domain spectroscopy of such gated monolayer graphene shows resonance features around 1. 6 THz superimposed on the Drude-like frequency response of graphene which may be related to the inherent poly-crystallinity of CVD graphene. Chapter 5 discusses these results, as an understanding of these features is necessary for the development of future THz optical elements based on CVD graphene. Chapter 5 finally describes how the gate tunability of THz transmission through graphene can be exploited to indirectly modulate a THz QCL. Chapter 6 presents ideas from this doctoral work, which can be developed in future to address the issues of enhanced temperature performance of THz QCLs and to realise realistic THz devices based on graphene...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} advantages and applications of Silicon Photonics (SiP) has initiated substantial research efforts. Silicon photonics has been favourably nominated {{to replace the}} current copper interconnects due to their high bandwidth, small footprint, and potentially low power consumption. However, {{the majority of the}} research into silicon photonics has been based on the silicon-on insulator (SOI) platform. The focus on the SOI platform has limited the design of silicon photonic devices to two-dimensional (2 D) structures. Moreover, the fabrication of optical active devices based on silicon photonics has relied on high temperature processing that is not compatible with CMOS back-end integration. New materials that are depositable at low temperatures can offer new possibilities for multi-layered, CMOS back-end compatible, and low optical loss silicon photonic devices. In this project, zinc oxide (ZnO) was investigated as a potential low temperature material whose fabrication is compatible with CMOS technology. Specifically, the naturally n-type doped ZnO can potentially form a heterojunction with p-type silicon without the need for high temperature processing. Poly-silicon is also a depositable and CMOS compatible material that can potentially form future multi-layered silicon photonic structures. However, low optical loss in poly-silicon has been based on high-temperature processing to improve the crystallinity and roughness of the deposited material. The deposition of poly-silicon in the SiP technology have been mainly carried out using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and other deposition techniques remain under investigated. In this project, ZnO was, for the first time, deposited at low-temperature (150 ?C) using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on a silicon waveguide to form a heterojunction diode capable of producing optical switching in the silicon core. Optical switching in the n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction was caused by the plasma dispersion effect. The design of the optical switch comprised a straight silicon waveguide (width = 1000 nm, height = 220 nm, slabheight = 60 nm) partially covered with a thin ZnO film (thickness = 10 nm). The commonly used highly doped p+ region {{were not included in the}} devices because of the high thermal budget (T ' 900 ?C) needed to activate the dopant. Moreover, the aluminium (Al) metal contacts were not annealed because the annealing temperature (Ts = 425 ?C) exceeds the high-temperature threshold (Ts = 400 ?C). An extinction ratio of ~ 10 dB was achieved for a 1 mm long device at 20 V forward-bias. This result can be expressed as a figure of merit of 5 dB/cm. V. The insertion loss of the device was estimated to be ~ 1 : 2 dB. The maximum switching speed of the devices was found to be ~ 1 MHz. Al-though this performance is inferior to the state-of-the-art silicon optical switches, it offers the first silicon-based electro-optical switch fabricated at low-temperatures with low insertion loss. Detailed analysis of the I-V and switching characteristics of the device revealed large series resistance and capacitance. It was also found that the switching speed is primarily governed by the RC time constant of the device rather than the minority carrier lifetime. This fact has led us to believe that the device functions as both injection and accumulation electro-absorption switch. A thin SiO 2 layer is suspected to form at the ZnO/Si interface that facilitates the accumulation operation of the device and increases the RC time constant. The first low loss and low-temperature poly-silicon waveguides are demonstrated in this project. Hot-wire chemical vapour deposition (HWCVD) was used to deposit poly-silicon films at 240 ?C. The propagation loss of the TE mode for a 600 by 220 nm waveguide was 13 : 5 dB/cm. Detailed simulation analysis revealed that at least 60 % of the loss was caused by the roughness of the top surface of the waveguides. The RMS roughness was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and was found to be 8 : 9 nm. Optimisation of the design, the deposition process, and the reduction of the top surface roughness, through surface <b>planarisation,</b> led to a reduction in the propagation loss of the TE mode to ~ 8 : 5 dB/cm while still maintaining low deposition temperature of 360 ?C. The crystal volume fraction of the optimised poly-silicon film was found to be ~ 96 %. An electro-optical switch based on ZnO and poly-silicon heterojunction was fabricated on a multi-layered poly silicon structure. However, there were problems with the metal contact pads as well as the thickness of the first poly-silicon layer. Future work will focus on improving the n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction electro-optical performance by adapting an accumulation type structure as well as optimising the multi-layered poly-silicon platform. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{density of}} electronics within {{portable electronic devices}} provides the motivation to develop more compact power electronics, such as DC-DC converters. Typically, integrated circuits and each passive component, such as inductors, are discreetly packaged and mounted on printed circuit board (PCB), to implement the converter. Hence for further size reduction there has been growing interest for integration schemes such as Power supply in package (PwrSiP). However, {{the ultimate goal is}} the monolithic integration of the power supply solution, in an integration scheme known as Power Supply on Chip (PwrSoC). The economic effectiveness of the converter will be determined by the device footprint and number of processing steps required to fabricate the inductor. Hence, the motivation behind this thesis is the need for microinductors with large inductance density (inductance per device footprint) while maintaining low losses, which can be integrated with silicon IC. Furthermore, the need for thick layers will result in issues with yield and reliability of the fabricated device. Hence {{there is a need to}} identify, characterise and integrate materials with low residual stress into the microinductor fabrication process. A typical choice of inter-coil dielectric is the photo-definable epoxy SU- 8. However, SU- 8 suffers from intrinsic issues with high residual stress and adhesion. One possible replacement for SU- 8 as a structural and dielectric layer is Parylene-C. The first objective of this thesis proposes a test-bed inductor process, which incorporates Parylene as a structural and dielectric layer and has a short turnaround time of one week. This fabrication process involves the filling of high aspect ratio gaps between copper structures with Parylene and subsequent chemical mechanical <b>planarisation,</b> and a test chip has been designed to characterise these processes. Additionally, Scotch-tape testing has been used to confirm suitable Parylene adhesion to patterned and unpatterned films used in this process. Subsequently, complete microinductors, with magnetic cores, have been fabricated, characterised and benchmarked against other inductor technologies and architectures reported in the literature. Parylene is expected to produce films with low residual stress due to its room temperature deposition process. However, the test-bed inductor process requires thermal treatments up to 140 °C. Hence it was necessary to characterise the stress in Parylene films as a result of processing temperature and compare this to stress levels in SU- 8 5 and 3005 films. This study has determined the spatial variation of residual stress in Parylene-C and SU- 8 films, by combining automated measurements of strain indicator test structures and local nanoindentation measurements of Young’s modulus. These measurements have been used to wafer map strain, Young’s modulus, and subsequently residual stress in these films, as a result of processing parameter variation. It is well known that placing ferromagnetic material in close proximity to current carrying coils can further enhance the measured inductance value. However, the conductive magnetic core is also a source of loss for the microinductor. Hence, magnetic permeability, electrical resistivity and mechanical stress in the magnetic core influence the inductance value, eddy current losses and reliability of the fabricated microinductor, respectively. The ability to characterise these properties on wafer is essential for process control and verification measurements. This thesis details a test chip capable of routine measurements on NiFe films to characterise the spatial variation of these properties. Furthermore, wafer mapping measurements are reported to identify the correlation between high frequency permeability, electrical resistivity, mechanical strain and the chemical composition of two-component Permalloy film (NixFe(100 -x)) electroplated on the surface of 100 mm silicon wafers. Finally, MEMS-based inductor fabrication processes typically require a number of electrodeposition steps, which require conductive seed layers for the deposition of the coils and magnetic core material. A typical choice of seed layer is copper. However, due to copper’s paramagnetic behaviour (μ = 1) and low electrical resistivity (ρ= 6. 69 μΩ. cm) this layer contributes to eddy current losses, while acting as a thin ‘screening layer’. It is very likely that using a magnetic seed layer, within the magnetic core, will noticeably reduce eddy current related losses. However, detailed systematic experimental studies on any such improvement have not been documented in the literature. This study involves compositional, structural, electrical and magnetic characterisation of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on non-magnetic and magnetic seed layers (i. e. copper and nickel respectively). Mechanical strain test structures and X-ray analysis have been used to characterise the stress levels and structural properties of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on both copper and nickel seed layers. In addition, planar spiral micro-inductors, both with and without patterned magnetic cores, have been fabricated to determine the effect of patterning on their performance. This is in addition to quantifying the improvement in the electrical performance resulting from the enhanced magnetic and resistive contribution provided by magnetic seed layers...|$|E
40|$|Cerium dioxide (ceria) {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} the subject of intense academic and industrial interest. Ceria has a host of applications but academic interest largely stems from their use in the modern automotive catalyst but it is also of interest because of many other application areas notably as the abrasive in chemical-mechanical <b>planarisation</b> of silicon substrates. Recently, ceria has been the focus of research investigating health effects of nanoparticles. Importantly, the role of non-stoichiometry in ceria nanoparticles is implicated in their biochemistry. Ceria has well understood non-stoichiometry based around the ease of formation of anion vacancies and these can form ordered superstructures based around the fluorite lattice structure exhibited by ceria. The anion vacancies are associated with localised or small polaron states formed by the electrons that remain after oxygen desorption. In simple terms these electrons combine with Ce 4 + states to form Ce 3 + states whose larger ionic radii is associated with a lattice expansion compared to stoichiometric CeO 2. This is a very simplistic explanation and greater defect chemistry complexity is suggested by more recent work. Various authors have shown that vacancies are mobile and may result in vacancy clustering. Ceria nanoparticles are of particular interest because of the high activity and surface area of small particulates. The sensitivity of the cerium electronic band structure to environment would suggest that changes in the properties of ceria particles at nanoscale dimensions might be expected. Notably many authors report a lattice expansion with reducing particle size (largely confined to sub- 10 nm particles). Most authors assign increased lattice dimensions to the presence of a surface stable Ce 2 O 3 type layer at low nanoparticle dimensions. However, our understanding of oxide nanoparticles is limited and their full and quantitative characterisation offers serious challenges. In a series of chemical preparations by ourselves we see little evidence of a consistent model emerging to explain lattice parameter changes with nanoparticle size. Based on these results and a review of the literature it is worthwhile asking if a model of surface enhanced defect concentration is consistent with known cerium/cerium oxide chemistries, whether this is applicable to a range of different synthesis methods and if a more consistent description is possible. In Chapter one the science of cerium oxide is outlined including the crystal structure, defect chemistry and different oxidation states available. The uses and applications of cerium oxide are also discussed as well as modelling of the lattice parameter and the doping of the ceria lattice. Chapter two describes both the synthesis techniques and the analytical methods employed to execute this research. Chapter three focuses on high surface area ceria nano-particles and how these have been prepared using a citrate sol-gel precipitation method. Changes to the particle size have been made by calcining the ceria powders at different temperatures. X-ray diffraction methods were used to determine their lattice parameters. The particles sizes were also assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and BET, and, the lattice parameter was found to decrease with decreasing particle size. The results are discussed in light of the role played by surface tension effects. Chapter four describes the morphological and structural characterization of crystalline CeO 2 nanoparticles prepared by forward and reverse precipitation techniques and compares these by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), nitrogen adsorption (BET) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. The two routes give quite different materials although in both cases the products are essentially highly crystalline, dense particulates. It was found that the reverse precipitation technique gave the smallest crystallites with the narrowest size dispersion. This route also gave as-synthesised materials with higher surface areas. HRTEM confirmed the observations made from PXRD data and showed that the two methods resulted in quite different morphologies and surface chemistries. The forward route gives products with significantly greater densities of Ce 3 + species compared to the reverse route. Data are explained using known precipitation chemistry and kinetic effects. Chapter five centres on the addition of terbia to ceria and has been investigated using XRD, XRF, XPS and TEM. Good solid solutions were formed across the entire composition range and there was no evidence for the formation of mixed phases or surface segregation over either the composition or temperature range investigated. Both Tb 3 + and Tb 4 + ions exist within the solution and the ratios of these cations are consistent with the addition of Tb 8 O 15 to the fluorite ceria structure across a wide range of compositions. Local regions of anion vacancy ordering may be visible for small crystallites. There is no evidence of significant Ce 3 + ion concentrations formed at the surface or in the bulk by the addition of terbia. The lattice parameter of these materials was seen to decrease with decreasing crystallite size. This is consistent with increased surface tension effects at small dimension. Chapter six reviews size related lattice parameter changes and surface defects in ceria nanocrystals. Ceria (CeO 2) has many important applications, notably in catalysis. Many of its uses rely on generating nanodimensioned particles. Ceria has important redox chemistry where Ce 4 + cations can be reversibly reduced to Ce 3 + cations and associated anion vacancies. The significantly larger size of Ce 3 + (compared with Ce 4 +) has been shown to result in lattice expansion. Many authors have observed lattice expansion in nanodimensioned crystals (nanocrystals), and these have been attributed to the presence of stabilized Ce 3 + -anion vacancy combinations in these systems. Experimental results presented here show (i) that significant, but complex changes in the lattice parameter with size can occur in 2 - 500 nm crystallites, (ii) that there is a definitive relationship between defect chemistry and the lattice parameter in ceria nanocrystals, and (iii) that the stabilizing mechanism for the Ce 3 + -anion vacancy defects at the surface of ceria nanocrystals is determined by the size, the surface status, and the analysis conditions. In this work, both lattice expansion and a more unusual lattice contraction in ultrafine nanocrystals are observed. The lattice deformations seen can be defined as a function of both the anion vacancy (hydroxyl) concentration in the nanocrystal and the intensity of the additional pressure imposed by the surface tension on the crystal. The expansion of lattice parameters in ceria nanocrystals is attributed to a number of factors, most notably, the presence of any hydroxyl moieties in the materials. Thus, a very careful understanding of the synthesis combined with characterization is required to understand the surface chemistry of ceria nanocrystals...|$|E
