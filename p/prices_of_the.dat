5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E

5|$|After {{sufficiently}} {{upgrading the}} ship and exploring the map, the player is allowed to buy the three powerful artifacts, which then spawn at random ports. Defeating the Ancient Guardian in a card minigame awards the player additional loot and previously unavailable upgrades. Ancient Trader does not include a saving feature, which means that all progress is lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase the artifacts, and defeat the Guardian. The <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artifacts increase as other players buy them. The players can check the wealth and artifacts gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were African American.

Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, however, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labor.|$|E

25|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} in Brazil early in the eighteenth century, but initially it was planted only for domestic use. It took the high world <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1820s and early 1830s to turn coffee into a major export item. During the initial phase, production was concentrated in the mountainous region near Rio de Janeiro. This area was highly suitable for coffee cultivation, and it had access to fairly abundant slave labor. Moreover, the coffee could be transported easily on mule trains or on animal-drawn carts over short distances to the ports.|$|E
30|$|In {{this paper}} {{we can find}} that the higher the {{frequency}} ρ is, <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> default-free zero-coupon bond is (see Fig.  1 (a)).

Similarly, the bigger <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive jump is, the less attractive purchasing a default-free zero-coupon bond is.
