Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive-equation mesoscale models as well. The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations, which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods, {{with the exception of a}} few idealized cases. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions. Different models use different solution methods: some global models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods for the vertical dimension, while regional models and other global models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question regarding {{the dynamics of}} mantle convection is whether some intraplate volcanic centers, known as “hotspots, ” are the surface manifestations of hot, narrow, thermally driven upwellings, or plumes, rising from the lower mantle. Shown here is a global negative correlation between {{the thickness of the}} mantle transition zone (near 410 – 660 km depth) and petrologically determined <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> of mid-ocean ridge and hotspot magmas. Hotspot <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> are systematically higher than those for mid-ocean ridges, and the transition zone thicknesses beneath these hotspots are thinner. Thus, the majority of oceanic intraplate magmatic centers are associated with deep-seated thermal anomalies, suggesting that such magmatism is probably associated with thermal plumes. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of mantle rocks {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature, {{and has been}} shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the modelled thermal structure of cooling oceanic plates. This dissertation models temperatures in subducting slabs, taking into account the temperature-dependence of the relevant physical parameters, and investigates the maximum <b>temperatures,</b> <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and homologous temperatures up to which intraslab earthquakes occur. An analysis of the world’s subduction zones reveals that intraslab seismicity is consistent with being limited to material having <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> less than 600 °C. Apparent exceptions to this pattern occur in regions where the Nazca Plate subducts subhorizontally beneath South America, with which the final study in this dissertation is concerned. The unusual subduction geometry in the Peruvian and Pampean segments of the South American subduction zone keeps the overriding plate and the subhorizontal subducting slab in contact for several hundreds of km. Thermal modelling including this unusual geometry shows the subducting slab to be relatively cold in these regions, as compared with typical subduction zones where more immediate contact with the mantle wedge results in a hotter slab temperature structure. In the Peruvian and Pampean regions, intraslab seismicity is found to occur at <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> less than 600 °C. Furthermore, the continental mantle above the slab is shown to be cold enough to generate earthquakes. Teleseismic waveform-modelling is used to constrain 39 earthquake focal depths, and confirms that the continental mantle of Peru is indeed seismogenic.

40|$|The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model’s {{ability to}} {{forecast}} convective morphological evolution is examined for 37 convective systems. The simulations used Thompson microphysics with 3 -km horizontal grid spacing. Ten convective mode classifications were used. An objective score {{was developed to}} determine {{the accuracy of the}} simulated morphologies considering a normalized duration of each mode simulated and its agreement with observations. Rapid Update Cycle analyses were used to compare largerscale preinitiation conditions to simulated morphology accuracy, as well as to examine how the WRF model’s skill at predicting these larger-scale conditions influenced its prediction of morphology. Two case studies selected as representative of themost common simulated morphology deficiencies were examined in detail. The model simulated cellular systems relatively well but struggled more with linear systems, particularly bow echoes and squall lines having trailing stratiform rain regions. Morphological evolution was generally better simulated in environments with enhanced deep-layer shear and cooler <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> at the level of maximum ue. Weaker deep-layer shear, cooler <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> at the surface, and quickly warming <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> with height increased the likelihood of timing errors.

30|$|The {{performances}} of four vertical mixing parameterizations, NN, MY, GLS, and LMD, were investigated at four observational sites. The model replicated <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> and surface mixed layer depths reasonably {{well at the}} deep water site, but overmixed <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{after a few days}} at the shallower site with weaker stratification. MY and NN performed the best, but MY occasionally failed at the shallow site, particularly in high winds. GLS had nearly the same performance as MY and NN, although underestimating the surface mixed layer depth by a few meters at the deep, temperate site. LMD performed the worst, generated the highest temperature diffusivities, and overmixed the most. The performance of the vertical mixing parameterizations appears to depend on stratification, wind strength, and possibly water depth. Further observational data sets are needed for comparison and more work {{needs to be done to}} determine the limitations of the parameterizations. There is definitely room for improvement with the vertical mixing parameterizations, particularly in their slow response, and with parameterizing the shear going into their estimates.|$|R
