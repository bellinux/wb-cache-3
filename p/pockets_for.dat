5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, Marie Tucek {{received}} a U.S. patent for {{a device that}} consisted of separate <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> each breast above a metal supporting plate and shoulder straps fastened by hook-and-eye. This invention more closely resembled the modern bra known today, and was a precursor to the underwire bra.|$|E
25|$|A {{less common}} problem is found when rebreathers have a counterlung towards {{the top of}} the torso. In this case there may be a need to attach weights near the counterlung. This is usually not a problem, and weight <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> this purpose are often built into the rebreather harness or casing, and if {{necessary}} weights can be attached to the harness shoulder straps.|$|E

25|$|Absence of {{evidence}} {{is a condition}} in which no valid conclusion can be inferred from the mere absence of detection, normally due to doubt in the detection method. Evidence of absence is the successful variation: a conclusion that relies on specific knowledge in conjunction with negative detection to deduce the absence of something. An example {{of evidence}} of absence is checking your <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> spare change and finding nothing, but being confident that the search would have found it if it was there.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic {{language}} {{is the most}} recent stage of the Egyptian language. Coptic should more correctly be {{used to refer to}} the script rather than the language itself. Even though this script was introduced {{as far back as the}} 1st century BC, it has been applied to the writing of the Egyptian language from the 1st century AD to the present day. Coptic remained the spoken language of most Egyptians until it was slowly replaced by colloquial Egyptian Arabic around the 17th century, although it may have survived in isolated <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> a little longer.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him {{and talk to them}} about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E

25|$|The fullback {{position}} {{has always been}} a purely defensive role, with the aim of stopping the full-forward from getting the ball and scoring. But, in recent times, where the ability to move the ball out of the back and down the field quickly has become a more important tactic, the fullback often starts a chain of passes up the ground. The defensive aspect of the position remains important, with the ability to accelerate and change direction quickly. Spoiling the ball is also of utmost importance. The fullback often kicks the ball back into play after a point has been scored, although some teams prefer a midfielder or the small back <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> this role, freeing the (typically taller) fullback player to attempt to mark the kick in.|$|E
25|$|In land plants, chloroplasts are {{generally}} lens-shaped, 3–10 μm {{in diameter and}} 1–3 μm thick. Corn seedling chloroplasts are ≈20 µm3 in volume. Greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae, which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net (e.g., Oedogonium), a cup (e.g., Chlamydomonas), a ribbon-like spiral {{around the edges of}} the cell (e.g., Spirogyra), or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges (e.g., Sirogonium). Some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell; they are star-shaped in Zygnema, or may follow the shape of half the cell in order Desmidiales. In some algae, the chloroplast takes up most of the cell, with <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> the nucleus and other organelles, for example, some species of Chlorella have a cup-shaped chloroplast that occupies much of the cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{melatonin}} receptors {{consist of}} proteins around 40 kDa each. The MT1 receptor encodes 350 amino acids and the MT2 encodes 362 amino acids. The binding of melatonin and its analogues to the receptors {{is not fully}} known. The binding space for melatonin and analogues on the MT1 receptor is smaller than on the MT2. Investigations usually focus on two binding <b>pockets,</b> <b>for</b> the two side-chains. The binding pocket of the 5-methoxy group is more investigated than the other pocket. Researchers agree that the oxygen in the group binds to histidine (His) residues in transmembrane 5 (TM5) domain of the receptor with a hydrogen bond; His195 in MT1 and His208 in MT2. Another amino acid, valine 192 (Val), also participates in the binding of the 5-methoxy group by binding to the methyl portion of the group.|$|E

25|$|The belt loops are of new design, {{much wider}} (double width) {{and there is}} 8 of them now {{compared}} to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs {{at the bottom of}} the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> a piece of evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point {{in a conversation with}} a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E
500|$|One of her major {{initiatives}} as First Lady was {{the promotion}} of volunteerism, in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems {{at the local level}} through volunteering at hospitals, civic organizations, and rehabilitation centers. She stated, [...] "Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of ourselves for the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others." [...] She undertook a [...] "Vest <b>Pockets</b> <b>for</b> Volunteerism" [...] trip, where she visited ten different volunteer programs. Susan Porter, in charge of the First Lady's scheduling, noted that Pat [...] "saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn't been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be". Her second volunteerism tour—she traveled [...] within the United States—helped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the Vietnam War. She herself belonged to several volunteer groups, including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League, and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations. Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and Jacqueline Kennedy.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{the player}} gets still more points if a ball {{with which the}} cue ball caromed for {{additional}} points (i.e. a nakki ball) is also pocketed on the same shot. The number of points is awarded by the pocketed ball's value: white = 2, red = 3, yellow = 6. For example, if a player pockets the yellow kaisa, and caroms a red nakki ball into a pocket, the score is 15 points (kaisa <b>pocketed</b> <b>for</b> 6, nakki carom off <b>pocketed</b> kaisa <b>for</b> 3, red hit on nakki carom for 3, plus red ball in a <b>pocket</b> <b>for</b> 3, equals 15).|$|R

2500|$|In practice, the war-time {{population}} {{shift in}} the annexed territories did not take on its planned extent, either {{in regard to the}} number of expelled Poles and the resettled Germans, or in regard to the origin of the settled Germans which was the Soviet Union. Plans for a resettlement of Germans from the Third Reich were upheld in the Generalplan Ost but postponed to after the war. This plan envisioned the elimination of all Jews and, in the long run, the deportation of initially 31 million, later 51 million Slavs to Siberia from a large area designated for German settlement. The removal of Poles consisted of such actions as ethnic cleansing, mass executions, organized famine and eradication of national groups by scattering them in isolated <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> labour. [...] About 350,000 ethnic Germans were settled in Poland after Nazi propaganda persuaded them to leave the Baltic States prior to the Soviet Union's take-over, and subjected to Germanization.|$|E

2500|$|During the First World War, {{the design}} of the trench coat was {{modified}} to include shoulder straps and D-rings. The shoulder straps were for the attachment of epaulettes or other rank insignia; There is a popular myth that the D-ring was for the attachment of hand grenades. [...] The ring was originally for attaching map cases and swords or other equipment to the belt. This latter pattern was dubbed [...] "trench coat" [...] by the soldiers in the front line. Many trench coats had large <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> maps and cleverly placed flaps and vents to deal with the odour associated with earlier rubber coats. A range of waterproof coats were designed and sold during wartime that incorporated War Office requirements with traditional aspects of leisurewear. What became known as the ‘trench coat’ combined the features of a military waterproof cape and the regulation greatcoat designed for British officers. Many veterans returning to civilian life kept the coats that became fashionable for both men and women.|$|E
2500|$|Some cytosolic {{proteins}} are {{recruited to}} different cellular membranes by recognizing {{certain types of}} lipid found within a given membrane. Binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind. This is a typical biochemical protein–ligand interaction, and is stabilized by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic interactions between the protein and lipid ligand. Such complexes are also stabilized by the formation of ionic bridges between the aspartate or glutamate residues of the protein and lipid phosphates via intervening calcium ions (Ca2+). [...] Such ionic bridges can occur and are stable when ions (such as Ca2+) are already bound to a protein in solution, prior to lipid binding. The formation of ionic bridges {{is seen in the}} protein–lipid interaction between both protein C2 type domains and annexins..|$|E
2500|$|Logan {{was born}} in Richland Township, Tama County, Iowa in 1867. His mother died in 1876, and his brothers, Hank, Johnny and Lonny, moved to Dodson, Missouri {{to live with their}} aunt Lee Logan. Until at least 1883, Harvey made his living {{breaking}} horses on the Cross L ranch, near Rising Star, Texas. While there, he met and befriended a man named [...] "Flat Nose" [...] George Curry, from whom he took his new last name. His brothers soon adopted the same last name. The Logan brothers were known as hard workers until they got paid. Money did not stay in their <b>pockets</b> <b>for</b> long. They all had a taste for alcohol and women. Kid Curry would often return from a train or bank robbery, get drunk and lay up with prostitutes until his share of the take was gone. After Kid Curry became famous, the prostitutes would frequently name him as the father when they became pregnant. The children were referred to as [...] "Curry Kids". It is believed that Kid Curry was credited with as many as eighty-five children, though the number of children he actually fathered was probably fewer than five. Descendants of the [...] "Curry Kids" [...] remain scattered throughout Eastland County, Texas and the surrounding areas to this day.|$|E
