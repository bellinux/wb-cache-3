50|$|His medical {{employment}} was {{ended on}} March 13, 1998. Shortly afterward, {{he confessed to}} 50 murders (a confession he later retracted). In searching for evidence that would {{be strong enough to}} obtain a court conviction, the police exhumed the remains of patients who had died while Saldivar had been on duty and been buried (rather than cremated). The marker that was being sought was unusually high levels of <b>Pavulon</b> in the cadaver, as this drug remains identifiable for many months (unlike succinylcholine chloride and morphine which are decomposed into innocuous compounds relatively rapidly).|$|E

5000|$|On October 24, 1990 The New York Times {{described}} him as [...] "self-proclaimed execution expert and manufacturer of death machinery." [...] It quoted Dr. Edward A. Brunner, chairman of the anesthesia department at Northwestern University Medical School, as saying Leuchter's lethal injection system would indeed paralyze a condemned criminal with <b>Pavulon,</b> but far from being humane this paralysis would merely stop the prisoner from screaming at the [...] "extreme pain {{in the form of}} a severe burning sensation" [...] caused by the potassium chloride injection. Potassium chloride is commonly used in judicial execution through lethal injection.|$|E
50|$|He {{killed his}} {{patients}} by injecting a paralytic drug {{which led to}} respiratory and/or cardiac arrest. These drugs could have included Morphine and Suxamethonium chloride as they were found in his locker with fresh and used syringes. Pancuronium (brand name <b>Pavulon)</b> definitely was used in six murders; this drug is used to stop a patient's respiration when {{they are about to}} be put on a medical ventilator. He was careful in the selection of his victims, choosing those who were unconscious and close to death. This led to no easily detectable rise in the rate or distribution of patient deaths when he was on duty. This in turn hampered the investigation, as there were no easily discernible correlations between changes in the distribution or rate of deaths and his shift pattern (a commonly used tool in examining whether malpractice is taking place).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1987, Good Samaritan Hospital nurse Richard Angelo ("The Angel of Death") was arrested {{following}} a urine analysis of Good Samaritan patient Geralomo Kucich that showed the drugs <b>Pavulon</b> and Anectine in his system. Following his arrest, the remains {{of some of the}} patients Angelo had treated were exhumed and 10 of the deceased patients also tested positive for the drugs. Angelo eventually confessed to authorities, telling them during a taped interview, [...] "I wanted to create a situation where I would cause the patient to have some respiratory distress or some problem, and through my intervention or suggested intervention or whatever, come out looking like I knew what I was doing. I had no confidence in myself. I felt very inadequate." [...] He was charged with multiple counts of second-degree murder and was ultimately convicted of two counts of depraved indifference murder (second-degree murder), one count of second degree manslaughter, one count of criminally negligent homicide and six counts of assault with respect to five of the patients and was sentenced to 61 years to life.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{method of}} {{execution}} in the US is via lethal injection which generally involves {{the administration of}} three drugs: sodium thiopental, a sedative to induce unconsciousness, pancuronium bromide (<b>Pavulon),</b> a muscle relaxant to cause respiratory arrest, and potassium chloride to trigger cardiac arrest. Organ donation following this method of lethal injection is often compared to donation after circulatory death (DCD). Similar to DCD organ donation following lethal injection faces the challenge of gathering organs before they become unusable due to hypoxia. Both the American Medical Association and the American Society of Anesthesiology oppose their members from participating in executions, although their abilities to sanction members for doing so are limited. In {{order to avoid the}} transplanting physician's involvement in the death of the inmate, the cause of death must be determined to be from lethal injection, and not from the removal of the patients organs. This means that after lethal injection, the medical examiner waits 10-15 minutes to test for sign of cardiac activity before pronouncing them dead. During this time hypoxia destroying the organs becomes a serious issue, but removal of the organs any earlier risks making the removal of the inmates organs the cause of death and not the lethal injection.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Death House" [...] is an {{isolated}} structure where state ordered executions are carried out. The [...] "house" [...] is a single-entrance fortified building, accessed {{only through the}} prison yard. Upon entry to the Death House, witnesses to executions are immediately located in an observation room, approximately 20' X 20' (6 m X 6 m), with three 16' (4.9 m) long wooden benches to seat them. When seated, a glass window is seen {{directly in front of}} the first row of benches. An access door to the left of the viewing window leads to the execution room. Immediately to the right of the observation room (but still within it) is a storage area that houses the non-functional electric chair (nicknamed [...] "Sparky") that was used before the implementation of lethal injection. The execution room proper is approximately 8' X 12' and is occupied by a gurney outfitted with sheets and pillow. Continuing through the execution room, there is a holding room off the right side as viewed from the observation room with a single-cell complex. The [...] "Death Watch" [...] cell consists of a standard holding cell, with a sink, toilet, and shower included within the one-cell complex. There is a small observation area immediately outside of the cell where two corrections officers are assigned to 24/7 security detail once an inmate is placed on [...] "Death Watch." [...] There is a private observation room with one-way glass directly behind the execution room that is accessed through the holding room. This room is where the old electrical supply panel is housed that energized the formerly used electric chair. Also, there are two circular line ports through the block wall where chemical lines are fed to the execution room. This room is where the executioners, warden, and other authorized personnel maintain watch over the execution and the administration of the lethal injection drugs: sodium thiopental that was previously used to induce unconsciousness; pancuronium bromide (<b>Pavulon)</b> to cause muscle paralysis and respiratory arrest; and potassium chloride to stop the heart.|$|E
40|$|An organism’s {{ability to}} track moving objects, or {{temporal}} resolution, has been correlated to habitat and lifestyle, {{and can be}} further modulated by temperature and light intensity fluctuations within the environment. Photopic (bright-light/day time) vision is typically faster than scotopic (dim-light/night time) because visual sensitivity is greater in dim light and integration time must be slowed to allow for capture of {{the maximum number of}} photons. Higher temperatures result in increased temporal resolution in both endothermic and non-endothermic fishes. Previous studies have used either anesthetized or paralyzed fishes to determine temporal resolution, measured as the maximum critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFmax). However, sedation with the anesthetic, tricaine methanesulfonate (MS- 222), is thought to suppress sensory system responses, although empirical evidence is lacking. Therefore, we quantified scotopic and photopic CFFmax in the yellow stingray, Urobatis jamaicensis, at the extremes of its temperature range, 20 °C and 30 °C, and immobilized with anesthesia, MS- 222, or a paralytic, <b>Pavulon.</b> Both low temperature and anesthesia (MS- 222) reduced CFFmax. With an increase of 10 °C, CFFmax doubled from 12 Hz to 25. 3 Hz (photopic) under <b>Pavulon,</b> whereas CFFmax increased by only 4 Hz, from 6. 7 Hz to 10. 7 Hz (photopic) under MS- 222 anesthesia. In general, MS- 222 anesthesia minimized the effects of both temperature and light-adaptation compared to <b>Pavulon.</b> Yellow stingray CFFmax was similar to the skate, another benthic batoid, but slower than shark species studied with the same technique. These results illustrate the effects of light adaptation, temperature, and anesthesia on visual function within the elasmobranch fishes...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{concentrations}} of pancuronium were measured using a fluorimetric method in six patients with normal renal function and seven patients in chronic renal failure. A two-compartment open model {{was used in}} the pharmacokinetic analysis of the data. With this model, the clearance of pancuronium was found to be reduced significantly in the patients with renal failure, and in these individuals the volume of the central (distribution) compartment was increased significantly. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. The bisquaternary ammonium steroid pancuronium bromide (<b>Pavulon,</b> Organon) has gained widespread acceptance as a useful non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in anaesthetic and intensive-care practice. Studies on the pharmacokinetics of this agent in man indicate that renal excretion represents a major route of elimination (Agoston et al., 1973; Buzello, 1975). These investigations have revealed that 40 - 50 % of an injected dose of pancuronium appears unchanged in the urine. Therefore we have compared the pharmacokinetic behaviour of this drug in patients with normal and impaired renal function...|$|E
40|$|BOTH {{anaesthetics}} {{and surgical}} trauma could strongly affect {{the production of}} tumour necrosis factor t (TNFt). During in vitro experiments the authors found that anaesthetics modulate the production of TNFt by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Notably, Pentothal strongly increased {{the production of the}} cytokine as compared to both lipopolysacchride treated and control mononuclear cells, whereas in supernatants from Leptofen driven mononuclear cells TNFt was strongly reduced. On the other hand, <b>Pavulon</b> did not significantly affect the cytokine production. In the in vivo study, in an attempt to ameliorate the metabolic response to surgical trauma, L-carnitine was administered to 20 surgical patients, then the circulating TNFt was measured. The results indicate that the levels of circulating TNFt were strongly increased following surgery and that L-carnitine administration resulted in a strong reduction of TNFt. Thus, the data suggest that L-carnitine could be helpful in protecting surgical patients against dysmetabolism dependent on dysregulated production of TNFt. Key words: Anaesthetics, L-Carnitine, Surgery, TNF Anaesthetics modulate tumour necrosis factor = " effects of L-carnitine supplementation in surgical patients. Preliminary results...|$|E
30|$|Five {{domestic}} female Agroceres pigs (80 [*][79, 81][*]kg) were anesthetized with thionembutal (10  mg.kg− 1, thiopental, Abbott, Brazil) and {{pancuronium bromide}} (0.1  mg.kg− 1, <b>Pavulon,</b> AKZO Nobel, Brazil) {{and connected to}} a mechanical ventilator (Evita XL Dräger, Dräger, Lübeck, Germany) with the following parameters: tidal volume 8  mL/kg, end-expiratory pressure 5  cmH 2 O, FiO 2 initially set at 100  % and subsequently adjusted to maintain arterial saturation between 94 and 96  %, and respiratory rate titrated to maintain PaCO 2 between 35 and 45  mmHg or an end-tidal CO 2 (NICO, Dixtal Biomedica Ind. Com, São Paulo, Brazil) between 30 and 40  mmHg. The electrocardiogram, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and systemic pressures of the animals were monitored with a multiparametric monitor (Infinity Delta XL, Dräger, Lübeck, Germany). Central venous pressure (CVP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm), pulmonary artery occluded pressure (PAOP), and cardiac output (CO) were measured {{with the use of}} a pulmonary artery catheter. Anesthesia was maintained with midazolam (1 – 5  mg.kg− 1.h− 1) and fentanyl (5 – 10  mcg.kg− 1.h− 1), and muscular relaxation was maintained with pancuronium bromide (0.2  mg.kg− 1.h− 1).|$|E
40|$|The neuromuscular {{blocking}} action of pancuronium bromide {{was investigated in}} anaesthetized patients. Pancuronium resembles tubocurarine in producing a competitive type block but is about five times as potent as tubocurarine. With a small dose (0. 02 mg/kg) the onset of action of the drug was slow, with the time to its maximum effect averaging 4. 5 minutes. The maximum effect was, on average, a reduction in twitch height of 69 per cent. With larger doses of the agent (0. 05 mg/kg and 0. 1 mg/kg) the onset was more rapid and usually a complete block was achieved. The recovery from 0. 02 mg/kg and 0. 05 mg/kg to 50 per cent of the initial twitch height averaged 12. 2 minutes and 36. 8 minutes respectively. Repeated doses of the drug produced a greater duration of action with a somewhat greater intensity of block. During recovery from {{the action of the}} drug a respiratory acidaemia reduced and a respiratory alkalaemia increased the rate of recovery.
