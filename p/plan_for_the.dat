It was first a part of M-15 when the highway system was signed in 1919, and then later as US41/M-28 after {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered Highway System in 1926. (Under the original 1925 draft <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Highway System, US102 was the number assigned to run through Marquette.)

5|$|After the Americans {{attacked}} the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October, the Japanese implemented their <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defense {{of these areas}} that required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces, {{with only a few}} aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion.|$|E
5|$|Age, {{cognitive}} growth, {{and continued}} social experience advance {{the development and}} complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining.

5|$|An early plan {{conceived}} by British Rail {{in the early}} 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds, especially from the Leigh Action Group and Surrey & Kent Action on Rail (SKAR).

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General <b>Plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting {{the entire population of}} occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
