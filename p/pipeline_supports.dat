In order to ensure the above-ground routing method for the oil pipeline “Zapolyarye - Pur-pe” and {{in view of the}} lack of construction experience in case of above-ground routing of oil pipelines, the leading research institute of JSC “Transneft” - LLC “NII TNN” over the period of August, 2011 - September, 2012 performed a research and development work on the subject “Development and production of <b>pipeline</b> <b>supports</b> and pile foundation test specimens for the areas of above-ground routing of the pipeline system “Zapolyarye - Pur-pe”.

Cyclic tests of endurance and stability of the displacements of sliding supports under the influence of limit operating loads for confirming their operation capacity. Relocation of the pipeline on the sliding supports from temperature expansion in case of preheated oil charge into a “cold” pipeline was simulated. 4.

The mother machine (MM) cultivation system is particularly attractive for the long-term investigation of rod-shaped bacteria since it facilitates continuous cultivation and observation of individual cells over many generations in a highly parallelized manner.

40|$|Summary: Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) PROfiling {{in small}} RNA (sRNA) -seq (ncPRO-seq) is a stand-alone, {{comprehensive}} and flexible ncRNA analysis pipeline. It can interrogate and perform detailed profiling analysis on sRNAs derived from annotated non-coding regions in miRBase, Rfam and RepeatMasker, {{as well as}} specific regions defined by users. The ncPRO-seq pipeline performs both gene-based and family-based analyses of sRNAs. It also has a module to identify regions significantly enriched with short reads, which cannot be classified under known ncRNA families, thus enabling the discovery of previously unknown ncRNA- or small interfering RNA (siRNA) -producing regions. The ncPRO-seq <b>pipeline</b> <b>supports</b> input read sequences in fastq, fasta and color space format, as well as alignment results in BAM format, meaning that sRNA raw data from the three current major platforms (Roche- 454, Illumina-Solexa and Life technologies-SOLiD) can be analyzed with this pipeline. The ncPRO-seq pipeline {{can be used to}} analyze read and alignment data, based on any sequenced genome, including mammals and plants.

30|$|The CPU {{version of}} the {{proposed}} <b>pipeline</b> <b>supports</b> 256 or more disparity hypotheses. We also implemented a GPU version for the whole pipeline that takes advantage of parallelism in the optimization at the pixel level. We ran our experiments on an Nvidia Titan Black graphics card with 6 -GB memory on board. We allocate memory for a batch of left and right images, including the disparity hypothesis layers requiring 2 ×Width×Height×Frames×Disparities floating point values. Because of the limited GPU memory, we are currently restricted to batches of 14 frames at a resolution of 960 × 540 and 32 disparity layers. Note that we evaluate the unary term at a finer discretization of disparity steps, typically at one pixel steps. We then store the minimum {{for each of the}} 32 layers. At the end of the optimization, the disparity is computed and finalized as described above, and by fitting the quadratic to the 32 layers, we achieve finer levels of disparity. After the disparities of a batch of frames are computed, we move forward by seven frames and compute the disparities for the next batch. We finally interpolate the disparity values of the overlapping frames in consecutive batches for smoother transitions.|$|E

40|$|Food webs {{describe}} who eats whom among species {{within a}} habitat. These networks depict interlinked food chains and {{have long been}} a central ecological paradigm for studying biocomplexity. As food-web data encompasses more species, the network structure of the feeding links among those species results in a highly connected network {{that is difficult to}} visualize in 2 D. Such simple representations often obscure important details critical for understanding the structure and function of ecosystems. Graph layout is thus critically important for enhanced understanding of complex food webs. In this paper, we describe 3 D visualizations of food webs that use intuitive node placement, minimal edge-crossing and link length, hierarchical node aggregation, and analysis tool integration. We also describe our deployment of “Webs on the Web” (WoW) visualization and analysis tools on the WWW. These tools will facilitate food-web research, collaboration, and education.

40|$|Figure 1 : Three rhinos, {{defined and}} printed using OpenFab. For each print, the same {{geometry}} was {{paired with a}} different fablet—a shaderlike program which procedurally defines surface detail and material composition throughout the object volume. This produces three unique prints by using displacements, texture mapping, and continuous volumetric material variation {{as a function of}} distance from the surface. 3 D printing hardware is rapidly scaling up to output continuous mixtures of multiple materials at increasing resolution over ever larger print volumes. This poses an enormous computational challenge: large high-resolution prints comprise trillions of voxels and petabytes of data and simply modeling and describing the input with spatially varying material mixtures at this scale is challenging. Existing 3 D printing software is insufficient; in particular, most software is designed to support only a few million primitives, with discrete material choices per object. We present OpenFab, a programmable pipeline for synthesis of multi-material 3 D printed objects that is inspired by RenderMan and modern GPU pipelines. The <b>pipeline</b> <b>supports</b> procedural evaluation of geometric detail and material composition, using shader-like fablets, allowing models to be specified easily and efficiently.

40|$|AbstractWire damping {{materials}} (such as Metal Rubber, MR, or “spring cushion”, etc.) {{are widely}} used for protection of a pipeline against vibration. A calculation method for an arbitrary shaped pipeline with damping supports made of the MR material was developed {{by means of the}} finite element ANSYS software package. Dependencies of MR support stiffness and energy dissipation coefficient on various parameters (material density, wire diameter, thickness, preliminary static deformation) are obtained as these two characteristics influence the quality of MP supports. An equivalence viscous damping coefficient was obtained {{on the basis of the}} equality of the hysteretic loop area for the viscous damping system and dry friction in the wire material. The method takes into account a non-linearity of the MR material by the iteration method. The method allows obtaining a pipeline vibration amplitude and stress in the pipeline for its 3 D vibration. Calculation results are proved by experiment with the ARAMIS non-contact measurement system. The error is less than 9 %, thus, it is possible to use this method for practical application: placement of <b>pipeline</b> <b>supports</b> and design of these supports parameters.

The <b>pipeline</b> <b>supports</b> configurable parallel processing that can significantly reduce the time needed to process a large volume of data products. Processors in the pipeline implement a simple Java interface and declare their required input from upstream processors.

Fault tolerance can be configured to attempt continuation of processing {{in the event of an}} error or failed input dependency if possible, or to abort further processing when an error is detected. This innovation also provides support for Java Message Service broadcasts of telemetry objects to clients and provides a file system and relational database logging of telemetry. Orchestrator supports remote monitoring and control of the pipeline using browser-based JMX controls and provides several integration paths for pre-compiled legacy data processors. At the time of this reporting, the Orchestrator architecture has been used by four NASA customers to build telemetry pipelines to support field operations.
