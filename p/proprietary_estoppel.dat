25|$|In Yeomans Row Management Ltd v Cobbe the House {{overturned}} {{the decision of}} a fairly heavy-weight Court of Appeal on the very issue of estoppel, thereby illustrating the level of confusion {{about the meaning of}} the doctrine. Lord Scott of Foscote, with whom the other Lords agreed, described at length that someone who seeks to rely on <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> must establish an actual or certain interest in the property to which he claimed a right. Without that, he is not off the starting blocks.|$|E
2500|$|Yet <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{has also}} arisen by acquiescence. The leading case {{in this area}} is Ramadan v Dyson (1866) LR 1 HL 129.|$|E
5000|$|Under English and Australian legal systems, estoppels {{in equity}} include {{promissory}} and <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppels,</b> described below. (Contrast with estoppel by representation, {{which is a}} claim (under the English system) at law.) ...|$|R
50|$|These {{elements}} were, however, refined by future {{case law}} over the later 20th century {{and in the}} early 21st century. Indeed, the High Court in Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher, recognised that both the principles of <b>proprietary</b> and promissory <b>estoppel</b> encompass the broader principle of equitable estoppel.|$|R
2500|$|In {{particular}} {{he remarked}} {{that the following}} rationes of Deane J in Muschinski v Dodds [...] "repay careful reading" [...] (his Lordship said they applied to <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> as they do to constructive trusts): ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of Ottaway v Norman [...] Ch., Brightman J held that a {{floating}} obligation attaches to secret trusts: [...] "A valid trust is created in favour of the secondary donee which is in suspense during the lifetime of the donee, but attaches to the estate of the primary donee {{at the moment of}} the latter's death." [...] Edward Nugee QC sitting as deputy High Court judge in Re Basham [...] 1 WLR applied a comparable test in relation to <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel.</b> He held that the belief, for detrimental reliance, need not relate to a clearly identified piece of property. Following Cleaver and Birmingham, if it is established by cogent evidence that the intention was to leave the entire estate, <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> will enforce that intention. (It is interesting to recall that Edward Nugee was counsel in Ottaway v Norman and that Brightman J adopted his floating obligation theory) ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the courts}} will {{generally}} uphold {{the expectations of}} parties, if the parties are themselves not clear about their expectations the court's starting point will be the detriment incurred by the parties (per Robert Walker LJ [...] Jennings v Rice). <b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> claims, therefore do not necessarily result in {{the transfer of the}} property to the claimant; in Jennings v Rice itself, there was a monetary award.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008 the House of Lords re-visited the {{doctrine}} of <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel,</b> {{and in the process}} was quite fierce in describing its limits. [...] In that light, it must be very doubtful that Mr Jennings would have got the result he did: properly understood, Jennings v Rice {{is a bit of a}} muddle, probably concerning promissory estoppel, with a bit of quantum meruit thrown in for good measure.|$|E
2500|$|Under English law, {{estoppel}} by, {{promissory estoppel}} and <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{are regarded as}} reliance-based estoppels by Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol 16(2), 2003. [...] Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. [...] These estoppels can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him. [...] The court will only enforce this lack-of-consideration promise {{if and only if}} it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] for the promisor/representor to rescind from his promise/representation ("it's not fair!"). [...] Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under contract law. [...] Only <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence. [...] Under American jurisprudence, equitable estoppel is available only as a defense, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{arises when}} A purports to give but fails to {{effectively}} convey, or promises to give property or {{an interest in}} property, to B, while being generally aware (Crabb v Arun District Council) that B will expend money or otherwise act to his detriment in reliance of the supposed or promised gift, {{so much so that}} it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] not to enforce the expectation (Taylor Fashions v Liverpool Victoria Trustees).|$|E
2500|$|Estoppel by {{representation}} of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: [...] the former is based on {{representation of}} existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter {{is based on a}} promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future). [...] <b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> can operate only between parties who, at the time of representation, were in a pre-existing relationship, while this is not a pre-requisite under estoppel by {{representation of fact}}.|$|E
2500|$|Estoppel by {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as estoppel by agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same. [...] It {{has been said that}} estoppel by convention is not truly an estoppel but merely an instance of estoppel by representation, promissory estoppel or <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel,</b> though the first of the three is its most frequent manifestation.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{arose in}} {{relation}} to rights to use {{the land of the}} owner, and possibly in connection with disputed transfers of ownership. Although <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> was only traditionally available in disputes affecting title to real property, it has now gained limited acceptance in other areas of law. <b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> is closely related to the doctrine of constructive trust.|$|E
50|$|In English law, <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> is {{distinct}} from promissory estoppel. <b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> is not a concept in American law, but a similar result is often reached under the general doctrine of promissory estoppel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{is a legal}} claim, {{especially}} {{connected to}} English land law, which may arise in relation to rights to use {{the property of the}} owner, and may even be effective in connection with disputed transfers of ownership. <b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> transfers rights if, ...|$|E

50|$|Lord Scott held to {{the view}} that <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> can only be used where the assurer {{believes}} they have or will have very soon acquired a right in someone’s land. He said though he would not disagree about <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel,</b> he would ‘find it easier and more comfortable to regard David’s equity as established via a remedial constructive trust.’ The elements of a claim are clear assurance, reasonable reliance, substantial detriment. <b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> brings uncertain results, e.g. if Peter intended to give up the farm, but before then had wanted to use the farm as a home given his old age. Cases like Ramsden and Crabb can easily be understood as <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel,</b> but he finds inheritance cases easier to understand as being remedied through a remedial constructive trust, created by the parties’ common intention, since Gissing. Like Gillett.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{is one of}} four {{principal}} {{mechanisms to}} acquire rights over property, seen particularly in the case of land (the others being a contract, an implied trust, and adverse possession). Unlike a contract or gift, which depend on consent, or resulting and constructive trusts that depend primarily on the fact of contribution, a <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> arises when a person has been given a clear assurance, it was reasonable of them to rely on the assurance, and they have acted to their detriment. This threefold pattern of <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> (clear assurance, reasonable reliance and substantial detriment) makes it consistent with its partner in the law of obligations, [...] "promissory estoppel".|$|E

50|$|The Court of Appeal (Lloyd LJ, Ward LJ and Rimer LJ) held David had no <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> claim {{because there}} was never a clear and unequivocal assurance.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{there also}} exists a {{doctrine}} of <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel,</b> the High Court of Australia merged this doctrine with the doctrine of promissory estoppel {{by virtue of their}} similar criteria.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, {{authority}} {{for the doctrine of}} <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> indicates that if a landlord allows a licensee to expend money on the land under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he/she will be able to remain there, and the licensee suffers a detriment in relying on that expectation, an equity arises in the licensee such as to entitle him/her to stay. Where a <b>proprietary</b> <b>estoppel</b> is found to exist, the court does not have to grant the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the land subject to the dispute. It may instead make an order that the plaintiff receive equitable compensation.|$|E
