5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E

5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, a large {{underground}} {{cold store}} at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, {{a mixture of}} ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz's work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten's operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher's basement, behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete {{with the development of}} longer range aircraft and the project was then abandoned.|$|E
5|$|During WorldWarI, {{approximately}} 120,000 ANZAC personnel convalesced in Weymouth {{after being}} injured at Gallipoli or other theatres of the war. Weymouth and Portland were bombed by German <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> WorldWarII; Portland harbour {{had a large}} naval base, and Weymouth was home to Nothe Fort, next to Nothe Gardens. 517,816 troops embarked through the borough to fight at the Battle of Normandy. The Bouncing bomb was tested in the Fleet lagoon {{to the west of}} town. The history of the area was documented at the Timewalk museum in Brewers Quay.|$|E

5|$|Flight Unlimited II is a 1997 flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Looking Glass Studios {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. The player controls one of five <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> the airspace of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent aircraft directed by real-time air traffic control. The game eschews the aerobatics focus of its predecessor, Flight Unlimited, in favor of general civilian aviation. As such, new physics code and an engine were developed, the former because the programmer of Flight Unlimiteds computational fluid dynamics system, Seamus Blackley, had left the company.|$|E
5|$|He was {{preoccupied with}} his own security, {{regularly}} changing where he slept and sometimes grounding all other <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> Libya when he was flying. He made particular requests when traveling to foreign nations. During his trips to Rome, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City, he resided in a bulletproof tent, following his Bedouin traditions. Gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to foreign powers, and generally shunned Western ambassadors and diplomats, believing them to be spies.|$|E
5|$|Mallet {{traveled}} to Stockholm on 4 April {{where he met}} with Erik Boheman, the Swedish State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. During the meeting he presented the proposals for British reconnaissance flights and for the transport collaboration. The Swedish government rejected the former but accepted the latter. However, privately Boheman indicated that Sweden's air force would not pursue Allied <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> their airspace, and also that limitations of the transport collaboration meant it would have little benefit for the British.|$|E
50|$|In the 70s, {{directors}} made {{frequent use}} of the split-focus diopter.

5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.|$|E
5|$|The task {{groups were}} forced to stay within enemy air range longer than {{anticipated}} due to Canberra situation. Early morning fighter sweeps were launched to suppress air power on Luzon and Formosa while the newly formed task group attempted to escort Canberra to safety.

5|$|After reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a hurricane in the eastern Atlantic, the Weather Bureau warned shipping lanes in the storm's path. Small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from Block Island, Rhode Island south to Savannah, Georgia on September7 due to the threat of rough seas. After Carrie stalled on September11, the Weather Bureau gave Florida a slight chance of being affected by the storm, but the possibilities of the storm affecting the peninsula decreased after the hurricane curved northwards. After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda, schools were closed in preparation for Carrie, while vessels were warned of the oncoming hurricane. Most <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated, with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags. After passing Bermuda, the storm was forecast to strike Nova Scotia, but instead Carrie curved towards the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the beetle}} became {{established}} near USA {{military bases in}} Bordeaux during or immediately following World War I and had proceeded to spread {{by the beginning of}} World War II to Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following World War II and spread eastward, and the beetle is now found over much of the continent. After World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by the beetle by 1950. In East Germany they were known as Amikäfer ('Yankee beetles') following a governmental claim that the beetles were dropped by American <b>planes.</b> <b>In</b> the EU it remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the UK, Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland.

5|$|For {{the battle}} {{sequence}} in North Africa, two actual Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images {{of them or}} by computer-generated <b>planes.</b> <b>In</b> scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little {{was left of the}} original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.|$|E
5|$|For {{transporting}} paratroops, {{to avoid}} relying solely on American aircraft and pilots, No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force was expanded, becoming No. 38 Group with its Halifax squadrons, now supported by four squadrons of Albemarles and four squadrons of Stirlings. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery guns by air, {{the air force}} started experiments on parachuting them into combat, carrying the jeeps and guns in the aircraft's large bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46 Group, was formed, and was equipped solely with Dakotas, instead {{of the mixture of}} aircraft in No. 38 Group.

5|$|In 1809, Richard and Israel Inman {{constructed}} a gristmill {{at the foot}} of Solomon's Falls. It was converted to a house in 1833 and destroyed in 1850. A gristmill on the creek in Hanover Township had been built by 1812 and was run by George Mesinger. It was destroyed in 1840. In 1845, William Petty constructed the gristmill called Petty Mill in Hanover Township. This mill burned down in 1887. The Wyoming Division Canal, which was constructed in the 1830s, started at Solomon Creek. Construction of the Ashley <b>Planes</b> <b>in</b> the Solomon Creek gap began in 1837. They were used until 1848. An iron-producing forge operated on the creek in Ashley until 1839. There was also a sawmill on it until 1839. A powder mill operated on Solomon Creek, but was replaced with a brewery by 1885. A slaughterhouse discharged its waste into the creek in the early 20th century. The creek was used as the water supply for the Huber Breaker from the 1930s to the 1970s. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Solomon Creek.|$|E
