40|$|Introduction: Needle stick {{injuries}} {{are an important}} occupational hazard for nursing personnel as they form an important mechanism for transmission of blood borne pathogens. Hence the knowledge of nurses about the prevention and management of needle stick injuries and practicing standard precautions is critical. Methodology: This was a hospital based cross sectional study conducted among nursing staff {{during the month of}} December, 2011. A semi structured questionnaire was administered to 320 nurses working in a tertiary care hospital of New Delhi by adopting systematic random sampling methodology. Data was entered and analysed using SPSS version 12. Percentages of categorical variables were computed. Results: Only 31. 1 % nurses had adequate knowledge about steps for prevention of needle stick injuries. 259 (88. 4 %) nurses had adequate knowledge about the authority to whom they should report needle stick injuries while almost three fourth i. e. 73. 4 % had adequate knowledge about management of needle stick injuries. Majority of nurses (69. 6 %) reported the use of gloves very often before venipuncture, 80. 2 % never recapped needles while 77. 5 % disposed sharps in <b>puncture</b> <b>proof</b> containers very often. Only one fourth (24. 6 %) nurses always used personal protective equipment in case of emergencies. 85. 7 % of nurses had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. 51 (17. 4 %) had a history of needle stick injury in the last one year out of which 49 (96. 1 %) took adequate measures immediately after the injury and 37 (72. 5 %) reported the incidence to the concerned authority.

40|$|Various optical {{diagnostic}} {{techniques such}} as laser induce fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, laser Doppler velocimetry, and laser light scattering have been employed to study the flowfield downstream of a single injector element in a optically accessible rocket chamber at Penn State for a number o years. These techniques have been used with both liquid and gaseous oxygen at pressures up to 1000 psia which is the limit of the facility. The purpose of the test programs at Penn State were to develop the techniques and to study the flow field from various injector designs.

The advantages of cuffed tracheal tubes in smaller children - in particular the almost 100 % chance to insert the right sized tracheal tube at the first attempt and their reliable sealing characteristics within the trachea - makes tracheal intubation and ventilation considerable easier and safer. This certainly compensates for the higher cost of cuffed compared to uncuffed tracheal tubes.

40|$|In an autofrettage {{process a}} given thick {{cylinder}} {{is subjected to}} such a pressure which gives a specified depth of elasto-plastic boundary. The outside diameter expansion during autofrettage process {{is a function of}} depth of autofrettage. To obtain a specified depth of elastic-plastic interface, the applied autofrettage pressure increases in direct proportion to the proof stress of the pressure vessel material. Although this increases the load bearing capacity of the barrel, resulting in enhanced factor of safety, this increases the maintenance cost of a hydraulic autofrettage plant. To assure quality, product safety and manufacturing economy, an optimal autofrettage pressure is defined. The paper proposes that the minimum autoftrettage pressure is the pressure at which the pressure exterior expansion curve intersects line of constant factor of safety. At higher values of 0. 2 per cent <b>proof</b> stress of <b>tube</b> material autofrettaging based on line of constant factor of safety will result in a reduction in fatigue life. The point of intersection of exterior expansion curve with line of constant fatigue life has been defined as the optimal pressure because the specifications of factor of safety and fatigue life are simultaneously achieved.

The verification of the shakedown condition for reverse yielding due to the Bauschinger effect (Huang’s model) and fatigue life has also been satisfied.   Defence Science Journal, Vol. 64, No. 4, July 2014, pp. 385 - 392, DOI:[URL]     </span...|$|R
40|$|Early-age {{shrinkage}} {{and cracking}} have become reoccurring problem in concrete construction. Conditions such as reduced maximum aggregate size, increased amount of fines, presence of retarding admixtures, increased binder content and deficient covering and curing {{all contribute to}} this problem. At early age, when the cement paste is young and has poorly developed mechanical properties, autogenous and evaporating shrinkage, both incorporated in the plastic shrinkage, are the two main driving forces for cracking. For modern concretes developing large autogenous shrinkage, as the high performance and self-compacting concrete (SCC), early-age cracking is a highly topical and important area. When the concrete dries out due to evaporation there will be formation of water menisci near the concrete surface. The distance between the particles then tends to be reduced and the concrete will contract. These contracting capillary forces are in reverse ratio to the meniscus radius. The capillary tension stresses will therefore increase with decreasing interparticle spaces. For a concrete where the evaporation is prevented, the negative capillary pressure will also start to develop as the concrete sets. As a solid skeleton starts to form the chemical shrinkage is not totally transformed into external volume change and, if the water supply is restricted, empty pores will be formed inside the paste and water meniscus occurs. In this work, early age (< 24 h) autogenous deformation and crack tendency due to plastic shrinkage was measured. For the autogenous deformation, a specially developed digital dilatometer was used with great satisfactory, generating accurately measures of the linear displacements of the concrete cast in a vapor <b>proof</b> flexible <b>tube</b> mould. The plastic shrinkage cracking tendency was evaluated, using a modified Nordtest method (NT BUILD 433), where the concrete sample was exposed to early drying conditions and where the restraining inner steel ring causes development of tangential stresses which if sufficiently high leads to cracking. As the underlying mechanisms are not quantified by the ring-test and as plastic shrinkage strongly {{are related to the}} negative capillary pressure in fresh concrete, the test was complimented with transducer recording the development of the pore pressure. In some cases, pore pressure development was also measured on sealed specimens, referring to the autogenous deformation tests. A large number of different SCC constituents and mix compositions have been investigated; e. g. w/c-ratio from 0. 38 to 0. 67, coarse aggregate content, silica fume, fly ash, cement type, extra water and different admixtures (accelerator, retarder, shrinkage reducer, air entraining agent, superplasticizer dosage). For comparison, tests with standard concrete were made. The crack tendency test was also performed on mixes with different fibers and curing compounds. The influence of different constituents and mixes on the autogenous deformation and plastic shrinkage crack tendency was significantly observed. The results indicated that: • High crack tendency was generated when: - large autogenous shrinkage (silica addition, low w/c, high fineness) - high water evaporation (extra water, high w/c, low fineness) - retardation (retarder, slow hardening cement, high superplastisizer dosage), - low content of coarse aggregate • Minimum crack tendency at w/c 0. 55 IV • Reduced crack tendency by: - shrinkage reducing admixture (large positive effect on both autogenous shrinkage and evaporation, without influencing the time to initial- and final set) - acceleration (accelerator, rapid cement) - air entraining agent - fibers - wax membrane (effectively for concretes with high evaporation) Finally the ring-test method and the experimental results were clearly verified by field studies...|$|R
40|$|Bovine virus {{diarrhea}} (BVD) is {{a complicated}} disease to discuss as it {{can result in a}} wide variety of disease problems from very mild to very severe. BVD can be one of the most devastating diseases cattle encounter and one of the hardest to get rid of when it attacks a herd. The viruses that cause BVD have been grouped into two genotypes, Type I and Type II. The disease syndrome caused by the two genotypes is basically the same, however disease caused by Type II infection is often more severe. The various disease syndromes noted in cattle infected with BVD virus are mainly attributed to the age of the animal when it became infected and to certain characteristics of the virus involved. Diseases caused by BVD infection Fetal BVD infections (infection of the unborn calf) : The result of a fetal infection with the BVD virus is usually determined by the age of the fetus at the time of infection. The virus is capable of passing from an infected cow to the unborn fetus which is particularly vulnerable to the BVD virus during the first 6 months of pregnancy. Death of the fetus is common if the infection occurs during the first 120 days of pregnancy and the cow will lose the pregnancy. However, if the fetus survives an early infection, it will be born without a detectable antibody titer and be persistently infected (PI) with the BVD virus. During the first 120 days of gestation, the fetus has an underdeveloped immune system and does not recognize the BVD virus as foreign. The fetus does not mount an immune response against the virus, remains infected, and does not have a detectable anti-BVD titer. It is not uncommon for the surviving fetus to be malformed; blindness, skeletal abnormalities and under-developed brains are common defects noted in such calves. A BVD PI calf may appear normal, be weak at birth, grow poorly, be susceptible to respiratory diseases, and die before they can be weaned. They may also grow normally, reach breeding age, and produce more persistently BVD infected calves (The virus is passed from generation to generation). PI carriers can only be created by infection with BVD virus during the first 110 - 120 days of pregnancy. These animals shed billions of virus particles every day in their urine, feces, and saliva, and are a source of infection for other animals in the herd. If the fetus becomes infected after 120 days of pregnancy, there may be an abortion but usually, because this aged fetus has a more developed immune system and can elicit an immune response against the BVD virus, a healthy calf is born that has a good level of BVD antibody titer. Subclinical BVD infections: Most animals that become infected with BVD never show signs of disease caused by the virus; however infection can lower the animal’s resistance to other infections, which could result in illness. For example, in feedlot calves, BVD infection may go unnoticed, but the lungs become susceptible to infection with bacteria such as Mannheimia haemolytica (previously called Pasteurella haemolytica) and other agents that cause “shipping fever”. Some people believe that BVD is one of the most significant disease organisms involved with respiratory disease of cattle. Severe acute BVD infections: This disease syndrome is usually (but not always) associated with Type II BVD virus infection. The affected animals will exhibit high fevers (107 - 110 F), occasional diarrhea, respiratory disease, and they will not eat. Peracute BVD can affect cattle of all ages and often results in death of the animal within 48 hours of disease onset regardless of age. Acute BVD infections: The classic, acute form of BVD is characterized by a fever of 104 - 106 F, discharge from the nose and eyes, erosions of the muzzle and in the mouth, and diarrhea that may contain mucus and blood. Diarrhea is usually present in every herd that has an outbreak of acute BVD, but diarrhea is not present in every animal that has acute BVD. The percentage of the herd exhibiting clinical disease and dying can vary extremely; however, if "secondary infections" are controlled, most animals survive the acute disease. This syndrome usually occurs in cattle 6 to 24 months of age. Acute Mucosal disease: An animal persistently infected with BVD virus is not able to mount any defense against becoming subsequently infected with a different BVD virus. When a BVD infection is superimposed on a PI animal, mucosal disease usually results. Acute mucosal disease is characterized by fever, profuse, watery diarrhea, erosions of the mouth, lack of appetite, discharge from the eyes and nose, and occasionally lameness. Secondary infections, such as pneumonia and mastitis, are common. Cattle with acute mucosal disease usually die within 3 to 10 days. Chronic Mucosal disease: Some cattle that develop mucosal disease do not die as soon as expected but rather become chronically infected. Cattle with chronic mucosal disease are poor doers, and may have persistently loose stools or intermittent diarrhea, chronic bloat, decreased appetite, weight loss, erosions between the claws, or non-healing skin lesions. Discharge from the eyes and nose, bald spots due to loss of hair, and long-term lameness are also common. Cattle with chronic mucosal disease rarely survive beyond 18 months and ultimately die. Treatment and Prevention of BVD infections There is no effective treatment for infection with BVD, but most cases are subclinical and self-limiting. Antibiotics, fluid and supportive therapy may be indicated to control secondary infections. Offering highly palatable feed could tempt sick animals to eat needed nutrients. Vaccination of susceptible cattle has been the principal approach to the prevention and control of BVD. However, preventing the introduction of BVD into your herd and identifying and eliminating PI animals from your herd are important steps to take to control the disease. Vaccinate calves: Calves should be vaccinated twice with a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine before leaving the herd of origin. Ideally, BVD vaccinations should be completed in the calves at least 30 days prior to weaning, but whatever program you initiate needs to fit with your management system. Check with your veterinarian for specific recommendations for your herd. Vaccinate the cow herd: It is difficult to provide blanket recommendations for vaccinating the cow herd, but some general guidelines can be given. Unvaccinated heifers and cows should be properly vaccinated before breeding to ensure protection for the fetus. All bulls should be properly vaccinated before putting them out with the cows or heifers and new additions should be properly vaccinated before adding them to the herd. Modified live virus vaccines can be safely used in open cows (there are new MLV vaccines safe for pregnant cows if the cows have been previously vaccinated with certain products) and provide long-lasting protection. Killed vaccines are safe for all cattle, but usually don’t provide as strong an immune response and may need more frequent booster vaccinations. Again, check with your veterinarian for specific recommendations. Prevent introduction of BVD into your herd: BVD virus is shed from cattle in the feces and in secretions from the nose and mouth. BVD is also readily transmitted by aerosol droplets and direct contact. Avoiding contact with other cattle is therefore an important step to take to prevent infection from entering your herd. “Good fences make good neighbors”. It is especially important to keep pregnant cows less than 120 days pregnant separated from other cattle. New introductions into your herd need to be tested for PI status. Eliminate PI animals from your herd: Until recently, testing cattle for PI infection was prohibitively expensive but now there are tools available making it feasible to test for and eliminate these “typhoid Mary” animals from the herd. There are two types of test available, one using a skin sample and one using a blood sample: Immunohistochemistry – for this test, a small notch of skin is taken from the edge of the ear, easily done using a pig ear-notching tool. The triangular piece of skin removed should be ¼ to ½ inches per side. Depending on the laboratory the sample will be sent to, the removed skin is placed either in a vial containing formalin or an individual plastic bag. All samples must be clearly labeled with the animals’ identification number. PCR – this test requires that a blood sample in a “purple top” tube be taken and submitted. Again, all samples must be clearly labeled with the individual animal ID. Samples can be sent to a number of different laboratories; three are listed below. Be sure to contact the lab and talk to your veterinarian before taking and sending samples – if you take the wrong samples, all your work may be wasted. Be aware that it is possible to have “false positive” results – some animals may test positive when they are not truly persistently infected, and may need to be re-tested. Your veterinarian can help interpret the results of the testing. (Thank you to Dr. John Maas for the following information) 1.
