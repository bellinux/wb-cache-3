The expiration date is estimated based on the type and manufacture/packaging time of that particular food unit. This date is then printed on the container so it is available to the end user {{at the time of}} consumption. MONICOD (MONItoring of CODes); an industrial validator of expiration codes; allows the expiration code printed on a drink can to be read. This verification occurs immediately after printing. MONICOD faces difficulties due to the high <b>printing</b> <b>rate</b> (35 cans per second) and problematic lighting caused by the metallic surface on which the code is printed. This article describes a solution that allows MONICOD to extract shapes and presents quantitative results for the speed and quality...|$|E
40|$|Pad {{printing}} is used {{to decorate}} consumer goods largely because of its unique ability to apply graphics to doubly curved surfaces. The Intelpadrint project was conceived to develop {{a better understanding of}} the process and new printing pads, inks and printers. The thesis deals primarily with the research of a printer control system including machine vision. At present printing is manually controlled. Operator knowledge was gathered for use by an expert system to control the process. A novel local corner- matching algorithm was conceived to effect image segmentation, and neuro-fuzzy techniques were used to recognise patterns in printing errors. Non-linear Finite Element Analysis of the rubber printing-pad led to a method for pre-distorting artwork so that it would print undistorted on a curved product. A flexible, more automated printer was developed that achieves a higher <b>printing</b> <b>rate.</b> Ultraviolet-cured inks with improved printability were developed. The image normalisation/ error-signalling stage in inspection was proven in isolation, as was the pattern recognition system...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{thin film}} {{transfer}} mechanism {{has been studied}} and developed to transfer chemically reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) thin film using a roll-to-roll printing system. We discover that shear stress generated on the silicon rubber stamp surface facilitates delamination of the deposited r-GO thin film efficiently. A roll-to-roll apparatus is assembled to demonstrate the shear-induced transfer printing {{in a large scale}} printing system. Shear stress is applied on the stamp surface by rotating the stamp side roller faster than the substrate side roller. The hydrophobic surface is changed to hydrophilic by polydopamine modification for 15 minutes at 60 ˚C in order for r-GO thin film to be directly deposited on the rubber stamp. Roll-to-roll printing parameters such as evaporation time during deposition of r-GO, vertical deformation of stamp, RPM, and RPM ratio between two rollers are investigated and adjusted for successful transfer of r-GO. With the adjusted roll-to-roll printing parameters, r-GO thin film has been transferred successfully to glass and PET substrates at a <b>printing</b> <b>rate</b> of 5 mm/min. The shear stress required to transfer r-GO thin film in our experiment condition with glass substrate is estimated to be 325. 43 kPa by experimental data and computation with ANSYS. A flexible transparent capacitive touch sensor is fabricated with printed r-GO thin film after the sheet resistance is significantly improved by thermal annealing process. Both the shear-induced roll-to-roll printing method and the stamp modification process are expected to contribute to large scale manufacturing systems for flexible printed electronics...|$|E

To fulfill this need, this study develops technological forecasts for hard copy and video display communications terminals. Changes in input/output parameters of the terminals, when the changes will occur, and how rapid the changes will be are estimated. These forecasts are determined by first measuring a limited number of performance parameters such as <b>print</b> <b>rate</b> and transmission speed. Then mathematical models are fitted to the performance parameter data and the trend extrapolated into the future to make predictions. The results of the study indicate that <b>print</b> <b>rates</b> will increase significantly in the next ten years to a level of approximately 2000 characters per second and transmission speeds to' a level of approximately 500, 000 bits per second for hard copy terminals. Video display terminals show a steeper increase with transmission speed levels of 1. 5 Mbps predicted in the next five years. Also, the <b>print</b> <b>rate</b> per dollar and transmission speed per dollar for these terminals will show rapid increases in the next ten years.

40|$|Inkjet-printed metal {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} intensively studied for microelectronic applications including {{both physical and}} chemical sensors, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). However, printed feature broadening is frequently observed due to the coalescence of un-dried ink, reducing achievable resolution. Increasing substrate temperature and reducing <b>print</b> <b>rates</b> are two common mitigation techniques, each with drawbacks. Here a novel interlacing method is introduced as an alternative strategy to manage droplet coalescence. The desired geometry is sampled into multiple sub-patterns and then printed sequentially, to yield the complete pattern. The interlacing sub-sampling matrix is selected according to the desired resolution and printing parameters to isolate each un-dried ink droplet during deposition. Printed geometries are found to retain single droplet resolution using this method. A comparison is made between samples with direct (single-pass) printing and interlaced printing. High-resolution silver planar resistors are constructed and characterized for their application as printed temperature sensors. © 2014 IEEE. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

One {{of the key}} issues to optimize the electrical and optical properties of nanotube arrays is the control of their orientation. So far, orientation of nanotubes in thin films was achieved i) directly during CVD growth [1], ii) using liquid dispersions: by electrophoresis [Herman], in an hydrodynamic flow [Poulin,Li], {{in the field of}} an host liquid crystal [Ould-Moussa], by formation of a liquid crystal in concentrated suspensions [Zamora-nem], or iii) by stretching composites [Zamora-pol].
