50|$|Although {{not often}} {{thought of as a}} <b>precision</b> <b>weapon,</b> the various Kamikaze attackers that first {{appeared}} in the fall of 1944 functioned much like modern anti-shipping missiles, and thus can legitimately be considered a part of the <b>precision</b> <b>weapon</b> story. The Kamikaze was the deadliest aerial anti-shipping threat faced by Allied surface warfare forces in the war. Approximately 2,800 Kamikaze attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. Despite radar detection and cuing, airborne interception and attrition, and massive anti-aircraft barrages, a distressing 14 percent of Kamikazes survived to score a hit on a ship; nearly 8.5 percent of all ships hit by Kamikazes sank. As soon as they appeared, then, Kamikazes revealed their power to force significant changes in Allied naval planning and operations, despite relatively small numbers. Clearly, like the anti-shipping cruise missile of a later era, the Kamikaze had the potential to influence events all out of proportion to its actual strength.|$|E
50|$|Developed {{from earlier}} Greek weapons, it relied upon {{different}} mechanics, using two levers with torsion springs {{instead of a}} prod (the bow part of a modern crossbow), the springs consisting of several loops of twisted skeins. Early versions projected heavy darts or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for siege warfare. It developed into a smaller <b>precision</b> <b>weapon,</b> the scorpio, and possibly the polybolos.|$|E

50|$|Originally Soviet {{strategic}} missile systems {{had been}} placed in fixed, hardened sites.
