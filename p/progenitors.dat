5|$|The <b>progenitors</b> of Type Ib/c supernovae are not {{observed}} at all, and constraints on their possible luminosity are often {{lower than those}} of known WC stars. WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, so it is difficult to say whether such <b>progenitors</b> are missing or just yet to be observed. Very luminous <b>progenitors</b> have not been securely identified, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such <b>progenitors</b> would have been clearly imaged. Population modelling shows that the observed Type Ib/c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped-envelope stars from interacting binary systems. The continued lack of unambiguous detection of <b>progenitors</b> for normal Type Ib and Ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst. Most of these supernovae are then produced from lower-mass low-luminosity helium stars in binary systems. A small number would be from rapidly-rotating massive stars, likely corresponding to the highly-energetic Type Ic-BL events that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveRecent {{evidence}} suggests that the effects of mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cell transplantation into the infarcted myocardium might be mediated by local paracrine angiogenesis. We compared the effects of mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cell transplantation versus those of a primarily angiogenic cell, the endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cell, in a rat model of myocardial infarction. MethodsTwenty-one days after left anterior descending artery ligation, rats were injected in their infarcted anterior myocardium with 1 × 106 mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cells, 1 × 106 endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cells, 5 × 105 mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cells plus 5 × 105 endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cells, or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 6 - 8 per group). Echocardiography was performed before injection and 4 weeks later, after which rats were killed and immunohistochemical analyses performed. ResultsConnexin 43 density was greater in cell-treated groups compared with that seen in the phosphate-buffered saline group (by 91. 6 % ± 15. 2 %, P <. 001), with no observed difference between cell-treated groups (P ≥. 3). Endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cell treatment increased arteriolar density within the infarct border zone (by 297 %, 205 %, and 101 % vs phosphate-buffered saline, mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cell, and mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cell/endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cell treatment, respectively; P <. 01). Postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cell: 68. 3 % ± 9. 8 % vs mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cell/endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cell: 55. 0 % ± 11. 1 %, mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cell: 53. 0 % ± 6. 0 %, and phosphate-buffered saline: 49. 6 % ± 9. 5 %) and fractional shortening (endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cell: 32. 4 % ± 5. 1 % vs mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cell: 22. 5 % ± 5. 4 % and phosphate-buffered saline: 21. 3 % ± 5. 3 %) were greater in endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cell–treated rats versus those receiving other treatments (all P <. 05). Only endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cells prevented further contractile deterioration compared with baseline values (P =. 8), whereas other groups had continued loss of function after treatment. ConclusionCompared with the use of mesenchymal <b>progenitor</b> cells, cell transplantation with endothelial <b>progenitor</b> cells after myocardial infarction resulted in better neovascularization and contractility. This suggests that angiogenesis is an important mechanism in attenuating the progression of left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction...|$|R

40|$|An {{appropriate}} liver-specific <b>progenitor</b> cell marker is {{a stepping}} stone in liver regenerative medicine. Here, we report brain isoform glycogen phosphorylase (GPBB) as a novel liver <b>progenitor</b> cell marker. GPBB was identified in a protein complex precipitated by a monoclonal antibody Ligab generated from a rat liver <b>progenitor</b> cell line Lig- 8. Immunoblotting results show that GPBB was expressed in two liver <b>progenitor</b> cell lines Lig- 8 and WB-F 344. The levels of GPBB expression decreased in the WB-F 344 cells under sodium butyrate (SB) -induced cell differentiation, consistent with roles of GPBB as a liver <b>progenitor</b> cell marker. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) -mediated GPBB knockdown followed by glucose deprivation test shows that GPBB aids in liver <b>progenitor</b> cell survival under low glucose conditions. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated GPBB knockdown followed by SB-induced cell differentiation shows that reducing GPBB expression delayed liver <b>progenitor</b> cell differentiation.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{size and}} cell number of each brain region are {{influenced}} by the organization and behavior of neural <b>progenitor</b> cells during embryonic development. Recent studies on developing neocortex have revealed the presence of neural <b>progenitor</b> cells that divide away from the ventricular surface and undergo symmetric divisions to generate either two neurons or two <b>progenitor</b> cells. These 'basal' <b>progenitor</b> cells form the subventricular zone and are responsible for generating the majority of neocortical neurons. However, not much has been studied on similar types of <b>progenitor</b> cells in other brain regions. Results We have identified and characterized basal <b>progenitor</b> cells in the embryonic mouse thalamus. The <b>progenitor</b> domain that generates all of the cortex-projecting thalamic nuclei contained a remarkably high proportion of basally dividing cells. Fewer basal <b>progenitor</b> cells were found in other <b>progenitor</b> domains that generate non-cortex projecting nuclei. By using intracellular domain of Notch 1 (NICD) as a marker for radial glial cells, we found that basally dividing cells extended outside the lateral limit of radial glial cells, indicating that, similar to the neocortex and ventral telencephalon, the thalamus has a distinct subventricular zone. Neocortical and thalamic basal <b>progenitor</b> cells shared expression of some molecular markers, including Insm 1, Neurog 1, Neurog 2 and NeuroD 1. Additionally, basal <b>progenitor</b> cells in each region also expressed exclusive markers, such as Tbr 2 in the neocortex and Olig 2 and Olig 3 in the thalamus. In Neurog 1 / Neurog 2 double mutant mice, the number of basally dividing <b>progenitor</b> cells in the thalamus was significantly reduced, which demonstrates the roles of neurogenins in the generation and/or maintenance of basal <b>progenitor</b> cells. In Pax 6 mutant mice, the part of the thalamus that showed reduced Neurog 1 / 2 expression also had reduced basal mitosis. Conclusions Our current study establishes the existence of a unique and significant population of basal <b>progenitor</b> cells in the thalamus and their dependence on neurogenins and Pax 6. These <b>progenitor</b> cells may have important roles in enhancing the generation of neurons within the thalamus and may also be critical for generating neuronal diversity in this complex brain region. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRetinal <b>progenitor</b> {{cells are}} {{believed}} to display altered proliferation and differentiation during retinal development, suggesting that retinal <b>progenitor</b> cell populations are not homogeneous. However, the composition of <b>progenitor</b> cell populations is not known, {{due in part to}} the lack of known surface markers identifying distinct stages of retinal <b>progenitor</b> cells. We found a dramatic change in the expression profile of the cell surface antigens c-kit and stage-specific embryonic antigen- 1 (SSEA- 1) in retinal <b>progenitor</b> cells during development. While SSEA- 1 was expressed early in development, c-kit expression peaked in late stage <b>progenitor</b> cells. The identification of these developmental markers enabled us to characterize distinct sub-populations of retinal <b>progenitor</b> cells. <b>Progenitor</b> cell subpopulations expressing either SSEA- 1, c-kit, or both showed different proliferation and differentiation abilities. Although SSEA- 1 -positive cells were augmented by β-catenin signaling, c-kit-positive cells were positively regulated by Notch signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that c-kit and SSEA- 1 can be used to spatiotemporally differentiate retinal <b>progenitor</b> populations that have intrinsically distinct characteristics. Prolonged expression of c-kit by a retrovirus resulted in the promotion of proliferation and the appearance of nestin-positive cells in the presence of the c-kit ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). This suggests a role for c-kit, Notch, and the β-catenin signaling network in retinal development...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} supports {{the role of}} stem and <b>progenitor</b> cells in vascular regeneration or injury. Following tissue ischemia, <b>progenitor</b> cells are mobilized from their bone marrow or peripheral niches into circulation, adhere at sites of vascular lesion and differentiate {{into a variety of}} mature cell types according to their origin and the local environment. Impairment in this pathophysiological process due to either low numbers of circulating <b>progenitor</b> cells or dysfunctional <b>progenitor</b> cells leads to inadequate vascular repair and upon co-existence with different cardiovascular risk factors to vascular injury and atherosclerosis. Vascular repair is a complex process which includes mobilization, chemotaxis, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of <b>progenitor</b> cells. The common cardiovascular risk factors can impair this process resulting into inhibition of vascular healing and enhancement of inflammatory pathways which ultimately leads to atherosclerosis. Although homing of <b>progenitor</b> cells into bone marrow has been extensively studied, domiciliation of precursor cells into peripheral tissues and differentiation into mature cells are poorly understood so far.

The processes involved in the self-renewal of this cell population remain to be defined. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study in situ and in vitro hAT <b>progenitor</b> cell (defined as CD 34 (+) /CD 31 (-) cells) proliferation. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In situ <b>progenitor</b> cell proliferation was assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analyses on hAT from lean to obese subjects using the proliferation marker Ki- 67. The effects of adipokines, hypoxia, and conditioned media (CM) from adipocytes, capillary endothelial cells, and macrophages isolated by an immunoselection approach were studied on hAT <b>progenitor</b> cell growth. Cell death in hAT was assessed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein end labeling method. RESULTS: Ki- 67 -positive staining was observed in AT <b>progenitor</b> cells. Fat mass enlargement in obese patients was {{associated with an increased}} Ki- 67 (+) <b>progenitor</b> cell population together with a new fraction of small adipocytes and increased cell death. HIF- 1 alpha mRNA expression in freshly harvested <b>progenitor</b> cells was positively correlated with body mass index.
