30|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} for many researchers is that precursor syndromes or putative risk factors reported in retrospective studies of prodromes and prospective studies of risk syndromes may overlap. A classic {{example is the}} high frequency of anxiety disorders reported in individuals who develop BD. In retrospective studies of individuals with an established diagnosis of BD, up to 75 % of cases may report anxiety as {{a feature of the}} prodromal phase. However, this finding does not mean that prospectively, 75 % of individuals with anxiety will develop BD (under a given set of circumstances). <b>Prospective</b> <b>follow-ups</b> demonstrate that, not only is anxiety a non-specific risk factor for BD (being part of the developmental trajectory of a range of mental disorders), but also that it actually occurs more frequently prior to the first onset of UP and of psychosis (in many studies) (e.g. Kim-Cohen et al. 2003; Rubino et al. 2009). So, although a symptom might be an important feature of prodrome (e.g. increasing risk of relapse), and have high prevalence in those with the diagnosis, its utility as a core feature of BAR that prospectively predicts onset of the disorder is largely determined by its specificity.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To compare two {{management}} strategies for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, and evaluate reproducibility of the diagnosis. Patients and Methods: Ninety (90) women with biopsy-proven CIN 2 diagnosed through the Brazilian {{public health service}} were randomly allocated into two groups: 45 in <b>prospective</b> <b>follow-up</b> without treatment, and 45 for radical loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LLETZ). As in the real-life situation, pathology-reviewed diagnoses and HPV genotypes were not available. Results: Excision of the lesion {{proved to be more}} effective than <b>prospective</b> <b>follow-up</b> in reaching clearance of CIN 2 (hazard ratio= 3. 66; 95 % confidence interval 2. 02 - 6. 64).

Conclusion: CIN 2 lesions regress without treatment in one year, although an ablative procedure is more effective. However, excision of CIN 2 may lead to additional morbidity and costs, and tailoring the management on an individual basis may result in better outcome. Misclassification of CIN 2 is not a negligible problem...|$|E
