A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates <b>perching.</b> Sometimes known as <b>perching</b> birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. The order has roughly twice as many species as Rodentia, the largest order of mammals. There are more than 110 families of passerine birds, the second-most of any tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).|$|E

The yellow <b>perch</b> was described in 1814 by Samuel Latham Mitchill from New York. Yellow <b>perch</b> are closely related, and morphologically similar to the European <b>perch</b> (Perca fluviatilis); however, the two are recognized as independent species based on anatomical and genetic differences.

50|$|If neither player {{controls}} the tie-breaker <b>perch,</b> then the tie {{goes to the}} aggressor. The losing card is removed, along with any jaguars. There are certain <b>perches</b> that allow for special abilities or extra points. The 1 point <b>perch</b> is a Tie-breaker <b>perch,</b> allowing the controlling player to win ties. The 3 point <b>perch</b> is the Vision Roof and it allows a player who wins the <b>perch</b> {{to look at a}} face down card of an opponent. The 8 point <b>perch</b> is special, in that it is made up of two <b>perches.</b> If a single player controls both of the <b>perches,</b> he gains an additional 3 points (for a total of 19). The game ends when each player has played through their deck. Player tally their scores, and gain points for <b>perches</b> they control with birds. However, a <b>perch</b> controlled with a jaguar does not gain the player points. The player with the most points wins the round.|$|R

50|$|<b>Perch</b> is {{a common}} name for fish of the genus Perca, {{freshwater}} gamefish belonging to the family Percidae.

Many species of freshwater gamefish more or less resemble <b>perch,</b> but belong to different genera. In fact, the exclusively saltwater dwelling red drum {{is often referred to as}} a red <b>perch,</b> though by definition <b>perch</b> are freshwater fish.

40|$|Ambient ultraviolet-B {{radiation}} can harm amphibian eggs, larvae and adults. However, some amphibians avoid UV-B radiation {{when given}} the opportunity. The strawberry poison dart frog, Oophaga pumilio, is diurnal and males vocalize {{throughout the day}} in light gaps under forest canopies that expose them to solar radiation. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} males calling from high <b>perches</b> are more successful at mating than those at lower <b>perches.</b> We investigated whether frogs at higher <b>perches</b> receive more ultraviolet-B than those calling from lower <b>perches.</b> We also investigated whether frogs on <b>perches</b> receiving relatively low ultraviolet-B levels maintained their positions for longer compared to individuals calling from <b>perches</b> receiving higher levels of ultraviolet-B. Finally, since it has been hypothesized that some animals utilize levels of UV-A as a visual cue to avoid UV-B damage, we artificially elevated ultraviolet-A levels to examine whether males exposed to artificially elevated ultraviolet-A abandoned their <b>perches</b> sooner compared to males exposed to visible light. We found that frogs called from <b>perches</b> receiving low ultraviolet-B regardless of <b>perch</b> height, and that frogs maintain their positions longer on <b>perches</b> receiving low ultraviolet-B compared to <b>perches</b> receiving even slightly higher ultraviolet-B levels. Exposing the frogs to artificially elevated levels of ultraviolet-A radiation caused males to move off of their <b>perches</b> faster than when they were exposed to a control light source.

40|$|I {{studied the}} effects of temperature, pH, {{competition}} and predation on Eurasian <b>perch</b> (Perca fluviatilis) in 30 lakes in Norway during 1981 - 2001. The study lakes were situated in two different areas in southern Norway; four lakes in Aust-Agder county in southernmost Norway were explored during 1981 - 1984 and 26 lakes in Hedmark county in south-eastern Norway were investigated during 1992 - 2001. The study lakes varied considerably in pH, temperature, fish species composition, and <b>perch</b> abundance and size composition. In addition to field surveys, behavioural studies of <b>perch</b> were conducted at Karlstad University in 2006 - 2007. The field studies revealed that temperature affected recruitment of <b>perch</b> as strong year-classes of <b>perch</b> generally occurred in summers with high temperatures. Temperature also affected <b>perch</b> behaviour {{as indicated by the}} low gillnet catches (CPUE) of <b>perch</b> atlow temperature. This effect on CPUE was also supported by results from the aquaria experiments, where swimming and feeding activity of <b>perch</b> was low at low temperature. In a study of four lakes, growth was positively related to temperature in the lake with an allopatric <b>perch</b> population, but not in three lakes where <b>perch</b> occurred sympatrically with roach. pH also affected recruitment. In the four lakes in Aust-Agder, one strong year-class of <b>perch</b> occurred in all lakes in a year with especially high pH in spring and early summer. Adult mortality was also affected by pH, as old <b>perch</b> were less abundant in lakes with late spring pH= 5. 5 - 5. 8 than in lakes with pH 5. 8. The size and growth of adult <b>perch</b> were negatively affected by low pH, whereas abundance of large, potentially predatory <b>perch</b> was positively related to pH. The field studies indicated that roach influence <b>perch</b> populations. When coexisting with roach, <b>perch</b> were mainly littoral. In lakes where roach dominated (by number), there was no growth – temperature correlation, but there was such a correlation in lakes without roach. In lakes with sympatric roach, age-specific weight of <b>perch</b> and the growth of 2 + <b>perch</b> were negatively related to the proportion of roach in the gillnet catches. In the aquaria experiments, swimming and feeding activity of <b>perch</b> were lower than that of roach at all temperatures tested, and the difference was most pronounced at 4 and 8 °C. The aquaria experiments indicated that <b>perch</b> had a lower feeding efficiency and that they generally occupied positions closer to the bottom than roach...|$|R
