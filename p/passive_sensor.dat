500|$|While the {{electronic}} barrier program in Laos {{became the most}} visible part of the anti-infiltration program, the physical barrier project in South Vietnam was largely abandoned after 1968 in favor of mobile operations. The SPOS outlined in the original Dyemarker plan envisioned a virtual defensive wall stretching from the South China Sea to Dong Ha Mountain. The plan called for a fence, a line of twin steel apron and barbed steel tape, an anti-personnel mine field, a <b>passive</b> <b>sensor</b> detection system, and another line of twin steel apron and barbed steel tape, to [...] "trace" [...] this path, providing a physical obstacle to enemy infiltration. Observation posts and towers would line the route, and six specifically designed strong points would be constructed, with associated battalion base areas. A combined force of a single US Marine Corps Regiment and a single ARVN Regiment were to man these positions.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of remote sensing. <b>Passive</b> <b>sensors</b> detect natural {{radiation}} that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding area being observed. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by <b>passive</b> <b>sensors.</b> Examples of <b>passive</b> remote <b>sensors</b> include film photography, infra-red, charge-coupled devices, and radiometers. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. radar, lidar, and SODAR are examples of active remote sensing techniques used in atmospheric physics where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, height, speed and direction of an object.|$|R
50|$|The Kolchuga (Кольчуга Chainmail) <b>passive</b> <b>sensor</b> is an ESM system {{developed}} in the Soviet Union and manufactured in Ukraine. Its detection range is limited by line-of-sight but may be up to 800 km for very high altitude, very powerful emitters. Frequently referred to as Kolchuga Radar, {{the system is not}} really a radar, but an ESM system comprising three or four receivers, deployed tens of kilometres apart, which detect and track aircraft by triangulation and multilateration of their RF emissions.|$|E
5000|$|Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is {{a process}} to {{determine}} {{the position of a}} target using <b>passive</b> <b>sensor</b> information. Sensors like passive [...] RADAR and [...] SONAR provide directional and occasionally frequency information. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases. There are two different ways to execute TMA: manual and automated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{detection}} range {{is one of}} the best in its class, but it is highly dependent on the emitted power of the transmitter being tracked, and requires satisfaction of the line of sight condition to at least two receiving sites for triangulation (compared with three sites for a multilateration system such as the VERA <b>passive</b> <b>sensor).</b> A Kolchuga complex can detect and locate air and surface targets and trace their movement to a range generally limited only by the common line-of-sight of the stations. Assuming no terrain masking, the line-of-sight range of a single Kolchuga station (in km) is approximately (Skolnik 1981): ...|$|E
30|$|Passive {{surveillance}} has {{the advantage}} of covertness, and <b>passive</b> <b>sensors</b> are typically smaller, cheaper, and lower power than their active counterparts. This allows <b>passive</b> <b>sensors</b> to be utilised in scenarios that would preclude the deployment of active sensors (e.g. such as in remote operations). Passive measurement exploitation has a long history, beginning with angle-of-arrival (AOA) emitter localisation [8]. Other commonly used passive measurements include time-of-arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), frequency of arrival (FOA), and combinations thereof (e.g. again, see [1] and references therein).|$|R

40|$|Since 2000, {{there have}} been a number of {{spaceborne}} satellites that have changed the way we assess and predict natural hazards.

Most of these satellites contain active or <b>passive</b> <b>sensors</b> that can be utilized by the scientific community for the remote sensing of natural hazards over a number of spatial and temporal scales. The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0. 6 m to 1 m pixel size) <b>passive</b> <b>sensors</b> and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution <b>passive</b> <b>sensors</b> have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from <b>passive</b> and active <b>sensors.</b> Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times.
