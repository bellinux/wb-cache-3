50|$|As {{in other}} sectors, {{industrial}} relations under the Thatcher Government {{continued to be}} conflictual. Successive Health Ministers looked to hold down pay {{in the public sector}} and to outsource ancillary staff where possible. Following the 1983 Griffiths Report, the NHS also tried to import a business model more similar to the private sector with professional managers taking over cost control, reducing the power of the medical profession. There were disputes over all of these policies. In 1982 there was another conflict over <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> involving ancillaries and nurses. Campaigning by NUPE, COHSE and RCN won an interim pay rise for nurses who were also granted their own independent pay review body, as the doctors had been 20 years earlier.

50|$|Major strike {{action by}} British unions during the 1978 - 1979 Winter of Discontent {{contributed to the}} {{downfall}} of the Labour government of James Callaghan. Callaghan, himself a trade-unionist, had previously appealed for unions to exercise <b>pay</b> <b>restraint,</b> as part of the British Government's policies at the time to try to curb rampant inflation. His attempt to try to limit unions to a 5% pay rise led to widespread official and unofficial strikes across the country during the winter of that year. Official and unofficial strike action by lorry drivers, rail workers, nurses and ambulance drivers precipitated a feeling of crisis in the country. The effects of the union action caused a major swing in voting intention. In November 1978, a Gallup poll suggested a 5% Labour lead in the opinion polls. Following the union action that Winter, in February 1979, the Conservatives had a 20% lead.|$|R
40|$|Summary. The major {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the applicability of multicriteria evaluation methods to automobile restraint types of transportation projects. The examination was performed through applying the three multicriteria evaluation methods-concordance analysis, the goals-achievement matrix and the compromise solution-to automobile <b>restraint</b> <b>policies</b> in the context of Seoul, Korea. The results of the research show that the methods employed have, despite certain drawbacks, considerable potential for assisting the decision-maker and others concerned with the transportation decision-making process. Their major advantage over traditional transportation evaluation methods is that they allow the consideration of a wider range of costs and benefits. The empirical analysis also illustrates the usefulness of including qualitative criteria into the evaluation framework without transforming them to a monetary dimension. I...|$|R
40|$|When Jimmy Carter became {{president}} in January 1977, {{he took office}} with the stated objective of making both US {{domestic and foreign policy}} more humane and morale. The ambitious foreign policy objectives would be reached through addressing global issues such as human rights, economic development in third world countries, environmental problems and reduction of world-wide transfers of conventional weapons. During the presidential campaign and his first year in office, Carter committed himself to trying to reduce the world’s arms trade. This policy was planned to be realized through unilateral measures and multilateral negotiations, and by rationalizing the Executive Branch’s arms transfer decision-making process. The Administration worked out a conventional arms transfer <b>restraint</b> <b>policy</b> presented in May 1977 as Presidential Directive 13 (PD- 13). PD- 13 set out six unilateral control mechanism designed to reduce American sales of military material. The restrictions applied for all weapon importing states except NATO members, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. The thesis focuses on two main questions: a) to what extent was the arms transfer <b>restraint</b> <b>policy</b> followed up in practice; and b) if it was not fully implemented, why? Carter hoped that unilateral restraint combined with multilateral negotiations and comprehensive agreements would result in other weapon producing states following USA’s lead. Because the arms transfer <b>restraint</b> <b>policy</b> was planned based upon both unilateral measures and multilateral negotiations, the thesis looks at both aspects of the subject. How they affected each other, and to what extent the unilateral arms control measures rested upon success in negotiating multilateral restraint regimes. The only major arms supplier the Carter Administration managed to involve in serious discussions on the topic was the Soviet Union. The Conventional Arms Transfer Talks between the two superpowers lasted from December 1977 to December 1978, when they broke down without producing any agreements. These talks were not only important in themselves, but were also consequential because the West European weapon producers had based their willingness on participating in multilateral agreements upon Soviet seriousness in reducing their weapon sales. Because the Administration’s efforts at engaging other arms producing countries in arms transfer reductions were unavailing, and were abandoned in late- 1978, {{the focus is on the}} implementation on the unilateral policy. In eight case studies, the thesis examines the Carter Administration’s arms transfer policy toward Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Yemen, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Korea, Taiwan and the whole of Latin America. U. S. arms transfer policy to these countries and regions during the Carter Presidency are discussed in relation to how they corresponded to the policy spelled out in PD- 13, and how they differed in respect to previous presidents’ policies...|$|R

The union strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners.

The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to free collective bargaining as they were promised.

50|$|The general {{election}} {{at the end}} of February 1974 resulted in a hung parliament where Labour had slightly more seats than any other party but no overall majority. The Conservatives tried to negotiate a coalition with the Liberal Party but failed and Edward Heath's government resigned.

Wilson called a second election for October 1974, which gave Labour a wafer-thin majority of three MPs. The Labour Government implemented <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> to control global inflation, coupled with stagnation and unemployment at record post-war levels. Wilson resigned in 1976 in poorer health, on turning 60, and James Callaghan became Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister. By-elections and defections whittled away Labour's majority, which technically was non-existent by April 1976 in the House of Commons after a by-election defeat, the defection of two Labour MPs to form the Scottish Labour Party and the defection of backbencher John Stonehouse.|$|R
