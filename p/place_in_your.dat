500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sands of Time {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon launch. Edge said that, despite difficulty spikes caused by respawning enemies, [...] "the game cannot be commended highly enough". IGN's Matt Casamassina found the entire experience enjoyable, saying that [...] "Whether you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan or {{somebody with a}} mild interest in action-adventures, The Sands of Time is a must own -- a soon-to-be-classic worthy of a permanent <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> collection". 1UP.com, while pointing out the camera control as [...] "tricky", said that the game [...] "will make your chest explode if you've got a heart condition (in a good way, of course)". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When {{the whole thing is}} over, it's perfectly timed to leave you wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement that makes you feel happy to be a gamer." [...] Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS2 version a good review, saying that the action was smooth and challenging, bearing similarities to the original Prince of Persia, and one reviewer found the Prince [...] "colourful".|$|E
