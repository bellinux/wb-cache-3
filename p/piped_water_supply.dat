Carrick never grew large—the {{population}} varied from around 200 to 439—and {{today it is}} largely a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage, though reticulated services for both are now connected. Volunteer labour enabled <b>piped</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> from the Liffey, from 1961 and a sewerage plant {{was built in the}} mid-1970s on the towns outskirts.

It supplied water to approximately 4500 of the 14,000 houses, generating an income £5000 a year. HMS Victorys active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a depot ship. The town of Gosport contributed £75 a year towards the ship's maintenance. In 1818, John Pounds began teaching working class children in the country's first ragged school. In 1820, the Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas street lighting throughout the town, followed by Old Portsmouth three years later.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{to improve}} potable water accessibility and sustainability through efficient management of <b>pipe</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system {{a case study of}} Uganda, Kampala region. Kampala the capital city of Uganda still faces a challenge to access clean potable <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>supply</b> coverage is 77. 5 % showing at least 22. 5 % of the total population has limited access to potable drinking water causing a gap between <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>water</b> demand. Hypotheses of the paper were that the city's population is increasing rapidly with an annual urbanization rate of 4. 8 % this has put pressure on the <b>pipe</b> <b>water</b> infrastructure in terms of expansion and maintenance. Also the functioning pipes in place are too few to provide enough water for the growing population demand. The paper aimed at identifying and prioritizing possible policies on how the gap between the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and consumer <b>water</b> demand could be reduced. In that respect a review of both the current <b>pipe</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system was modelled using a system dynamics approach to allow model and policy testing through computer simulations as well as to validate the different hypotheses. The results showed that the increase in functioning pipes would greatly improve potable <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> however this can only be done with enough available funds. The water board management can achieve this through donations from non-government organizations, loans and customer support in terms of paying their water bills...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 20 th May 2019 © 2017 Academy of Social Sciences This article {{considers}} how to reconcile ambitious UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for universal <b>piped</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> with developing country realities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A concise process for effective reviews of medium-term national targets is proposed and is applied {{in an analysis}} of the current provision of <b>piped</b> <b>water</b> to households and shared community facilities in urban and rural settings in Uganda. Different disciplinary perspectives are adopted to review trends, the performance of key stakeholders and their scope for achieving new targets. Only about 5 % of households have <b>piped</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> on their premises in rural areas in SSA. To achieve the SDG target of 100 % coverage will, therefore, take a long time and requires continued support for the sustainability of community water facilities as a priority. The SDGs offer sensible long-term aims, but national medium-term target setting and reviewing remain critical and require realistic and systematic planning approaches, as well as careful global reporting of national performance against SDG targets. The authors argue that balanced incentives are needed to encourage stakeholders to strive for realistic targets in the medium term, without demotivating countries with limited capacities and resources...|$|R
