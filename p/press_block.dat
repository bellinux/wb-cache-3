40|$|The {{seedlings}} {{were produced}} {{according to two}} methodologies: <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> and stiff plastic tubes. A mixture of decomposed sugar-cane bagasse (60 %) and industrial sugar-cane plant residues (40 %) were used as substrate. The blocks were made by pressing the humid substrate in metallic moulds with the dimensions of 60 x 40 x 20 cm (lenght, width and height) and pressure of 10 kgf/cm 2 for 15 minutes. Under this load the blocks height was reduced to 10 cm. They were placed in wooden boxes with screen bottom. The stiff plastic tubes had circular section 12 cm high, with volume capacity of 50 cm 3. The seeds were sown in the blocks 5 cm apart, {{by means of a}} spatula. At the end of nursey phase, the seedlings were planted the field. After 2, 6 and 10 months of planting, the height and the diameter at the ground level were evaluated. At the age of 10 months it was also evaluated the number of laterals root and deformatiom cofficient the three plants for treatment. Two months after planting, the plants originated from the <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> showed growth highly signifficant in relation to those of the stiff plastic tubes. At 10 months, of age only Eucalyptus grandis seedlings showed significant difference concerning to height and diameter at the ground level between plants produced by <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> and stiff plastic tubes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the outplanting growth of Eucalyptus grandis e E. saligna clones, produced by cuttings in tubes (50 cm³) and in <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> (40 x 60 x 07 cm) - 175 cm³/ seedlings, with different substrates (BT - sugarcane bagasse+sugarcane filter cake; AR - carbonized rice hull + eucalyptus bark; TF - peat). The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design, in a 2 x 7 factorial (2 clones and 7 treatments), with four replicates with 25 plants. Survival was evaluated two months later. Plant growth was monitored through height and ground level diameter at 20, 40, 60, 120 and 180 days after outplanting. To evaluate {{the effect of the}} containers on stem and root biomass in both clones, 180 days after outplanting, the cuttings grown in BT substrate with fertilizer were selected. One plant per plot of each clone, grown in tubes and in <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> was selected. The E. grandis and E. saligna cuttings grown in <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> with sugarcane bagasse+sugarcane filter cake presented greater height and diameter after out planting. Both clones presented larger root, bark, log and branch biomass production in plants produced in the block system. Cuttings of E. saligna grown in <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> showed 80 % most wood biomass 180 days after outplanting, compared to that grown in tubes. In E. grandis, the differences in diameter and height, in function of the cutting production system, decreased along time, while in E. saligna these differences increased along the evaluation period...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the growth and the levels of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in Australian cedar seedlings which had been inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in different types of containers. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a greenhouse and the experimental design was that of randomized complete blocks (RCB), with a 4 x 4 factorial design consisting of four inoculation treatments with AMF (Rhizophagus clarum, Gigaspora margarita, a mixed inoculation (R. clarum + G. margarita) and the control (with no AMF inoculation); four types of containers (plastic bags measuring 250 cm 3, tubes of 55 and 130 cm 3 and <b>pressed</b> <b>blocks</b> 440 cm 3. plant- 1), with four repetitions. The height, the diameter of the stem base, the aerial part dry weight (APDW), the dry weight of the root (DWR) and the total plant dry weight (DW) were measured, along with the Dickson quality index, the percentage of mycorrhizal colonization and the levels of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in the aerial part dry weight. One hundred and thirty eight days (138) days after sowing, the greatest growth and/or the highest levels of P, K and Ca could be observed in the aerial part dry weight of the Australian cedar seedlings which had been planted in the <b>pressed</b> <b>block</b> container and inoculated with a mixture of the two AMF species (G. margarita + R. clarum) or with just R. clarum.
