5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a <b>precondition</b> <b>for</b> baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a <b>precondition</b> <b>for</b> vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examined}} <b>preconditions</b> <b>for</b> unsafe acts of employees. Studies {{relevant to}} <b>preconditions</b> <b>for</b> unsafe acts of employees were selected {{out of the}} numerous studies reviewed; through a rigorous process. The results from the literature study were analyzed using content analysis to obtain specific issues {{that are relevant to}} the root causes of preconditions of unsafe acts of employees. Based on the identified causes of unsafe acts, needs are clearly defined and strategies are proposed to control errors and violations in the construction industry. Findings from the study reveal that <b>preconditions</b> <b>for</b> unsafe acts are caused by three factors: namely, environmental factors, condition of operators, and personnel factors. The study explores <b>preconditions</b> <b>for</b> unsafe acts of employees in the building construction industry...|$|R

5|$|Between 1964 and 1970, Weizsäcker {{served as}} President of the German Evangelical Church Assembly. He {{was also a}} member of the Synod and the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany from 1967–1984. During his early tenure as President, he wrote a {{newspaper}} article supporting a memorandum written by German evangelical intellectuals including Werner Heisenberg and his brother Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker who had spoken out in favour of accepting the Oder–Neisse line as the western border of Poland as an indispensable <b>precondition</b> <b>for</b> lasting peace in Europe. While this was met by negative reactions from politicians, especially in Weizsäcker's own party, he nevertheless led the Evangelical Church on a way to promoting reconciliation with Poland, leading to a memorandum by the Church in both West and East Germany. The paper was widely discussed and met with a significantly more positive response.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a <b>precondition</b> <b>for</b> world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} first {{presented}} to the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević. Milošević found the plan wholly acceptable and promised he would ensure {{the leadership of the}} RSK eventually supported it. He endorsed the plan because it ensured the preservation of Serbian territorial gains of 1991, retained Croatian Serb administration of the areas where the peacekeepers would be deployed and allowed the JNA to shift its focus to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vance then met Yugoslav defence minister JNA General Veljko Kadijević, who also endorsed the plan and was apparently urged by Milošević to do so. After the plan was accepted by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and Kadijević in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. The Accord was a <b>precondition</b> <b>for</b> the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force. It comprised four provisions; the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks, the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian aid.|$|E

5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary <b>precondition</b> <b>for</b> the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|This did {{not deter}} Margaret of York, Duchess of BurgundyEdward's sister and Elizabeth's auntand {{members of the}} de la Pole familychildren of Edward's sister and John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk from {{frequent}} attempts to destabilise Henry's regime. Henry imprisoned Margaret's nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick, the son of her brother George, in the Tower of London, but in 1487 Margaret financed a rebellion led by Lambert Simnel pretending to be Edward. John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, joined the revolt, probably anticipating that it would further his own ambitions to the throne, but {{he was killed in}} the suppression of the uprising at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487. Warwick was implicated by two further failed invasions supported by Margaret using Perkin Warbeck pretending to be Edward IV's son Richard of Shrewsbury, and Warbeck's later planned escape for them both; Warwick was executed in 1499. Edward's execution may simply have been a <b>precondition</b> <b>for</b> the marriage of Arthur, Prince of Wales to Katherine of Aragon in 1501.|$|E
