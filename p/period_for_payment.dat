40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{assessed}} {{performance of}} the Ga District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme over the period 2007 - 2009. MethodsThe desk review method was used to collect secondary data on membership coverage, revenue, expenditure, and claims settlement patterns of the scheme. A household survey was also conducted in the Madina Township by using a self-administered semi-structured questionnaire to determine community coverage of the scheme. ResultsThe study showed membership coverage of 21. 8 % and community coverage of 22. 2 %. The main reasons why respondents had not registered with the scheme are that contributions are high {{and it does not}} offer the services needed. Financially, the scheme depended largely on subsidies and reinsurance from the National Health Insurance Authority for 89. 8 % of its revenue. Approximately 92 % of the total revenue was spent on medical claims, and 99 % of provider claims were settled beyond the stipulated 4 -week period. ConclusionsThere is an increasing trend in medical claims expenditure and lengthy delay in claims settlements, with most of them being paid beyond the mandatory 4 -week period. Introduction of cost-containment measures including co-payment and capitation payment mechanism would be necessary to reduce the escalating cost of medical claims. Adherence to the 4 -week stipulated <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of medical claims would be important to ensure that health care providers are financially resourced to deliver continuous health services to insured members. Furthermore, resourcing the scheme would be useful for speedy vetting of claims and also, community education on the National Health Insurance Scheme to improve membership coverage and revenue from the informal sector...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the inventory model for a retailer under two levels of trade credit to reflect the supply chain management. Supplier offers trade credit period of M to the retailer while in turn retailer provides a trade credit period of N to his/her customers. The supplier is willing to provide the retailer a full trade credit <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>payments</b> and the retailer offers the partial trade credit period to his/her customers. Here, selling items are considered as perishable items such as fruits, fresh fishes, gasoline, photographic films, etc. so that its potential worth decreases. It is assumed that decay in potential worth of items can be increased by using preservation technology. The demand is considered as the function of selling price and trade credit. Ordering cost can be reducing due to learning by doing phenomenon. By applying convex fractional programming results, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions of an optimal solution. Some theorems are developed to determine retailer’s optimal ordering policies and numerical examples are given to illustrate these theorems.

40|$|The Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyAbstract A notable change in consumer financial services {{over the past few}} decades in Sri Lanka has been the growth of the use of Credit Cards, both as a mode of payment and as of revolving credit. Use of Credit Cards are sweeping through Upper, Middle and Lower Middle classes and across all age groups in Sri Lankan society. With no government intervention in regulating the issue of Credit Cards and with very faded regulations of issuing agencies and particularly without any awareness programs of Credit manipulation, this easily accessible pre paid loan scheme has the potential of driving the Middle Class, particularly the Lower Middle Class which is striving to maintain the social status and severely hampered by the rising cost of living in Sri Lanka into the deftness. / As such, the present study was focused on investigating consumer attitudes towards Credit Cards and thereby to contribute in recommending suitable corrective action to prevent economically collapsing the Middle Class of Sri Lankan society. / Main objectives of the study was to analyze the Credit Cards issuing agencies in Sri Lanka and to analyze the facilities, features and switching costs; investigate the factors that influence consumers to obtain Credit Cards; investigate consumer attitudes such as repayment behavior, responsiveness to interest rates etc, towards Credit Cards in terms of demographic factors such as age, income, education, occupation and to investigate the ways in which Credit Cards spending has changed consumer life styles. / The questionnaire-survey method was used in order to gather the information and 177 Credit Card holders have responded to the questionnaire posed to them. Findings of the study, reveals that the prestige has been the most influential factor for the consumers to obtain a Credit Card. Further, it was revealed that 80 % of the consumers have had their education up to GCE (A/L) or a Basic Degree, and 70 % of the respondents are drawing an average monthly wage of Rs. 15000. 00 - 45000. 00. It is evident that these middle class consumers are trying to maintain a social status which is difficult to be achieved with their monthly earnings. Further, the findings of the present study supports one of the hypotheses of the study, i. e., consumers are unaware of the effects of the hidden interest rates charged by the Credit Card issuers. Lack of clear understanding of using Credit Cards particularly on the interest rates charged will undoubtedly lead the consumers to deftness. It order t arrest this situation, an active social awareness programmers, which addresses on rational use of Credit Cards, calculation of interest rates, grace <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> and consumer rights when using Credit Cards need to be conducted. / As the Credit Card culture is relatively young in Sri Lanka, it may be premature to make a final conclusion on adverse effects on Sri Lankan consumers due to Credit Cards. However, the present study on consumer attitudes towards Credit Cards revealed certain problems experienced by families and the society as a whole. For example, the management of debts by the Credit Card holders too can not be considered satisfactory as the findings indicate that almost half of the Credit Card holders do not manage their debts rationally. / While there are lot of advantages in Credit Cards, some of which were discussed in this study, problems emerged are of a new kind and are require innovative solutions. Impacts of the changes in money spending, banking and purchasing activities on consumers have been observed to be different for different social classes and various age groups. In response to these new emerging problems, social welfare professionals have to be urged to gain new intervention skills and knowledge. They have to be encouraged to equip themselves with skills in credit counseling, family budgeting and financial management, so that consumers are ready to assist the increasing number of clients with such problems as well as provide preventive programs. ...|$|E

30|$|Pricing and {{ordering}} decisions play {{crucial role in}} optimizing the costs of inventory systems. So, firms try to employ these optimal decision strategies to content their customers. Recently, many researches were performed {{in the area of}} supply chain by employing pricing {{and ordering}} decisions. For instance, Abad (2003) applied the optimal pricing ordering strategies with partial backordering shortage for a deteriorating item. Arcelus et al. (2005); Liu (2006) and Zhang and Bell (2007) considered pricing and ordering problem under various assumptions. Chao et al. (2008) discussed a distribution network design problem and utilized pricing and inventory policies under trade credits. Sajadieh and Akbari Jokar (2009) examined pricing, ordering and shipment policies in a two- echelon supply chain. Xiao et al. (2010) surveyed pricing, ordering and lead time policies in a three-echelon supply chain where demand is uncertain. Shao et al. (2011) employed pricing and inventory policies in a supply chain involving a supplier and multiple retailers for single product. Thangam (2012) studied pricing and lot-sizing decisions in a supply chain model for a deteriorating product where the supplier provides the retailer a full trade credit <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>payments</b> and the retailer offers the partial trade credit to end users. Noori-daryan et al. (2014) discussed pricing and inventory policies in a four-echelon supply chain composed of a supplier, a manufacturer, a distributor and multi- retailers under rework process. Taleizadeh and Noori-daryan (2015) determined pricing, manufacturing and ordering decisions in a three-echelon supply chain including a supplier, a producer and several retailers. Therefore, some authors as Sadjadi et al. (2015), Taleizadeh and Charmchi (2015), Esmaeilzadeh and Taleizadeh (2016), Vijayashree and Uthayakumar (2017) and Sundara Rajan and Uthayakumar (2017) surveyed optimal pricing and ordering policies under different settings.|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} additions {{are made}} to the model to incorporate the Self-Sufficiency Project. 32 First, individuals on IA face several time constraints. IA recipients become eligible for SSP {{after they have been}} on Income Assistance a minimum of 12 months. Once eligible for SSP, individuals have 12 months to find employment in order to receive supplement payments. If an individual secures a job before the eligibility period ends, she can receive the supplement while employed for a maximum of 36 calendar months. Consistent with the SSP treatment implemented in the experiment, individuals have one eligibility <b>period</b> <b>for</b> the treatment. Once the eligibility <b>period</b> <b>for</b> the supplement <b>payments</b> expires, individuals return to the regular IA system. Second, eligible individuals who find work receive supplement payments that are a function of their earnings upon obtaining employment. As in the baseline version of the model, earnings increase with job tenure. One goal of the SSP is to provide workers with enough time to experience sufficient earnings growth so that employment remains an attractive alternative once the earnings supplement expires. On-the-job earnings growth, which results from increases in the surplus created in worker-firm matches in our model, captures this particular feature of the program. In the following section, we assess the ability of the calibrated model to match the main features of the experimental data.|$|R
