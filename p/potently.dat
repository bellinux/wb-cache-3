5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is <b>potently</b> inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

25|$|The {{chimpanzee}} antibody 5H2 <b>potently</b> neutralizes DENV4. Its Fab fragment was crystallized {{in complex}} with the sE protein of DENV4. Its epitope {{is included in}} domain 1 (ED1) of the E protein.|$|E
25|$|Most, if not all, of the TCAs also <b>potently</b> inhibit sodium {{channels}} and L-type calcium channels, and therefore act as sodium channel blockers and calcium channel blockers, respectively. The former property {{is responsible for}} the high mortality rate upon overdose seen with the TCAs via cardiotoxicity. It may also be involved in their efficacy as analgesics, however.|$|E
25|$|The human {{antibodies}} Ede1-C10, Ede2-A11 and Ede2-B7 <b>potently</b> neutralize {{all four}} DENV serotypes. Their Fab or scFv fragments were crystallized in complex with the sE protein of DENV2. The recognition determinants of these antibodies {{are at a}} serotype-invariant site in the E dimer interface and include the exposed side-chains of the E fusion loop and the two conserved glycan side-chains.|$|E
25|$|The Nigerian society (both {{historical}} and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural {{practices that are}} <b>potently</b> hurtful to women’s emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices. As daughters self-identify as females with their mother and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, gender stereotyping becomes institutionalized within the family unit. Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility.|$|E
25|$|Pure AR antagonists like {{flutamide}} and bicalutamide are potent progonadotropins with indirect estrogenic {{activity in}} males. This {{is because they}} block the AR in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and thereby inhibit the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. This, in turn, results in increased gonadotropin secretion, activation of gonadal steroidogenesis, and an up to 2-fold increase in testosterone levels and 2.5-fold increase in estradiol levels. Conversely, AR antagonists that are also progestogens, like cyproterone acetate, are not progonadotropic, as activation of the PR is antigonadotropic, and, indeed, cyproterone acetate is <b>potently</b> antigonadotropic in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis is a {{physiological}} process involving {{the growth of}} new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Under normal physiological conditions angiogenesis is tightly regulated and is controlled by a balance of angiogenic stimulators and angiogenic inhibitors. Tumor growth is dependent upon angiogenesis and during tumor development a sustained production of angiogenic stimulatory factors is required along with {{a reduction in the}} quantity of angiogenic inhibitory factors tumor cells produce. The cleaved and latent form of antithrombin <b>potently</b> inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in animal models. The prelatent form of antithrombin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in-vitro but to date has not been tested in experimental animal models.|$|E
25|$|After {{finding a}} novel set of analogs of thalidomide, namely 3-(1,3-dioxo-1,3 dihydroisoindol-2-yl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) propionic acid (not shown), which had PDE4 {{inhibition}} activity the work began {{to optimize the}} activity. For that purpose the researchers used a known structure moiety, 3,4-dialkoxyphenyl, that is a recognized pharmacophore in PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram (Figure 6) and roflumilast and added it onto {{the structure of the}} previously mentioned analog series. After tweaking the structure and testing different substitution at the 4-position of the phthaloyl ring and at the carboxyl acid the researchers finally landed at a molecule that <b>potently</b> inhibits PDE4 and TNF-α, which they later named apremilast (Figure 4). The S-enantiomer of apremilast was chosen since it was the more active enantiomer. Since the structure of apremilast lacks the acidic chiral hydrogen it should not racemize in vivo, unlike thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol acts {{primarily}} as an agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear steroid hormone receptor. There are two subtypes of the ER, ERα and ERβ, and estradiol <b>potently</b> binds to and activates {{both of these}} receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of gene transcription and expression in ER-expressing cells, which is the predominant mechanism by which estradiol mediates its biological effects in the body. Estradiol also acts as an agonist of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for estradiol, via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-genomic effects. Unlike {{the case of the}} ER, GPER appears to be selective for estradiol, and shows very low affinities for other endogenous estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Additional mERs besides GPER include ER-X, ERx, and Gq-mER.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of {{ketoconazole}} are sometimes harnessed {{in the treatment of}} non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800mg/day), it <b>potently</b> inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydoxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.|$|E
500|$|Nudibranch {{molluscs}} are {{the most}} commonly cited examples of aposematism in marine ecosystems, but the evidence for this has been contested, mostly because (1) there are few examples of mimicry among species, (2) many species are nocturnal or cryptic, and (3) bright colours at the red end of the colour spectrum are rapidly attenuated {{as a function of}} water depth. For example, the Spanish Dancer nudibranch (genus Hexabranchus), among the largest of tropical marine slugs, <b>potently</b> chemically defended, and brilliantly red and white, is nocturnal and has no known mimics. Mimicry is to be expected as Batesian mimics with weak defences can gain a measure of protection from their resemblance to aposematic species. Other studies have concluded that nudibranchs such as [...] the slugs of the family Phyllidiidae from Indo-Pacific coral reefs are aposematically coloured. Müllerian mimicry has been implicated in the coloration of some Mediterranean nudibranchs, all of which derive defensive chemicals from their sponge diet.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of ketanserin was a landmark in the pharmacology of 5-HT2 receptors. Ketanserin, though capable of blocking 5-HT induced platelet adhesion, however does not mediate its well-known antihypertensive action through 5-HT2 receptor family, but through its high affinity for alpha1 adrenergic receptors. It also has high affinity for H1 histaminergic receptors {{equal to that}} at 5-HT2A receptors. [...] Compounds chemically related to ketanserin such as ritanserin are more selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists with low affinity for alpha-adrenergic receptors. However, ritanserin, like most other 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, also <b>potently</b> inhibits 5-HT2C receptors.|$|E
2500|$|James Watson {{and others}} have {{proposed}} that lack of intracellular ROS {{due to a lack}} of physical exercise may contribute to the malignant progression of cancer, because spikes of ROS are needed to correctly fold proteins in the endoplasmatic reticulum and low ROS levels may thus aspecifically hamper the formation of tumor suppressor proteins. Since physical exercise induces temporary spikes of ROS, this may explain why physical exercise is beneficial for cancer patient prognosis. Moreover, high inducers of ROS such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose and carbohydrate-based inducers of cellular stress induce cancer cell death more <b>potently</b> because they exploit cancer cell high avidity for sugars.|$|E
2500|$|Wild wedge-capped {{capuchin}} monkeys (Cebus olivaceus) self-anoint with millipedes (Orthoporus dorsovittatus). Chemical {{analysis revealed}} these millipedes secrete two benzoquinones, compounds {{known to be}} <b>potently</b> repellent to insects and the secretions are thought to provide protection against insects, particularly mosquitoes (and the bot flies they transmit) during the rainy season. Millipede secretion is so avidly sought by the monkeys that up to four of them will share a single millipede. The anointment must also involve risks, since benzoquinones are toxic and carcinogenic, however, {{it is likely that}} for capuchins, the immediate benefits of self-anointment outweigh the long-term costs. [...] Secretions from these millipedes also elicit self-anointing in captive male and female tufted capuchin (C. apella) and white-faced capuchin (C. capucinus) monkeys.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Hitchings in The Evening Standard {{deemed the}} play a [...] "stirring crowd-pleaser" [...] and [...] "a <b>potently</b> {{realised}} spectacle", concluding that while [...] "undeniably bombastic fare", [...] "energy and conviction make Chariots of Fire a satisfying experience." [...] In The Stage, Mark Shenton echoed other reviews regarding the high-energy, intriguingly staged production. He emphasized in addition that [...] "the meat of the drama" [...] is the [...] "gripping human confrontation {{being played out}} at its centre, in which two young men from very different backgrounds ... are drawn into competition with each other but also a bigger one with themselves and what truly matters to each."

2500|$|In 1978 Daniel Toroitich arap Moi succeeded Jomo Kenyatta (d. 1978) {{to become}} Kenya's 2nd postcolonial president. [...] Moi's {{presidency}} {{gave rise to}} Moses Mudavadi as a <b>potently</b> influential Cabinet Minister in the Moi regime. Mudavadi was never comfortable with Khasakhala, Joshua Angatia, Martin Shikuku and other fellow Kakamega leaders. He was instrumental in rigging {{them out in the}} infamous 1988, [...] "Mlolongo elections", replacing them with his sycophants. Previously in 1987 Khasakhala had played host to then Vice President Mwai Kibaki and other leaders in what became a very successful harambee for Bunyore schools. It was during the period when Kanu was steadily sidelining Kibaki, thus anyone who associated with him was perceived to be an anti-establishment. The event attracted many of Khasakhala's old friends including Kenneth Matiba, and a host of leaders from all walks of life. Mudavadi snubbed the event.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{positive}} reviews included Charles Spencer of The Telegraph, who raved, [...] "this is Lloyd Webber's finest show {{since the}} original Phantom, {{with a score}} blessed with superbly haunting melodies and a yearning romanticism that sent shivers racing down my spine." [...] He gave the show four stars out of five, but cautioned that [...] "The show may ultimately prove too strange, too dark, too tormented to become a massive popular hit, but I suspect its creepy allure will linger <b>potently</b> in the memory when frothier shows have been long forgotten". Paul Callan of the Daily Express also gave the show four stars, writing that Love Never Dies [...] "is an elegant and clever sequel to Phantom and deserves to have the old Adelphi Theatre filled every night with Lloyd Webber's core, usually middle-class, audiences. It is a great night out." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a conference}} of German {{physicians}} and natural scientists, most of the speakers rejected his doctrine, including the celebrated Rudolf Virchow, who was a scientist of the highest authority of his time. Virchow's great authority in medical circles contributed <b>potently</b> to Semmelweis' lack of recognition. Ede Flórián Birly, Semmelweis's predecessor as Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Pest, never accepted Semmelweis's teachings; he continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel. August Breisky, an obstetrician in Prague, rejected Semmelweis's book as [...] "naive" [...] and he {{referred to it as}} [...] "the Koran of puerperal theology". Breisky objected that Semmelweis had not proved that puerperal fever and pyemia are identical, and he insisted that other factors beyond decaying organic matter certainly had {{to be included in the}} etiology of the disease. Carl Edvard Marius Levy, head of the Copenhagen maternity hospital and an outspoken critic of Semmelweis's ideas, had reservations concerning the unspecific nature of cadaverous particles and that the supposed quantities were unreasonably small. In fact, Robert Koch later used precisely this fact to prove that various infecting materials contained living organisms which could reproduce in the human body; that is, since the poison could be neither chemical nor physical in operation, it must be biological.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the {{surprising}} discovery {{was made that}} DHEA, as well as DHEA-S, directly bind to and activate the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors of neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with high affinity. DHEA was subsequently also found to bind to the TrkB and TrkC with high affinity, though it notably activated the TrkC but not the TrkB. DHEA and DHEA-S bound to these receptors with affinities {{that were in the}} low nanomolar range (around 5nM), although the affinities were nonetheless approximately two orders of magnitude lower relative to highly potent polypeptide neurotrophins like NGF (0.01–0.1nM). In any case, DHEA and DHEA-S both circulate at requisite concentrations to activate these receptors and were thus identified as important endogenous neurotrophic factors. They have since been labeled [...] "steroidal microneurotrophins", due to their small-molecule and steroidal nature relative to their polypeptide neurotrophin counterparts. Subsequent research has suggested that DHEA and/or DHEA-S may in fact be phylogenetically ancient [...] "ancestral" [...] ligands of the neurotrophin receptors from early on {{in the evolution of the}} nervous system. The findings that DHEA binds to and <b>potently</b> activates neurotrophin receptors may explain the positive association between decreased circulating DHEA levels with age and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.|$|E
