5|$|Their {{painting}} styles {{evolved from}} the formal Neoclassical approach of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen to embrace the evolving European trends in Realism and Impressionism, including the <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> approach adopted by the Barbizon School. The artists were especially attracted by the opportunities for painting en <b>plein</b> <b>air,</b> focusing on {{the activities of the}} local fishermen and their modest cottages. In the absence of any rules within the colony, the painters freely developed their individual styles. Nevertheless, one of the interests they shared was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings, whether playing cards, celebrating or simply eating together.|$|E

5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The stacks {{belonged to}} Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing {{the way the}} light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for {{overcast}} conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled {{the scene of the}} moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en <b>plein</b> <b>air,</b> Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} representing Vršac at the Exhibition {{was originally}} meant to depict folk hero Janko Halabura fighting the Turks, {{an idea to}} which Jovanović took a liking. The Vršac council members soon changed their minds, and Jovanović was asked to paint a composition showing the everyday lives of the town's inhabitants. Over {{the course of the}} triptych's creation, Jovanović visited his hometown {{on a number of occasions}} for the purpose of sketching its people and structures. The triptych proved to be a particularly difficult undertaking. Jovanović's firm grasp in Western Medieval panel and mural painting proved of great importance. Earlier, Jovanović had been the recipient of several church commissions that called for multi-sectional painting, though not to the same extent as some of his contemporaries, such as Uroš Predić. Each scene needed to connect seamlessly with the others, and Jovanović was met with the additional challenge of painting a number of figures engaged in actions requiring precise definition. The artist addressed this by carefully drawing each figure, the landscape and the panels themselves so as to ensure compositional unity. To ensure natural light, Jovanović painted the triptych out of studio, en <b>plein</b> <b>air.</b> It took the artist about ten months to complete.|$|E

40|$|South Australians {{might still}} like to claim Adrian Mitchell {{as one of their}} own, {{despite the fact that he}} now lives in Sydney. An {{associate}} professor of English and now Honorary Associate of the University of Sydney, he has published many articles and co-edited several books on Australian literature and historiography. More recently, he has made an impressive contribution to Australian historical non-fiction, beginning with Drawing the Crow (2006), a memoir about Adelaide in the 1950 s, and continuing with Dampier’s Monkey: the South Sea Voyages of William Dampier (2010), <b>Plein</b> <b>Airs</b> and Graces: the Life and Times of George Collingridge (2012) and From Corner to Corner: the Line of Henry Colless (2015). Also published in 2015 was a novel, The Profilist: the Notebooks of Ethan Dibble, based on the life of English-born colonial artist Samuel Thomas Gill (1818 - 1880). Gill came to Adelaide in 1839, three years after its foundation. He worked as an artist in South Australia for more than a decade before heading east to the Victorian goldfields. I hadn’t met Adrian before September 2015 when this conversation took place. But I had read and enjoyed Drawing the Crow when it first appeared, and had been captivated by The Profilist’s wry and poignant depiction of the precarious life of the colonial artist. So I contacted him through his publishers, South Australia’s Wakefield Press, and he agreed to meet me when next we were in the same city at the same time. We recorded this conversation, appropriately, in the State Library of South Australia, where he has spent many hours researching the lives of his subjects...|$|R
5|$|Jovanović {{began working}} on the {{painting}} in 1900. In keeping with his usual approach, he spent {{a significant amount of}} time researching Dušan's life. He read medieval accounts of the proclamation, consulted experts on that historical period, and examined medieval paintings and illuminated manuscripts for insight into the architecture and weaponry of 14th-century Serbia. Jovanović also visited the monasteries of Gračanica and Lesnovo, the Field of Kosovo, and the cities of Prizren and Skopje. Since the church where the proclamation took place had long since been destroyed, he was forced to find an alternative, ultimately deciding to model it after the Visoki Dečani monastery given the similarities in their design. By his own admission, the hardest task Jovanović faced was achieving authenticity with regard to clothing, weaponry and medieval heraldry. He found the medieval clothing particularly difficult to reproduce because Serbs did not have their own national costume at the time. Instead, medieval Serbs, especially royalty and the nobility, wore clothing that was greatly influenced by neighbouring cultures, particularly the Byzantines. Jovanović styled the clothes seen in the painting on frescoes from the medieval monasteries he visited, sketched them, and then requested that the head costume designer of the Vienna State Opera recreate them based on those sketches. Upon receiving the costumes, Jovanović placed them in his studio and used them as models for the painting. Dušan's German mercenaries, who are shown lining the church doors church as he exits, wear Venetian body armour. Jovanović based this detail on a medieval correspondence that Novaković had discovered in the Venetian archives where Dušan is recorded having ordered 300 units of plate armour from Venice. Knights' swords and other weaponry were based on depictions from medieval frescoes. The heraldry depicted on the shields and the insignia of the various figures is based on examples from a medieval book titled Armaila Illyricorum. Jovanović had found the book in a Viennese library. It had been removed from Herzegovina's Žitomislić monastery several decades prior and brought to the Austro-Hungarian capital. The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex was painted outdoors, en <b>plein</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

25|$|He was {{influenced}} by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot. Their influence is seen in Manet's use of lighter colors: after the early 1870s he made less use of dark backgrounds but retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor (<b>plein</b> <b>air)</b> pieces, but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the studio.|$|E
25|$|Three art {{movements}} which {{contributed to}} the development of abstract art were Romanticism, Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An objective interest in what is seen, can be discerned from the paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille Corot and from them to the Impressionists who continued the <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> painting of the Barbizon school.|$|E
25|$|Manet {{became the}} friend and {{colleague}} of Berthe Morisot in 1868. She is credited with convincing Manet to attempt <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> painting, which she had been practicing since she was introduced to it by another friend of hers, Camille Corot. They had a reciprocating relationship and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In 1874, she became his sister-in-law when she married his brother, Eugène.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1860s, through the {{practice}} of painting light and water en <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> (outdoors), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect known today as diffuse reflection. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet worked side-by-side, depicting the same scenes (La Grenouillère, 1869).|$|E
25|$|This highly {{detailed}} work {{depicts a}} morning {{scene at the}} Villeneuve-l'étang park, located just outside Paris in the western suburb of Marnes-la-Coquette (Seine-et-Oise), France.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the mountain became a luxury resort and a sought-after area for the food needs of various religious communities. One of those communities, the Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel, went as far as building a school and an arboretum {{for the benefit of the}} neighboring population. In 1976, the Government of Quebec acquired part of the mountain. It established a park in 1985 that, since 1999, is managed by the Société des établissements de <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> du Québec (SÉPAQ).|$|E
25|$|Perry won {{a silver}} medal in 1892 {{exhibition}} of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association. In 1893 Perry was chosen to represent Massachusetts at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Perry had seven works displayed at the exhibition, of which four of the compositions were worked in the en <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> style (Petite Angèle, I, An Open Air Concert, Reflections, Child in a Window) and three were more formal studio portraits (Portrait of a Child, Child with a Violoncello, Portrait Study of a Child).|$|E

When completed, farm trails will add an estimated three to five miles to the six or more that already traverse the Hotchkiss Woods.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} for Quebec's other {{national}} parks (with the exception of Pingualuit and Kuururjuaq national parks, which are administered by Nunavik parks), the Mont-Saint-Bruno national park has been administered by the Société des établissements de <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> du Québec (SÉPAQ) since 1999. The SÉPAQ oversees the provision of activities and services as well as park protection and promotion. The exploitation of natural resources for forestry, mining or energy production is forbidden, as it is in any other of Quebec's parks, and so are hunting, trapping and poaching. The passage of gas or oil pipelines is also forbidden in all parks except for existing installations.|$|E
25|$|His {{first trip}} to New York and Boston as a {{professional}} artist in 1887–88 produced over twenty important commissions, including portraits of Isabella Stewart Gardner, the famed Boston art patron. His portrait of Mrs. Adrian Iselin, wife of a New York businessman, revealed her character {{in one of his}} most insightful works. In Boston, Sargent was honored with his first solo exhibition, which presented twenty-two of his paintings. Here he became friends with painter Dennis Miller Bunker who traveled to England in the summer of 1888 to paint with him en <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> and is the subject of Sargents painting 'Dennis Miller Bunker Painting at Calcot' 1888.|$|E
25|$|From 1955-60 Kipling {{studied at}} the Vancouver School of Art (now Emily Carr University of Art and Design). She studied with Jan Zack, Herbert Siebner, and Rudy Kovak before gaining her footing as an artist in the 1960s-70s, most notably with her first solo show at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1971. In the 1960s {{she moved to the}} Lynn Valley where she lived and worked for a number of years. During this period her {{interest}} in depictions of natural phenomenon grew, and she began developing her individual style which involved working in extended sessions for her <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> landscapes and sittings with models for portraiture.|$|E
25|$|Like many {{of their}} contemporaries in Europe and North America, members of the Heidelberg School adopted a direct and impressionistic style of painting. They {{regularly}} painted landscapes en <b>plein</b> <b>air,</b> and sought to depict daily life. They showed {{a keen interest in}} the effects of lighting, and experimented with a variety of brushstroke techniques. Unlike the more radical approach of the French Impressionists, the Heidelberg School painters often maintained some degree of academic emphasis on form, clarity and composition. The latter group had little direct contact with the former; for example, it was not until 1907 that McCubbin saw their works in person, which is reflected in his evolution towards a looser, more abstracted style.|$|E
25|$|William Didier-Pouget (Toulouse 14 November 1864 - Digulleville 12 September 1959) was a French artist, born in 1864, Toulouse, France, {{known for}} his {{landscape}} paintings. He focused primarily on the countryside of southern France, infusing his landscapes, always painted outdoors (en <b>plein</b> <b>air),</b> with light and color. Didier-Pouget {{is associated with the}} later phase of Impressionism, although not actually identified with the group of artists typically known as the Impressionists. His career as an exhibiting artist stems from 1886 onwards. He {{was a member of the}} Société des Artistes Français, a member of l'École de Crozant and Société des Peintres de Montagne. Also, laureate of l'Institut au Concours Troyon, Officer of the order of Nichan Iftikar (Order of Glory (Tunisia)) and Officer of the Legion of Honour.|$|E
25|$|In Karlsruhe Gude {{continued}} to faithfully reproduce the landscapes he saw, {{a style that}} he passed on to his students by taking them to Chiemsee to paint the lake en <b>plein</b> <b>air.</b> While on these trips Gude and his pupils often encountered Eduard Schleich the Elder with his own students from Munich who were, as Gude described, only out to capture {{the mood of the}} scene and were skeptical of the advantages of painting in the sunshine. Gude also took special interest in how light reflected in water while in Karlsruhe, as well as expanding his study of the human figure. Although Gude rarely portrayed humans for their own sake, he began populating his paintings with convincing, if sometimes anatomically incorrect, individuals.|$|E
25|$|Huntington {{had envisioned}} the work {{depicting}} {{a history of}} Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific 'Vision of Spain', eventually opting for {{a representation of the}} regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain. Despite the immensity of the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en <b>plein</b> <b>air,</b> and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted. He completed the final panel by July 1919.|$|E
25|$|John Glover and Eugene von Guerard {{were among}} the {{foremost}} landscape painters during the colonial era. The origins of a distinctly Australian school of painting {{is often associated with}} the Heidelberg School of the late 1800s. Major figures of the movement include Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and Frederick McCubbin. They painted en <b>plein</b> <b>air,</b> like the French Impressionists, and sought to capture the intense light and unique colours of the Australian bush. Popular works such as McCubbin's Down on His Luck (1889) and Roberts' Shearing the Rams (1890) defined an emerging sense of national identity in the lead-up to Federation. Civic monuments to national heroes were erected; an early example is Charles Summers' 1865 statue of the ill-fated explorers Burke and Wills, located in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Modigliani's {{connection}} with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli {{was not only a}} Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous Giovanni Fattori, a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint en <b>plein</b> <b>air,</b> but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist), Modigliani chose a proto-Cubist palette more akin to Cézanne than to the Macchiaioli.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, a {{group of}} Melbourne artists formed the first {{distinctive}} Australian school of painting. Named the Heidelberg School, and latterly described as Australian Impressionism, the movement's four prinicple artists were Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder and Frederick McCubbin. Together they painted en <b>plein</b> <b>air</b> at artists' camps set up around Melbourne's rural suburbs, including Box Hill and Heidelberg, allowing them to capture the unique light, colour and atmosphere of the Australian bush. Many of the group's most famous works from this period are large-scale sunlit landscapes and pastoral figure subjects, however they also explored Melbourne's urban scenery, local history (including pioneer and bushranger themes), beaches (often along Port Phillip Bay at Mentone, Sandringham and Beaumaris), and did portraits of wealthy Melburnians from their inner-city studios. In 1889 they staged the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition opposite the Melbourne Town Hall. It {{is regarded as a}} landmark event in Australian art history.|$|E
