40|$|Background: Developing a novel, {{efficient}} biomarker {{for detecting}} malignant tumors {{is essential for}} the early diagnosis of cancers. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic value of a potential <b>plasma</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>marker,</b> thioredoxin reductase (TR), which is expressed in many types of malignant tumor, for the non-invasive detection of cancers. Methods: The plasma activities of TR were measured in 1513 patients with common clinical diseases, 59 patients with benign tumors, and 154 patients with cancers and 586 healthy controls. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of TR and logistic re-gression results of different groups were compared by sensitivity, specificity and Youden’s index. Diagnostic cut-offs and clinical reference intervals were established via ROC curve analysis. Re-sults: The logistic regression indicated that TR activity can discriminate between cancers and be-nign tumors or other common diseases very well (p < 0. 0001), with an area under the curve from the receiver-operator characteristics between 0. 91 and 0. 96. The positive critical value was 2. 51 and the cancer critical value was 9. 90. The diagnostic gray zone (2. 51 - 9. 90) may be associate...|$|E

Using two different antibodies (directed against GAWK [1 - 17] and [20 - 38] fragments) GAWK-LI {{was measured in}} tumors from 194 patients and in the plasma of 434 patients by RIA. The highest tissue concentrations of GAWK-LI were found in pheochromocytoma (GAWK [1 - 17]-LI, 18, 173 +/- 3, 915; GAWK [20 - 38]-LI, 17, 852 +/- 2, 763 [mean +/- SEM] pmol/g wet wt tissue; n = 9), which were at least ten times higher than any other tumors producing GAWK-LI. High concentrations of GAWK-LI were also found in other types of endocrine tumors including carcinoid, medullary carcinoma of thyroid, pancreatic, and ACTH-producing lung tumors. On the other hand, low concentrations of GAWK-LI were found in nonendocrine tumors. Plasma concentrations of GAWK-LI {{were found to be}} elevated in patients with endocrine tumor, but more so in those with pancreatic tumors than with pheochromocytomas. Plasma concentrations returned to normal after successful tumor removal. Chromatographic profiles of GAWK-LI in extracts of pheochromocytomas and normal adrenals showed high molecular weight peaks that were absent in the extracts of other endocrine tumors and normal pancreas, suggesting differential tissue-specific processing. Thus GAWK-LI is produced by a variety of endocrine tumors and may serve as a <b>plasma</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>marker,</b> especially in patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors...|$|E
40|$|Background—Plasma tumor {{biomarkers}} {{are widely}} used clinically for monitoring response to therapy and detecting cancer recurrence. However, {{only a limited number}} of them have been effectively used for the early detection of cancer. Objective—To review <b>plasma</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> used clinically for the early detection of cancer and to provide expert opinion about future directions. Methods—Literature review, as well as our expert opinion, of <b>plasma</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> that have been widely accepted for the early detection of cancer. Results—In the United States, only prostate specific antigen (PSA), cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) have been clinically used for the early detection of prostate, ovarian, and liver cancers, respectively. Both analytical and clinical issues related to the use of these three markers were discussed. Conclusion—Few <b>plasma</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> have been used effectively for the early detection of cancer, mainly due to their limited sensitivity and/or specificity. Multiple approaches have been developed to improve the clinical performance of <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> for the early detection of cancer.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and validate a novel blood test able to differentiate patients with CRC and adenomatous polyps (AP) from individuals with a negative colonoscopy. Experimental Design: A case-control, multicenter clinical study was designed to collect blood samples from patients referred for colonoscopy or surgery. Predictive algorithms were developed on 75 controls, 61 large AP (LAP) {greater than or equal to} 1 cm, 45 CRC, and independently validated on 74 controls, 42 LAP, 52 CRC (23 Stages I-II) as well as on 245 cases including other colorectal findings and diseases other than CRC. The test is based on a 29 -gene panel expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells alone or in combination with established <b>plasma</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>markers.</b> Results: The 29 -gene algorithm detected CRC and LAP with a sensitivity of 79. 5 % and 55. 4 %, respectively, with 90. 0 % specificity. Combination with the protein <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> CEA and CYFRA 21 - 2 resulted in a specificity increase (92. 2 %) with a sensitivity for CRC and LAP detection of 78. 1 % and 52. 3 %, respectively. Conclusions: We report the validation of a novel blood test, Colox®, for the detection of CRC and LAP based on a 29 -gene panel and the CEA and CYFRA 21 - 1 plasma biomarkers. The performance and convenience of this routine blood test provides physicians a useful tool to test average risk individuals unwilling to undergo upfront colonoscopy...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{application}} of <b>plasma</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> is mainly during the follow-up of cancer patients {{and especially in}} monitoring of advanced disease. These biomarkers do not require surgical intervention and provide relatively simple monitoring {{at any time during}} the disease course. TGF-beta 1 is a pluripotent cytokine, with diverse effects in normal physiology and a role in both normal mammary gland development and progression of breast cancer. In early stages of breast carcinomas TGF-beta 1 acts as tumor suppressor, while in later stages, when tumor cells become resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1, it acts as tumor promoter. For that reason, the aim of this study was to assess the stage-related TGF-beta 1 elevation in circulation of breast cancer patients, during disease progression. Methods: We analyzed 52 breast cancer patients of different stages (I/II, III, IV) and 36 healthy donors. TGF-beta 1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, R&D). Results Although there was no increase in plasma TGF-beta 1 in stage I/II patients (n = 10, median value = 0. 89 ng/ml), statistically significant elevation of plasma TGF-beta 1 was found in locally advanced breast cancer (stage III, n = 9, median value = 2. 30 ng/ml) and also in metastatic breast cancer (stage IV, n = 33, median value = 2. 46 ng/ml) in relation to healthy donors and stage I/II. Conclusion: This elevation of plasma TGF-beta 1 in locally advanced breast cancer is probably the result of increased tumor mass and tumor-stromal interactions in this stage, as well as a possible cause of greater metastatic potential of tumor cells which lead to metastatic breast cancer. Prognostic role of TGF-beta 1 is not fully understood, but from these results we could say that it could be a marker for monitoring patients disease course, as well as for understating the biology of breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Serial plasma {{levels of}} the glucoprotein <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and gross cyst disease fluid protein (GCDFP) were {{evaluated}} in 83 patients undergoing treatment for predominant osseous metastases from breast carcinoma. Abnormal plasma levels of CEA (greater than 10 ng/ml) and/or GCDFP (greater than 150 ng/ml) were observed in 53 (63. 8 %) subjects. Fifty-six courses of hormonal and chemical therapy were evaluated. Clinical response to therapy correlated positively with alterations in serial plasma levels of CEA and/or GCDFP. Increasing <b>plasma</b> levels of <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> were associated with clinical disease progression whereas decreasing plasma levels were associated with and generally preceded clinical disease remission. Of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast, responses to therapy are most difficult to evaluate in those with bone metastases.

40|$|Purpose: Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MS) plays {{a potential}} {{role in the}} etiology of benign pro-static hyperplasia (BPH). Recent studies have reported on an association between MS and BPH. However, {{there has been no}} consensus on recent results. This study was con-ducted to evaluate the associations among prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate vol-ume (PV), and metabolic components in men who visited our health promotion center. Materials and Methods: During the period from January 2005 to December 2010, 521 consecutive men (age range, 40 to 70 years) who underwent transrectal ultrasono-graphy were enrolled in this retrospective study. The health screening program in-cludes blood pressure, body measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, body mass index), biochemical analysis (serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting <b>plasma</b> glucose, <b>tumor</b> <b>markers),</b> stool and urine analysis, and a detailed clinical examination. Results: The serum PSA level and PV were significantly higher in patients with MS than in patients without MS, retrospectively (p＜ 0. 001, p＜ 0. 001). Patients with more than one metabolic component {{were significantly more likely to}} have a larger PV and higher serum PSA level. The serum PSA level and PV were increased in a similar man-ner with the increasing sum of MS components (p＜ 0. 0001, p＜ 0. 0001). Conclusions: The MS components were associated with larger PV and higher serum PSA level. Therefore, each MS component could be an important factor in BPH develop-ment and management.

Serial measurements of CA 125, HER- 2 /neu, urinary gonadotropin peptide, lipid-associated sialic acid, and Dianon marker 70 /K were obtained during 6 years of follow-up of 1257 healthy women {{at high risk of}} ovarian cancer. We analyzed individual-specific <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> behavior and explored methods that can exploit this information to develop individual-specific screening rules. These five <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> behaved approximately independently. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among women in the behavior of each <b>tumor</b> <b>marker,</b> particularly CA 125. Intraclass correlation (ICC), or the proportion of total variability that occurs between individuals, was approximately 0. 6 for log-transformed CA 125 and urinary gonadotropin peptide, and less than 0. 4 for the other markers. This degree of <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> heterogeneity among healthy women, and the relative independence of these markers, has important implications for screening and diagnostic tests. Independence of markers results in the clinically useful fact that the combined false positive rate from screening with multiple markers may be estimated by the sum of individual false positive rates. Heterogeneity of <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> patterns in healthy women implies that a fixed screening cutoff level is suboptimal to a degree that depends strongly on ICC. Using information on longitudinal measurements and ICC, individual-specific screening rules may be developed with the potential to improve early detection of ovarian cancer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gastrointestinal cancers {{constitute}} {{the third most}} common cancers worldwide. <b>Tumor</b> <b>markers</b> have long since {{been used in the}} postoperative surveillance of these malignancies; however, the true value in clinical practice remains undetermined. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of three <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> in colorectal and esophagogastric cancer. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to elicit the sensitivity, specificity, statistical heterogeneity and ability to predict recurrence and metastases for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 19 - 9 and CA 125. European surgeons were surveyed to assess their current practice and the characteristics of <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> they most valued. Data from the included studies and survey were combined in a cost-benefit trade-off analysis to assess which <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> are of most use in clinical practice. Results: Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were ranked the most desirable characteristics of a <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> by those surveyed. Overall, 156 studies were included to inform the cost-benefit trade-off. The cost-benefit trade-off showed that CEA outperformed both CA 19 - 9 and CA 125, with lower financial cost and a higher sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy for metastases at presentation (area under the curve [AUC] 0. 70 vs. 0. 61 vs. 0. 46), as well as similar diagnostic accuracy for recurrence (AUC 0. 46 vs. 0. 48). Conclusions: Cost-benefit trade-off analysis identified CEA to be the best performing <b>tumor</b> <b>marker.</b> Further studies should seek to evaluate new <b>tumor</b> <b>markers,</b> with investigation tailored to factors that meet the requirements of practicing clinicians...|$|R
