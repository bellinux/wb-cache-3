Structures of QacR(E 90 Q) and QacR(E 120 Q) with ethidium or malachite green took similar global conformations that differed significantly from all previously described QacR-drug complexes but still prohibited binding to cognate DNA. Strikingly, the QacR(E 90 Q) -rhodamine 6 G complex revealed two mutually exclusive rhodamine 6 G binding sites. Despite multiple structural changes, all drug binding was essentially isoenergetic. Thus, these data strongly suggest that rather than contributing significantly to ligand binding affinity, the role of acidic residues lining the QacR multidrug-binding pocket is primarily to attract and guide cationic drugs to the "best available" positions within the pocket that elicit QacR induction...|$|R

2500|$|The {{development}} of nAChR agonist pharmacophore started in 1970 {{when it was}} proposed that the binding of the agonists to a receptor was dependent on a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>nitrogen</b> atom and a hydrogen bond forming from carbonyl oxygen atom in acetylcholine or a nitrogen atom in (S)-nicotine. Since then {{it has been shown}} that a cationic center, atoms that are electronegative and able to form hydrogen bonds along with the center of the pyridine ring in (S)-nicotine are favorable. Stereochemistry is a part of the pharmacophore as is clearly seen with (S)- and (R)- nicotine where the (S)-enantiomer is 10-100 times more potent. The azabicyclic ring of epibatidine is another example of favorable steric interactions to the receptors. [...] It has been suggested that a specific internitrogen distance, N+-N, is important for agonist affinity but debate has arisen over its influence. A newer theory is that a distance of 7-8 Å between points that complement the protonated nitrogen atom and hydrogen bond acceptor will enhance the potency.

40|$|The redox {{behaviour}} {{of conducting}} poly(o-aminophenol) films (PoAP), potentiodynamically electrosynthesized onto Pt substrates, was studied {{by means of}} in situ Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM), varying the composition, concentration and pH of the acidic supporting electrolyte. PoAP films at different oxidation stages were also characterized by ex situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), stopping the anodic scan at + 0. 1 V (semi-oxidized PoAP) and + 0. 5 V vs Ag/AgCl (oxidized PoAP). The results were interpreted by comparison with previous investigations carried out on the reduced PoAP. Polymer oxidation proceeds through the deprotonation of aminic site susceptible then to oxidation. The incorporation of perchlorate ions occurs mostly {{at the beginning of}} the anodic scan till the peak potential is reached. At this stage of the oxidation <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>nitrogens,</b> polaron type, are present which then recombine each other to give bipolaron and, upon deprotonation, neutral immines. The overall PoAP redox oxidation is a reversible two electrons process complicated by chemical deprotonation steps before and after the oxidation itself. On the reverse scan immines require protonation in order to be reduced. A diffusional type limitation on the cathodic process was demonstrated and attributed to counter ions diffusion through the polymer accompanying its protonation. The XPS investigation allowed to unambiguously prove the presence of water inside the film, already suggested by the authors for the reduced PoAP by heating experiments in ultra-high vacuum conditions. Rinsing the polymer with acetonitrile before the XPS analysis, the relevant detailed C 1 s, N 1 s and O 1 s regions evidenced the presence of ammonium acetate coming from nitrile hydrolysis. A higher amount of water was evidenced in the oxidized states with respect to the reduced form. The exchanged molar mass calculated by EQCM revealed, indeed, solvent entrance in the last part of the oxidation. Accordingly, the Binding Energies characteristic of neutral nitrogen functionalities suggested that polymer chains are more distant in the oxidized state, preventing the incoming of hydrogen bonds...|$|R

Equilibration studies showed that strongly basic (QAE) and strongly acidic (SP) derivatives can be equilibrated quicker and more easily than weakly basic (DEAE) and weakly acidic (CM) derivatives. This makes QAE and SP derivatives those of first choice, for use in commercial ion exchange processes. The new QA and DE Cellulose derivatives were investigated for their possible use in the commerical purification of rennet. It was found that {{they were unable to}} bind rennet with sufficient capacity, within it's pH stability limits, to be of any use in this process. This finding was surprising at first since these new ion exchangers showed improved BSA adsorption capacities over those currently employed for rennet purification. An explanation for this low capacity was proposed and verified with model studies on BSA adsorption. From these model studies it was also found that the new DE Cellulose has a more even distribution of charged groups resulting in sharper and more symmetrical peaks in the elution profiles of BSA, than those obtained from some DEAE celluloses commercially available. The new QA Cellulose was investigated for its possible use in the commercial extraction and purification of heparin, but was found to have insufficient density of charged groups to bind heparin at the high ionic strength used in some extraction processes. Several reaction schemes were devised and used to produce quaternary ammonium cellulose derivatives containing groups with two or three <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>nitrogens</b> as a means of increasing the charged density on the cellulose to match repeating negatively charged sulphate groups in heparin.

This iminium ion is then trapped by water at the exocyclic iminium carbon atom, {{rather than at the}} â-lactam carbonyl carbon atom, to form the corresponding N-hydroxymethylazetidin- 2 -ones. Calculations carried out at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d) level of theory also support that nucleophilic attack by water takes place at the exocyclic carbon rather than at the â-lactam carbonyl carbon of the iminium ion. The mechanism for the acid-catalyzed pathway involves a preequilibrium protonation, probably at the beta-lactam nitrogen, followed by rate-limiting alkyl C-O fission with formation of an exocyclic iminum ion. The basecatalyzed hydrolysis involves rate-limiting hydroxide attack at the ester carbonyl carbon. These results imply formation of a â-lactam system containing a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> amide <b>nitrogen</b> atom that hydrolyzes via a pathway that preserves the â-lactam structure in the product and provide further evidence that cleavage of the â-lactam C-N bond is not as facile as is commonly imagined...|$|R

The common atom that connects the two (or sometimes three) rings is called the spiro atom; in carbocyclic spiro compounds like spiro5.5undecane (see image at right), the spiro-atom is a quaternary carbon, and as the -ane ending implies, these are the types of molecules to which the name spirane was first applied (though it is now used general of all spiro compounds).

Swapping a bromine atom in BHQ-OAc for a chlorine atom in CHQ-OAc causes the amount of the tautomeric species to become larger, although the neutral species is still the predominant species for both systems in water-rich solutions. The absorption spectra and the resonance Raman spectra of CyHQ-OAc suggest that, because of the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the cyano substituent, a measurable amount of the anionic species is present and the tautomeric species cannot be easily detected in water-rich solutions. The results reported here reveal large substituent effects {{on the distribution of}} the different forms of the XHQ-OAc compounds in largely aqueous solutions. The steric effect of the 8 -substituted group and competitive hydrogen bonding between the 8 -substituted group and water molecules hinders the formation of a cyclic BHQ-OAc-water complex, and the electron-withdrawing property of the 8 -substituted group enhances the deprotonation of the phenol group while disfavoring the formation of the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> quinoline <b>nitrogen.</b> We briefly discuss the implications of the substituent effects for using these compounds as phototriggers. © 2010 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{modeling}} {{techniques were}} used to derive a predictive model for substrates of cytochrome P 450 2 D 6, an isozyme known to metabolize only compounds {{with one or more}} basic nitrogen atoms. Sixteen substrates, accounting for 23 metabolic reactions, with a distance of either 5 A (" 5 -A substrates", e. g., debrisoquine) or 7 A (" 7 -A substrates", e. g., dextromethorphan) between oxidation site and basic nitrogen atom were fitted into one model by postulating an interaction of the basic nitrogen atom with a negatively charged carboxylate group on the protein. This acidic residue anchors and neutralizes the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> basic <b>nitrogen</b> atom of the substrates. In case of " 5 -A substrates" this interaction probably occurs with the carboxylic oxygen atom nearest to the oxidation site, whereas in the case of " 7 -A substrates" this interaction takes place at the other oxygen atom. Furthermore, all substrates exhibit a coplanar conformation near the oxidation site and have negative molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) in a part of this planar domain approximately 3 A away from the oxidation site. No common features were found in the neighbourhood of the basic nitrogen atom of the substrates studied so that this region of the active site can accommodate a variety of N-substituents. Therefore, the substrate specificity of P 450 2 D 6 most likely is determined by the distance between oxidation site and basic nitrogen atom, by steric constraints near the oxidation site, and by the degree of complementarity between the MEPs of substrate and protein in the planar region adjacent to the oxidation site.

In many examples, fluorescent structures are incorporated into a BA derivative’s framework in order to monitor the effect of sugar concentrations by changes in fluorescence 1, 2. Due to the pKa of the BA at ~ 9 and the one for the sugar bound form at ~ 6, BA type sensors exhibit sugar sensing capabilities between a pH range of 6 - 9. This is advantageous for applications in sugar sensing under physiological conditions, where the pH for blood and ocular fluid is approximately 7. 4. Here, we report novel carboxylic acid BA fluorescent sensors, o-COOHBA and m-COOHBA, respectively, that have been synthesised via a one-step nucleophilic substitution reaction, and have been investigated for their glucose sensing capabilities in solution. Upon addition of glucose the electron density on the boron atom is increased, facilitating the partial neutralization of the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> quaternary <b>nitrogen</b> of the quinolinium moiety through a neutralisation-stabilisation interaction.

Signaling by AC- 42, 77 -LH- 28 - 1, and NDMC was reduced by L 102 A and abolished by D 105 E, suggesting that all three may interact with transmembrane helix 3 at or near the binding site Asp 105 to activate the M 1 mAChR. In striking contrast to NDMC and ACh, the affinities of AC- 42 and 77 -LH- 28 - 1 were increased 100 -fold by W 101 A, and their signaling activities were abolished by Y 82 A.
