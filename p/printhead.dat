2500|$|The machine had {{a feature}} called [...] "Stroke Storage" [...] that {{prevented}} two keys from being depressed simultaneously. When a key was depressed, an interposer, beneath the keylever, was pushed {{down into a}} slotted tube full of small metal balls (called the [...] "compensator tube") and spring latched. These balls were adjusted to have enough horizontal space for only one interposer to enter at a time. (Mechanisms much like this were used in keyboards for teleprinters before World War II.) If a typist pressed two keys simultaneously both interposers were blocked from entering the tube. [...] Pressing two keys several milliseconds apart allows the first interposer to enter the tube, tripping a clutch which rotated a fluted shaft driving the interposer horizontally {{and out of the}} tube. The powered horizontal motion of the interposer selected the appropriate rotate and tilt of the <b>printhead</b> for character selection, but also made way for the second interposer to enter the tube some milliseconds later, well before the first character had been printed. While a full print cycle was 65 milliseconds this filtering and storage feature allowed the typist to depress keys in a more random fashion and still print the characters in the sequence entered.|$|E
50|$|Solid {{contaminants}} in ink blocks can clog <b>printhead</b> nozzles when using original or compatible inks, and may require costly <b>printhead</b> replacement. For this reason, many third-party ink manufacturers provide a guarantee and {{will pay for}} the replacement of a damaged <b>printhead.</b> Xerox also provides its own warranty.|$|E
50|$|To combat this drying, {{nearly all}} inkjet {{printers}} include {{a mechanism to}} reapply moisture to the <b>printhead.</b> Typically there is no separate supply of pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself is used to remoisten the <b>printhead.</b> The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the <b>printhead</b> to the dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber wiper blade is swept across the <b>printhead</b> to spread the moisture evenly across the <b>printhead,</b> and the jets are again all fired to dislodge any ink clumps blocking the channels.|$|E

50|$|Many {{consumer}} grade printers {{are designed}} with close-fitting and sometimes fully enclosing shrouds over the print carriage. It may be difficult or impossible to install a retrofit kit {{because there is no}} room to install the flexible tubing that must flex and bend as the <b>printhead</b> moves back and forth. Jamming may occur if the tubing droops into the path of the <b>printhead</b> and is crushed underneath the <b>printhead</b> or between the <b>printhead</b> and cover. It may be necessary to modify the printer by removing the cover or cutting slots into the body to provide an open space for the tubing.|$|E
5000|$|Every {{time the}} printer loses power {{for long enough}} to cause the portion of ink which was being kept above its [...] "freeze point" [...] in the <b>printhead</b> to drop below that temperature, the mass of ink in each {{reservoir}} would have contracted in size enough (as {{a result of the}} cooling) to permit air to enter the <b>printhead,</b> which would result in print aberrations until the <b>printhead</b> reservoirs had been refilled by the ink-melter assembly above it. As a result, the <b>printhead</b> is then purged using a vacuum pump, causing some ink to be flushed from the printhead's holding tanks into the waste tray to remove the air from the <b>printhead.</b> (Xerox printers have a [...] "waste ink" [...] tray for this purpose. Since all four inks are dumped into a unified [...] "waste ink" [...] tray, it is impossible to reuse the lost ink since the four process colors coalesce to form a single solid mass in the tray, which look much like solidified candle wax drippings, but almost black.) If the printer was in its sleep state, less time without power would be required to necessitate a purge cycle than if the printer was in its ready-to-print state (since the <b>printhead</b> is kept much hotter when ready-to-print).|$|E

50|$|Separating the ink storage {{from the}} <b>printhead</b> may also allow the tank to be {{refilled}} or replaced while a print job is in progress. With ink tanks {{located on the}} <b>printhead,</b> replacement typically requires repriming and alignment checks that necessarily require aborting any current print job.

50|$|The {{primary cause}} of inkjet {{printing}} problems is ink drying on the printhead's nozzles, causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways. Most printers attempt to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the <b>printhead</b> nozzles with a rubber cap when the printer is not in use. Abrupt power losses, or unplugging the printer before it has capped the <b>printhead,</b> can cause the <b>printhead</b> to be left in an uncapped state. Even when the head is capped, this seal is not perfect, and {{over a period of}} several weeks the moisture (or other solvent) can still seep out, causing the ink to dry and harden. Once ink begins to collect and harden, the drop volume can be affected, drop trajectory can change, or the nozzle can completely fail to jet ink.|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} of paper size and production speed in wide-format inkjet printing systems {{is limited by}} significant in-plane deformation of the paper during printing. To increase both the production speed and paper size, the compensation of paper deformation is essential. A potential approach to compensate the paper deformation is actively changing the longitudinal paper position during a lateral pass of the <b>printheads.</b> This paper aims at developing an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm suited for this compensation strategy. The paper position is measured directly, but in non-real-time using image data obtained with a scanner located at the <b>printheads.</b> The proposed controller is experimentally validated and compared with standard norm-optimal ILC in a reproducible experiment, where a set of benchmark trajectories is used that represents severe paper deformation. The results show that in contrast to standard ILC, the ILC with basis functions achieves good tracking performance for the reference set and is hence a proper candidate algorithm for the compensation strategy...|$|R
50|$|The Tonejet {{process is}} an {{electrostatic}} drop-on-demand deposition technology that enables high-quality images to be printed onto virtually {{any type of}} absorbing or non-absorbing substrate at high speed. The Tonejet process consists of electrostatic concentration and ejection of particles from a fluid. The Tonejet print head enables an electric field {{to be applied to}} the ink. The Tonejet ink is {{a key part of the}} ejection process; it consists of electrically charged conventional pigments in a non-conductive liquid. In the Tonejet <b>printhead,</b> an electric force is applied directly to the charged ink particles. The longer the electric pulse is applied, the more ink is ejected. The Tonejet ejection process concentrates the ink prior to ejecting the droplets onto the substrate, with continuous greyscale control. The Tonejet <b>printhead</b> is a three-dimensional structure consisting of side walls, flow channels and ejectors. An ink meniscus is formed between the side walls and the ejector. The Tonejet <b>printhead</b> is therefore a simple, nozzleless, open structure.|$|E
50|$|The printer {{contains}} melted wax when at operating temperature, and owners' manuals {{warn that}} it cannot be moved {{until it has}} completed a special cool-down cycle selected from the machine's control panel. It is recommended to provide a 30-minute cool down time {{from the point of}} removing main power, however all modern solid-ink printers have a shutdown cycle which use fans to solidify the ink in less than ten minutes, with the added benefit of physically restraining the <b>printhead</b> to prevent damage during moving or shipping. The manuals warn that substantial damage is possible otherwise, requiring servicing by a trained technician if not properly cooled down before moving the printer. Moving the printer before cool down completes can damage the print head by spilling molten ink between reservoirs of different color as well as over other components inside the printer (motors, belts, etc.), and is not covered under maintenance or warranty. Because of the liquid-ink-spillage concern, solid-ink printers are not suitable for mobile usage, such as on movable carts for printing pricing tags in retail settings. Unlike some inkjet printers where the cartridge includes the print head, the <b>printhead</b> in these printers is fixed. Over time, parts of the <b>printhead</b> may become permanently clogged, resulting in unsightly streaks, but there are <b>printhead</b> and drum cleaning cycles and jet-substitution options which can resolve most printing issues. There is a filter for the ingested ink implemented at least on the recent ColorQube devices (8570/8870), according to a service manual for those models. Dust caused by the use of cheap paper may cause <b>printhead</b> clogging, which is why Xerox recommends the use of papers that are not prone to giving off dust and fibers during regular usage. Paper dust may also accumulate as debris inside the printer; this could cause abrasions on the drum and may mimic a weak or missing jet. For this reason, the basic built-in drum-cleaning procedure is therefore recommended to be invoked at least three times before initiating printhead-nozzle cleaning cycle. The <b>printhead</b> system also contains a wiper-assembly unit that is used to wipe the <b>printhead</b> from dust, debris and residual ink, {{in order to protect the}} nozzles from clogging. Overall, the design of this system is robust: printheads have been known to last one million prints or more. Ink blocks are not compatible between Phaser models, due to Xerox changing each CMYK molded shape with each new model release due to changes in the formulation (and especially melt point) of the ink. Special openings prevent the insertion of ink sticks from the wrong model, or the wrong slot. Lamination becomes difficult due to the nature of the ink technology. The ink melts and becomes smeared unless the laminator temperature is reduced to just enough to seal a pouch.|$|E

50|$|By the mid-1980s, {{manufacturers}} {{had increased}} the pincount {{of the impact}} <b>printhead</b> from 7, 8, 9 or 12 pins to 18, 24, 27, 36 or 48, with 24 pins being most common.

50|$|Selective heat {{sintering}} (SHS) {{is a type}} of {{additive manufacturing}} process. It works by using a thermal <b>printhead</b> to apply heat to layers of powdered thermoplastic.

SHS is best for manufacturing inexpensive prototypes for concept evaluation, fit/form and functional testing.

50|$|Another 3D {{printing}} {{approach is}} the selective fusing of materials in a granular bed.

For example, in selective heat sintering, a thermal <b>printhead</b> applies heat to layers of powdered thermoplastic; when a layer is finished, the powder bed moves down, and an automated roller adds a new layer of material which is sintered to form the next cross-section of the model; using a less intense thermal <b>printhead</b> instead of a laser, makes this a cheaper solution than using lasers, and can be scaled down to desktop sizes.|$|E
