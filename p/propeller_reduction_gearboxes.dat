50|$|Twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{with their}} propellers rotating {{in the same}} direction are also asymmetric. Counter-rotating propellers avoid this, either by building pairs of engines to rotate their crankshafts in opposite directions, or by using a reversing gear in one of the <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> Handed engines have rarely been used, owing to cost, but were sometimes used for naval aircraft such as the Sea Hornet, to simplify their handling across a narrow carrier deck.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{called the}} PT7, the PW100 uses a {{relatively}} unusual three-shaft engine configuration. In the PW100, a centrifugal LP impeller (except for the PW150 {{which uses a}} 3-stage axial LP compressor), driven by a single stage LP turbine, supercharges a centrifugal HP impeller, driven by a single stage HP turbine. Power is delivered to the offset <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox</b> via a third shaft, connected to a 2-stage free (power) turbine.|$|R
50|$|Such {{a failure}} {{was the cause}} of the second {{prototype}} Bristol Britannia, G-ALRX's 1954 accident in the Severn Estuary. A failure in the <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox</b> led to an overspeed and destruction of the power turbine of Nº3 engine. In the confined space of the Britannia's Bristol Proteus engine, fragments perforated the oil tank and led to a fire, which threatened the integrity of the wing spar. The pilot, Bill Pegg, then made a forced landing on the estuary mud.|$|R

25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} unusual and innovative, being {{based on a}} strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard {{formed the basis of}} the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox</b> and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a fireproof panel and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A long nose wheel well was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached {{to the rear of the}} arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.|$|R

Access to the cockpit was via sideways opening [...] "car doors", one on either side. Both had wind-down windows. As only the right-hand door had a handle both inside and outside this was used as the normal means of access and egress. The left-hand door could be opened only from the outside and was for emergency use, although both doors could be jettisoned. In operational use, as the roof was fixed, the cockpit design made escape difficult in an emergency.|$|R
500|$|The {{engine room}} on a bulker is usually near the stern, under the superstructure. Larger bulkers, from Handymax up, {{usually have a}} single {{two-stroke}} low-speed crosshead diesel engine directly coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Electricity is produced by auxiliary generators and/or an alternator coupled to the propeller shaft. On the smaller bulkers, one or two four-stroke diesels are used to turn either a fixed or controllable-pitch <b>propeller</b> via a <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox,</b> which may also incorporate an output for an alternator. The average design ship speed for bulkers of Handysize and above is [...] The propeller speed is relatively low, at about 90 revolutions per minute, although {{it depends on the}} size of the propeller.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{reliability}} and maintenance costs (R&MC's) {{of past and}} current turboprop systems were examined. Maintenance cost drivers {{were found to be}} scheduled overhaul (40 %), lack of modularity particularly in the <b>propeller</b> and <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox,</b> and lack of inherent durability (reliability) of some parts. Comparisons were made between the 501 -D 13 / 54 H 60 turboprop system and the widely used JT 8 D turbofan. It was found that the total maintenance cost per flight hour of the turboprop was 75 % higher than that of the JT 8 D turbofan. Part of this difference was due to propeller and gearbox costs being higher than those of the fan and reverser, but most of the difference was in the engine core where the older technology turboprop core maintenance costs were nearly 70 percent higher than for the turbofan. The estimated maintenance cost of both the advanced turboprop and advanced turbofan were less than the JT 8 D. The conclusion was that an advanced turboprop and an advanced turbofan, using similar cores, will have very competitive maintenance costs per flight hour...|$|R
50|$|The Pilatus PC-6 Porter is a Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) utility aircraft. The {{majority}} of aircraft are {{powered by a}} single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine, which drives a fully reversible, constant-speed, three-bladed HC-B3TN-3D (or an alternative four-bladed HC-D4N-3P unit) Hartzell aluminium <b>propeller</b> via a <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b> Pilatus claims that it possesses unique STOL capabilities, capable of landing in places only otherwise accessible by rotorcraft. It is fully capable of being operated from unprepared rough airstrips, in remote areas, hot climates and at high altitudes in all-weather conditions. In particular, the undercarriage employed provides for high wing and propeller clearances, making the PC-6 less susceptible to damage than conventional nosewheel-type undercarriages. For further landing versatility, various types of landing gear may be optionally installed allowing it to operate from different types of terrain; options include floats for water landings and skis for landing on snow.|$|R
50|$|Skrunda {{class was}} ordered in 2008 and built in {{cooperation}} by Abeking & Rasmussen Shipyard in Germany and Riga Shipyard in Latvia between 2009 and 2013. The {{class and the}} five vessels are named after towns and cities in Latvia {{from each of the}} five historical regions of Latvia, where important battles for Latvia's independence took place. The design is based on the well proven Abeking & Rasmussen 25m SWATH Pilot boat design, which is known for its excellent seaworthiness, offering motions in high sea state similar to conventional monohull ships three to four times its size. Skrunda class vessels are able to perform 100% of their duties in waves as high as 3.5 meters. The propulsion system was designed specifically for Skrunda class and places two MAN D 2842 diesel engines in the lower torpedo hulls, driving Servogear controllable pitch <b>propellers</b> via Servogear <b>reduction</b> <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main use for steam {{turbines}} is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was {{by use of}} {{steam turbines}}) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well {{with the speed of}} modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the Turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to <b>propellers</b> with no <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox)</b> dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines. In recent decades, reciprocating Diesel engines, and gas turbines, have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications.|$|R
50|$|Centurion series {{engines are}} always fitted with {{constant}} speed propellers which allow {{the engine to}} be operated at optimum speed at all times. However, the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The constant speed <b>propeller</b> and <b>reduction</b> gear result in a propeller tip speed that is 10-15% lower than comparable conventional avgas engines, reducing propeller noise.|$|R
2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a <b>propeller</b> speed <b>reduction</b> unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use <b>propeller</b> speed <b>reduction</b> units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b> [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian 1931 Schneider Trophy entrant, the Macchi M.C.72, {{required}} an engine of 2,300 horsepower (1,700 kW) with {{the capability of}} producing up to 2,800 horsepower (2,090 kW) while having a weight of not more than 840 kilograms (1,850 lb). The contract was awarded to Fiat, but as their most powerful V engine to that date was the 1,000-horsepower (750 kW) 12-cylinder Fiat AS.5 that had also been used for Schneider Trophy racing, the company faced a difficult challenge. The novel solution was to couple two AS.5 V12 engines in tandem to produce a V-24 with each engine independently driving one {{of a pair of}} contra-rotating propellers through co-axial shafts. Except for sharing a common mechanical supercharger, the unit was more a [...] "tandem V12" [...] than a true V24, which would require all cylinders to power a single crankshaft, rather than dual crankshafts rotating in opposite directions with independent crank and driveshafts, or at least to have both cranks geared together to drive a single output. The rear engine drove the front <b>propeller</b> through a <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox,</b> located between the two engines, up to a shaft that passed between the cylinder banks of the reverse-mounted forward engine. The latter's crankshaft drive faced rearwards and drove the rearmost propeller in a likewise manner, but instead via a hollow shaft passing between the cylinder banks through which the rear engine driveshaft passed. [...] A large rear-mounted mechanical centrifugal supercharger was used to boost the engine, with the fuel/air mixture being delivered to the cylinders through a manifold that was centrally mounted between the cylinder banks of both engines.|$|R
