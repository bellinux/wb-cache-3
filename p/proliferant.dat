40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} tasks facing the world in the post-cold war era is to eliminate nuclear proliferation. With the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, the subject of nuclear proliferation has returned to the forefront of international politics. Taking issue with the complacent belief that only a few states unnecessarily jeopardize international peace by acquiring nuclear weapons, I argue that many states in territorial protracted conflict are generally <b>proliferants</b> because of their specific security concerns. Demonstrating how individual and domestic level motivations are not the key determinants of the nuclear choices of the South Asian and Middle Eastern states, I emphasize the role of systemic level motivation, particularly security, in their nuclear decisions. Through a close examination of these states' nuclear weapons choices, I develop a new appraisal of the territorial protracted conflict states' potential to proliferate. While high war-probability has provoked virtually all of these protracted conflict states to seek nuclear deterrent capability and become <b>proliferants,</b> the variations in the type of conflict, regional power structure and geographical proximity have brought about variations in the pace of proliferation among these states. Finally, I expand the implications of this study for IR theory, especially with regard to Realist theory, nuclear deterrence, post-cold war world order, and nuclear arms control treaties. I conclude that the resolution of the roots of regional conflicts will most effectively ensure that more states do not embark on a nuclear weapons program. It is, however, naive to expect the new nuclear states to roll back their weapons programs...|$|R

These two materials are the essential ingredients of nuclear weapons, and limits on access to them are the primary technical barrier to prospective <b>proliferants</b> who might desire to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.

[...] (Youngest son Hugh's descendants soon largely disappeared from view.) These names would morph into the Scudamore surname over the next generation or two, and then later into [...] "Skydemore" [...] and [...] "Skydmore" [...] by 1400.

For example, a family might be known as [...] "Skidmore" [...] during the week, but be called [...] "Scudamore" [...] when attending church services on Sunday. The patriarch of the Birmingham family mentioned below, for example, William Skidmore (c. 1590-1664), was most often recorded as [...] "Skidmore" [...] in church registers and tax lists, but spelled his name [...] "Skudemore" [...] in his will. By the sixteenth century, around the time that parish registers began to come into common use following the Reformation, the shorter variant [...] "Skidmore" [...] came to be more common, and began to spring up {{in other areas of the}} United Kingdom where it had not previously been documented in the aristocratic or landowning families.

40|$|The {{means that}} a nation uses to deliver {{a weapon of mass}} {{destruction}} (WMD) depends in part on the availability of a vehicle, the survivability of the delivery system, the characteristics of its intended target, and the nation’s military objective (even if the target is civilian in nature). These factors are not mutually exclusive considerations. Many proliferants have demonstrated clever methods to adapt one delivery vehicle, which it can easily acquire, to other applications much different from the original purpose of the vehicle. Similarly, some nations have launched effective attacks against targets that U. S. analysts might initially overlook because of a different perception of the importance of these targets. When a <b>proliferant</b> has invested both the expense and talent to develop a WMD arsenal and the means to deliver it, it does so to be capable of launching a sufficiently effective attack. Consequently, the means of WMD delivery a <b>proliferant</b> selects usually reflects some planning and coordination of its objectives.

The former (unofficial) nuclear weapons state South Africa has destroyed its nuclear weapons and joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and Libya has apparently abandoned its former nuclear ambitions, whereas other potential nuclear <b>proliferants</b> such as Egypt were never very serious in their quest for nuclear weapons. Africa is thus mainly of interest in a non-proliferation context by virtue of its uranian deposits.

We investigated 7 -ethoxyresorufìn O-deethylase (EROD) and 7 -pentoxyresorufìn O-depenthylase activities (PROD). Normal human keratinocytes were cultured with mitomycin-treated 3 T 3 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F 12. At confluency cells were incubated with inducers or irradiated with different doses of UVB. The microsomal fraction was studied by western-blot analysis. The MC-induced EROD activity was up to 4 fold higher when compared with BNF induced activity. UVB exposure resulted in a dose-dependent (25 - 75 mJ) and time dependent (6 - 24 h) induction of CYP 450 1 A 1. Immunoblotting assay showed expression for CYP 450 1 B 1 for both keratinocytes and melanocytes. Proadifen, an inhibitor of CYP 450 -monooxygenase, led to a significant decrease in EROD activity. The results of the present study clearly show that irradiation with UVB is capable of modifying the activity of CYP 450 isoenzymes in keratinocytes. The phase II enzyme gluthatione S transferase activity (GST) was induced by UVB and PB.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the methodology approach developed by the Generation IV International Forum Expert Group on Proliferation Resistance & Physical Protection for evaluation of Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection robustness of Generation IV nuclear energy systems options. The methodology considers a set of alternative systems and evaluates their resistance or robustness to a collection of potential threats. For the challenges considered, the response of the system to these challenges is assessed and expressed in terms of outcomes. The challenges to the system are given by the threats posed by potential <b>proliferant</b> States and sub-national adversaries on the nuclear systems. The characteristics of the Generation IV systems, both technical and institutional, are used to evaluate their response to the threats and determine their resistance against the proliferation threats and robustness against sabotage and theft threats. System response encompasses three main elements: (1) System Element Identification. The nuclear energy system is decomposed into smaller elements (subsystems) at a level amenable to further analysis. (2) Target Identification and Categorization. A systematic process is used to identify and select representative targets for different categories of pathways, within each system element, that actors (<b>proliferant</b> States or adversaries) might choose to use or attack. (3) Pathway Identification and Refinement. Pathways are defined as potential sequences of events and actions followed by the <b>proliferant</b> State or adversary to achieve its objectives (proliferation, theft or sabotage). For each target, individual pathway segments are developed through a systematic process, analyzed at a high level, and screened where possible. Segments are connected into full pathways and analyzed in detail. The outcomes of the system response are expressed in terms of PR&PP measures. Measures are high-level characteristics of a pathway that include information important to the evaluation methodology users and to the decisions of a <b>proliferant</b> State or adversary. They are first evaluated for segments and then aggregated for complete pathways. Results are aggregated as appropriate to permit pathway comparisons and system assessment. The paper highlights the current achievements {{in the development of the}} Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection Evaluation Methodology.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991 left {{the legacy of the}} USSR weapons complex with an estimated 50 nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons cities containing facilities responsible for research, production, maintenance, and destruction of the weapons stockpile. The Russian Federation acquired ten such previously secret, closed nuclear weapons complex cities. Unfortunately, a lack of government funding to support these facilities resulted in non-payment of salaries to employees and even plant closures, which led to an international fear of weapons material and knowledge proliferation. This dissertation analyzes migration in 33 regions of the Russian Federation, six of which contain the ten closed nuclear weapons complex cities. This study finds that the presence of a closed nuclear city does not significantly influence migration. However, the factors that do influence migration are statistically different in regions containing closed nuclear cities compared to regions without closed nuclear cities. Further, these results show that the net rate of migration has changed across the years since the break up of the Soviet Union, and that the push and pull factors for migration have changed across time. Specifically, personal and residential factors {{had a significant impact on}} migration immediately following the {{collapse of}} the Soviet Union, but economic infrastructure and societal factors became significant in later years. Two significant policy conclusions are derived from this research. First, higher levels of income are found to increase outmigration from regions, implying that programs designed to prevent migration by increasing incomes for closed city residents may be counter-productive. Second, this study finds that programs designed to increase capital and build infrastructure in the new Russian Federation will be more effective for employing scientists and engineers from the weapons complex, and consequently reduce the potential for emigration of potential <b>proliferants...</b>|$|R

Normal human keratinocytes were cultured with mitomycin-treated 3 T 3 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F 12 or with KGM serum-free medium. Melanocytes were grown in medium 154. At confluency cells were incubated with inducers or irradiated with different doses of UVB. At different times after treatments, cells were harvested for in vitro measurement of CYP 450 induction. The microsomal fraction was studied by western-blot analysis. Low, but measurable levels of CYP activity were detected in both basal and differentianting keratinocytes. The MC-induced EROD activity was up to 4 fold higher when compared with BNF induced activity.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySecurity Studies Interdepartmental ProgramDavid R. StoneBest {{known for}} being a ‘rollercoaster’ and a ‘marriage of convenience’, various {{scholars}} have tried to reflect upon {{the true nature of}} Pak-U. S. relationship under this banner. However, no matter how one examines this relationship one thing is certain –– the experience for both countries has been harrowing. After India settled for non-alignment early in the Cold War, Pakistan seized the opportunity and aligned itself with the United States in the East-West struggle and pledged allegiance to fight communism in Asia. But that was not the only motive –– Pakistan secretly hoped that an alliance with the U. S. would provide it security against India with whom Pakistan had an antagonistic relationship over their outstanding territorial dispute of Kashmir. When the U. S. did not rescue Pakistan as it had hoped for during its war with India in 1965 and sanctioned both countries with an arms embargo, Pakistan felt betrayed. From that period onwards, Pakistan’s list of grievances against the U. S. developed into a narrative of betrayal and abandonment fed by several episodes in their relationship during and after the Cold War –– a period in which Pakistan developed and tested its nuclear weapons –– duly exploited by Pakistani leaders as a tool for populist politics. This dissertation provides the first scholarly account of Pakistan’s narrative and tests its merit against the U. S. non-proliferation policy towards Pakistan under five administrations from Ford to Clinton and finds that Pakistan’s narrative of betrayal and abandonment is uneven and misleading with respect to the objectives and successes of U. S. non-proliferation policy. This dissertation uses multi-archival documents to offer a counter-narrative which argues that Pakistan, although a small state, was able to brilliantly maneuver its way through restricted spaces in its relationship with the U. S. in the past five decades to not only acquire a decent conventional capability through U. S. military assistance but also nuclear weapons due to the fickleness of U. S. non-proliferation policy. This research concludes that the compromises made by the U. S. to accommodate Pakistan and its inconsistency in enforcement of non-proliferation laws has implications for the efficacy and success of U. S. non-proliferation policy with prospective <b>proliferants...</b>|$|R

40|$|Verification`s {{importance}} {{has changed}} dramatically over time, although {{it always has been}} in the forefront of arms control. The goals and measures of verification and the criteria for success have changed with the times as well, reflecting such factors as the centrality of the prospective agreement to East-West relations during the Cold War, the state of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the technologies available for monitoring. Verification`s role may be declining in the post-Cold War period. The prospects for such a development will depend, first and foremost, on the high costs of traditional arms control, especially those associated with requirements for verification. Moreover, the growing interest in informal, or non-negotiated arms control does not allow for verification provisions by the very nature of these arrangements. Multilateral agreements are also becoming more prominent and argue against highly effective verification measures, in part because of fears of promoting proliferation by opening sensitive facilities to inspectors from potential <b>proliferant</b> states. As a result, it is likely that transparency and confidence-building measures will achieve greater prominence, both as supplements to and substitutes for traditional verification. Such measures are not panaceas and do not offer all that we came to expect from verification during the Cold war.

40|$|Abstract: Adult mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{obtainable}} from autologous bone marrow aspirates have generated tre-mendous {{interest in the}} medical and scientific communities {{in the last two}} decades and are currently being investigated by a of interested physicians for use in point-of-care stem cell therapies due to their great potential to differentiate into multi-ple cell lineages such as bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, and nerve. However, as these stem cells are found in very low numbers in adult tissue, centrifugal concentration or expansion through in vitro culturing has been pursued to obtain higher numbers of efficacious regenerative therapeutic applications. More recently, some physicians and scientists have chosen to explore use for direct injection of un-fractionated, native whole bone marrow aspirate as a strategy in regenera-tive treatment regimes. This review examines the potential merits and disadvantages of using either concentrated and culture expanded MSCs versus native whole bone marrow aspirate as key <b>proliferant</b> in direct regenerative injection ther-apy (RIT). Results from a number of published investigations have clearly shown high potential of various deleterious ef-fects on manipulating MSCs obtained from native bone marrow aspirate either by centrifugal forces or expansion through in vitro culturing; moreover, currently used centrifugal concentration techniques do not significantly concentrate MSCs from bone marrow aspirate, thus, defeating the purpose of this manipulative step. On the other hand, preliminary results and observations of using un-fractionated whole bone marrow injection for treatment of various musculoskeletal joint dis-eases (for example, osteoarthritic joints) suggest that the procedure is safe and potentially efficacious, with no know...|$|E

Methods One hundred and forty-seven consecutive {{patients with chronic}} spinal pain were classified as litigants if they had retained a lawyer for an unresolved claim {{at the start of}} treatment, or as non-litigants if they had previously settled claims or sustained non-compensable injuries. Patients were treated with a solution of 20 % dextrose and 0. 75 % lidocaine. One-half milliliter of <b>proliferant</b> was injected into facet capsules of the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. The iliolumbar and dorsal sacroiliac ligaments were also injected for a total of 10 cc in low back pain patients. The Neck Disability Index, Patient Specific Functional Scale, and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scales were administered before treatment and approximately 1 year after treatment. At the 1 -year follow-up, patients were also asked to rate their change in symptoms, function, ability to work, willingness to repeat treatment, and need for ongoing medications or other treatment. Results Both litigants (71) and non-litigants (76) showed significant improvement from baseline on all disability scales (P < 0. 001). There were no differences in the percentage of litigants/non-litigants reporting improvement on impression of change scales for symptoms (91 / 92 %), function (90 / 90 %), improved ability to work (76 / 75 %), willingness to repeat treatment (91 / 93 %), ability to decrease medication (82 / 81 %), and decreased need for other treatment (80 / 84 %).

40|$|The National Nuclear Security Administration is {{developing}} methods for nonproliferation assessments {{to support the}} development and implementation of U. S. nonproliferation policy. This paper summarizes the key results of that effort. Proliferation resistance is the degree of difficulty that a nuclear material, facility, process, or activity poses to the acquisition of one or more nuclear weapons. A top-level measure of proliferation resistance for a fuel cycle system is developed here from a hierarchy of metrics. At the lowest level, intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to proliferation are defined. These barriers are recommended as a means to characterize the proliferation characteristics of a fuel cycle. Because of the complexity of nonproliferation assessments, the problem is decomposed into: metrics to be computed, barriers to proliferation, and a finite set of threats. The spectrum of potential threats of nuclear proliferation is complex and ranges from small terrorist cells to industrialized countries with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. Two general categories of methods have historically been used for nonproliferation assessments: attribute analysis and scenario analysis. In the former, attributes of the systems being evaluated (often fuel cycle systems) are identified that affect their proliferation potential. For a particular system under consideration, the attributes are weighted subjectively. In scenario analysis, hypothesized scenarios of pathways to proliferation are examined. The analyst models the process undertaken by the <b>proliferant</b> to overcome barriers to proliferation and estimates the likelihood of success in achieving a proliferation objective. An attribute analysis approach should be used at the conceptual design level in the selection of fuel cycles that will receive significant investment for development. In the development of a detailed facility design, a scenario approach should be undertaken to reduce the potential for design vulnerabilities.
