5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the <b>past</b> <b>were</b> members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{temporal}} finitism {{was inspired by}} the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite <b>past</b> <b>were</b> used by the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).|$|E
50|$|The <b>past</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} to {{indicate}} the totality of events that occurred before a given point in time. The <b>past</b> <b>is</b> contrasted with and defined by {{the present and the}} future. The concept of the <b>past</b> <b>is</b> derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language.|$|R

Because of this, the world keeps looking toward the past for guidance. Too many people <b>are</b> following the <b>past.</b> In this new space age, this <b>is</b> dangerous. The <b>past</b> <b>is</b> DEAD and those, who <b>are</b> following the <b>past</b> <b>are</b> doomed to die and <b>be</b> like the <b>past.</b> It <b>is</b> no accident that those who die are said to have passed since those who have PASSED <b>are</b> <b>PAST.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1948, when Australia's {{part-time}} {{military force}} was re-raised as the Citizens Military Force (CMF), the 10th Battalion {{returned to the}} order of battle, readopting the designation of The Adelaide Rifles. Throughout the 1950s, as part of Central Command, the battalion provided training for national servicemen until 1960, when a widespread re-organisation of the CMF saw the creation of six state-based multi-battalion regiments as the smaller, regional regiments of the <b>past</b> <b>were</b> consolidated. As a result, the 10th Battalion was subsumed into the pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment, providing two companies: 'D' (The Adelaide Company) and 'E' (The Port Adelaide Company). In 1961, the battalion, although technically off the Army's order of battle, was entrusted with the 12 battle honours that had been earned by the 2/10th Battalion during World War II.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the <b>past</b> <b>were</b> used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the <b>past</b> <b>were</b> shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E

5|$|There {{are about}} 30 ponds in the park. Some– {{including}} Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond– {{have been created}} to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the <b>past</b> <b>were</b> used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas {{of water in the}} park.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} {{numerical}} analysis predates {{the invention of}} modern computers by many centuries. Linear interpolation was already in use more than 2000 years ago.

25|$|The Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics {{periodically}} hosts temporary exhibitions {{dealing with}} {{various aspects of}} aviation history.

25|$|Some pagans {{would appear}} to have {{continued}} to practice their faith when circumstances permitted, as the emperors continued issuing laws.

25|$|Not all reefs in the <b>past</b> <b>were</b> {{formed by}} corals: {{those in the}} Early Cambrian (542–513 Ma) {{resulted}} from calcareous algae and archaeocyathids (small animals with conical shape, probably related to sponges) and in the Late Cretaceous (100–66 Ma), when there also existed reefs formed {{by a group of}} bivalves called rudists; one of the valves formed the main conical structure and the other, much smaller valve acted as a cap.|$|E

50|$|The {{consistency}} paradox or grandfather paradox {{occurs when}} the <b>past</b> <b>is</b> changed in any way, thus creating a contradiction. A time traveler can do anything that did happen, but can't do anything that didn't happen. Doing something that didn't happen results in a contradiction. Consistency paradoxes occur whenever changing the <b>past</b> <b>is</b> possible.|$|R

25|$|In medieval philosophy, {{there was}} much debate over whether the {{universe}} had a finite or infinite past (see Temporal finitism). The philosophy of Aristotle held that the universe had an infinite past, which caused problems for medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophers who were unable to reconcile the Aristotelian conception of the eternal with the Abrahamic view of creation. As a result, a variety of logical arguments for the universe having a finite <b>past</b> <b>were</b> developed by John Philoponus, Al-Kindi, Saadia Gaon, Al-Ghazali and Immanuel Kant, among others.|$|E
25|$|Jones's and Nebel's {{claims were}} first made public in 1976 (in Donald Bain's The Control of Candy Jones, {{published}} by Playboy Press). Nebel apparently accepted his wife's claims, and openly discussed killing Dr. Jensen in revenge. However, Nebel was a prankster and a hoaxer of long standing {{and as he}} was not above hoaxing his radio audience, some of whom doubted the recovered memories of Candy Jones's <b>past</b> <b>were</b> genuine. Later skeptics would argue that an alleged false memory syndrome was a more plausible explanation.|$|E
25|$|Starting around 1500, the Zwin channel, (the Golden Inlet) {{which had}} given the city its prosperity, also started silting and the Golden Era had ended. The city soon fell behind Antwerp as the {{economic}} flagship of the Low Countries. During the 17th century, the lace industry took off, and various efforts {{to bring back the}} glorious <b>past</b> <b>were</b> made. During the 1650s, the city was the base for Charles II of England and his court in exile. The maritime infrastructure was modernized, and new connections with the sea were built, but without much success, as Antwerp became increasingly dominant. Bruges became impoverished and gradually faded in importance; its population dwindling from 200,000 to 50,000 by 1900.|$|E
