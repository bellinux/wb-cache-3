In general, the elbow is made by welding a straight pipe and bend part. So, periodic welding inspection is required due to the potential defects in weld zone. Recently, the application of induction heating <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> is increasing in order to reduce this problem. <b>Pipe</b> <b>bend</b> made by induction heating band is not necessary welding process because it is made by bending a straight pipe but the intrados thickness and the extrados thickness are different. On the other hand, J-integral is widely used to evaluate a structural integrity (to check crack stability) but the J estimation of <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> with un-uniform thickness is very difficult because of the thickness differences in each locations. This paper proposes a reference stress based J estimation scheme of circumferential through-wall cracked <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> with un-uniform thickness under in-plane opening bending loading condition.

In the manufacturing process of pipe bends {{it is difficult to}} avoid thickening on the inner radius of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> and thinning on the outer radius of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend.</b> The cross section of the bend also becomes non circular due to bending process; this tends to cause ovality in pipe bends. The acceptability of pipe bends is based on the induced level of shape imperfections considered. The influence of internal pressure, operation time and shape imperfections of <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> on stress-strain redistributions and creep-fatigue crack growth rate was investigated using FE-analysis and experiments at elevated temperature. Full-size stress-strain state analysis of <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> was performed for different stage of lifetime under considering loading conditions.

The smooth and compact specimens were cut out from four tension and compression critical zones of the same <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> with given ovality and thinning cross sections as well as operating time. The creep-fatigue crack growth rate tests were performed on special designed program test-cycle. Comparison between new and old materials shows tensile properties of 12 Cr 1 MoV steel have degraded by long-term high-temperature service; while comparison between the creep-fatigue crack growth rate characteristics indicates that they are a function of the critical zone positions in the considered <b>pipe</b> <b>bend.</b> A new parameter for characterization of the crack growth resistance for power plant materials and structures under elevated temperature is used in the form of creep stress intensity factor...|$|E

This leads to actuality of questions which associated with the more efficient use of existing wells, because cost of their drilling is a significant share of geothermal projects. In domestic practice of development of geothermal resources the steam-water wells have greatest energy potential. One way to improve the performance of these wells is a providing of smooth change of direction of motion of steam-water mixture from the vertical, in the well, to the horizontal, in steam gathering system. Typical wellhead piping of domestic steam-water wells involves the removal of the mixture through a cross bar at a right angle. Cross bar can generate considerable pressure loss that increases the operating pressure {{at the mouth of the}} well and reduces flow rate. It seems reasonable to substitute the typical cross bar by smooth <b>pipe</b> <b>bend.</b> This reduces wellhead resistance coefficient by more than on 2. Increase of curvature radius of <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> reduces the pressure loss to a local resistance but increases the friction pressure loss.

In {{the manufacturing process}} of pipe bends {{it is difficult to}} avoid thickening on the inner radius of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> and thinning on the outer radius of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bend.</b> The cross section of the bend also becomes non circular due to bending process; this tends to cause ovality in pipe bends. The acceptability of pipe bends is based on the induced level of shape imperfections considered. Ovality is the shape imperfection considered for the analysis which varies from 0 to 8 %. This study is an attempt to analyze the ovality effect of inlet pigtail bend, INCOLOY 800 ASTM B 407 material which is used in hydrogen reformer application. The finite element method is used to model and analyze a stand-alone, long-radius <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> with 42. 2 mm nominal diameter and a 250 mm bend radius with specified length. A parametric study was performed in which the bend factor is taken as 1. 90 to 2. 07. Internal pressure is incremented for each model, until it reaches 27 x 108 N/mm 2. During this process, the bend undergoes plastic instability due to pressure and thermal effect.

Though it has been established that this is within the capabilities of wall-resolved LES, its high computational cost has prevented widespread usage in industry. In the present paper the suitability of LES with blended wall-functions, that allow the first cell {{to be placed in}} any part of the boundary layer, is assessed. Numerical results for the flows through a 90 ° <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> and a T-Junction are compared against experimental data. Both test cases contain areas where equilibrium laws are violated in practice.

The LES with wall-function approach consistently overpredicts the near-wall temperature fluctuations in the T-Junction, suggesting that it can be considered as a conservative approach. We also benchmark a range of low-Re RANS models. EBRSM predictions for the 90 ° <b>pipe</b> <b>bend</b> are in significantly better agreement with experimental data than those from the other models.
