5|$|As castles {{were not}} simply {{military}} buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, {{they had a}} significant impact on the surrounding landscape. <b>Placed</b> <b>by</b> a frequently-used road or river, the toll castle ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources. Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their upkeep. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.|$|E

Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E
