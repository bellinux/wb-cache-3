40|$|<b>Post</b> <b>and</b> core-systems {{are common}} {{techniques}} in oral rehabilitation of teeth with inadequate structure {{which do not}} allow using of the traditional restorations. Many factors can affect the treatments’ success and survival rate. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the use <b>and</b> experience of <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core systems in public and private Swedish dental care. The hypothesis was that prefabricated post in composite material is the most common <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core-system used in Swedish dentistry today. Complication rates are higher for teeth with <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core and crown restorations compared with teeth restored with only crowns but without post/core. Furthermore, the risk of catastrophic failure is more frequent for teeth restored with <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core than without. A survey was conducted by sending 500 questionnaires to dentists in public and private dental care in five different cities of Sweden. Results were compiled by 297 returned surveys and showed that the most used technique was individually cast <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core and the most used material was metal alloy <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core. Conclusion: Individually cast <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core was found to be the most used technique both in public and private dental care in Sweden. Fiber reinforced composite was considered as the material with highest complication rates while metal alloy <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core was the material with lowest complication rates. Root fracture was the most common complication reported. The ferrule effect was considered as the most important factor affecting the survival rate of treatment with <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core...|$|R

40|$|Statement of problem: Techniques and {{recommendations}} {{for the restoration of}} endodontically treated teeth have changed from the use of custom cast metal <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core system to glass fiber-reinforced (GFRC) <b>post</b> <b>and</b> composite core system. Has this latest prefabricated glass fiber reinforced <b>post</b> <b>and</b> composite core system increased the fracture resistance of teeth and reduced the incidence of unrestorable root fractures. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the incidence of root fracture and mode of failure of endodontically treated teeth restored with two different <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core systems. Material and methods: Forty maxillary central incisors were randomly divided into two groups. (n= 20). All teeth received endodontic treatment. First group was restored with custom cast <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core system. Second group was restored with glass fiber <b>post</b> <b>and</b> composite core system. In Both the groups posts were cemented with adhesive resin cement. Compressive load was applied at an angle of 130 to the long axis of teeth at a cross head speed of 1 mm/min until fracture occurred. Data were analyzed with student 't' test P<. 001. Results: The mean value for fracture resistance was (331. 4025) N in Group -I Custom cast Ni-Cr <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core and (237. 0625) N in Group -II Glass fiber reinforced <b>post</b> <b>and</b> composite core system. Students 't' test shows the significant difference in fracture resistance of two groups. Conclusion: This study showed that the incidence of root fracture was significantly higher in custom cast Ni-Cr <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core system than glass fiber <b>post</b> <b>and</b> composite core system. A more favourable mode of failure was observed in teeth restored with Group II glass fiber post system...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Since many years, post {{has been}} {{commonly}} used to provide adequate support and retention {{for the restoration of}} endodontically treated teeth. Although it is successful, several cases of failure have been reported. Various classifications of teeth for <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core were given in the past. However, classification on the basis of failure of <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core has not yet been described. Methods: Electronic search on PubMed and a hand search were performed to identify relevant literature, which were thoroughly screened before the articles were included in the study. Results: Based on the search, various classifications related to <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core had been given by many authors; however, it was observed that certain aspects of the classification regarding the failure of <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core were not yet included. Therefore, the manuscript is an attempt to emphasize the need to develop a classification system for the failure of <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core. Conclusion: The new classification on failure of teeth restored with <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core has been proposed by the authors as Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV depending upon the type of failure. The new classification aims at better understanding the failure of <b>post</b> <b>and</b> core and can be a valuable tool during epidemiological surveys...|$|R
