40|$|About 1 per cent. {{of human}} births are twin births. However, {{there are certain}} {{families}} in which the proportion rises to 5, 10, or even 15 per cent. There {{can be little doubt}} then that, as in sheep, so in man, there are strains having a special tendency toward the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>twins.</b> It is commonly believed that this tendency toward the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>twins</b> must be wholly a maternal quality, depending upon the inherited tendency to double ovulation. The study of the heredity of twins is accompanied by certain difficulties, such as the fact that the occurrence of twins is frequently isolated, apparently haphazard, occurring perhaps in only one case in a fairly large fraternity, in which other representatives are single births. It will simplify the matter a little if we consider only those cases in which two or more sets of twins have arisen from a given mating. The study of twins is still further {{complicated by the fact that}} they are of two types, namely twins derived from a double ovulation and twins derived from a single ovulation, there being a subsequent fission or budding of the fertilized egg. Such single-egg twins are'easily distinguished clinically by being both enveloped in the same chorion. They are also always of the same sex. The statement that the mother alone determines the tendency to twins is not, however, supported by the facts. Of the births giving rise to the fraternities of twin-repeating mothers, 4. 5 per cent, are twin births. Of the births giving rise to fraternities of twin-repeating fathers, 4. 2 per cent are twin births. These figures depend upon 355 and 289 labors respectively. The sisters of twin-producing fathers have twins in 8. 2 per cent. of labors, while the sisters of twin-producing mothers have twins in 5. 5 per cent. of labors...|$|E
40|$|Aberdeen Angus (originated in Scotland) is {{the second}} most common beef breed in the Czech Republic due to its {{resistance}} to adverse climatic events, modesty, earliness, ease of calving, low birth weight of calves and good maternal instincts of cows. The main economic indicator of suckler cows rearing is the number of born and weaned calves. <b>Production</b> <b>of</b> <b>twins</b> is possible way to improve these indicators. The aim of this thesis was to compare the growth potential of twins of Aberdeen Angus beef breed with individuals who were born as singletons. The work is focused on comparing the weight at birth, in 120 and 210 days of age. Most twins in the population of Aberdeen Angus breed reared in the Czech Republic in 2009 - 2013 was born in 2012 - 9. 44 % (270 pcs.), the least in 2013 - 6. 67 % (184 pcs.). The incidence of twins by birth order increased from 1 to 3 birth order (78, resp. 130, resp. 131 pcs.) as further increasing order resulted into decline of twin's incidence. The difference in weight between twins and singletons at birth was 5. 81 kg, in 120 days 28. 32 kg and 37. 32 kg 210 days (P 0. 001). Differences within twins by sex were for bulls and heifers statistically significant (P 0. 001). The relationship between weight at birth and calving ease was also investigated - in the case of twins relationship was not statistically significant (P> 0. 05).

40|$|The {{increased}} twinning frequency (Le., approximately 25 %) in the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center twinning {{project has}} resulted in additional management requirements to achieve survival <b>of</b> <b>twin</b> calves and timely rebreeding of their dams. Previously, neonatal survival <b>of</b> <b>twin</b> calves (Le., within 24 hr after calving) was about 82 % compared to 97 % survival for singleborn calves. Although twin calves are smaller at birth than single-born calves (34. 3 vs 44. 8 kg), the incidence of calving difficulty (dystocia) is increased in twin pregnancies (35 % vs 23 % for twins vs singles, respectively) due to abnormal positioning of the calves within the uterus. The dystocia further increases mortality <b>of</b> <b>twin</b> calves (27 % with vs 5 % without dystocia). Secondly, the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>twin</b> births results in lower conception rates (71 % for twins vs 85 % for singles) and a longer postpartum infertility period (95 vs 85 days, respectively) regardless of rearing one or two calves. Precalving diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>twin</b> fetuses would enable dietary supplementation to increase maternal energy stores and increase awareness of calving difficulty. Greater obstetrical assistance at calving should reduce the effects of dystocia and nutrition on calf survival and rebreeding performance of the dam. Previously employed methods to identify twin pregnancies were: 1) measurement of estrone sulfate in maternal blood, 2) determination of number of corpora lutea and fetuses by laparoscopy, and 3) determination of fetal number by rectal palpation of the uterus.

At 3 min after insemination, metal oxides were added to Xenopus fertilized eggs, and then twin embryos appeared. Zirconium oxide (ZrO 2) was the most effective metal oxide for producing twin embryos. ZrO 2 was added to the fertilized eggs, and 30 sec later, the eggs were dejellied with cysteine solution and washed within 7 min after insemination. The fertilized eggs began flattening at around 15 min after insemination.

A hybrid of common wheat cv. 7182 (2 n = 6 x = 42, AABBDD) and Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng (2 n = 2 x = 14, NsNs) via embryo culture produced the novel intergeneric disomic addition line 59 - 11. The seed morphology of 59 - 11 resembled the parent 7182 and it exhibited extreme agronomic characteristics, i. e., twin stable spikelets, fertile florets, and multi-kernel clusters. Furthermore, 59 - 11 produced plump kernels with a high seed-setting percentage during the advanced maturation stage. The line was screened based on genomic in situ hybridization, EST-SSR, EST-STS, and gliadin to identify P. huashanica chromatin in the wheat background.

While advances in nuclear transfer technology may someday enable monkeys to be cloned with some efficiency, embryo splitting may be a more realistic approach to creating pairs of genetically identical monkeys. Although several different approaches to embryo splitting, including blastocyst bisection and blastomere separation, have been used successfully in rodents and domestic species for <b>production</b> <b>of</b> pairs and sets of identical offspring, efforts to create monozygotic twins in rhesus monkeys using these approaches have not met with similar success. Aggregation of split embryos with other types of blastomeres, such as tetraploid and developmentally asynchronous blastomeres, that could potentially increase their cell numbers and developmental competence without contributing to term development has been investigated as an alternative approach to creating monozygotic twin monkeys. The major challenges encountered with respect to the efficient <b>production</b> <b>of</b> monozygotic <b>twins</b> in rhesus monkeys and potential strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed. </p...|$|R

However, the mechanisms regulating sperm cell formation and cell fate specification {{has yet to be}} identified. In this study, the thesis investigates the function of key cell cycle regulators and presents characterisation of a novel pollen division mutant of Arabidopsis (duo 3) that fails to produce twin sperm cells. In addition, the project also examines the activity of small RNA (smRNA) pathways as a potential mechanism that modulates native gene expression. Pollen cell-specific vectors were constructed to drive the expression of hairpin double stranded RNA (hp-dsRNA) as tools for investigating the activity of smRNA pathways, and their efficacy was tested by manipulating expression of key cell cycle regulators in Arabidopsis. Indeed, expression of hp-dsRNA intended to knockdown transcripts of Cyclin B 1 members, revealed a putative role Cyclin B 1 in microspore and germ cell division. Furthermore, analysis of a Cyclin B 1; 1 reporter led to the identification of DUO 1 (a pollen specific R 2 R 3 MYB protein) but not DUO 3 as a germ cell-specific regulator of Cyclin B 1; 1 expression. This interaction was further verified by rescuing mutant duo 1 plants with Cyclin B 1; 1. Analysis of DUO 3 expression revealed restricted patterns confined predominantly in dividing tissues. Moreover, study of Cyclin B 1; 1 reporter revealed mutant duo 3 cells to be impaired in degrading Cyclin B 1; 1 protein, suggesting a role in modulating Cyclin B 1; 1 activity. In summary, this work has highlighted a potential role of the Cyclin B 1 family {{in the development of the}} male gametophyte. Use of Cyclin B 1; 1 marker has demonstrated a first example of germ cell specific integrator of cell division and cell differentiation and a putative role of DUO 3 in germ cell division.
