40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the external cowl angle, and hence the <b>cowl</b> <b>pressure</b> drag, were investigated on a two-dimensional model. One method used at both on- and off-design Mach numbers was {{the addition of a}} cowl visor that had the inner surface parallel to the free stream at 0 deg angle of attack. The other method investigated consisted in replacing the original cowl by a flatter cowl that also provided internal contraction. Both the visor and the internal-contraction cowl reduced the <b>cowl</b> <b>pressure</b> drag 64 percent or more. The visor had little effect on inlet performance at the design Mach number except to reduce the stability range slightly.

40|$|Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) {{simulations}} {{were performed}} for the high-speed flowpath and isolator of a dual-flowpath Turbine-Based Combined-Cycle (TBCC) inlet using the Wind-US code. The RANS simulations were performed {{in preparation for}} the Large-scale Inlet for Mode Transition (LIMX) model tests in the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) 10 - by 10 -ft Supersonic Wind Tunnel. The LIMX inlet has a low-speed flowpath that is coupled to a turbine engine and a high-speed flowpath designed to be coupled to a Dual-Mode Scramjet (DMSJ) combustor. These RANS simulations were conducted at a simulated freestream Mach number of 4. 0, which is the nominal Mach number for the planned wind tunnel testing with the LIMX model. For the simulation results presented in this paper, the back <b>pressure,</b> <b>cowl</b> angles, and freestream Mach number were each varied to assess the performance and robustness of the high-speed inlet and isolator. Under simulated wind tunnel conditions at maximum inlet mass flow rates, the high-speed flowpath pressure rise was found to be greater than a factor of four. Furthermore, at a simulated freestream Mach number of 4. 0, the high-speed flowpath and isolator showed stability for freestream Mach number that drops 0. 1 Mach below the design point. The RANS simulations indicate the yet-untested highspeed inlet and isolator flowpath should operate as designed. The RANS simulation results also provided important insight to researchers as they developed test plans for the LIMX experiment in GRC s 10 - by 10 -ft Supersonic Wind Tunnel...|$|R

In the light of this investigation, common misconceptions and factors which are frequently overlooked in the cooling and cowling of radial engines are considered in some detail.

40|$|The {{scope and}} {{significance}} of propulsion airframe integration (PAI) for hypersonic airbreathing vehicles is presented through {{a discussion of the}} PAI test techniques utilized at NASA Langley Research Center. Four primary types of PAI model tests utilized at NASA Langley for hypersonic airbreathing vehicles are discussed. The four types of PAI test models examined are the forebody/inlet test model, the partial-width/truncated propulsion flowpath test model, the powered exhaust simulation test model, and the full-length/width propulsion flowpath test model. The test technique for each of these four types of PAI test models is described, and the relevant PAI issues addressed by each test technique are illustrated through the presentation of recent PAI test data.

40|$|A full Navier-Stokes {{analysis}} was performed to evaluate {{the performance of the}} subsonic diffuser of a NASA Lewis Research Center 70 / 30 mixed-compression bifurcated supersonic inlet for high speed civil transport application. The PARC 3 D code was used in the present study. The computations were also performed when approximately 2. 5 percent of the engine mass flow was allowed to bypass through the engine bypass doors.

40|$|A novel {{concept of}} a {{moveable}} cowl is introduced for improving the performance of integrated hypersonic waverider designs. These vehicle designs are typically computed at one design Mach number. Thus, off-design performance suffers because of flow spillage at the engine inlet.

In this paper the {{concept of a}} moveable cowl is discussed to control local and global effects of hypersonic waveriders.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results obtained from pressure distribution tests on the fuselage of a PW- 9 pursuit airplane {{in a number of}} conditions of flight. The investigation was made to determine the contribution of the fuselage to the total lift in conditions considered critical for the wing structure, and also to determine whether the fuselage loads acting simultaneously with the maximum tail loads were of such a character as to be of concern with respect to the structural design of other parts of the airplane. The results show that the contribution of the fuselage toward the total lift is small on this airplane. Aerodynamic loads on the fuselage are, in general, unimportant from the structural viewpoint, and in most cases they are of such character that, if neglected, a conservative design results. In spins, aerodynamic forces on the fuselage produce diving moments of appreciable magnitude and yawing moments of small magnitude, but opposing the rotation of the airplane.

40|$|A {{study of}} the data {{obtained}} in a flight investigation of an R- 2800 - 21 engine in a P- 47 G airplane was made {{to determine the effect}} of the flight variables on the engine cooling-air pressure distribution. The investigation consisted of level flights at altitudes from 5000 to 35, 000 feet for the normal range of engine and airplane operation. The data showed that the average engine front pressures ranged from 0. 73 to 0. 82 of the impact pressure (velocity head). The average engine rear pressures ranged from 0. 50 to 0. 55 of the impact <b>pressure</b> for closed <b>cowl</b> flaps and from 0. 10 to 0. 20 for full-open cowl flaps. In general, the highest front pressures were obtained {{at the bottom of the}} engine. The rear pressures for the rear-row cylinders were. lower and the pressure drops correspondingly higher than for the front-row cylinders. The rear-pressure distribution was materially affected by cowl-flap position in that the differences between the rear pressures of the front-row and rear-row cylinders markedly increased as the cowl flaps were opened. For full-open <b>cowl</b> flaps, the <b>pressure</b> drops across the rear-row cylinders were in the order of 0. 2 of the impact pressure greater than across the front-row cylinders.
