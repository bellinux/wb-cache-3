5|$|Camper Village is {{the only}} place at Cedar <b>Point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is {{possible}} to hook up a recreational vehicle (RV) to water and electricity. Camper Village sites range from deluxe sites with electricity, water, sewer and cable to 112 electric-only sites. The Camper Village has the Camper Village Store, an outdoor pool, a shuffleboard court, a game room, a shuttle service, a dump station and laundry facilities.|$|E
5|$|For contact or semi-detached binaries, the {{transfer}} of mass from a star to its companion can also result in a significant transfer of angular momentum. The accreting companion can spin up to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> reaches its critical rotation rate and begins losing mass along the equator.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the writing}} {{continues}} onto the second {{side of a}} tablet at the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> finishes off the first, so if the first side has an odd number of lines, {{as is the case}} with tablets K, N, P, and Q, the second will start at the upper left-hand corner, and the direction of writing shifts to top to bottom.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Scheindlin {{stated that}} the {{membership}} had grown to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> again required {{the services of a}} full-time rabbi, and the congregation hired Jonathan Ginsburg as its first full-time rabbi since Israel Goldfarb's retirement. Ginsburg developed adult education and young singles programs, and improved standards in the synagogue's children's education programs. Geoffrey Goldberg followed him as rabbi from 1987 to 1988.|$|E
5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{flanked by}} areas prone to {{flooding}} between the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> enters Schuylkill County and its mouth. The tributary Stony Run also flows through some areas prone to flooding and a few areas near Trexler Run are susceptible to flooding as well.

5|$|One of the {{catenary}} stanchions on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, {{and carries}} a small plaque detailing {{the visit of}} Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 1974, {{after the completion of}} electrification of tracks north of the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> stands. This was significant because it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the coastguard {{was little more than}} a few sometimes unserviceable patrol craft manned by ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was considered the best trained of the armed services.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, NY17A was {{extended}} eastward along NY210 to Southfields, completing the alternate loop of NY17, while NY210 was realigned on its east end by 1938 to end at US9W in Stony Point. Instead of following Willow Point Road, the highway remained on modern Gate Hill Road to {{the vicinity of}} Stony <b>Point,</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> entered the hamlet on Main Street. It was rerouted again between 1968 and 1973 to bypass Main Street to the south on Central Drive.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E
5|$|Larrys Creek is in {{a narrow}} valley formed by {{mountains}} and hills, with steep to moderate slopes. The channel pattern is regular, with a dendritic drainage pattern. South of its source, the creek turns to flow southwest along {{the northern edge of}} Green Mountain, turns south into the State Game Lands at Buckhorn Mountain, and flows south along the western edge of Coal Mountain. The only named peak on the west bank of Larrys Creek itself is Harris <b>Point,</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau.|$|E
50|$|The {{trackbed}} from Steanbow Crossing to Cock Mill Crossing, {{between the}} sites of Pylle and West Pennard stations, crosses {{the site of the}} Glastonbury Festival and functions as an internal road within the festival site.

5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again {{this is due to}} the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Carrols Corporation {{was founded}} in 1960 as a {{franchisee}} of the Tastee Freeze Company's Carrols Restaurants division by Herb Slotnick under the name Carrols Drive-In Restaurants of New York, and by 1968 the company had grown to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> purchased the chain from Tastee Freeze. By 1974 Carrols owned and operated over 150 Carrols Club restaurants in the Northeast United States and abroad. In 1975 the company entered into a franchise agreement with Burger King and converted its existing Carrols restaurants in the US into BK locations, closed those stores that {{were not able to}} be updated and sold off its international operations.|$|E

5000|$|The Wotton Light Railway is {{a private}} [...] gauge light railway located near Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire. It is the hobby of High Court judge Sir Jeremy Sullivan.

5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Like their German counterparts, Soviet {{divisions}} {{were also}} seriously understrength. For example, {{divisions in the}} 40th Army averaged 3,500–4,000 men each, while the 69th Army fielded some divisions which could only count on 1,000–1,500 soldiers. Some divisions had as little as 20–50 mortars to provide fire support. This shortage in manpower and equipment led Vatutin's Southwestern Front to request over 19,000 soldiers and 300 tanks, while {{it was noted that}} the Voronezh Front had only received 1,600 replacements since the beginning of operations in 1943. By the time Manstein launched his counteroffensive, the Voronezh Front had lost so much manpower and had overextended itself to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> could no longer offer assistance to the Southwestern Front, south of it.|$|E
