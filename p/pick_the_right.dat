[...] According to Yankovic, he wrote several additional verses for [...] "Melanie" [...] {{that he would}} only sing to his friends. [...] "Twister" [...] is an ode to the Milton Bradley game Twister. The song is a style parody of the Beastie Boys. When Yankovic was recording the song, he initially recorded about 20 vocal takes. However, {{when it came time}} to <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> take, he opted for the first because it sounded [...] "more raw and more off-the-cuff." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Good Old Days" [...] is about a psychopath fondly remembering his childhood. Yankovic described the song as an [...] "experiment". He [...] "wanted to see if [...] could write a song as if Charlie Manson and James Taylor were collaborating." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{literary}} celebrity {{during his}} lifetime, Stevenson now {{ranks as the}} 26th most translated author in the world. His works have been admired by many other writers, including Jorge Luis Borges, Bertolt Brecht, Marcel Proust, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, Cesare Pavese, Emilio Salgari, Ernest Hemingway, Rudyard Kipling, Jack London, Vladimir Nabokov, J. M. Barrie, and G. K. Chesterton, who said of him that he [...] "seemed to <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> word up {{on the point of}} his pen, like a man playing spillikins".|$|E
2500|$|Jackman {{also wrote}} motifs {{for the major}} {{characters}} introduced in the film: Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo. Spider-Man's motif has a small arc to match that character's few appearances, being introduced very gently as the [...] "somewhat confused, slightly tender" [...] Peter Parker first appears, followed by [...] "the seed of his heroism" [...] when he is recruited for the Avengers, and finally a [...] "full-blown version" [...] plays when he fights alongside the other heroes. For Black Panther, Jackman used a combination of African woodwind instruments whenever the character talks about his ancestors, while muted trombones [...] "brought his character into {{the grandeur of the}} symphony orchestra, but there’s a slightly vengeful, serrated sound to muted trombones if you <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> kind of mood". Zemo's personal theme was performed on [...] "a lot of these rather unusual tuned bells" [...] that gave him an [...] "otherly sound", as well as a cimbalon to represent his Eastern European roots.|$|E
2500|$|Vos Savant {{suggests}} that the solution will be more intuitive with 1,000,000 doors rather than 3. [...] In this case, there are 999,999 doors with goats behind them and one door with a prize. After the player picks a door, the host opens 999,998 of the remaining doors. On average, in 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, the remaining door will contain the prize. Intuitively, the player should ask how likely it is that, given a million doors, he or she managed to <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> one initially. Stibel et al. (2008) proposed that working memory demand is taxed during the Monty Hall problem and that this forces people to [...] "collapse" [...] their choices into two equally probable options. They report that {{when the number of}} options is increased to more than 7 choices (7 doors), people tend to switch more often; however, most contestants still incorrectly judge the probability of success at 50:50.|$|E

60|$|If {{the rather}} vague Victorian public did not {{appreciate}} the deep and even tragic ethics with which Stevenson was concerned, still less were they {{of a sort}} to appreciate the French finish and fastidiousness of his style; in which he seemed to <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> word up {{on the point of}} his pen, like a man playing spillikins. But that style also had a quality that could be felt; it had a military edge to it, an acies; and {{there was a kind of}} swordsmanship about it. Thus all the circumstances led, not so much to the narrowing of Stevenson to the romance of the fighting spirit; but the narrowing of his influence to that romance. He had a great many other things to say; but this was what we were willing to hear: a reaction against the gross contempt for soldiering which had really given a certain Chinese deadness to the Victorians. Yet another circumstance thrust him down the same path; and in a manner not wholly fortunate. The fact that he was a sick man immeasurably increases the credit to his manhood in preaching a sane levity and pugnacious optimism. But it also forbade him full familiarity with the actualities of sport, war, or comradeship: and here and there his note is false in these matters, and reminds one (though very remotely) of the mere provincial bully that Henley sometimes sank to be.|$|E
