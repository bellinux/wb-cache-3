500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a [...] "must-see" [...] event. Gray said, [...] "At this point, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E

2500|$|The Blue Jays began a 7-game {{road trip}} in Baltimore on May 11. The game played {{that night was}} the first to be played in Baltimore {{following}} the empty-stadium game played on April 29, due to the 2015 Baltimore protests. Toronto would lose, 5–2. In the second game, Toronto would come from behind 2–0 to win 10–2, helped by a two-home run night from Edwin Encarnacion. Toronto lost the rubber match, 6–1, and did not record an extra-base hit {{for the first time in}} the 2015 season. The loss also broke a 31-game streak with at least 1 double. The Blue Jays then travelled to Houston, taking on the AL West-leading Astros. Toronto was swept by Houston, losing 6–4, 8–4, 6–5, and 4–2. Following their third loss to Houston, Josh Donaldson called out his teammates for their poor play, stating [...] "this isn't the 'try' league, this is the 'get it done' league. And you know, eventually they're gonna find <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get it done." ...|$|E

[...] "It's only that you make me a little nervous with your account of all the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tumble in.

[...] "You {{see one of}} the {{greatest}} nations in the world going through its hour of agony, and you think nothing but how you yourselves will be affected! Every thinking person in Russia regrets that this thing should have come to pass at such a time. Yet it is best for you English to look the truth in the face. It wasn't the Russian people who were pledged to you, with whom you were bound in alliance. It was that accursed trick all European politicians have of making secret treaties and secret understandings, building up buffer States, trying to whittle away a piece of the map for yourselves, trying all the time to be dishonest under the shadow of what is called diplomacy. That is what brought the war about. It was never the will of the people. It was the Hohenzollerns and the Romanoffs, the firebrands of the French Cabinet, and your own clumsy, thick-headed efforts to get the best of everybody and yet keep your Nonconformist conscience. The people did not make this war, but it is the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end it." ...|$|E

60|$|There were a {{few moments}} of silence. Gerald, like a sentinel, <b>was</b> {{watching}} the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on to the boat. He was very good-looking and self-contained, but his air of soldierly alertness was rather irritating.|$|R
6000|$|... "While we've a yard {{to stand}} upon {{or a man}} to fight we shall do our best. I have been a soldier, as you know, all my life, and I have no sentimental hatred of war. But my country--ah well, it is so {{different}} when it is your own <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die upon their homesteads, your own womenkind who must go sorrowing through life widowed and orphaned. I don't suppose there is anything particularly beautiful about Theos," [...] the King continued, thoughtfully, [...] "yet to me her quiet country places, her vineyards and farms, her whole rural life has seemed so simple and charming. I have seen my people at their play and at their daily tasks, a cheerful, honest people, light-hearted and fond of pleasure perhaps--why not? The thought of a blackened country, her vineyards and corn-fields red with blood, the homesteads in flames, my poor peasants fighting to the death against cruel odds--it is hideous! I do not dare {{to think of it}} or it will unman me. Only I pray to the God of our fathers that this thing will not seem just to the great liberty-loving nations and that they will not see us wiped out {{from the face of the}} earth." ...|$|E
60|$|On we flew, {{drawn by}} the mighty current, till at last I noticed that {{the sound of the}} water was not half so {{deafening}} as it had been, and concluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes to disperse in. I could now hear Alphonse's howls much more distinctly; they were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the Supreme Power and the name of his beloved Annette {{that it is possible to}} conceive; and, in short, though their evident earnestness saved them from profanity, were, to say the least, very remarkable. Taking up a paddle I managed to drive it into his ribs, whereon he, thinking that the end had come, howled louder than ever. Then I slowly and cautiously raised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards, but could touch no roof. Next I took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as I could, but with the same result. I also thrust it out laterally to the right and left, but could touch nothing except water. Then I bethought me that there was in the boat, amongst our other remaining possessions, a bull's-eye lantern and a tin of oil. I groped about and found it, and having a match on me carefully lit it, and as soon as the flame had got a hold of the wick I turned it on down the boat. As it happened, the first thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of Alphonse, who, thinking that it was all over at last, and that he was witnessing a preliminary celestial phenomenon, gave a terrific yell and was with difficulty reassured with the paddle. As for the other three, Good was lying on the flat of his back, his eyeglass still fixed in his eye, and gazing blankly into the upper darkness. Sir Henry had his head resting on the thwarts of the canoe, and with his hand was trying to test the speed of the water. But when the beam of light fell upon old Umslopogaas I could really have laughed. I think I have said that we had put a roast quarter of water-buck into the canoe. Well, it so happened that when we all prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into the water by the rock roof, Umslopogaas's head had come down uncommonly near this roast buck, and so soon as he had recovered a little from the first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry. Thereupon he coolly cut off a chop with Inkosi-kaas, and was now employed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction. As he afterwards explained, he thought that he was going 'on a long journey', and preferred to start on a full stomach. It reminded me of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be hanged, and who are generally reported in the English daily papers to have made 'an excellent breakfast'.|$|E
