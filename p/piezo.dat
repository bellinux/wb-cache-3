These {{work on a}} fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the <b>piezo</b> elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line. Another type uses the <b>piezo</b> elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw. The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size.

In this study the nanomechanical properties of either a sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK) treated layer or bare polyether ether ketone (PEEK) were evaluated via AFM nanoindentation and a nanomechanical test system to probe the possible error of the calculated nanomechanical properties due to the AFM <b>piezo’s</b> hysteresis.

40|$|Among {{the various}} schemes being {{considered}} for structural health monitoring (SHM), guided wave (GW) testing in particular has shown great promise. While GW testing using hand-held transducers for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is a well established technology, GW testing for SHM using surface-bonded/embedded piezoelectric wafer transducers (piezos) is relatively in its formative years. Little effort has been made towards a precise characterization of GW excitation using <b>piezos</b> and often the various parameters involved are chosen without mathematical foundation. In this work, a formulation for modeling the transient GW field excited using arbitrary shaped surface-bonded <b>piezos</b> in isotropic plates based on the 3 D linear elasticity equations is presented. This is then used for the specific cases of rectangular and ring-shaped actuators, which are most commonly used in GW SHM. Equations for the output voltage response of surface-bonded piezo-sensors in GW fields are derived and optimization of the actuator/sensor dimensions is done based on these. Finally, numerical and experimental results establishing the validity of these models are discussed...|$|R

25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. <b>Piezo</b> transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E
