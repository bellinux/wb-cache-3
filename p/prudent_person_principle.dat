40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} Canadian pension funds relative to those from the UK and US, {{in the light of}} the ongoing quantitative asset restrictions that still apply in Canada, compared with the purer <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> approach in the UK and US. We find that although Canadian funds often obtain better combinations of return and risk, returns are often less than could be obtained given financial market conditions, as shown by dummy portfolios split evenly between bonds and equities, or diversified into real estate, as well as mean-variance optimal portfolios. In contrast, UK and US funds typically outperform such benchmarks. Combined with criticisms of specific Canadian regulations in the light of finance theory and empirical evidence, the paper makes a case for removal of residual quantitative restrictions in Canada, and their replacement by sole <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> regulations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the rationale, nature and financial consequences of two alternative approaches to portfolio regulations {{for the long-term}} institutional investor sectors life insurance and pension funds. These approaches are, respectively, <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> rules and quantitative portfolio restrictions. The argument draws on the financial-economics of investment, the differing characteristics of institutions’ liabilities, and the overall case for regulation of financial institutions. Among the conclusions are: · regulation of life insurance and pensions need not be identical; · <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> rules are superior to quantitative restrictions for pension funds except in certain specific circumstances (which may arise notably in emerging market economies), and; · although in general restrictions may be less damaging for life insurance than for pension funds, <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> rules may nevertheless be desirable in certain cases also for this sector, particularly in competitive life sectors in advanced countries, and for pension contracts offered by life insurance companies. These results have implications inter alia for an appropriate strategy of liberalisation. 1 The author is Professor of Economics and Finance, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB 3 4 PH, United Kingdom (e-mail ‘e_philip_davis@msn. com’, website: ‘www. geocities. com/e_philip_davis’).

50|$|Here it {{was stated}} that the test of {{negligence}} to be applied in criminal trials {{was the same as}} that applied in civil cases: the standard of care and skill which would be observed by a reasonable man.

40|$|The {{premise of}} this Article {{is that a}} new {{definition}} pertaining to an individual's right {{to be left alone}} should be formulated. The new standard that should be adopted in determining whether an individual's right of privacy has been violated is that of the reasonably <b>prudent</b> <b>person.</b> In other words, whether the conduct or activity in question constitutes an invasion of one's right to live a life free of interference from outside agencies should depend upon the reasonableness of the conduct or activity under the circumstances in question...|$|R

5000|$|While {{some may}} claim Diminished Value (DV) is {{subjective}} and based upon perception or speculation, {{the old adage}} [...] "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> {{is willing to pay}} the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.|$|R

40|$|Thanks to Richard Posner 2 ̆ 7 s classic 1972 article, A Theory of Negligence Law, the Hand {{formula of}} United States. v. Carroll Towing Co. {{is perhaps the}} most central idea of many first-year torts classes today. Students learn that the meaning of {{negligence}} should be understood in terms of Judge Learned Hand 2 ̆ 7 s formula comparing the costs of taking precautions with the product of the likelihood of injury without those precautions and the magnitude of such injury. There is more than a little irony, however, in the superstar status of the Hand formula in negligence law. Carroll Towing is not a negligence case at all; indeed, it is not even a tort case, but an admiralty case. Beyond that, even the very general idea of a negligent injurer being held liable for the injuries it caused is not implicated in Carroll Towing, because it is about plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s fault, not defendant 2 ̆ 7 s fault. Posner 2 ̆ 7 s elevation of this formula to the apex of negligence doctrine is, though utterly sincere, nevertheless a sleight of Hand. This article puts aside the moral and evaluative arguments that frequently divide tort theorists, and instead gathers overwhelming evidence within negligence law that the Hand formula - in both its economic and its non-economic versions - simply misses the meaning of negligence within negligence doctrine. Negligence is a failure to use ordinary care. Ordinary care is that which a reasonably <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> would use under the circumstances. While hardly self-evident or precise, concepts of ordinary care and the reasonably <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> connote a standard of conduct that our negligence doctrine requires jurors and judges to apply as well as they can. There is every reason to believe this meaning is something quite different from the Hand formula (even if the two ideas should sometimes overlap). An accurate account of the meaning of negligence is a necessary starting point for questions or interpretation, criticism, and revision of tort doctrine. Finally, the article canvasses and rejects rights-based, conventionalistic, and virtue-based theories of the meaning of negligence, and begins to sketch an account according to which the reasonably <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> is conceived in terms of a special kind of competency in civil life...|$|R

But if Sarah should come and borrow a pitcher to carry some milk home in, and should let it fall and break it by the way, even if it was not gross carelessness, she ought to pay for it; that is, the person that sent her ought to pay for it, for it was bailed to her for her benefit alone; and therefore it was at her risk." ...|$|R
