Danes vse več tekstilnih podjetij uporablja računalniško podprte programe v procesu izdelave ali pa kot komunikacijo s strankami ali drugimi partnerji. V nalogi smo za namen raziskave izbrali dva znana grafična programa, in sicer 2 D CAD program za risanje in oblikovanje tkanin ArahPaint in 3 D CAD program za oblikovanje in izdelavo simulacij Blender. S pomočjo teh programov smo ustvarili virtualne tkanine z vzorci, ki jih je mogoče primerjati s fotografijami realnih tkanin enakih vzorcev. Predhodno smo izbrali šest tkanin in sicer tri tiskane in tri pestro tkane, nato smo izbrali ustrezno sceno, kjer se tkanine drapirajo zaradi trkov samih s seboj in z drugimi objekti. Slike smo upodobili, nato pa ustvarili enako sceno v realnosti z enakimi tkaninami. Rezultate smo vrednotili subjektivno na podlagi različnih vizualnih parametrov.

In modern production of textile goods, more and more textile companies use computer aided programs {{in the process of}} creation or just communication with customers or other manufacturers.

It was art-based studio research design that made use of exploration and experimental methods in the execution of four murals with different scenery. The works depict various activities within the Textiles section programme, Faculty of Art, College of Art and Built Environment, KNUST {{as a case study}} with the intent to promote and educate the populace. The activities were arranged into different scenery out of which four were selected for production. Step-by-step universal design methodology was carefully followed to ensure precision and easy reproduction of the murals.

The enhancement of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s. However, when sandwich panel arrangement {{was in the}} following order: 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> and a final layer of HAH, Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> pull out was observed when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 277. 8 m/s.

The overall sandwich panels for both arrangements had the same amount of materials but one failed the ballistic test and the other passed.

In the present paper, the effect of pp between two adjacent yams on the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> lamina and the effect of laminate configuration for different number of layers on the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates for different material systems are studied. An optimum gap between adjacent yams gives higher Young's moduli, and it depends upon the fabric structure and material system.

The results prove that the manner of fabric deformation during relaxation depends upon the multilayer fabrics structure. The quantities of the crinkles on the fabric {{are related to the}} float length type. Multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> with longer float length show higher crinkled, and its deformation behavior is non-linear. Thus, connected deformations are closely related to the stretch potential and influence multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> draping and fitting of the garment.

It has been reported that <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> based on high strength and high modulus fibers with dense structures have the advantage of shear resistance (Tien et al. 2010). Also due to interlacement of tows or yarns, <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> offer high resistance to damage, superior energy absorption (Karahan et al. 2008) and remarkably high values of strain at failure in tension, and loadings (Chou and Ko 1989; Dixit and Mali 2013).

Electromagnetic {{multifunctional}} composites merge {{the excellent}} structural performance of structural composites with additional functionality such as sensing, communication, or electromagnetic interference protection. The multifunctionality aspect {{of these devices}} increases the functional capability of structures and can reduce weight, size, and cost. Often left addressed {{in the development of}} these structures, is the scalability and practicality of fabricating devices over large surface areas. In this dissertation, scalable methods of fabricating embedded electromagnetic devices are explored using highly scalable additive manufacturing techniques. Both screen printing and microdispensing of silver conductive inks are used to demonstrate common devices found in electromagnetic systems. Specifically, transmission line feeds, frequency selective surfaces, high impedance surfaces, and antennas are demonstrated and fabricated within <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> structural composites. Through these devices, the electromechanical tradeoffs of embedded printed conductors were explored. It was found that silver conductive inks that were screen <b>printed</b> onto glass <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> experienced a reduction of conductivity and an increase in electrical path length. Additionally, the mechanical shear strength and delamination resistance of a composite decreased compared to a baseline when printed with a continuous plane of conductive ink. At higher frequencies, screen printed, embedded frequency selective surfaces compared well against devices fabricated with copper clad polyimide. The high scalability of screen printing pairs well with the patterning of frequency selective surfaces over large structures. Microdispensing of silver conductive inks was also explored as a higher quality method of depositing silver inks onto <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The high turnover of additive manufacturing allowed for rapid processing of multiple antenna design iterations in a short time period. In addition, microdispensing allows for the deposition of higher conductivity, lower viscosity inks that were difficult to deposit onto <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> via screen <b>printing.</b> The resulting antenna showed high conductivity, within an order of magnitude of copper, and excellent radiation performance. A final device was demonstrated using multimaterial additive manufacturing that combined an embedded antenna and high impedance surface fabricated within a single machine. A method for predicting the dielectric properties of geometrically controlled polycarbonate substrates was determined. This method was used to fabricate multiple substrates with varying dielectric properties using a single material. Additionally, the co-deposition of silver conductive ink and polycarbonate was used to additively manufacture both the embedded antenna and high impedance ground plane. The measured antenna showed improved performance when radiating above the high impedance surface relative to a continuous conducting surface at the same distance.

An even higher combination was the Pan-T-Boot, a single garment combining stretch tights with boots. [...] In summer, pale, high-legged boots in <b>printed</b> or open <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> were teamed with summery dresses; these often had extensive cut-outs, so that they were more like high-legged sandals than conventional boots.

The multi-colored suede and canvas over-the-knee boots produced by the London store Biba were so sought-after that queues would form outside the store when a delivery was due. By the late 1970s, form-fitting, shaped-leg boots were being replaced with straight-legged designs, frequently worn over jeans or other pants, which were often pulled-on rather than zip-fastened. As well as high-heeled dress boots, more rugged designs, by companies such as Frye, were widely worn. The end of the decade saw a growth in popularity of shorter, calf-length boots, often worn layered with socks and tights, and a revival of interest in over-the-knee and thigh-length boots, which were popularized by punk and new wave performers such as Blondie’s Debbie Harry.|$|R

The method enables a complicated design procedure for the MLWF to be reduced to the much simpler design process of a single-layer <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> using conventional CAD systems. The method can be applied to all types of common MLWF including orthogonal and angle-interlock woven structures. This method will be widely used in the textile industry for the design of multi-layered <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> and by the software companies which provide CAD/CAM systems for the industry...|$|R
