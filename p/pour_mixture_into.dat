All the {{ingredients}} it needs are diced mango, sliced pomelo, sago, coconut milk, evaporated milk and milk. First, boil the sago while blending mango, coconut milk, evaporated milk and milk in the blender. When the sago begins to float and turns into transparent, rinse it for later use. Then, <b>pour</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> a bowl together with the cooked sago and mix well. Lastly, the pomelo is put on top of the mixture for decoration. All these ingredients can be chilled beforehand to improve the taste of this dessert.|$|R

Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cakes is fairly consistent in all recipes. First, preheat the oven at around 170 degree Celsius, at the same time, mix the 1 eggs and 3 egg yolks by adding sugar and honey which depend on preference. The mixture will be creamed by using a wooden spoon or electric mixer. The gluten flour will be added and stir them softly for a while. Then, <b>pour</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> molds. Place them into the oven and adjust to 170 degrees Celsius for 16 minutes. Someone may prefer to well done, then prolong the time to 20 minutes.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} influence of fillers on viscosity, especially of six mixtures that contain different amount of ferrite powder. It was made {{in order to find}} out an effect of introduced ferrite powder on epoxy resin processing conditions and parameters. Additionally viscosity of pure epoxy resin was determined for reference purposes. The influence of temperature on composites viscosity was also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Viscosity of mixtures based on epoxy resin that contain ferrite powders and pure epoxy resin using Hoeppler viscometer was measured. Procedures of viscosity measurements were performed for three temperatures and for three filler contents. Findings: Higher temperature of measurement resulted in lower values of viscosity while higher quantity of ferrite powder increased viscosity of mixtures. There was no difference between results of viscosity that were obtained for barium ferrite and strontium ferrite. Research limitations/implications: The main problem of this work was limitations of research method. Mixtures before measurement had to be put to the vacuum venting in order to remove air bubbles that were introduced through mixing. Also an amount of powder introduced into the matrix was limited because for higher contents {{it was not possible to}} <b>pour</b> <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> glass pipe of measurement device. Practical implications: Applied method allowed to determine the influence of temperature, kind and quantity of filler on viscosity. Viscosity is the main factor defining processing parameters in many processing technologies. Originality/value: Results of viscosity for searched composites are not known up till now. Achieved results are planned in order to use them in future works of authors on polymeric magnetic composites...|$|R
5000|$|A {{story of}} the origin of the dish {{involves}} Don Carlos Antonio López (the first constitutional president of the country between 1841 and 1862) and one of his cooks (called machú in the Guarani language). It is said that the great governor, a famously obese man, liked a white soup made with milk, Paraguay cheese (fresh cheese), egg and corn flour. One day the machú mistakenly added too much corn flour to the mixture. Near noon, she found herself with two problems: first, the mixture was too thick for tykuetî; second, she didn't have time to start the process over , or replace the favorite dish with another. So, showing off a decided attitude, a mix of fear and wit, she <b>poured</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> an iron container and cooked it in the tatakua ("hole of fire", a rustic Guarani oven made of clay and adobe), from which she obtained a [...] "solid soup". Don Carlos, after tasting it, found it very delicious and immediately named it [...] "sopa paraguaya".|$|R
50|$|Croak's dirt {{sculpture}} technique goes as follows. First a {{model is}} selected and photographed {{from many different}} angles. The photograph is then dressed with a grid {{in order to allow}} for accurate size referencing. Second, an armature is created from steel and aluminum that is strong enough to support two hundred pounds of clay. Third, the clay is sculpted {{in the presence of the}} model over the span of more than one hundred hours in order to replicate the model's body as precisely as possible. Fourth, smaller and more minute details like the face are refined. Fifth, the sculpture is then cut into pieces and a two layer mold (a rubber layer and a plaster layer) is made from those pieces. Sixth, Croak digs up or acquires a large amount of dirt and dries it with the aid of large fans. Seventh, Croak mixes the dirt with a binder, then <b>pours</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> the mold. Eighth, once set, the pieces of the sculpture are then reassembled and glued together with the same dirt and binder mixture with which they were created. His dirt sculptures have appeared in over twenty-five published books.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cellulose acetate {{phthalate}} (CAP) {{has been}} used for several decades in the pharmaceutical industry for enteric film coating of oral tablets and capsules. Micronized CAP, available commercially as "Aquateric" and containing additional ingredients required for micronization, used for tablet coating from water dispersions, was shown to adsorb and inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1), herpesviruses (HSV) and other sexually transmitted disease (STD) pathogens. Earlier studies indicate that a gel formulation of micronized CAP has a potential as a topical microbicide for prevention of STDs including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The objective of endeavors described here was to develop a water dispersible CAP film amenable to inexpensive industrial mass production. Methods CAP and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) were dissolved in different organic solvent <b>mixtures,</b> <b>poured</b> <b>into</b> dishes, and the solvents evaporated. Graded quantities of a resulting selected film were mixed for 5 min at 37 °C with HIV- 1, HSV and other STD pathogens, respectively. Residual infectivity of the treated viruses and bacteria was determined. Results The prerequisites for producing CAP films which are soft, flexible and dispersible in water, resulting in smooth gels, are combining CAP with HPC (other cellulose derivatives are unsuitable), and casting from organic solvent mixtures containing ≈ 50 to ≈ 65 % ethanol (EtOH). The films are ≈ 100 µ thick and have a textured surface with alternating protrusions and depressions revealed by scanning electron microscopy. The films, before complete conversion into a gel, rapidly inactivated HIV- 1 and HSV and reduced the infectivity of non-viral STD pathogens > 1, 000 -fold. Conclusions Soft pliable CAP-HPC composite films can be generated by casting from organic solvent mixtures containing EtOH. The films rapidly reduce the infectivity of several STD pathogens, including HIV- 1. They are converted into gels and thus {{do not have to be}} removed following application and use. In addition to their potential as topical microbicides, the films have promise for mucosal delivery of pharmaceuticals other than CAP. </p...|$|R
