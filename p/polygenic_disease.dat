40|$|Ion {{channels}} {{are a large}} family of > 400 related proteins representing > 1 % of our genetic endowment; however, ion-channel diseases reflect a relatively new category of inborn error. They were first recognized in 1989, {{with the discovery of}} cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and rapidly advanced as positional and functional studies converged in the dissection of components of the action potential of excitable tissues. Although it remains true that diseases of excitable tissue still most clearly illustrate this family of disease, ion-channel disorders now cover the gamut of medical disciplines, causing significant pathology in virtually every organ system, producing a surprising range of often unanticipated symptoms, and providing valuable targets for pharmacological intervention. Many of the features shared among the monogenic ion-channel diseases provide a general framework for formulating a foundation for considering their intrinsically promising role in <b>polygenic</b> <b>disease.</b> Since an increasingly important approach to the identification of genes underlying <b>polygenic</b> <b>disease</b> is to identify “functional candidates” within a critical region and to test their disease association, it becomes increasingly important to appreciate how these ion-channel mechanisms can be implicated in pathophysiology...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demand for the}} identification of genetic variation responsible for common diseases has translated into a need for sophisticated methods for effectively prioritizing mutations occurring in disease-associated genetic regions. In this article, we prioritize candidate nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) through a bioinformatics approach that takes advantages {{of a set of}} improved numeric features derived from protein-sequence information and a new statistical learning model called “multiple selection rule voting ” (MSRV). The sequence-based features can maximize the scope of applications of our approach, and the MSRV model can capture subtle characteristics of individual mutations. Systematic validation of the approach demonstrates that this approach is capable of prioritizing causal mutations for both simple monogenic <b>diseases</b> and complex <b>polygenic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Further studies of familial Alzheimer diseases and diabetes show that the approach can enrich mutations underlying these <b>polygenic</b> <b>diseases</b> among the top of candidate mutations. Application of this approach to unclassified mutations suggests that there are 10 suspicious mutations likely to cause diseases, and there is strong support for this in the literature. With the accelerating advancement of biomedical research, it has been widely accepted that inherited genetic variation {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of common diseases, including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes...|$|R
