40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} the strategic provision {{of a public}} good in a dynamic setting. The public good in question is reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, which limits the public bad of climate change. Emissions can be reduced both through demand- and supply-side policies, and countries differ in which type of policy they prefer. Two stylized models are developed, with consumer countries that consume fossil fuels, but produce none, and producer countries that produce fossil fuels, but consume none. In the first model, a <b>producer</b> <b>country</b> that does not care about the climate interacts with consumer countries that do. It is shown {{that even though the}} <b>producer</b> <b>country</b> does not care about the climate, it reduces production in order to limit emissions. In the second model, both producer and consumer countries care about the cli- mate. It is shown that the nature of future climate policies matters for emissions today. Between countries that prefer the same type of climate policy, the dynamic public good problem is aggravated. However, between countries that prefer different types of policies, the dynamic public good problem is alleviated...|$|E
40|$|Container {{multimodal}} transport system {{was an important}} promoter of postwar globalization. But in the future, part of global manufacturing may change from centralized to distributed due to 3 D printing. To evaluate its impact, this research established a system dynamics model of sneakers supply chain firstly. The modeling showed that the total demand of international transport would decline after the application of 3 D printing. For consumer country, the return of manufacturing would increase its container business. And that of <b>producer</b> <b>country</b> would reduce correspondingly. But for resource country, its resource exports would decline, while its container business may grow for the local processing of printing filaments. Secondly, the evaluations based on the data of Guangzhou port suggest that the 3 D printing of sneakers {{was not enough to}} subvert the existing system. It would be broken only after the 3 D printing of electrical products. By then, more manufacturing activities would transfer to the end of supply chain. On the other hand, <b>producer</b> <b>country</b> may actively respond to maintain its advantage in incumbent industrial pattern, such as Belt and Road initiative proposed by China. Deglobalization, caused by 3 D printing, and globalization strengthening, caused by trade cooperation, will affect this system simultaneously...|$|E

Finally, it is shown that producing countries cannot afford to ignore the reactions of other countries when contemplating different policy options...|$|E

At jurisdictional level, Australiaâ€™s wind generation is heavily skewed towards states like South Australia (SA) and Tasmania, which have some of the highest per capita wind generation in the world alongside leading U.S. states like Iowa and Texas [1]. With 39 percent of its total generation supplied by wind and solar plants, SA of National Electricity Market (NEM) region has second per capita capacity of renewable wind and solar energy in world after Iowa. The SA renewables experiment is more significant given most other high renewables penetration regions and countries â€“ Iowa, Denmark and Germany â€“ are much more integrated into larger grids with complementary (dispatchable) generation technologies. The SA grid is partially constrained, connected to Victoria by two transmission lines which allows it to source a maximum of around 20 percent of peak load from Victoria. By contrast, Denmark has interconnections that allow it to source its entire peak load from other countries.|$|E

In fact, CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire is self-sufficient in electricity; but the electric distribution network is not wide enough.

Moreover, the cost of electricity production by turbo-alternators using traditional fuel such as DDO is higher than the cost of electricity produced by the national electrical company. The principal aim of this study is to show that the use of the waste produced by the oil mill can be used as fuel for the production of electricity in order to satisfy the energy needs. Solid waste from a palm oil mill is used as fuel for boilers. Three types of composition are carried out: solid waste only (Fuel 1), oil cake only (Fuel 2), a mixture of solid waste and oil cake (Fuel 3). Physicochemical and energy studies of these fuels have been made. And that allows giving the contribution of oil cake in energy production (superheated steam, electric power) in agro industrial unit...|$|E

The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic {{and led to the}} [...] "First International Tin Agreement" [...] in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the International Tin Council (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for <b>producer</b> <b>countries.</b> However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.|$|R

Importantly, this paper studies the trade-off faced by drug consumer country`s government between prevention policies (aimed at reducing the demand for illegal drugs) and enforcement policies (aimed at reducing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs in <b>producer</b> <b>countries).</b> We use available data for the war against cocaine production and trafficking in Colombia, and that against consumption in the U.
