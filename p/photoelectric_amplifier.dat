40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{to reduce the}} Brownian deflections of electrometer systems. This is achieved by replacing the air damping by a special type of artificial damping. The latter is realised {{by means of a}} <b>photoelectric</b> <b>amplifier</b> containing a differentiating circuit, comp. fig. 1. The amount of light entering the photocell is made proportional to the deflection of the electrometer system and the output of the amplifier is fed back to the electrometer. The motion of the electrometer is studied with a photoelectric relay and a recording galvanometer allowing a magnification up to 14300. The application of this method of damping has already resulted in a hundred fold reduction of the Brownian energy and an increase in precision of a factor of ten. In order to reach the same accuracy with normal air-damping it should be necessary to cool the instrument to 3 °K...|$|E

50|$|Scottish {{inventor}} John Logie Baird {{demonstrated the}} world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters {{of a different}} primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London's Dominion Theatre. Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of <b>photoelectric</b> cells, <b>amplifiers,</b> glow-tubes, and color filters, {{with a series of}} mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a circuit for an {{inexpensive}} portable biosensing system based on surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. This portable biosensing system designed for field use is characterized by a special structure which consists of a microfluidic cell incorporating a right angle prism functionalized with a biomolecular identification membrane, a laser line generator and a data acquisition circuit board. The data structure, data memory capacity and a line charge-coupled device (CCD) array with a driving circuit for collecting the photoelectric signals are intensively focused on and the high performance analog-to-digital (A/D) converter is comprehensively evaluated. The interface circuit and the <b>photoelectric</b> signal <b>amplifier</b> circuit are first studied to obtain the weak signals from the line CCD array in this experiment. Quantitative measurements for validating the sensitivity of the biosensing system were implemented using ethanol solutions of various concentrations indicated by volume fractions of 5 %, 8 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, and 30 %, respectively, without a biomembrane immobilized on the surface of the SPR sensor. The experiments demonstrated that it is possible to detect a change in the refractive index of an ethanol solution with a sensitivity of 4. 99838 × 105 ΔRU/RI in terms of the changes in delta response unit with refractive index using this SPR biosensing system, whereby the theoretical limit of detection of 3. 3537 × 10 − 5 refractive index unit (RIU) and a high linearity at the correlation coefficient of 0. 98065. The results obtained from a series of tests confirmed the practicality of this cost-effective portable SPR biosensing system...|$|R
