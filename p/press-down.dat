It was briefly sold as LetraPage, but dropped from the market when Letraset subsequently acquired Ready,Set,Go! from Manhattan Graphics.|$|E
40|$|Insect {{adhesion}} {{is mediated}} by thin fluid films secreted into the contact zone. As {{the amount of}} fluid affects adhesive forces, a control of secretion appears probable. Here, we quantify {{for the first time}} the rate of fluid secretion in adhesive pads of cockroaches and stick insects. The volume of footprints deposited during consecutive <b>press-downs</b> decreased exponentially and approached a non-zero steady state, demonstrating the presence of a storage volume. We estimated its size and the influx rate into it from a simple compartmental model. Influx was independent of step frequency. Fluid-depleted pads recovered maximal footprint volumes within 15 min. Pads in stationary contact accumulated fluid along the perimeter of the contact zone. The initial fluid build-up slowed down, suggesting that flow is driven by negative Laplace pressure. Freely climbing stick insects left hardly any traceable footprints, suggesting that they save secretion by minimizing contact area or by recovering fluid during detachment. However, even the highest fluid production rates observed incur only small biosynthesis costs, representing less than 1 per cent of the resting metabolic rate. Our results show that fluid secretion in insect wet adhesive systems relies on simple physical principles, allowing for passive control of fluid volume within the contact zone...|$|R
50|$|Bed {{of nails}} {{fixtures}} require a mechanical assembly {{to hold the}} PCB in place. Fixtures can hold the PCB with either a vacuum or pressing {{down from the top}} of the PCB. Vacuum fixtures give better signal reading versus the <b>press-down</b> type. On the other hand, vacuum fixtures are expensive because of their high manufacturing complexity. Moreover, vacuum fixtures cannot be used on bed-of-nails systems that are used in automated production lines, where the board is automatically loaded to the tester by a handling mechanism.The bed of nails or fixture, as generally termed, is used together with an in-circuit tester. Fixtures with a grid of 0.8 mm for small nails and test point diameter 0.6 mm are theoretically possible without using special constructions. But in mass production, test point diameters of 1.0 mm or higher are normally used to minimise contact failures leading to lower remachining costs.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{automatic}} soldering technology using {{industrial robots}} has been spreaded {{in the production}} line. As the main problem is this automation technique low production speed and low flexibility can be counted. Though development of new method in robotic soldering the production speed can be essentially improved rather than through optimization of soldering process and robot path. This paper introduces new soldering process suitable to robotics soldering and verifies the results through experiments. Optimized vibration process is added during wire feeding. By this method quality as well as soldering speed could be improved. Automatic soldering tool for robots imitated the motion of manual workers. But hte flexiblity of tool construction is very limited as against human hands. This poor flexibility of soldering tool cannot cover the wide application. Here a flexible soldering tool is introduced. In approaching of soldering tip to pin/pad will be searched correct positions of pin using optical fiber sensor in a cartesian direction. During press process 2 <b>press-down</b> force components will be feedbached to optimal value because the <b>press-down</b> force is a important parameter of soldering process...|$|E
