2500|$|In December 1941, Osipov {{was drafted}} into the Red Army. He fought in combat from September 1942. Osipov became a pontonier in the 134th Separate Motorized <b>Pontoon-Bridge</b> Battalion. The {{battalion}} {{became part of the}} 6th Pontoon Bridge Brigade of the 40th Army in March 1943. In August, he fought in the Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation. On 27 August, the battalion was involved in the crossing of the Vorskla River during the Lower Dnieper Offensive. It was necessary to build a pontoon bridge to enable heavy tanks to cross the river in the Akhtyrka-Detgorodok area. Osipov reportedly spent ten hours in the water constructing the bridge, despite German bombing raids. Between 28 and 29 August, Osipov reportedly led a group of soldiers in the area of Zhuravne and Buymerovka in installing bridge supports in the water. For these actions, Osipov was recommended by his battalion commander for the Order of the Red Star, but this was downgraded to the Medal [...] "For Courage", which Osipov received on 11 September.|$|E

6000|$|Friedrich {{was among}} the last to quit the ground. He seemed stupefied by the excess of his emotions; in no haste to go; {{uncertain}} whether he would go at all. His adjutants were about him, and a small party of Ziethen Hussars under Captain Prittwitz. Wild swarms of Cossacks approached the place. [...] "PRITTWITZ, ICH BIN VERLOREN (Prittwitz, I am lost)!" [...] remarked he. [...] "NEIN, IHRO MAJESTAT!" [...] answered Prittwitz with enthusiasm; charged fiercely, he and his few, into the swarms of Cossacks; cut them about, held them at bay, or sent them else-whither, while the Adjutants seized Friedrich's bridle, and galloped off with him. At OEtscher and the Bridges, Friedrich found of his late Army not quite 3,000 men. Even Wunsch is not there till next morning. Wunsch with his Party had, early in the afternoon, laid hold of Frankfurt, as ordered; made the garrison prisoners, blocked the Oder Bridge; poor Frankfurt tremulously thanking Heaven for him, and for such an omen. In spite of their Wagenburg and these <b>Pontoon-Bridges,</b> it appears, {{there would have been}} no retreat for the Russians except into Wunsch's cannon: Wagenburg way, latish in the afternoon, there was such a scramble of runaways and retreating baggage, all was jammed into impassability; scarcely could a single man get through. In case of defeat, the Russian Army would have had no chance but surrender or extermination. [Tempelhof, iii. 194: in Retzow (ii. 110) is some dubious traditionary stuff on the matter.] At dark, however, Wunsch had summons, so truculent in style, he knew what it meant; and answering in words peremptorily, [...] "No" [...] with a like emphasis, privately got ready again, and at midnight disappeared. Got to Reitwein without accident.|$|R

60|$|About this time, {{the rains}} having set in heavily in Tennessee and North Alabama, making it {{difficult}} to move army transportation and artillery, General Thomas stopped the pursuit by his main force at the Tennessee River. A small force of cavalry, under Colonel W. J. Palmer, 15th Pennsylvania Volunteers, continued to follow Hood for some distance, capturing considerable transportation and all the enemy's <b>pontoon-bridge.</b> The details of these operations will be found clearly set forth in General Thomas's report.|$|E
60|$|We paddled and floundered {{over the}} ruins of the track, and, {{scrambling}} down an embankment, crossed the Potomac by a <b>pontoon-bridge,</b> a thousand feet in length, over the narrow line of which--level with the river, and rising and subsiding with it--General Banks had recently led his whole army, with its ponderous artillery and heavy laden wagons. Yet our own tread made it vibrate. The broken bridge of the railroad was a little below us, and at the base of one of its massive piers, in the rocky bed of the river, lay a locomotive, which the Rebels had precipitated there.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Sherman {{discovered}} that the enemy had left his front he directed his reserves, Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland, to push over the <b>pontoon-bridge</b> {{at the mouth of}} the Chickamauga, and to move forward to Chickamauga Station. He ordered Howard to move up the stream some two miles to where there was an old bridge, repair it during the night, and follow Davis at four o'clock in the morning. Morgan L. Smith was ordered to reconnoitre the tunnel to see if that was still held. Nothing was found there but dead bodies of men of both armies. The rest of Sherman's command was directed to follow Howard at daylight in the morning to get on to the railroad towards Graysville.|$|E
6000|$|From Thurmsdorf to the <b>Pontoon-Bridge</b> {{there was}} a kind of road; down which the Saxons {{scrambled}} yesterday; and, by painful degrees, got wriggled across. But, on the other shore, forward to the Hamlets of Halbstadt and Ebenheit, there is nothing but a steep slippery footpath: figure what a problem for the 14,000 in such weather! Then at Ebenheit, close behind, Browne-wards, were Browne now there, rises the Lilienstein, abrupt rocky mountain, its slopes on both hands washed by the River (River making its first elbow here, closely girdling this Lilienstein): on both these slopes are Prussian batteries, each with its abatis; needing to be stormed:--that will be your first operation. Abatis and slopes of the Lilienstein once stormed, you fall into a valley or hollow, raked again by Prussian batteries; and will have to mount, still storming, out of the valley, sky-high across the Ziegenruck (GOAT'S-BACK) ridge: that is your second preliminary operation. After which you come upon the work itself; namely, the Prussian redoubts at Lichtenhayn, and 12,000 men on them by this time! A modern Tourist says, reminding or informing: ...|$|E
60|$|By the 1st of February, General Sherman's whole {{army was}} in motion from Savannah. He {{captured}} Columbia, South Carolina, on the 17th; thence moved on Goldsboro', North Carolina, via Fayetteville, reaching the latter {{place on the}} 12th of March, opening up communication with General Schofield by way of Cape Fear River. On the 15th he resumed his march on Goldsboro'. He met a force of the enemy at Averysboro', and after a severe fight defeated and compelled it to retreat. Our loss in this engagement was about six hundred. The enemy's loss was much greater. On the 18th the combined forces of the enemy, under Joe Johnston, attacked his advance at Bentonville, capturing three guns and driving it back upon the main body. General Slocum, {{who was in the}} advance ascertaining that the whole of Johnston's army was in the front, arranged his troops on the defensive, intrenched himself and awaited reinforcements, which were pushed forward. On the night of the 21st the enemy retreated to Smithfield, leaving his dead and wounded in our hands. From there Sherman continued to Goldsboro', which place had been occupied by General Schofield on the 21st (crossing the Neuse River ten miles above there, at Cox's Bridge, where General Terry had got possession and thrown a <b>pontoon-bridge</b> on the 22d), thus forming a junction with the columns from New Bern and Wilmington.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{one small}} shop which {{appeared}} to have nothing for sale. A single man {{and one or two}} boys were all the inhabitants in view, except the Yankee sentinels and soldiers, belonging to Massachusetts regiments, who were scattered about pretty numerously. A guard-house stood on the slope of the hill; and in the level street at its base were the offices of the Provost-Marshal and other military authorities, to whom we forthwith reported ourselves. The Provost-Marshal kindly sent a corporal to guide us to the little building which John Brown seized upon as his fortress, and which, after it was stormed by the United States marines, became his temporary prison. It is an old engine-house, rusty and shabby, like every other work of man's hands in this God-forsaken town, and stands fronting upon the river, only a short distance from the bank, nearly {{at the point where the}} <b>pontoon-bridge</b> touches the Virginia shore. In its front wall, on each side of the door, are two or three ragged loop-holes, which John Brown perforated for his defence, knocking out merely a brick or two, so as to give himself and his garrison a sight over their rifles. Through these orifices the sturdy old man dealt a good deal of deadly mischief among his assailants, until they broke down the door by thrusting against it with a ladder, and tumbled headlong in upon him. I shall not pretend to be an admirer of old John Brown, any farther than sympathy with Whittier's excellent ballad about him may go; nor did I expect ever to shrink so unutterably from any apophthegm of a sage, whose happy lips have uttered a hundred golden sentences, as from that saying (perhaps falsely attributed to so honored a source), that the death of this blood-stained fanatic has [...] "made the Gallows as venerable as the Cross!" [...] Nobody was ever more justly hanged. He won his martyrdom fairly, and took it firmly. He himself, I am persuaded (such was his natural integrity), would have acknowledged that Virginia had a right to take the life which he had staked and lost; although it would have been better for her, in the hour that is fast coming, if she could generously have forgotten the criminality of his attempt in its enormous folly. On the other hand, any common-sensible man, looking at the matter unsentimentally, must have felt a certain intellectual satisfaction in seeing him hanged, if it were only in requittal of his preposterous miscalculation of possibilities. [Can it be a son of old Massachusetts who utters this abominable sentiment? For shame.] ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{preparations}} {{should be}} made for attacking the enemy's [...] position on Missionary Ridge by Saturday at daylight. Not being [...] provided with a map giving names of roads, spurs of the [...] mountains, and other places, such definite instructions cannot [...] be given as might be desirable. However, the general plan, you [...] understand, is for Sherman, with the force brought with him [...] strengthened by a division from your command, to effect a [...] crossing of the Tennessee River just below the mouth of [...] Chickamauga; his crossing to be protected by artillery from the [...] heights on the north {{bank of the river}} (to be located by your [...] chief of artillery), and to secure the heights on the northern [...] extremity to about the railroad tunnel before the enemy can [...] concentrate against him. You will co-operate with Sherman. The [...] troops in Chattanooga Valley should be well concentrated on your [...] left flank, leaving only the necessary force to defend [...] fortifications on the right and centre, and a movable column of [...] one division in readiness to move wherever ordered. This [...] division should show itself as threateningly as possible on the [...] most practicable line for making an attack up the valley. Your [...] effort then will be to form a junction with Sherman, making your [...] advance well towards the northern end of Missionary Ridge, and [...] moving as near simultaneously with him as possible. The [...] junction once formed and the ridge carried, communications will [...] be at once established between the two armies by roads on the [...] south bank of the river. Further movements will then depend on [...] those of the enemy. Lookout Valley, I think, will be easily [...] held by Geary's division and what troops you may still have [...] there belonging to the old Army of the Cumberland. Howard's [...] corps can then be held in readiness to act either with you at [...] Chattanooga or with Sherman. It should be marched on Friday [...] night to a position {{on the north side of}} the river, not lower [...] down than the first <b>pontoon-bridge,</b> and there held in readiness [...] for such orders as may become necessary. All these troops will [...] be provided with two days' cooked rations in haversacks, and one [...] hundred rounds of ammunition on the person of each infantry [...] soldier.

50|$|Some {{historians have}} {{dismissed}} the Praetorian Guard as a parade-ground army of little military value. The Praetorians were certainly taunted as such by {{the soldiers of}} the Danubian legions {{during the civil war}} of 68-9. But Rankov argues that the Praetorians boasted a distinguished campaign-record that shows that their training and military effectiveness was far more impressive than those of merely ceremonial troops and amply justified their elite status. During the Julio-Claudian era (to 68), the Praetorians saw relatively little action in the field, as emperors only rarely led their armies in person. After that date, emperors led armies, and therefore deployed the Praetorians on campaign, much more frequently. The Praetorians were {{in the thick of the}} Emperor Domitian's wars, firstly in Germany and then on the Dacian front, where their prefect, Cornelius Fuscus was killed in action (87). Other examples include the Praetorians' prominent role in Trajan's Dacian Wars (101-6), as acknowledged on the friezes of Trajan's Column and the Adamklissi Tropaeum. Equally celebrated, on the Column of Marcus Aurelius, was the Praetorians' role in the Marcomannic Wars (166-80), in which two Guard prefects lost their lives. Even their final hour was wreathed in military glory: at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), the Praetorians fought fiercely for their emperor Maxentius, trying to prevent the army of rival emperor Constantine I from crossing the river Tiber and entering Rome. Many perished fighting and others drowned when the makeshift <b>pontoon-bridge</b> they were using collapsed. Subsequently, the Praetorians paid the price of supporting the losing side: they were definitively disbanded, and their fortress demolished, by Constantine.|$|E
