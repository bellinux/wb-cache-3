25|$|Emergency {{workers who}} {{arrived at the}} scene were tasked not only with looking for survivors, but also with <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fire at the crash site. Hungarian {{authorities}} reported that the heavily wooded and steep terrain, {{as well as the}} low temperatures, contributed to the destruction and hampered rescue efforts. It was also reported that helicopters were unable to land at the crash site. Access was also made difficult because the road leading to the site was covered in snow.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 1925, {{after several}} hours of work, Floyd Collins managed to squeeze through several narrow passageways; he claimed he had {{discovered}} a large, grotto chamber, though this was never verified. Because his lamp was dying, {{he had to leave}} quickly before losing all light to the chamber, but became trapped in a small passage on his way out. Collins accidentally knocked over his lamp, <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> light, and was caught by a rock from the cave ceiling, pinning his left leg. The falling rock weighed only 16pounds, but because of its position, obstructed rescuers in completing the removal.|$|E
25|$|Cecan's status {{improved}} {{with the union}} of Bessarabia with Romania, following which he was reinstated a Protoiereus of the Romanian Orthodox Church. He returned to his Nișcani parish, where he built a church, and continued to involve himself in political and religious disputes. By 1925–1926, he was <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> magazine Unirea (or Yedineniye), which was a continuation of Obyedineniye. Here and in his propaganda brochures, Cecan took a strongly anti-communist and anti-Soviet position, describing communism as being intertwined with Pan-Slavism and Russian Orthodoxy. He looked into ways of emancipating Romanian Orthodoxy from its Slavic counterparts, looking into the precedent set by the Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic.|$|E

First-aid stations were set up in the streets to treat minor injuries. A Salvation Army rescue team was sent into the area under Catherine Bramwell-Booth, and the YMCA also rendered aid, including food and hot drinks. Thousands were left homeless, requiring temporary accommodation in schools, churches, and other similar places. 1,700men were employed in the reconstruction task by February. £3m in aid was paid to those affected by the blast, equivalent to approximately £40m in 2007, of which £1m was paid to local businesses and factories, including £185,000 to Brunner-Mond.|$|E
25|$|By 1893, Steuerman had enlisted at the University of Iași Faculty of Medicine, but {{was still}} preoccupied with {{literary}} studies. The Jewish printing house of Lazăr Șaraga hosted Steuerman's selection of Romanian literature, Autori români ("Romanian Authors"). Published in or around 1893, it was divided into two volumes: the Anthology-proper and the Chrestomathy. Steuerman and Șaraga published a second edition in 1896. Between these, Steuerman and his editor worked on translations {{from the work of}} philosopher Vasile Conta, <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Theory of Universal Undulation in 1894, and the Basic Metaphysics in 1896. The same collaboration brought the posthumous edition of poems by the socialist Traian Demetrescu, published by Șaraga and prefaced by Steuerman, and tales by Carmen Sylva, the Queen-consort of Romania.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, {{when all}} the Romanian factions briefly cooperated to block out other ethnic communities, Isopescu-Grecul also secured {{election}} to the Diet of Bukovina for Storozynetz. He had reconciled with Popovici and the PNPR youth wing, {{becoming one of the}} group's 7 representatives in the Diet; the Democratic Peasantists had 8, and the Conservatives, heralded by Iancu Flondor, had 5. He also retook his seat in the House in the parliamentary election of that year, again as representative for Storozynetz, Bojan, and Czernowitz. In Bojan, he defeated Florea Lupu, the Democratic Peasantist banker, during a heated campaign which saw him being injured by Lupu's voters. Isopescu-Grecul was <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> newspaper Unirea Națională, which claimed that Lupu intended to destroy the network of Bukovinan Romanian banks.|$|E

25|$|A while after, Cocea {{made his}} way in the Russian Republic, Romania's Entente ally, and settled in Petrograd. His {{activities}} there included <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> French-language magazine, L'Entente ("The Entente"), which was financed by his old rivals, the Romanian National Liberals. As a resident of Hotel Astoria, he witnessed first-hand the October Revolution, and became a passionate supporter of the Bolshevik cause. He later {{claimed to have been}} present, on Revolution day, in the Petrograd Soviet hall, hearing the victorious speech of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, and to have later attended the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. As a representative of the International Association for Information of the Labor Press of America, France, and Great Britain, Cocea exchanged notes with Lenin. He interviewed Lenin about the Bolsheviks' goals, assuring him that his replies would be published verbatim.|$|E
25|$|Emerson's Concord home {{caught fire}} on July 24, 1872. He called {{for help from}} neighbors and, giving up on <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> flames, all {{attempted}} to save as many objects as possible. The fire was put out by Ephraim Bull Jr., the one-armed son of Ephraim Wales Bull. Donations were collected by friends to help the Emersons rebuild, including $5,000 gathered by Francis Cabot Lowell, another $10,000 collected by LeBaron Russell Briggs, and a personal donation of $1,000 from George Bancroft. Support for shelter was offered as well; though the Emersons ended up staying with family at the Old Manse, invitations came from Anne Lynch Botta, James Elliot Cabot, James Thomas Fields and Annie Adams Fields. The fire marked an end to Emerson's serious lecturing career; from then on, he would lecture only on special occasions and only in front of familiar audiences.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to his writing, Theodorian advanced through with his bureau jobs, working as second inspector for State Monopolies in 1896, and being assigned a clerical position at Bucharest Police Headquarters in 1897. In April 1898, while commanding the police unit in Gara de Nord, he apprehended {{a ring of}} mail thieves who had thrived on transited Western merchandise. Later that year, he became head of police in Râmnicu Vâlcea, mediating between his politically ambitious brother and the Vâlcea County prefect (1900). He married Ana Iancovescu in 1899, and had two daughters from her—Emma and Alice. From 1901 to 1903, he was a deputy prefect in Northern Dobruja, moving between Babadag, Sulina, Cataloi and Măcin. He was again in Vâlcea as a village inspector on the Lotru (1904), <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> magazine Râmnicul (1906). Following the peasants' revolt of March 1907 and the cession of power to a National Liberal cabinet, he became for a while director of the Vâlcea prefecture. During this interval, he played host to an informal gathering of writers, including Victor Eftimiu, Octavian Goga, and Ilarie Chendi. According to Eftimiu, {{it was here that}} Chendi showed the first signs of a debilitating mental disease.|$|E

25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about this one time accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of the gorillas. Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an error of judgment, they walked into a tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until {{he was ready to}} try to become leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays a big part in helping Tarzan lead the gorillas to victory. Just as the gorillas are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{stood for}} 14 years before being {{destroyed by a}} great fire on April 23, 1879. About eleven {{in the morning on}} Wednesday morning, 23 April 1879, smoke and flames could be seen rising from the roof of the Main Building. The causes of the fire were impossible to ascertain. Workmen had been working on repairs on the roof until around 10 o'clock, and the fire might have started due to the dry timber on the roof. The fire was first spotted from the minim's courtyard, and soon word of the event spread {{to the rest of the}} students and faculty. Early attempts at <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fire were made, with lines of people passing buckets of waters towards the roof of the building. Water was forced into the great tanks on the roof by steam pressure. Despite these efforts, the fire had spread to the entire roof and quickly consumed the upper floors. The South Bend Fire Department was not able to arrive in time to save the main building, because of the long time needed to round up the volunteer firemen and set up the machines. The supports of the dome burned away and the statue went crashing below in a billow of sparks and flame, and even the most courageous abandoned the hope of saving the building and focused on rescuing whatever valuable effects might be carried out of the burning building. In the zeal to save precious objects students threw many of the valuables from the windows, yet despite the well-intentioned effort, almost all of these were lost in crashing on the ground. This was especially true for many of the most precious books and manuscripts.|$|E

Two coroner's inquests were opened: one in Senghenydd for the men who died in the colliery, and one in Cardiff for those who had died in hospital; both were adjourned the same day.

500|$|Brill {{took off}} for his second mission to Berlin on 27January. The Lancaster he flew {{was said to be}} jinxed, possessed of an engine that lost power in the air but always tested well on the ground, and {{suffering}} oxygen failure that killed its rear gunner on the previous sortie. One of the engines did begin to falter before Brill reached Berlin, forcing him to fly lower than normal. Having released his bombs over target, he felt the plane take several strikes that he assumed were anti-aircraft fire, but were in fact the incendiaries of a Lancaster flying above. His aircraft's nose, rudder controls, and electricals were all severely damaged, and the port wing was on fire. Having warned his crew to prepare to bail out, Brill dived the Lancaster and succeeded in <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> flames. The crew was able to remain on board and, after a nine-hour flight, the plane landed back at Waddington. Brill's verdict on the mission was, as he later wrote, [...] "not my idea of an evening's entertainment". He flew a total of eleven operations during the Battle of Berlin, including Bomber Command's costliest raid of the war, against Nuremberg in March. On that occasion, one of his engines failed and another was damaged when he had to fly through a cloud of debris from a Lancaster that was blown to pieces directly in his path.|$|E

Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> energy for the length of shows they were doing.

Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted.
