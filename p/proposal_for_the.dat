5|$|The ICD-10 {{criteria}} are typically used in European countries, while the DSM {{criteria are}} used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first-rank symptoms. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high. The current <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom.|$|E
5|$|The Plays of William Shakespeare was an 18th-century {{edition of}} the {{dramatic}} works of William Shakespeare, edited by Samuel Johnson and George Steevens.

5|$|Abdul Taib Mahmud, the BN chief {{minister}} of Sarawak, revised new land renewal rates which took effect on June 1. He {{said that the}} Sarawak new land rates is the cheapest in Malaysia as compared to other states. In accordance with opposition <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unconditioned, automatic renewal of land leases, he also challenged the opposition-led state governments to announce new land rates lower than the current one announced by himself, without risking the income of the state governments.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, another <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> flag was {{initiated}} by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The flag {{consisted of a}} thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906. Soon, many other proposals were initiated, {{but none of them}} gained attention from the nationalist movement.|$|E

5|$|Following Seven Assignments Clarke {{then took}} a job at Conservative Central Office, as Head of Public Opinion Research, where he worked until 1952. During this later career he also served as a {{director}} of Securicor. In 1952 he resumed his literary career with the publication of The Eleventh at War, a history of the 11th Hussars. The following year he submitted a publisher's <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Secret War, a full account of deception during the Second World War, but was prevented from writing it by the Official Secrets Act. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|He {{proposed}} that the population of Milton Keynes should double in the next 20 years. He appointed English Partnerships to do so, taking planning controls away from Milton Keynes Borough Council and making EP the statutory planning authority. In turn, EP established a subsidiary Milton Keynes Partnership to manage the programme locally. Their <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next phase of expansion moves away from grid squares to large scale, mixed use, higher density developments which are more based on assumptions about public transport than private car usage.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of a General Assembly went before the Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to the necessity of having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval {{of a majority of}} presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E

Scattered throughout the plan were references to streets, boulevards, parkways, and various other connections between District and regional parks and the District and the surrounding cities and undeveloped areas.|$|R

5|$|It {{was again}} {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City wanted to get funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic Committee would vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{was already}} {{known for his}} concern for the Irish people and for writing several {{political}} pamphlets. One of these, <b>Proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Universal use of Irish Manufacture (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that the printer, John Harding, was prosecuted, although the pamphlet had done little more than recommend that the Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England. It was also known by the Irish authorities that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, {{and that he would}} use his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May 1684 an {{earthquake}} devastated the city, severely damaging the Santa María castle. A road linking the Santa María de la Cabeza and San Antonio de la Eminencia castles was mentioned by Agustín Crame in a 1777 <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{defense of the}} city. Crame opposed the idea, but stated that if a road were built {{it should be a}} gravel one. The Santa María de la Cabeza castle was partially destroyed in a powerful earthquake felt throughout the state in 1797.|$|E

5|$|On November 17, 2008, Aliferi {{returned}} {{yet again}} to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction {{to begin with a}} condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi would also have to return for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due to the location, which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards to}} actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Printed Books {{had been}} in charge of the Philatelic Collections by default rather than design.

No decision could be agreed and Printed Books continued to manage the Collections until they were passed to the newly formed British Library in 1973.|$|E

5|$|The county {{facilities}} in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s {{the role of the}} military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682; he argued that it would cost at least £30,000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification, producing a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> six bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York, who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority.|$|E
5|$|The initial <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> CryoSat {{programme}} {{was submitted}} {{as part of}} a call for proposals in July 1998 for Earth Explorer missions as part of the European Space Agency's Living Planet programme.

The construction phase began in 2001, and in 2002 EADS Astrium was awarded a contract to build the spacecraft. A contract was also signed with Eurockot, to conduct the launch of the satellite using a Rokot/Briz-KM carrier rocket.|$|E
5|$|The <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spalding war {{memorial}} {{originated with}} Barbara McLaren (née Jekyll).

Lutyens designed the McLarens' London house on Cowley Street in Westminster in 1911 and shortly after Francis' death in 1917 designed the headstone for his grave in Busbridge in Surrey. He was later responsible for the war memorial in the same village.|$|E
