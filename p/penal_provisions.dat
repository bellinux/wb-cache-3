Nearly a decade earlier, on 12 July 1999, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in India banned smoking in public places by declaring public smoking as illegal (the first time in the world), unconstitutional, and violative of Article 21 of the constitution. The bench headed by Dr. Justice K.

On 30 April 2013 the new Bill—The West Bengal Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Bill (2013), was passed in a two-day special session of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly. The new law has provisions for retrospective effect, search and seizure, enhanced penalties, establishment of special courts and confiscation of property. As the Bill pertained to the Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution, on which a federal law was already in place, it required approval from the President. The Bill was sent to the Union Home Ministry, which sent it back to the West Bengal Assembly on 6 June 2013, stating that the Bill has <b>penal</b> <b>provisions</b> implemented with retrospective effect, thus contravening the Basic structure doctrine of the Indian constitution and the established criminal law jurisprudence. On 12 December 2013, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed an amended version of the original Bill, incorporating changes suggested by the financial services, and revenue and economic affairs departments in New Delhi.

I, on the contrary, have been led to the opinion that it is vital to any practical or effective policy against sweating. It is no use to attempt, in trades as complex and obscure as these with which we are dealing, to substitute outside authority for trade opinion. The only hope lies in the judicious combination of the two, each acting and reacting upon the other. A mere increase of the <b>penal</b> <b>provisions</b> and inspection would be a poor compensation for the active support of a powerful section within the trade itself. It is upon the probationary period that we rely to enable us to rally to the Trade Board and to its minimum wage the best employers in the trade.

The inquiries which I have set on foot in the various trades scheduled have brought to me most satisfactory assurances from nearly all the employers to whom my investigators have addressed themselves.|$|E

Norway is a signatory to the International Criminal Court which has complementary jurisdiction to municipal criminal courts, albeit that the local courts have precedence to prosecute the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Norway prosecutes international crimes using domestic penal law, e.g., genocide can be treated as homicide, torture as an offence against the person, etc. Norwegian criminal law is applicable to acts committed abroad by any Norwegian national or any person domiciled in Norway when the act is a felony under the law of the country in which it is committed.

The manufacture of lucifer matches by means of white phosphorus was forbidden and the export, importation and sale was regulated by a law of 28 May 1901. By a regulation of 16 March 1904 provisions for safety and health of women and young workers were strengthened in processes where lead compounds or other poisons are used, and their employment at certain dangerous machines and in cleaning machinery or near driving belts was prohibited.

40|$|Reinterpretation of Islamic Penal Punishment: A Study on Prof. K. H. Ibrahim Hosen, LML’s thought. Islamic penal {{punishment}} that {{is related to}} the qishas and hudûd is often considered as violating of human rights and intimidation so that there are many rejections in its application.

In this context, Ibrahim Hosen as the expert of Ushul al-Fiqh (Islamic Legal Theory) and comparative Islamic legal (Fiqh al-Muqâran) in Indonesia tried to neutralize the rigid understanding by using the types of crime and the reinterpretation of punishment through understanding of the texts contextually by using ijtihad istislahi (independent reasoning of public interest) and refers to the purpose of its application that prefers to the function of zawajir than the other.

In this case, the question arises as to whether the act that breaches several criminal provisions in reality violates only one. The approach followed in case law is a very formal one which ends up providing no limiting effects to cumulative convictions. Plausibly, this is a consequence of a line of thought that emerged {{in the aftermath of the}} Second War World and advances a primarily ‘retributive’ idea of punishment for serious international crimes, where there is no room for the perpetrator’s rehabilitation.

40|$|In Norwegian law we have civil {{anti-discrimination}} {{legislation that}} prohibits discrimination and harassment based on ethnicity, religion, beliefs, disability, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. However, {{with the exception}} of the Ethnicity Anti-Discrimination Act, none of these anti-discrimination laws contain a legal basis for penalties for contravention. Our most important <b>penal</b> <b>provision</b> pertaining to hate speech is Section 185 of the Norwegian General Civil Penal Code. Of the above-mentioned grounds for discrimination, the <b>penal</b> <b>provision</b> only includes ethnicity/skin colour/nationality, religion/beliefs, homosexual orientation and disability. Neither sexual orientation in general nor gender and gender identity/expression receive direct criminal law protection against hate speech. However, these categories are still given indirect protection in more general provisions in criminal law. ( [...] .) In terms of legal sources, the situation is complex. The interpretation and application of the provisions in the Norwegian General Civil Penal Code must take place in a manner that is compatible with freedom of speech as this is protected in both the Constitution and in international conventions that Norway is bound by, and which have been implemented into Norwegian law through the Human Rights Act, including Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). At the same time, Section 98 of the Constitution contains a general equality and non-discrimination principle and Norway also has obligations pursuant to international conventions to combat and, in part, criminalise, certain forms of hate speech. The only explicit obligation to criminalise is found in Article 4 of CERD (UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination). This entails that Norway’s legislative room to manoeuvre is most restricted when concerning hate speech based on someone’s ethnicity, skin colour and nationality. However, with regard to the other grounds for discrimination, Norway has more flexibility in terms of whether and to what extent hate speech should be criminalised. Based on a review of the European Court of Human Rights’ (ECtHR) jurisprudence on cases concerning hate speech versus freedom of speech, there is nothing at a general level that indicates that current Norwegian law goes too far in restricting freedom of speech in terms how this is enforced by the ECtHR...|$|R
