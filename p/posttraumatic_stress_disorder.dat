In this context, a better understanding is needed of how functional brain systems adapt to severe emotional stress. Previous animal studies have demonstrated the importance of limbic, paralimbic, striatal, and prefrontal structures in stress and fear responses. Human studies, which have focused primarily on patients with clinically established <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> have reported abnormalities in similar brain structures.

Here, we show alteration of brain function in a cohort of healthy survivors within 25 days after the Wenchuan earthquake by a recently discovered method known as "resting-state'' functional MRI. The current investigation demonstrates that regional activity in frontolimbic and striatal areas increased significantly and connectivity among limbic and striatal networks was attenuated in our participants who had recently experienced severe emotional trauma. Trauma victims also had a reduced temporal synchronization within the "default mode'' of resting-state brain function, which has been characterized in humans and other species. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that significant alterations in brain function, similar in many ways to those observed in <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> can be seen shortly after major traumatic experiences, highlighting the need for early evaluation and intervention for trauma survivors.

40|$|This {{clinical}} study focusing on {{people suffering from}} post-traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorders</b> following an aggression investigates the characteristics and evolution of sleep disturbances.

These two groups and a control group of 30 subjects were adjusted for sex, age and socio-professional level. The sleep disturbances were divided into difficulties in falling asleep, middle sleep disturbance, and early awakening. Combining clinical and statistical approaches, this study shows that behind the nocturnal symptoms in post-traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> especially traumatic dreams, there occurs a psychic reorganisation. Even if most of the sleep disturbances are persistant in long-term <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> our results show a diminution in the falling-asleep disturbances and nocturnal terrors.

50|$|Women often suffer lasting mental {{conditions}} {{from their}} abuse including anxiety <b>disorders,</b> depression, and <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorders</b> (PTSD). Since women in shelters have more likely experienced severe {{physical and mental}} abuse {{than those who do}} not utilize these services, they {{are also more likely to}} experience PTSD. In fact, a national organizational survey compiled four separate studies of female support group or shelter users and reported PTSD rates between 45% and 84% (Astin, Lawrence, Pincus, & Foy, 1990; Houskamp & Foy,1991; Roberts, 1996a; Saunders, 1994). These emotional and mental consequences have an effect on women's career opportunities and ability to function in normal life. Women's shelters try to counteract these effects as well as prevent future instances of abuse. However, PTSD can prohibit women from utilizing shelter resources effectively.|$|R

There was some talk among residents of leaving Ulithi and moving to nearby islands such as Yap, Palau, Saipan, or even the Philippines; however, mentions of this diminished relatively quickly. The devastation to the island's infrastructure hastened a previously gradual change in buildings. Reconstruction efforts had entirely abandoned traditional Ulithi building styles in favor of more modern ones.
