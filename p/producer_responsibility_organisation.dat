40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis is {{an interest in}} promoting circular material flows. Based on {{an understanding of the}} physical limitations and possibilities of plastic recycling, the thesis answers the question: How can recycling of plastic packaging waste from Danish retail be improved? Fieldtrips and stakeholder interviews have provided valuable insight to the field. This primary empirical data is analysed along with relevant policy, literature, and statistics. We conclude that Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a relevant tool in order to improve recycling of plastic packaging waste from Danish retail. EPR should cover other fractions and other sectors so as to increase environmental benefits. Three models for assigning responsibility are discussed; individual producer responsibility, a <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>organisation</b> (PRO) with simple organisational responsibility and a PRO with full organisational responsibility. Implementing EPR on Danish packaging should be done in close cooperation with relevant industry to avoid sub-optimal solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} key conditions for successful industrial implementation of collective extended producer responsibility (EPR) programmes in the Norwegian plastic packaging system, according to an industrial ecology perspective. ‘Key condition’ is defined as those factors, both drivers and barriers, which are critical for the outcome of industrial implementation of EPR. As we have seen there are several key conditions to be identified. We have studied this by first developing a theoretical framework based on the industrial ecology perspective and combined with a modified understanding on categories for EPR policy instruments we have developed an analytical framework which combines a material flow approach and an actor approach. Based on this we have carried out {{a case study of}} the Norwegian EPR system for plastic packaging, organised by the <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>organisation</b> Plastretur. We have shown the complexity of this system by doing analysis on various levels, both with respect to material flows and to actors. Our conclusions are primarily valid for this system only, but we have shown how our results correspond to existing literature, both theoretically and in practice. The overall conclusion from this case study is that the Plastretur EPR scheme has proven to be successful with respect to recycling ratios and costs, while it has been less successful concerning dematerialisation and design for recycling. This conclusion is contrary to what is considered to be the strength of EPR policies, but it provides empirical evidence for the arguments put forth by for instance Veerman (2004) on the Dutch system, claiming that EPR has mainly effects downstream. We argue {{that one of the reasons}} to this controversial result is that previous studies have not to a sufficient extent taken into account the need for identifying the causality between EPR policy instruments and the observed effects. We have provided this through a detailed case study on various analytical levels. PhD i industriell økologiPhD in Industrial Ecolog...|$|E

40|$|Discarded {{electrical}} and electronic equipment is {{a rapidly growing}} waste stream which has increased in part be-cause advances in technology have contributed to shorter product lifetimes [1],[2]. As such, waste {{electrical and}} electronic equipment (WEEE) has received increasing attention from policy makers. Previous research has re-vealed the large proportion of end-of-life consumer electronics disposed of through residual waste collections and destined for landfill disposal or incineration [3],[4]. This represents a missed opportunity for extending their lifetime by facilitating recovery for repair or reuse, which would be preferable {{in the context of their}} high levels of embodied carbon [5] and the valuable materials they contain. This paper outlines the current policy context following recently updated WEEE Regulations and explores the current routes for end-of-life {{electrical and electronic equipment}} in the UK and opportunities for product life ex-tension through reuse of discarded items. Following a literature review, a series of semi-structured interviews were undertaken with policy makers, <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>organisations,</b> third sector organisations, waste collection authorities and waste management companies. The paper reports the findings from this research, which aimed to determine whether the current collection sys-tem for end-of-life equipment in the UK adequately encourages increased repair and reuse in line with the UK Government’s waste reduction programme [6], or whether there is an excessive focus on recycling. An analysis of the findings is used to discuss whether the UK policy framework is adequate to embed legislative require-ments and improve current practices and whether the current system promotes awareness and understanding by householders sufficient to encourage behaviour change...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} part of the concept of Industrial ecology aims at understanding and improving the metabolic pathways of materials in society. Extended <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> is one of the recent, and indeed important, obligations towards industry and recycling structures. Until now this responsibility has mainly been implemented in the sector of packaging, but there are initiatives to expand to more sectors such as electronic and electrical products as well. What we see when examining the present practices of <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> is that there is developing a complex and comprehensive infrastructure for materials separation and recycling. These efforts are much needed, however, they are to some extent reactive oriented if the manufacturing industries are not also focusing on preventative options related to product design, product environmental quality, product recyclability and product function in the use phase.

However, related research and implementation are still limited. This study aims to identify the challenges of fulfilling <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> in waste management and determine whether the integration concept could generate outcomes expected from the EPR concept. A semi-structured interview survey of several stakeholders from the government, industrial, and waste management sectors was conducted and the data generated was used to simulate an integration scheme using a system dynamics approach. Secondary data and information from Bandung municipality were used as input for the simulation. The interview survey found that the concerns and issues of fulfilling <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> in waste management include lack of awareness, unavailability of clear guidelines, and the limited capacity of the current recycling sector. The results of the simulation suggested that if the integration scheme is applied, each business entity might bear the responsibility of IDR 29. 4 million per year and 14. 7 tons of waste per year for the scope of four sectors and IDR 34. 1 million per year and 17 tons of waste per year for the scope of two sectors...|$|R

40|$|A {{principle}} of extended <b>producer’s</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{in the law}} of waste management pursues the following aims of the waste management: 1) the maximum decrease {{in the amount of}} waste in any type of business and human existence, 2) the immediate reuse of production waste in a manufacturing process, 3) recovery of raw materials from collected waste, 4) application of processes to dispose of waste, 5) orderly waste storage ensuring the least damage to the environment. The overriding objective of this principle is application of legal instruments encouraging producers to undertake activities which will: prevent production of waste, decrease the level of using materials and energy at every stage of a product life cycle and encourage to introduce changes in the phase of a product design and during its manufacture. Broadly speaking, a {{principle of}} extended <b>producer’s</b> <b>responsibility</b> is connected with a producer’s financial liability for a product.

40|$|Extended Product Responsibility {{embodies the}} notion that agents along a product chain should share {{responsibility}} for the life-cycle environmental impacts of the product, including those associated with ultimate disposal.

Manufacturer "take-back" requirements are the policy lever most often associated with Extended <b>Producer</b> <b>Responsibility.</b> In this paper, the authors discuss alternative incentive-based policies {{that are consistent with}} the objectives of Extended Product and <b>Producer</b> <b>Responsibility.</b> They argue that an upstream combined product tax and recycling subsidy (UCTS) is generally more cost-effective and imposes fewer transactions costs than the take-back approach.

The authors find that this option shows potential for achieving non-trivial reductions in solid waste. Widespread application in the U.
