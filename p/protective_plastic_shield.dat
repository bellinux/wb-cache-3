One can use paracetamol (acetominophen) rather than aspirin to control the pain. Also, after surgery, a pad and <b>protective</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>shield</b> are used to apply pressure on the eye in order to prevent leakage of blood after the operation; this may be removed 6 to 8 hours after the procedure.|$|E
5000|$|The square is also {{prominent}} for a cenotaph {{erected in}} the centre. Unveiled during the 1927 Armistice Day, the stone brick cenotaph {{was built to}} honour men from Perak who {{have died in the}} Great War. The cenotaph has subsequently been modified with new plaques to honour fallen soldiers from Perak in World War II, the Malayan Emergency, the Indonesian confrontation and the [...] "Re-insurgency Period". As a result of the cenotaph's location the square has been a long-time local venue for Remembrance Day and Anzac Day. Some earlier plaques have been removed and replaced in an intervening change; the original brass plaque for the Great War dead has been restored although it is reinstalled on a different side of the cenotaph while several decorative brass parts have remained missing; to counter further vandalism the brass plaque has been covered with <b>protective</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>shielding.</b> A more recent addition is a memorial plaque that pays tribute to combatant and non-combatant prisoners of war who died building the Thailand-Burma Railway.|$|R
40|$|Electroluminescent (EL) wire is {{a unique}} kind of wire because it glows when {{attached}} to a power source. EL wire has many applications, both creative and practical. For example: Burning Man enthusiasts like to adorn their clothing with the flexible wire, and emergency responders use it to mark off accidents on the road at night. What makes EL wire glow is the electrical reactions between its copper wires and phosphor coating. The problem with this wire, however, {{is that it is}} very difficult to connect it to a battery. This is due to the wire’s structure. Beneath its <b>protective</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>shielding,</b> EL wire has a core copper wire, double wrapped with a very fine pair of copper wires. These fine copper wires are hard to solder to, and can break without much effort. Standard soldering methods use a basic alligator tooth style double clamp to hold EL wires in place for soldering. This device is very poorly made, as one must tighten and re-tighten every moveable joint for a precision solder. Adjusting these clamps can be maddening, especially when many EL solder joints must be made. There must be a better way to terminate EL wire, therefore various connection methods are considered as possible solutions. They are: improved hand soldering, machine soldering, conducive epoxy, and crimping. Ultimately it was decided that an improved solder technique would prove to be the best solution. And it entailed manufacturing a custom fixture that would hold the EL wire for easy soldering. The design went though many phases and was tested to see if it commanded a faster soldering time over its clamping counterpart. The results suggest the fixture has a mean soldering time that is statistically significantly less than the mean soldering time of the alligator clamps, with ninety-five percent confidence. An economic analysis determined that if even just one electrician were to try to profit off of making EL wire assemblies, working either full-time or part-time, he or she would save money in labor hours by purchasing the fixture. A hobbyist on the other hand, who makes only a few EL wire assemblies a month, might be stretching his or her wallet too far by spend the money for the fixture. The bottom line is that if someone stands to make a profit off EL wire assemblies, or is serious about making all kinds of EL artwork, this fixture will save the user time...|$|R
30|$|Second, a black <b>plastic</b> <b>shield</b> was {{successful}} in eliminating the interfering signal. To eliminate the IR light interference, shielding the pulse oximetry probe with aluminum was recommended [2, 3]. However, a black <b>plastic</b> <b>shield,</b> one of the accessories of Masimo Radical- 7, is indicated for use with Masimo adhesive, re-usable and responsive sensor, to reduce ambient light interference. The black <b>plastic</b> <b>shield</b> could completely eliminate the strong IR light from influencing the navigation system. However, only for eliminating the IR light, this black <b>plastic</b> <b>shield</b> may be expensive. When aluminum foil cannot be used immediately or when repositioning the probe to other sites where the IR light does not reach pulse oximetry probe is difficult, this black <b>plastic</b> <b>shield</b> can be an alternative method to solve the IR light interference.|$|R

40|$|This ex vivo study {{evaluated}} {{the quality of}} digital radiographic images obtained with the photostimulable phosphor plate system (Digora) according to the processing delay and maintenance of optical plates in either opaque (supplied with the system) or transparent <b>protective</b> <b>plastic</b> cases during this period. Five radiographs {{were obtained from the}} mandibular molar region of a dry human mandible using optical plates. These plates were placed in the <b>protective</b> <b>plastic</b> cases before obtaining the radiographs and were processed immediately or after processing delays of 5, 60 and 120 min, when the case was removed. The results revealed a reduction in image quality when processing was delay 120 min compared to the other times. The opaque case provided better protection to the sensor than the transparent case. In conclusion, a 120 -min processing delay for the Digora system caused a reduction in image quality, yet without interfering with the quality of diagnosis. The opaque case supplied by the system's manufacturer provided better protection to the optical plate than the transparent case...|$|R

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze two {{phosphor}} plate systems (PSPs) (Dürr Dental, Digora Optime) according to their scanning delay and <b>protective</b> <b>plastic</b> case performances. Methods. Two PSPs using an aluminum step wedge were exposed. These plates were placed in three different <b>protective</b> <b>plastic</b> cases (manufacturers' original cases, black case, and white case) before obtaining the radiographs and were then processed immediately and 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 [*]min after exposure. Mean gray values (MGVs) of the 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, and 9 th steps of the wedges were compared using ANOVA. Results. Statistically significant differences were found between the two PSPs (). ANOVA revealed that the MGVs of four steps of the wedges were significantly different from each other for all scan delays (). MGVs increased with increasing scanning delay, except the group with Dürr plates in their original cases. Reduction in image quality began 5 [*]min after exposure in the other Dürr plate groups. Conclusions. Within the limitations of the current study, it can be concluded that scanning delay causes a reduction in image quality, and using the manufacturer's original protective case will result in better performance of PSPs...|$|R
