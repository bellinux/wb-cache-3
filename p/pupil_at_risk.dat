This project will build on {{and develop the}} findings from an ESRC funded study which explored the experiences, personal identifications and meanings drawn on by <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of school exclusion. The aim is to produce targeted policy and practice resources in collaboration with Kids Company (a charity supporting challenged and challenging children and young people) their service users and other specialist practitioners. Two core products will be produced as an outcome of a co-ordinated programme of knowledge exchange: A policy directed 'Manifesto for Learning' detailing specific policy recommendations. This will involve joint working with Kids Company practitioners {{as well as the}} children and young people who use their services focusing on and refining findings from the original research to clarify policy implications. A practitioner directed 'Reflexive Toolkit' to prompt and facilitate critical, reflexive awareness among teachers and other professionals working with <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of school exclusion. This activity will synthesise findings from the original research with the insights and experience of a specially selected panel of practitioners to generate a practical overview of the dynamics commonly framing school conflict.

In this paper, we shed light on this issue by studying a remedial education programme aimed at English secondary school <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of school exclusion and with worsening educational trajectories. The main peculiarity of this intervention is that it solely targets students' non-cognitive skills – such as self-confidence, locus of control, self-esteem and motivation – with the aim of improving pupils' records of attendance and end-of-compulsory-education (age 16) cognitive outcomes. We evaluate the effect of the policy on test scores in standardized national exams at age- 16 using both least squares and propensity-score matching methods. Additionally, we exploit repeated observations on pupils’ test scores to control for unobservables that might affect students’ outcomes and selection into the programme. We find little evidence that the programme significantly helped treated youths to improve their age- 16 test outcomes. We also find little evidence of heterogeneous policy effects along a variety of dimensions. cognitive and non-cognitive skills; policy evaluation; secondary schooling...|$|R

This guidance states that “Schools should be safe spaces {{in which children}} and young people can understand and discuss sensitive topics, including terrorism and the extremist ideas that are part of terrorist ideology, and learn how to challenge these ideas. The Prevent Duty is not intended to limit discussion of these issues” (DfE, 2015, p. 11). The Prevent Duty also requires schools to identify <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of radicalization and have in place “robust safeguarding policies” (DfE, 2015, p. 11). Schools that are unable to satisfy OfSTED will be subject to ‘intervention’ (maintained schools) or ‘termination of funding’ (academies and free schools). This article explores the interplay between the statutory requirement to provide opportunity for pupils to debate and explore issues relating to citizenship in the public sphere in the light of religious and political discourses and the statutory requirement to monitor and report potential ‘vulnerable’ pupils. It asks what measures are employed to judge ‘vulnerability’ and ‘risk’ when they are encouraged to promote debate and active political engagement.

The RCT demonstrated that TaMHS led to reductions in behaviour problems but not emotional problems for 8 - 10 year olds. No impact was found for 11 - 13 year olds. The effects on behaviour problems in primary school were enhanced by the provision of evidence based self-help materials, but not by other area level support. The longitudinal study found information giving and good inter-agency working correlated with more positive outcomes for behavioural problems in secondary schools. The qualitative findings indicated that TaMHS was well received by all groups, though challenges to its implementation were noted. Overall, findings indicate the utility of targeted mental health provision in schools, particularly in primary settings.

However, populations which are <b>at</b> higher <b>risk</b> of being excluded from school have not been adequately represented in the literature. The study is designed to address two significant areas. Firstly, it aspires to define the effectiveness of strength-based techniques for adolescents, including those who are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of school exclusion. Secondly, it aims to clarify how to improve professional practice for educational psychologists (EPs) and educators when using these approaches. For the purposes of the study, a mixed methods approach was adopted and a strength-based intervention programme was implemented in three secondary schools of one Local Authority. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data about the effect of the intervention and ascertain potential areas of improvement. The findings reveal that although the intervention did not result in statistically significant improvements, <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of exclusion (AROE) seemed to have been affected more than pupils not AROE. Using Thematic Analysis, participants’ and facilitators’ views were captured into themes, which revealed that self-concept, social skills and strengths development were enhanced through the programme. In addition, this analysis highlighted the different components that contributed to helpful and unhelpful practice. The study offers knowledge and perspectives in terms of school applications for supporting pupils AROE and not AROE, and canvasses strategies that can be embedded within the school curriculum in order to inspire educators working with vulnerable populations.

The two-part study utilises a ‘two methods approach’ to reveal the attitudes of teachers and head teachers in primary mainstream and special schools toward pupils with disabilities and including them in mainstream classrooms. The first study was a questionnaire-based survey of 560 teachers and head teachers currently working in the 209 mainstream and special primary schools in Kuwait. The questionnaire used was the Mainstream Attitude Survey (MAS) developed by Alghazo (2000). Results showed a mixed attitude towards inclusion of pupils with disabilities, and that, overall, teachers were quite negative about the concept. Teachers from mainstream schools were more supportive of inclusion than special school teachers and, male teachers were more supportive than female teachers. The second study involved interviews with 30 teachers, head teachers and 4 decision makers. These revealed nuances of opinion with respondents from both school types supporting inclusion from two main positions. The first emphasised that inclusion was an ethically sound movement; the second emphasised inclusion would be socially beneficial to society and the development of all pupils. Of those who were negative towards inclusion, criticisms were mostly based on the idea that while there were likely to be social benefits of inclusion, these benefits were not significant enough to justify placing the academic achievement of mainstream <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R

Supporting such students constitutes a huge challenge for schools, which nowadays are under pressure to secure a good position in the league tables. Permanent exclusions are used in the UK as a response to students’ extremely inappropriate behaviour. Studies have highlighted the positive and negative implications of this practice for students or have concentrated in identifying strategies that can reduce the <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of exclusion. However, not many studies have highlighted the voices of young people, who experience exclusion. The aim {{of this study was to}} give voice to students with SEBDs and ADHD, who were permanently excluded from school, and explore their perceptions, in relation to the pathways of exclusion. Interviews within the hierarchical focusing method were conducted with 8 boys with SEBDs or ADHD and the data was thematically analysed. Five themes were identified, which provided a deep insight into the participants’ experiences, emotional world and perceptions of the implications of exclusion. The findings of this study, provide support for previous literature, as it concludes that exclusion is a negative experience for students with SEBDs and even if it is sometimes associated with positive feelings, their self-esteem is impacted negatively. Relationships with teachers, peers, parents and the ethos of the educational provision are, also, found to define whether or not students are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of exclusion, as they impact tremendously on the students’ behaviour and motivation for learning.

40|$|The {{provision}} of ‘extended schools’ in England forms {{one part of}} series of educational and social initiatives which aim to increase social inclusion through addressing concerns over negative indicators such as poor school attendance and exclusions. The Children’s Act (2004) and the "Every Child Matters Agenda" has been implemented {{as a response to}} perceived deficiencies in holistic approaches to child support services and follows inquiries into shortcomings across education, health and social services. The legislation places schools at the core of child protection and support services, with an intended increase in inter-agency collaboration and improved communication to ensure that all pupils receive appropriate access to essential services. Extended schools provide additional services, such as holiday clubs, family support workers and counselling services which are available to all pupils and their families and aim {{to address the needs of}} the most vulnerable. Across England, an increase in the {{provision of}} extended schools indicates a move towards increased inter-professional liaison with a declared intent of improving support for vulnerable young people. Few evaluations of the efficacy of such provision have, as yet, been completed. This paper reports on an investigation into the efficacy of two extended secondary schools in an English Local Authority. Using a combination of survey methods, observation and documentary analysis the researchers sought the opinions of teachers, pupils, parents and care agencies in assessing the impact of measures instigated to provide increased support and facilities for all pupils, and particularly those perceived to be <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> The research was conducted over the period of one academic year and was undertaken by both ‘outsider’ researchers from the University of Northampton, and two teachers (one from each school) who were seconded to the project as ‘insider researchers’. School performance indicators were scrutinised to ascertain the influences of specific measures adopted under the extended schools actions and quantitative data was subjected to interrogation alongside the information obtained through interviews and observation. Case studies, which provide exemplars of the impact of the extended school process upon specific individuals were constructed and used to model further developments within the schools. The researchers report on those measures, which are regarded by service users as having had a positive impact upon school performance in respect of supporting <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> The paper provides case study materials alongside both qualitative and quantitative data, which indicates the effectiveness of the extended schools process in the two study schools.

From a pool of approximately 150 kindergarten children, previously judged by their teachers as to risk, 30 were randomly selected who were judged as ???<b>at</b> <b>risk???</b> and 30 were randomly selected who were judged as ???not <b>at</b> <b>risk???.</b> All 60 children were then screened with the MST and the RIPIS. A canonical correlation analysis between the six subtests comprising the MST and the nine, previously identified, factors which make up the RIPIS found that draw-a-design, conceptual grouping, and leg coordination on the MST were strongly intercorrelated with body perception, self-concept, memory for events, memory for symbols for cognitive operations, and directional or positional constancy from the RIPIS. The MST subtests and the RIPIS factors that appear to be strongly influenced by the spatial perception were those that were most strongly loaded on the canonical variate. Subtests and factors claiming to measure memory were also important in explaining the interrelationships between the instruments. Discriminant function analysis indicated that both screening devices successfully predict teacher???s judgments of risk in a strong majority of cases. Numerical memory and verbal memory from the MST and seven of the nine RIPIS factors were shown to be of importance in making the predictions. RIPIS factors and MST subtests purporting to measure memory were strongly loaded on the discriminant functions, and those subtests and factors which appear to measure spatial perception had somewhat weaker, but still significant loadings. Apparently, the two abilities measured most strongly by the screening devices are also of major importance in determining teacher???s judgments of risk...|$|R
40|$|In Malawi, where {{a policy}} of Free Primary Education {{has been in place}} for more than fifteen years, {{relatively}} few children have never attended school. However, despite high initial enrolments, primary education in Malawi is inefficient, with high dropout and low completion rates. Against a context of underlying poverty, research suggests that many of the children in Malawi denied adequate access to education are those orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. Evidence from Malawi and neighbouring countries indicates that not enough is being done in schools to support vulnerable children in the context of HIV/AIDS and that a powerful argument can be made for new, more flexible models of formal schooling that reach out to young people who face educational exclusion. This doctoral study was part of a wider, three-year collaborative research project working in high HIV prevalence countries to address issues of educational access. It used a sequential, mixed methods design to examine {{the extent to which a}} more flexible model of formal schooling that integrates open and distance learning (ODL) strategies with face-to-face teaching and psychosocial support can improve educational access and retention of orphaned and other vulnerable children in rural Malawi. This study identifies and explores household, school and peer-related factors that influence the access and retention of children affected by HIV/AIDS, and confirm the very limited support provided by primary schools. These findings were used to contextualise and inform the development of a school-based intervention to implement a flexible model of schooling; thereafter trialed in 20 sampled schools in two selected districts in Malawi. This doctoral study demonstrates the potential of flexible learning to enhance learning experiences, bring psychosocial benefits and help improve retention of vulnerable pupils in primary schools in high HIV prevalence communities in rural Malawi, with important, positive spill-over effects to <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of dropout. It also argues that effective innovation requires strategies to create an enabling environment and promote an inclusive philosophy within schools. Further insights were drawn from the perspectives of actors on the benefits, shortfalls and outcomes of the intervention, as well as the successes and challenges of the implementation process. A synthesis and discussion of the empirical findings in relation to the wider literature explores the possibilities for introducing more flexible modes of educational delivery and support within formal schooling...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{doctoral}} thesis is to describe and analyse how school children are constructed into being <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> The research questions focus on what governing practices and techniques are used for and how power relations are expressed in a pedagogical practice. An ethnographic case study was conducted. Empirical data was collected during one year’s time comprising documents (pupils’ written material, teachers’ logbooks), classroom observations, and interviews with teachers as well as interviews with pupils and their mothers. For analytical purposes the material was divided into three main fields: What is said – speech, What is written – text and What is done – action. This was analysed by applying some central terms derived from Michel Foucault: governmentality, genealogy, pastoral power, regulation and examination processes. How pupils’ deviate behaviour is currently interpreted and dealt with in a pedagogical practice was of particular interest here. The outcome of {{this study suggests that}} teachers are part of a normalisation process, steering each other on the basis of conceptions and ideas rooted in the power and knowledge generally applied to the ”good school” of today. In Foucaultian terms this could be described as a process in which teachers constitute themselves as moral subjects. The teachers’ own conviction of governing ”the good school” can, however, be contrasted by their deeply rooted conceptions of pupils. Pupils are compared and categorised on the basis of judgments of what normality is. These normalising judgments can be understood {{in the light of the}} schools’ task and function in society. This task and schools’ function are not quite visible in the pedagogical practice and conceptions of deviance become more comprehensible. The predominant conception is that pupils should be responsible subjects equipped with internalised self-regulatory techniques. Whenever this does not appear to be the case, a need for various kinds of expert knowledge is created with the intention of directing pupils and parents towards what is conceived as normality. While schools’ and teachers’ failure is temporary, judgements of pupils’ deviance prevail throughout their school years. Pupils’ own strategies are not of relevance for the pedagogical practice. An ensuing effect of this is the construction of risk zones by the very pedagogical practice that considers children irresponsible objects. This doctoral thesis results in a suggestion as to how we could benefit from the challenging power constituted by pupils...|$|R

METHODS: Out of 1359 secondary school children, aged 13 through 15 y, who were invited for a routine health assessment by school doctors or nurses as part of the Child Health Monitoring System, 1279 (94 %) responded and data were analyzed. RESULTS: Among secondary school children 13 % of girls and 5 % of boys were dieting {{at the time of the}} health assessment. Half of the dieting <b>pupils</b> were <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of overweight, while the other half were within the normal weight range. The mean preferred weight of the dieting pupils was not lower than the mean actual weight of the non-dieting pupils. Dieting pupils skipped meals more often and consumed less sweets and salty snacks, soft drinks and bread than non-dieting pupils. School absence due to illness was relatively high in dieting boys, and medicine use was high in dieting girls. CONCLUSION: As in other Western countries, dieting is a common practise among young adolescents in the Netherlands, especially in girls. 'Unhealthy' dietary practices, like skipping breakfast, are already present at early age, therefore preventive programs should be targeted at young adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Compulsory {{education}} laws oblige {{primary and}} secondary schools to give each pupil positive encouragement in, for example, social, emotional, cognitive, creative, and ethical respects. This is a fairly smooth process for most pupils, {{but it is not}} as easy to achieve with others. A pattern of pupil, home or family, and school variables turns out to be responsible for a long-term process that may lead to a pupil’s dropping out of education. A systemic approach will do much to introduce more clarity into the diagnosis, potential reduction and possible prevention of some persistent educational problems that express themselves in related phenomena, for example low school motivation and achievement; forced underachievement of high ability pupils; concentration of bullying and violent behaviour in and around some types of classes and schools; and drop-out percentages that are relatively constant across time. Such problems {{have a negative effect on}} pupils, teachers, parents, schools, and society alike. In this address, I would therefore like to clarify some of the systemic causes and processes that we have identified between specific educational and pupil characteristics. Both theory and practice can assist in developing, implementing, and checking better learning methods and coaching procedures, particularly for <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> This development approach will take time and require co-ordination, but it will result in much better processes and outcomes than we are used to. First, I will diagnose some systemic aspects of education that do not seem to optimise the learning processes and school careers of some types of pupils in particular. Second, I will specify cognitive, social, motivational, and self-regulative aspects of learning tasks and relate corresponding learning processes to relevant instructional and wider educational contexts. I will elaborate these theoretical notions into an educational design with systemic instructional guidelines and multilevel procedures that may improve learning processes for different types of pupils. Internet-based Information and Communication Technology, or ICT, also plays a major role here. Third, I will report on concrete developments made in prototype research and trials. The development process concerns ICT-based differentiation of learning materials and procedures, and ICT-based strategies to improve pupil development and learning. Fourth, I will focus on the experience gained in {{primary and secondary}} educational practice with respect to implementation. We can learn much from such practical experience, in particular about the conditions for developing and implementing the necessary changes in and around schools. Finally, I will propose future research. As I hope to make clear, theory-based development and implementation research can join forces with systemic innovation and differentiated assessment in educational practice, to pave the way for optimal “learning for self-regulation” for pupils, teachers, parents, schools, and society at large...|$|R

The study makes use of the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, which is a survey of young people in secondary school that collects information on bullying, truancy and many other factors in each child's life. The data is linked to information on each child's academic achievement, enabling this study to investigate the inter-relationship between a pupil's academic performance and non academic outcomes. Pupils who enjoy school more at age 14 have, perhaps unsurprisingly, higher academic achievement by age 16. Equally, children who have higher achievement at age 11 go on to enjoy school more at age 16 though this is a not a strong relationship. In other words enjoyment of school and academic achievement are clearly linked. Pupils who were bullied or who took unauthorised absence at age 14 had significantly lower educational achievement <b>at</b> GCSE. <b>Pupils</b> who experienced bullying at age 14 were also much more likely to experience bullying at age 16. Therefore early negative outcomes, such as being bullied, suggest the child is <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of having later negative experiences at age 16. Conversely, pupils who participate in positive extra-curricular activities, such as clubs, were also found to have better academic achievement later in their schooling. High achievers at school, i. e. pupils who do well academically at age 14, were also no more likely to be bullied at age 16 than other children. The report also investigated the impact of schools on some of these non-academic outcomes between 14 - 16 and found little evidence that schools currently have different impacts on pupil's enjoyment of school, nor whether they take unauthorised absence, nor their likelihood of being bullied. In other words, which school a pupil attends is likely to have small or no effect on their wider well-being. This does not mean that schools do not have the potential to impact on these factors but rather that currently there are not large differences across schools in these outcomes once socio-economic factors have been taken into account. The report concludes that non-academic factors, such as a pupil's enjoyment of school, are inextricably linked to pupils' academic achievement. We {{need to be aware of}} these relationships when considering policies to improve pupil achievement. The report also provides some useful risk indicators of future low pupil academic achievement. For example, some factors, such as being bullied or taking unauthorised absence, predict low future academic achievement. Again this can be used by schools and policy-makers to identify <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of low attainment.

40|$|Previous {{researches}} on {{elementary grade}} handwriting revealed that pupils employ certain strategy when writing or drawing. The relationship between this strategy {{and the use}} of graphic rules has been documented but very little research has been devoted to the connection between the use of graphic rules and handwriting proficiency. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the relative contribution of the use of graphic rules to the writing ability. A sample of 105 first graders who were average printers and 65 first graders who might experience handwriting difficulty, as judged by their teachers, of a normal primary school were individually tested on their use of graphic rules. It has been found that pupils who are below average printers use more non-analytic strategy than average printers to reproduce the figures. The results also reveal that below average printers do not acquire the graphic principles that foster an analytic approach to production skills. Although the findings are not sufficient to allow definitive conclusions about handwriting ability, it can be considered as one of the screening measures in identifying <b>pupils</b> who are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of handwriting difficulties. ...|$|R
40|$|Government {{guidance}} in the United Kingdom encourages groups of schools to take collective responsibility for supporting and making provision for excluded <b>pupils</b> and those <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of exclusion. Managed-moves are {{one way that}} some schools and authorities are enacting such guidance. This paper {{presents the results of}} an evaluation of one such scheme. The scheme, involving seven neighbouring secondary schools, was nearing its first year of completion. The paper draws primarily on interview data with pupils, parents and school staff to describe a number of positive outcomes associated with the scheme and to explore how these were achieved. We found that while some of these could be attributed directly to the managed-move, others arose from the more inclusive ethos and practices of particular schools. The concepts of tailored support, care and commitment emerged as strong themes that underpinned the various practical ways in which some schools in the cluster were able to re-engage 'at-risk' pupils. As managed moves become more widely practiced it will be important to remember that it is how the move proceeds and develops rather than the move itself that will ultimately make the difference for troubled and troublesome pupils...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} why boys {{were more likely}} to be excluded than girls. The main research site was an 11 - 16 comprehensive in a market town, although findings were triangulated through a project in a feeder junior school. The research evolved in two phases. Phase One involved 67 loosely structured, fifty minute interviews with pupils who had been excluded for a fixed term. Phase Two involved four action research projects which triangulated and developed the Phase One findings. The projects consisted of an Anger Management therapeutic group with some of the excluded boys interviewed in Phase One, two days of staff training in Transactional Analysis, a self-discovery club with junior school <b>pupils</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of exclusion and a year 7 drama curriculum which taught Transactional Analysis, conflict resolution, meditation, emotional literacy and self-awareness. Findings were analysed using Strauss and Glaser’s concepts of grounded theory, emergent themes and the constant comparative method. Transactional Analysis was used as a practical as well as an analytic tool. The practical research took place between 1999 and 2002. The study found that all of the children who had been excluded were either threatened with loss or had suffered or were suffering from losses which threatened their safety and/or security. The effects of these losses gave rise to the emotions of bereavement which included anger. Boys and some girls used the emotion of anger as a mask for other emotions such as sadness and fear. The masking of vulnerable emotions was part of the way in which the boys constructed their masculinites. The losses brought with them loss of attachment and low self-esteem which led to students being more influenced by their peer group than by the adults around them. It was found that it was possible to counter the effect of these losses and the negative effects of the anger. The action research methods proved to offer part of the answer to the research questions. Trust was central to the development of new attachments and teachers could develop this trust using Adult-Adult behaviours, from an ‘I’m OK, You’re OK’ life position. Positive strokes encouraged desired behaviour. However, central to the ability to use these techniques was the concept of self-awareness that could be accessed through talking and being listened to by some one who did not judge. Meditation also proved to be helpful in bringing awareness and minimising stress. The concept of the Drama Triangle proved invaluable in understanding what occurred during exclusion incidents. Techniques were found to work with staff, secondary and primary school pupils. The implications of the research are that it is possible for staff to minimise exclusion incidents directly and indirectly by modelling peaceful behaviours. The research shows that pupils get excluded when they are under stress and that it might be profitable to listen to them after an exclusion to elicit their feelings. The study recommends future research which develops these ideas in other settings and investigates what happens for the teachers during an exclusion incident.
