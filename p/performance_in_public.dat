25|$|In recent years, Cambridge {{has placed}} {{slightly}} more emphasis than Oxford on public exam results during the selection process. Cambridge routinely asks applicants who take A-level exams {{to report their}} exact scores, not just letter-grades; this is partly to distinguish between high A-grades and borderline A/B grades. In contrast, disclosure of exact scores for Oxford applications is voluntary. In 2010, the new A* grade for A-level exams (an A* indicating a high A) was introduced. Cambridge started requesting that its applicants achieve at least one A* grade if they were taking A-levels, letting students earn a place through their <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> <b>public</b> examinations; Oxford initially stated that it relies more on its own internal aptitude tests and waited to see how effective the A* grade is at highlighting the best candidates, before deciding to implement it as a requirement for most courses starting in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred {{opposite}} Edward G. Robinson in {{the gangster}} farce The Whole Town's Talking, also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise. It {{was the first}} time Arthur portrayed a hard-boiled working girl with a heart of gold, the type of role she would be associated with {{for the rest of her}} career. She enjoyed the acting experience and working opposite Robinson, who remarked in his biography that it was a [...] "delight to work with and know" [...] Arthur. By the time of the film's release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and would mostly stay that way. She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her best side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director Frank Capra recalled producer Harry Cohn's description of Jean Arthur's imbalanced profile: [...] "half of it's angel, and the other half horse." [...] Her next few films, Party Wire (1935), Public Hero No. 1 (1935) and If You Could Only Cook (1935), did not match the success of The Whole Town's Talking, but they all brought the actress positive reviews. In his review for The New York Times, critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur's <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> <b>Public</b> Hero No. 1, writing that she [...] "is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as Joseph Calleia is in his own department." [...] Another critic wrote of her performance in If You Could Only Cook that [...] " [...] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic." [...] With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several contractual concessions from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.|$|E
