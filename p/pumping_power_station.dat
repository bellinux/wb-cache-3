40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method to {{calculate}} the best installed capacity of <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> First, we choose the day with maximum load as the typical day for every month and simulate the system running in two cases of whether the <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station</b> is put into operation. The difference of the total coal consumption between the two cases is the peak load shifting benefit. Furthermore, we build load model and power generation model to calcu-late the benefit of emergency use and frequency modulation, which are the major projects of dynamic benefits. At last, on the premise of ensuring the system requirements, the developed method employs the maximum benefit of the unit capacity as the objective function {{to get the best}} installed capacity of <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station</b> by simulations. Tests on a provincial power grid have shown that the developed method which combines of load characteristics, electric structure and other factors can get the best installed capacity of <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station</b> easily and has a certain guiding significance for the planning and construction of the <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station...</b>|$|R

As a <b>Pumped</b> Storage <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> it is able to pump water from the river Danube into the Ranna Valley storage tanks in times of weak consumer demand. This is possible because the tanks are located than the river. In times of high consumer demand the water is released into the other direction where it produces electricity by running through turbines.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Aimed {{to solve}} the {{abandoned}} wind problem and reduce CO 2 emission in the power generation process, this paper put forward a thermal, wind <b>power</b> and <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station</b> co-operation cost-benefit analysis model. And through a simulation example, found that using <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station</b> to substitute thermal power as the alternate service for wind power, and absorb underused wind power, can reduce the use of fired units and increase the capacity of grid to absorb wind power, as well as reduce CO 2 emission. Then through the sensitivity analysis, found {{that the amount of}} grid-connected wind power is a sensitive factor of CO 2 emission reduction and the decrease of grid power purchase profit. So when grid implementing wind power grid connection, should use <b>pumped</b> storage <b>power</b> <b>station</b> as the wind power alternate service to promote wind power grid connection...|$|R
