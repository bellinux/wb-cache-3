50|$|When {{using this}} type of stator design, lining the slot with {{insulation}} paper is not required. The <b>plastic</b> <b>end</b> plates are designed {{in a way that}} the sides of the injected shafts insulate half of the stator slot. It is also beneficial, that costs for paper as well as costs for the production process for the mounting of the paper do not arise. Under consideration of a certain wall thickness of these injected shafts, z-shaped overlapping of the shafts in the area of the stator nut center may be achieved in order to increase the creepage distance and clearance to avoid dielectric breakdowns. However, a disadvantage constitutes in the fact that the depth of the shot of the injection process is limited depending on the stator lengths and the plastic material used.When e.g. using PA with a solid material content (e.g. glass fibers) of approx. 25% and a shot of approx. 25 mm depth, a wall thickness of at least 0.5 mm may be achieved. However, it has negative repercussions on the fill factor compared to the use of insulation paper which e.g. is only 0.1 mm thick.|$|E

50|$|Some {{of these}} {{long-lasting}} <b>plastics</b> <b>end</b> {{up in the}} stomachs of marine animals, and their young, including sea turtles and the black-footed albatross. Midway Atoll receives substantial amounts of marine debris from the patch. Of the 1.5 million Laysan albatrosses that inhabit Midway, nearly all {{are likely to have}} plastic in their digestive system. Approximately one-third of their chicks die, and many of those deaths are due to being fed plastic from their parents. Twenty tons of plastic debris washes up on Midway every year with five tons of that debris being fed to albatross chicks.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{involved the}} investigation of the performance of unbonded post-tensioned precast concrete segmental bridge columns under lateral earthquake loading. Two columns with a high aspect ratio and two columns with a low aspect ratio were tested under simulated lateral seismic loading. Steel jackets of different thickness were used to confine the <b>plastic</b> <b>end</b> region at the base of each column. The test units all contained the same amount of prestressing steel and each was tested twice: the first time with a relatively low initial tendon stress, and the second with a higher initial prestress level. An analytical model describing the column force-displacement behavior was used to predict column response prior to testing. All test units performed well for the first test with the low initial tendon stress. The columns underwent large nonlinear displacements up to drifts on the order of 4. 0 % without experiencing significant or sudden loss of strength. For the second tests, the units with thicker steel jackets performed better than those with thinner jackets. Use of the thicker jackets enabled the columns to achieve a drift of 6. 0 % with only minimal capacity degradation. Because of the unbonded tendon design, the residual drift after the tests was minimal. Observed column damage was low in general, and consisted primarily of minor concrete crushing at the column base. The analytical model reasonably predicted the column forcedisplacemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{desire to}} carry out this work arose from an {{observation}} during a practical work on a typical <b>plastic</b> <b>end</b> milling CNC machine. It was noticed that under certain conditions of cutting, operation of the machine became noisy with increasing depth of cut and eventual perforation of workpiece therefore the basic aim is to generate stability characterization of the machine {{in the form of a}} chart on the plane of cutting parameters on which stable operation is demarcated from the unstable operation. In modelling this machine, a slot creating mode of operation is used since the machine is mainly used for creating logos which are basically collection of slots. The significance of the resulting stability chart lies in the result that the cause of the aforementioned noisy operation is due to unstable parameter combination. For example a laboratory operation at spindle speed of 1500 rpm and depth of cut of 1. 5 mm was noisy while that at spindle speed of 1500 rpm and depth of cut of 1 mm was serene. The stability chart generated for the system thus shows close agreement with both practice and theory. A unique impact this work will have on the reading community will be in the area of validity of the resulting stability chart on the basis of MATLAB dde 23 numerical simulation. The parameters of the end milling process are; tool mass tool natural frequency damping factor and workpiece cutting coefficient...|$|E
40|$|ASTM (1995) in {{standard}} D 4823 describes many {{other types of}} core samplers. The most common sampler is the open tube sampler with a core catcher. This sampler is commonly used in shallow waters where it is manually pushed into the sediment. When the desired penetration depth is reached, the sampler is carefully withdrawn. A leaf core catcher is commonly used to help retain the sample in the corer (Figure 5. 73). The leaves separate and fold against the inside walls of the sampler when the corer penetrates the sediment. The leaves fold closed when the sampler is withdrawn, holding the sample in the corer. Plastic liners are also commonly used inside the sampler, simplifying core removal from the corer. The liners usually have <b>plastic</b> <b>end</b> caps that can {{be placed on the}} liner ends, holding the cores inside until analyses. These conventional core samplers are most effective with clayey sediments. Sandy sediments tend to easily wash out of most corers upon retrieval, irrespective of the core catcher used. ASTM (1995) mentions excavating around a core sampler and sliding a flat plate under the bottom of the corer before retrieval in shallow water to capture most of the sample. Forestry Suppliers, Inc. sells the Wildco hand core sediment sampler that is 2 " in diameter and 20 " long, made of stainless steel with a plastic core liner tube and eggshell catcher (catalog # 77258 for about $ 340). Extra plastic liners are also available (catalog # 77260...|$|E

50|$|The extenders are {{constructed}} with metal bayonets, and engineered <b>plastic</b> <b>ends.</b> There are no moving parts, {{other than the}} lens latch lock. Three generations of the extenders exist: the older 1.4× and 2×, the 1.4× II and 2× II, and the 1.4× III and 2.0× III. The II versions have weather-sealing and anti-reflective surfaces inside the extender body. The optical construction of the 1.4× versions are of a five-element design. Both 2× versions use seven elements, although the optical formula of the II version is different to improve optical performance. The III versions of the extenders have improved autofocus performance as well increased image quality over the II, and their front and rear elements are coated with fluorine anti-smear coating to be easier to clean.|$|R

30|$|Since the {{introduction}} of phenoformaldehyde plastic in 1909 by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, petrochemical plastics have developed into a major industry and an indispensable commodity for modern life (Meikle, [1995]). It is estimated that more than 100 million tonnes of plastics are produced yearly. Most of these <b>plastics</b> <b>end</b> up after their useful life as discarded waste and some are disposed into the marine environment which {{pose a threat to}} the aquatic wildlife. In recent years, the widespread and increasing use of petrochemical plastics has raised concerns about the adverse impact of these recalcitrant plastics on the environment. Hence, biobased and biodegradable polymers are gaining widespread interest and acceptance as an alternative to some synthetic plastics. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a storage and reserve compound accumulated naturally in the cytoplasm of numerous bacteria, is being considered {{as one of the most}} attractive and promising biodegradable thermoplastics for various industrial and biomedical applications (Sudesh and Iwata, [2008]).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the increased runoff that results from plasticulture, {{there is also the}} problem of the increased amount of waste form the plastic mulch itself. The use of plastic mulch for vegetables, strawberries, and other row and orchard crops exceeds 110 million pounds annually in the United States. Most <b>plastic</b> <b>ends</b> up in the landfill, although there are other disposal options such as disking mulches into the soil, on-site burying, on-site storage, reuse, recycling, and incineration. The incineration and recycling options are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics. Plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals, which limits the amount of products that can be recycled. Research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or photodegradable mulches. While there has been minor success with this, there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade, as many biodegradable products {{take a long time to}} break down.|$|R

50|$|Under tensile stress, plastic {{deformation}} {{is characterized by}} a strain hardening region and a necking region and finally, fracture (also called rupture). During strain hardening the material becomes stronger through the movement of atomic dislocations. The necking phase is indicated by a reduction in cross-sectional area of the specimen. Necking begins after the ultimate strength is reached. During necking, the material can no longer withstand the maximum stress and the strain in the specimen rapidly increases. <b>Plastic</b> deformation <b>ends</b> with the fracture of the material.|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} of {{insufficient}} recycling of plastic products, {{millions of tons of}} <b>plastics</b> <b>end</b> up in landfills and oceans each year [1]. Besides polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, polyurethane, and polyethylenterephthalat, polystyrene (PS) {{is one of the most}} extensively used types of plastic. PS could enter the soil not only through direct release from products and applications during their life cycle [2] but also through fragmentation of macro- and microplastics. Once in the environment (e.g., landfills), polystyrene can undergo weathering through UV radiation, mechanical abrasion, biological degradation, and disintegration that result into smaller sized microplastics which could eventually fragment to nanoplastics [3]. As a result, nanoplastics are expected to increase consistently with time in the environment [4]. Recently, Lambert et al. [5] showed the formation of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) during the degradation of PS coffee cup lids using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Moreover, there are reports of PS-degradation by microorganisms (Rhodococcus ruber) [6], mandibulate insects and larva of mealworms [7, 8]. Furthermore, geophagous soil fauna, particularly earthworms, could contribute to fragmentation of plastics as ingested and broken down by their gizzard. Moreover, thermal cutting of polystyrene foam has been shown to emit nano-sized polymer particles, in the range of 22 – 220  nm [9] which can enter the soil through atmospheric deposition.|$|R
