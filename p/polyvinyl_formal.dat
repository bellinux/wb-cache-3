5000|$|Although {{described}} as [...] "enameled", enameled wire is not, in fact, coated {{with either a}} layer of enamel paint nor with vitreous enamel made of fused glass powder. Modern magnet wire typically uses one to four layers (in the case of quad-film type wire) of polymer film insulation, often of two different compositions, to provide a tough, continuous insulating layer. Magnet wire insulating films use (in order of increasing temperature range) <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>formal</b> (Formvar), polyurethane, polyamide, polyester, polyester-polyimide, polyamide-polyimide (or amide-imide), and polyimide. Polyimide insulated magnet wire is capable of operation at up to 250 °C. The insulation of thicker square or rectangular magnet wire is often augmented by wrapping it with a high-temperature polyimide or fiberglass tape, and completed windings are often vacuum impregnated with an insulating varnish to improve insulation strength and long-term reliability of the winding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{an effort}} to seek <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>formal)</b> (PVFM) foams based wound {{dressing}} pad material, a series of foamed PVFM materials have been synthesized under varied conditions. The influence of conditions on the properties of PVFM foam, such as mechanical properties, water absorption, pore structure and bulk density, is well discussed individually. It {{has been shown that}} both the reactant and acid catalyst affect the degree and speed of acetalization, therefore the mechanical properties, pores continuity and water absorption of the resultant sample. The addition of Na 2 CO 3, surfactant and CMCNa are mainly influencing the porous structure as well as the mechanical properties and water absorption.

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{transferring}} large-area graphene sheets onto {{a variety of}} substrates using Formvar (<b>polyvinyl</b> <b>formal)</b> is presented. Due to the ease at which formvar can be dissolved in chloroform this method allows for a consistent, a clean, and a more rapid transfer than other techniques including the PMMA assisted one. This novel transfer method is demonstrated by transferring large-area graphene onto a range of substrates including commercial TEM grids, silicon dioxide and glass. Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the presence of graphene and characterize the morphological properties of the large-area sheets. SEM and AFM analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of our rapid transfer technique for clean crystalline large-area graphene sheets. The removal of the sacrificial polymer {{was found to be}} one to two orders of magnitude faster than PMMA methods. Ultimately this facile transfer technique offers new opportunities {{for a wide range of}} applications for large-area graphene through the utilization of a new sacrificial polymer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{scaffold}} {{is necessary}} for tooth regeneration because of its three-dimensional geometry. For restoration of defect, it {{is necessary for}} the scaffold to be prepared {{in the shape of the}} defect. Sponges made from polyvinyl alcohol with formalin cross-linking (PVF sponge) have been used for scaffolds for bone formation in vivo. To induce osteogenesis within the sponge, methods of growing rat bone marrow cells (rBMCs) among the fiber structures in the sponge might be considered. Storage of rBMCs among the fibers in the sponge coated with dextran (10 kDa) was tried. After seeding of rBMCs to PVF sponge immersed in dextran solution at 2 g/dl concentration, osteogenesis was recognized in subcutaneously implanted PVF sponge as a scaffold in vivo. The level of osteocalcin was 25. 28 ± 5. 71 ng/scaffold and that of Ca was 129. 20 ± 19. 69 �g/scaffold. These values were significantly higher than those in sponges without dextran coating (p< 0. 01). Osteogenesis was induced in many spaces in the inner structure of the sponge with dextran coated fibers. Keywords—Dextran, <b>Polyvinyl</b> <b>formal</b> sponge, Osteogenesis, Scaffold...|$|E
40|$|Platelet {{structural}} {{changes such as}} spreading and cytoskeletal reorganization that occur upon contact with synthetic surfaces have been well documented. Structural changes such as spreading will {{vary depending on the}} substrate involved. Although platelet {{structural changes}} following adhesion have been recorded, the cellular mechanisms including changes in intracellular calcium flux underlying these platelet responses are less well understood. In this study, video microscopy was used to image platelet adhesion and spreading while simultaneously imaging intracellular free Ca 2 + levels in individual Fura- 2 loaded human platelets. This was accomplished using fluorescence video microscopy coupled with video enhanced asymmetric illumination contrast (AIC) to image Ca 2 + transients and correlative electron microscopy to image associated structural changes in individual platelets contacting glass and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>formal,</b> formvar, substrates. Three main points were concluded from this study: 1) Intracellular Ca 2 + levels increase with surface- induced activation on either formvar or glass. 2) In partially spread or fully spread platelets, intracellular Ca 2 + decreases to a steady state value. 3) Plateletplatelet contact leads to intracellular Ca 2 + transients...|$|E
40|$|Miscibility of poly(ε-caprolactone), (PCL), {{containing}} 1, 5, and 10 wt. % <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>formal)</b> (PVF) blends {{was investigated}} by polarized optical microscopy (POM), {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for spherulitic morphology and equilibrium melting temperature (T°m, via Hoffman-Weeks plot). The T°m of PCL in the blends {{was similar to that}} of pure PCL, indicating immiscibility. Isothermally, melt crystallized virgin PCL between 30 °C and 50 °C showed spherulitic morphology with negative birefringence, Maltese cross, and without extinction rings. The nucleation and growth rates of PCL spherulites were found to be dramatically reduced with the addition of PVF. Extinction rings and a change in the sign of the birefringence of the PCL spherulites were observed and were found to be dependent on blend composition and crystallization temperature. The presence of a ring pattern in spherulites was an indication of miscibility between the two polymers that had failed to be detected by thermal methods. The formation of a ring pattern is discussed in terms of lamella twisting originating from a change in the crystallization mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Several {{samples of}} <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>formal)</b> {{having the same}} vinyl alcohol content (8 – 9 %) but varying {{contents}} of vinyl acetate (6 – 22 %) and vinyl formol (70 – 85 %) were prepared and subjected to thermogravimetric analysis, in air and nitrogen atmospheres, employing both isothermal and dynamic methods. Kinetic parameters determined from both the isothermal and dynamic TGA data are compared. The activation energy is seen to be largely dependent {{on the degree of}} conversion, implying a complex degradation reaction. The activation energy is also much less for degradation in air than in nitrogen, which can be explained by a reaction with oxygen-producing structures favoring degradation. The activation energy is less sensitive to variation in polymer composition for degradation in air than in nitrogen. Thus, in the dynamic process, the activation energy value decreases (from 36 to 23 kcal/mole) with increasing acetate content (from 6 to 22 %) in nitrogen atmosphere, while in air the activation energy value increases only moderately (from 21 to 27 kcal/mole) with increasing acetate content (from 6 to 22 %). The order of reaction is nearly unity, irrespective of the composition of the polymer, both in air and nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|Adenovirus vector {{production}} by anchorage-independent 293 cells immobilized using porous biomass support particles (BSPs) {{was investigated in}} static and shake-flask cultures for efficient large-scale production of adenovirus vectors for gene therapy applications. The density of cells immobilized within BSPs was evaluated by measuring their WST- 8 (2 -(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitrophenyl) - 3 -(4 -nitrophenyl) - 5 -(2, 4 -disulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) reduction activity. In shake-flask culture, 293 -F cells, which were adapted to serum-free suspension culture, were not successfully retained within reticulated <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>formal</b> (PVF) resin BSPs (2  ×  2  ×  2  mm cubes) with matrices of relatively small pores (pore diameter 60  μm). When the BSPs were coated with a cationic polymer polyethyleneimine, a high cell density of more than 107 cells cm− 3 -BSP was achieved in both static and shake-flask cultures with regular replacement of the culture medium. After infection with an adenovirus vector carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (Ad EGFP), the specific Ad EGFP productivity of the immobilized cells was comparable to the maximal productivity of non-immobilized 293 -F cells by maintaining favorable conditions in the culture environment...|$|E
40|$|Solution cast blends of poly(e-caprolactone) [PCL] and <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>formal)</b> [PVF] from {{dichloromethane}} {{was investigated}} for miscibility by Differential Scanning Calorimetry [DSC], Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy [FTIR] and optical microscopy. Melting (Tm) and crystallization (Tc) temperatures {{were for the}} PCL fraction while the glass transition temperature (Tg) was for PVF fraction in the blends. Blends with 20 wt% and less PCL showed a depression in Tm and Tc. Depression in Tc indicated that during the non-isothermal crystallization process, the presence of PVF decreased the PCL segments migrating to the crystallite-melt interface thus reducing the nucleation rate, growth rate and {{the thickness of the}} lamella resulting in a depressed Tm. Crystallinity (Xc) decreased gradually with decreasing content of PCL in the blend and was due to the dilution of PCL by PVF. A depressed Tg was observed for 10 wt% PCL blend and remained the same for all other blend compositions. These observations suggested that this blend system has very low degree of miscibility. The degree of miscibility increased at low polyester concentration. FTIR spectra of the blends with low polyester concentrations showed changes in the C=O, O-H and C-O-C regions in the blended PVF and PCL spectra. Optical microscopy showed phase separation in the melt and in the PCL spherulites...|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAb) {{have been}} commonly applied to measure LDL in vivo and to characterize modifications of the lipids and apoprotein of the LDL particles. The electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) has an apolipoprotein B- 100 modified at oxidized events in vivo. In this work, a novel LDL-electrochemical biosensor {{was developed by}} adsorption of anti-LDL(-) MAb on an (<b>polyvinyl</b> <b>formal)</b> -gold nanoparticles (PVF-AuNPs) -modified gold electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used to characterize the recognition of LDL-. The interaction between MAb-LDL(-) leads to a blockage in the electron transfer of the [Fe(CN) (6) ](4 -) /K(4) [Fe(CN) (6) ](3 -) redox couple, which may could result in high change in the electron transfer resistance (R(CT)) and decrease in the amperometric responses in CV analysis. The compact antibody-antigen complex introduces the insulating layer on the assembled surface, which increases {{the diameter of the}} semicircle, resulting in a high R(CT), and the charge transferring rate constant k(0) decreases from 18. 2 x 10 (- 6) m/s to 4. 6 x 10 (- 6) m/s. Our results suggest that the interaction between MAb and lipoprotein can be quantitatively assessed by the modified electrode.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to systematically investigate individual aerosol particles collected onto a <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>formal</b> (Formvar) -coated copper grid with scanning electron microscopy. At very mild conditions with a low accelerating voltage of 2 kV and Gentle Beam mode aerosol particles down to 20 nm in diameter can be observed. Subsequent processing of the images with digital image analysis provides size resolved and morphological information (elongation, circularity) on the aerosol particle population. Polystyrene nanospheres in the expected size range of the ambient aerosol particles (20 – 900 nm in diameter) were used to confirm the accuracy of sizing and determination of morphological parameters. The relative standard deviation of the diameters of the spheres was better than ± 10 % for sizes larger than 40 nm and ± 18 % for 21 nm particles compared to the manufacturer's certificate. Atmospheric particles were collected during an icebreaker expedition to the high Arctic (north of 80 °) {{in the summer of}} 2008. Two samples collected during two different meteorological regimes were analyzed. Their size distributions were compared with simultaneously collected size distributions from a Twin Differential Mobility Particle Sizer, which confirmed that a representative fraction of the aerosol particles was imaged under the electron microscope. The size distributions obtained by scanning electron microscopy showed good agreement with the Twin Differential Mobility Sizer in the Aitken mode, whereas in the accumulation mode the size determination was critically dependent on the contrast of the aerosol with the Formvar-coated copper grid. The morphological properties (elongation, circularity) changed with the number of days the air masses spent over the pack-ice area north of 80 ° before the aerosol particles were collected at the position of the icebreaker and are thus an appropriate measure to characterize transformation processes of ambient aerosol particles...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the preparation of thermosetting polymeric blend consisting of three adhesive types, namely: epoxy, <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>formal</b> (PVF) and unsaturated polyester. Both of epoxy and PVF were used as a matrix-binder at fixed weight. Whilst unsaturated polyester was used at different weights and added to the matrix so as to produce prepared epoxy-PVF-unsaturated polyester blend. Several experiments were performed at different operating conditions, mixing speed and time at room temperature to identify the most favorable operating conditions. The optimum mixing speed and mixing time for the prepared blend were 500 rpm and 5 minutes respectively. Solid wastes-synthetic sack fibers from high volume, low cost, renewable fiber sources {{have been used as}} environmentally friendly alternatives to reinforcing fibers in composites. Many mechanical and thermal tests were carried out of the prepared blend at different weighted ratios. The optimum weighted ratio of the prepared blend for the untreated samples was characterized by the hardness and bending deflection properties and it was 0. 40 w/w, while for impact strength and thermal conductivity properties was 0. 20 w/w respectively. At these optimum weighted ratios of untreated samples with sack fibers, the maximum values of hardness and impact strength properties were 95 shore and 2. 25 J/cm 2 respectively. On the other hand, the minimum bending deflection and thermal conductivity properties values were found to be 4 mm and 0. 01094 W/cm. oC respectively. They showed the best bonding forces and physical interaction between two concentrations of matrix and unsaturated polyester adhesives. Treated samples of sack fibers reinforced composites at their optimum weighted ratio showed better fiber-matrix interaction as observed from the experimental results leading to enhance and improve the mechanical (hardness, impact strength, and bending deflection) and thermal (thermal conductivity) properties when compared to the untreated sample. These improvements in treated samples with two layers of sack fibers were predominant...|$|E

Surface tension measurements were engaged on a high-sensitive micro-eletromechanical balance system (Dataphysics DCAT 21, Germany). The plate used to detect the surface tension is with a length of 19. 9 mm and a width of 0. 2 mm. The motor speed to drive the plate is 1. 00 mm/s. 1 H- NMR spectra were recorded in D 2 O solution on a JEOL JNM-ECA 300 (300 MHz) spectrometer. ESI-MS measurements were performed on a Thermo ELECTRON CORPORATION Finnigan LTQ with deionized water as the solvent. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a MODEL H- 800 Electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.
