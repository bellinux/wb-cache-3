The use of conventional contour generation methods, such as the <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>plotting</b> technique, electronic correlator, and digital correlator are described. Coherent optical techniques for contour generation are discussed and compared to the electronic correlator. The optical techniques are divided into two categories: (1) image plane operation and (2) frequency plane operation. The description of image plane correlators are further divided into three categories: (1) image to image correlator, (2) interferometric correlator, and (3) positive negative transparencies. The frequency plane correlators are divided into two categories: (1) correlation of Fourier transforms, and (2) filtering techniques...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} fields of current {{research}} in photogrammetry {{is concerned with the}} reconstruction of object surfaces from digital images. The great number of object classes which can be reconstructed by <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>plotting</b> as well as the great number of possible plotting configurations suggest to investigate common strategies for reconstruction and common structures for object models. In the course of the Austrian Research Program on Digital Image Processing, a framework for object reconstruction is being developed which should work under quite general circumstances. The central part of the framework is the integration of a bundle block adjustment system for consistent modelling of the object surfaces and hybrid robust estimation of model parameters for verification of correspondence hypotheses. The generation of these hypotheses will be a task-dependent feature based matching algorithm. Approximate values will be improved by hierarchical methods (image pyramids) starting from [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{preservation}} {{and understanding of}} our past is fundamental to our development as a society and without the dedicated work of scientists, archaeologists and historians, the clues as to how we have evolved over the millennia would be lost. The work underlying this thesis provides a permanent 3 -dimensional record of the hominid trackway discovered at Laetoli, Tanzania in 1978 from the stereo photographs taken during the expedition. Despite great care and attention from the archaeologists, many of the footprints have, since initial excavation, been irreparably damaged and as a result, the photographs and 3 -dimensional models produced are all that remain of a vitally important discovery. In order to overcome issues presented by the original stereo photographs, robust reconstruction techniques have been implemented {{in conjunction with a}} novel segmentation approach for the extraction of the footprint from the background surface. The accuracy of the resulting models is then assessed by way of <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>plots</b> of the footprints, drawn soon after their discovery. This is achieved via a novel contour matching and evaluation technique. Finally, the results of the application of these algorithms to the entire laetoli footprint dataset are provided for the benefit of future researchers in related fields.

40|$|The {{availability}} of high-resolution satellite imagery with stereo viewing capability coupled to unrestricted commercial availably {{and a good}} geometric accuracy has made the satellite imagery a possible alternative to the conventional aerial mapping. Ikonos is {{a new generation of}} these satellites, launched successfully in September 1999. The satellite sensor can generate one-meter panchromatic and four-meter multispectral images with off-nadir viewing capability. These high-resolution images theoretically opened unlimited promising perspectives for topographic and thematic mapping. The present paper comes, in complement to other studies, to investigate the cartographic potential of Ikonos imagery with regard to large mapping scales (1 / 20000 to 1 / 5000). The investigation concerns the informational content and the metric aspect of these images. Testing was carried out on the 1 m panchromatic Geo imagery, and concerned a part of the city of Algiers (Algeria). The semantic analysis has been made by extracting the image information and comparing it to the informational content of maps derived by usual <b>photogrammetric</b> stereo <b>plotting</b> at different scales. The image was also rectified using ground control points determined by GPS and aerial triangulation and a DTM derived by conventional stereo photogrammetric techniques. A qualitative (visual) analysis of the precision has been {{made on the basis of}} comparisons with maps at different scales derived from <b>photogrammetric</b> stereo <b>plotting.</b> The quantitative analysis was based on the root mean square errors (RMS) computed from residuals on checkpoints. The results obtained from these tests, either in terms of RMS or semantic content, showed that, in the context of this investigation, mapping at scales up to 1 / 10000 is within the possibilities of Ikonos imagery, whereas mapping at 1 / 5000 remains however critical. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} current photogrammetric multi-head oblique cameras, such as UltraCam Osprey, to improve the efficiency of standard photogrammetric methods for surveying applications like inventory surveys and topographic mapping for public administrations or private customers. In 2015, Terra Messflug (TM), a subsidiary of Vermessung AVT ZT GmbH (Imst, Austria), has flown a number of urban areas in Austria, Czech Republic and Hungary with an UltraCam Osprey Prime multi-head camera system from Vexcel Imaging. In collaboration with FBK Trento (Italy), the data acquired at Imst (a small town in Tyrol, Austria) were analysed and processed to extract precise 3 D topographic information. The Imst block comprises 780 images and covers an area of approx. 4. 5 km by 1. 5 km. Ground truth data is provided {{in the form of}} 6 GCPs and several check points surveyed with RTK GNSS. Besides, 3 D building data obtained by <b>photogrammetric</b> stereo <b>plotting</b> from a 5 cm nadir flight and a LiDAR point cloud with 10 to 20 measurements per m² are available as reference data or for comparison. The photogrammetric workflow, from flight planning to Dense Image Matching (DIM) and 3 D building extraction, is described together with the achieved accuracy. For each step, the differences and innovation with respect to standard photogrammetric procedures based on nadir images are shown, including high overlaps, improved vertical accuracy, and visibility of areas masked in the standard vertical views.

Za dio gospodarske jedinice ‘Donja Kupčina – Pisarovina’ (14 odsjeka) na sistematskom uzorku ploha provedena je manualna (klasična/analogna) stereo fotogrametrijska izmjera na aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm i 10 cm (GSD – eng. Ground Sample Distance). Svakom stablu na plohi određena (interpretirana) je vrsta drveća, izmjerena visina i delineirana krošnja, na temelju čega su procijenjeni glavni strukturni elementi sastojina. Kako bi se utvrdila točnost fotogrametrijski procijenjenih strukturnih elemenata sastojina provedena je usporedba s podacima terenske izmjere. Rezultati provedenog istraživanja potvrdili su velik potencijal primjene digitalnih aerosnimaka visokih prostornih rezolucija u stereomodelu pri inventuri šuma. Usporedbom rezultata fotogrametrijske izmjere na digitalnim aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm i GSD 10 cm s rezultatima terenske izmjere utvrđeno je da aerosnimke GSD 30 cm pružaju mogućnost procjene srednjih sastojinskih visina, sastojinske temeljnice i volumena s gotovo jednakom točnošću kao i aerosnimke GSD 10 cm. Međutim, pogreške procijene srednjeg sastojinskog promjera i broja stabala bile su gotovo dvostruko veće na aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm nego na aerosnimkama GSD 10 cm. Stoga se može zaključiti kako aerosnimke GSD 10 cm sveukupno daju bolje rezultate procjene strukturnih elemenata sastojina, jer prikazuje strukturu sastojine bliže stvarnoj. Although the {{application}} of aerial stereo photogrammetry in forest inventory has a long tradition, in many countries including Croatia forest inventories are based on labour and time consuming field surveys. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research was to evaluate the applicability of using the digital aerial images of high spatial resolution (ground sampling distance – GSD of 10 cm and 30 cm) for predicting forest stand attributes (basal-area weighted mean dbh – DBHg, Lorey’s mean height – HL, stand density – N, basal area – G, volume – V). This research continues the work of the previous research (Balenović et al. 2013, 2015 a), where accuracy of photogrammetrically estimated arithmetic mean diameter and arithmetic mean height of forest stands were evaluated. The research was conducted in the even-aged (sessile oak management class) and the multi-aged stands (European beech and common hornbeam management classes) of a privately owned forest in the management unit Donja Kupčina – Pisarovina, 25 km south of Zagreb, Croatia (Figure 1). Field data were collected during {{the spring and summer of}} 2009 as part of the regular forest inventory conducted according to the valid Regulation on Forest Management. A total of 183 circular plots with radii of 8 or 12 m were systematically set in the 14 selected subcompartments. The positions of the sample plot centres were recorded with GPS receiver. Within each plot, the diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured and tree species was determined for all trees with dbh&# 8805; 10 cm. The height of each tree was calculated by means of the constructed local height curves fitted with Michailloff’s function. The basal area (g) of each tree was calculated from the measured dbhs using standard equation, whereas the merchantable tree volume up to a diameter of 7 cm overbark (v) was calculated from field-measured dbh and estimated h using the Schumacher-Hall function and parameters from Croatian volume tables. The forest stand attributes were calculated by averaging data of all sampled tree within each stand (DBHg, HL) or summing the tree data and dividing it by the total area of all plots for each stand (N, G, V). Stand-level field data were used in the statistical analysis and comparison with photogrammetric data as a ground-truth reference data (Table 1). The colour infrared (CIR) digital aerial images of GSD 30 cm and GSD 10 cm were acquired using a Microsoft UltraCamX digital large-format aerial camera during two aerial surveys in July 2009 (Figure 1, Table 2). The digital terrain data (breaklines, formlines, spot heights and mass points) for the digital terrain model (DTM) generation were collected by stereo-mapping of digital aerial images according to the rules of the Croatian State Geodetic Administration. The whole procedure of image acquisition, aerial triangulation, and collection of 3 D data was conducted by Geofoto Ltd. (Zagreb, Croatia). The photogrammetric stereo measurements and the visual interpretation of tree attributes were performed on digital aerial images of 30 cm GSD and 10 cm GSD using PHOTOMOD 5. 24 digital photogrammetric system according to procedures described in Balenović et al. 2013, 2015 a. The <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>plots</b> were overlaid upon the aerial images based on the spatial coordinates (x, y) of the field plot centres recorded by the GPS receiver. The determination of tree species and crown tops as well as the delineation of crown areas was performed manually for each tree whose top fell inside the plot. The height of each tree was calculated as the difference between the tree top elevations and the corresponding tree bottom elevations determined from the DTM. A raster DTM of 1 m grid size was generated through linear interpolation of a triangular irregular network (TIN) which was previously created from the digital terrain data. The dbh of each tree on the plot was calculated using local regression models with tree height and crown diameter as inputs (Balenović et al. 2012). Crown diameter was calculated from delineated crown area by applying the equation for circle surface area. Further calculations of photogrammetric tree (g, v) and stand variables (DBHg, HL, N, G, V) were identical to previously described calculations of field data. The accuracy of the photogrammetrically estimated stand attributes was evaluated by calculating differences (D), mean differences (MD) and RMSE between photogrammetric- and field-estimates. The relative values of D%, MD%, RMSE% were calculated according to the mean of the field reference values. The D and D% were calculated for each subcompartment, whereas MD, MD%, RMSE and RMSE% were calculated for the whole study area. The results in Table 3 show that photogrammetric measurements of the aerial images of 30 cm GSD (PM 30) and 10 cm GSD (PM 10) produced reasonable accurate estimates for HL, G, V with relative RMSEs ranging from 3. 65 % to 5. 36 %. Similar accuracy was obtained for DBHg estimated by PM 10 (RMSE= 4. 94 %), while lower accuracy was obtained for N estimated by PM 10 (RMSE= 7. 71 %) and DBHg estimated by PM 30 (RMSE= 9. 460 %). The lowest accuracy was obtained for N estimated by PM 30 (RMSE= 15. 90 %). Both photogrammetric measurements (PM 10 and PM 30) estimated HL and G with similar level of accuracy, whereas V was estimated with slightly higher accuracy by PM 10 then by PM 30. For estimation of DBHg and V, PM 10 produced considerably better results, i. e. estimates of approximately twice higher accuracy then PM 30. Figure 2 shows relations between D% and field estimates of corresponding attributes for each subcompartment. As can be seen, photogrammetrically estimated HL and V varied between overestimation and underestimation (HL: from - 13. 6 % to 2. 8 % for PM 10, from - 12. 8 % to 3. 7 % for PM 30; V: from - 7. 0 % to 2. 2 % for PM 10, from - 10. 2 % to 8. 2 % for PM 30), but with a slight tendency to underestimate field estimates. Photogrammetrically estimated G also varied between overestimation and underestimation (from - 6. 2 % to 12. 9 % for PM 10, from - 5. 0 % to 10. 2 % for PM 30), but with a slight tendency to overestimate field estimates. DBHg was overestimated for all subcompartments by both photogrammetric measurements (from 1. 1 to 9. 5 % for PM 10; from 3. 0 % to 16. 5 % for PM 30). On the contrary, both photogrammetric measurements underestimated N throughout all subcompartments (from - 2. 6 % to - 10. 6 % for PM 10; from - 5. 1 % to - 24. 4 % for PM 30). For both DBHg and N, PM 30 produced estimates of lower accuracy than PM 10. This is a consequence of lesser visibility of details (e. g. crown boundaries) on images of lower spatial resolution (GSD 30 cm) and decreased ability to detect individual trees, especially in the part of stands with greater proportion of younger trees. According to Figure 3, the notable underestimation of N by PM 30 was found in the lowest dbh size class (10. 0 - 14. 9 cm). The results of this research showed that HL, G and V can be accurately estimated by manual measurements of digital aerial images of high spatial resolution. The use of images of high spatial resolution, along with the use of local dbh models, led to improved accuracy regarding individual tree detection and dbh estimation. Moreover, the errors of N underestimation and DBH overestimation have been mutually abolished, which in the end resulted with reasonably accurate estimates of G and V at stand level. Since the errors of N underestimation and DBH overestimation with PM 30 were both proportionally (twice) greater than with PM 10, G and V were estimated on both 10 cm and 30 cm GSD images with similar level of accuracy. Although PM 10 overall produced the more accurate results than PM 30, it should be noted that the price of 10 cm images is several time higher than of 30 cm images. Therefore, a potential user should decide which images to use depending on desired accuracy and available funds...|$|R
