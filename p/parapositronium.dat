40|$|The {{construction}} of positronium decay amplitudes is handled {{through the use}} of dispersion relations. In this way, emphasis is put on basic QED principles: gauge invariance and soft-photon limits (analyticity). A firm grounding is given to the factorization approaches, and some ambiguities in the spin and energy structures of the positronium wavefunction are removed. Non-factorizable amplitudes are naturally introduced. Their dynamics is described, especially regarding the enforcement of gauge invariance and analyticity through delicate interferences. The important question of the completeness of the present theoretical predictions for the decay rates is then addressed. Indeed, some of those non-factorizable contributions are unaccounted for by NRQED analyses. However, it is shown that such new contributions are highly suppressed, being of order alpha^ 3. Finally, a particular effective form factor formalism is constructed for <b>parapositronium,</b> allowing a thorough analysis of binding energy effects and analyticity implementation.

30|$|The {{situation}} is radically changed when the effective {{mass of the}} impurity center (hole) {{is comparable to the}} mass of the electron. For example, in the narrow-gap semiconductors for which the CC standard (parabolic) dispersion law is violated, the effective masses of the electron and light hole are equal [11 – 14]. It is obvious {{that in the case of}} equal effective masses, adiabatic approximation is not applicable. A similar situation arises in considering the Coulomb interaction of the electron-positron pair. Antiparticle doping in semiconductor systems with reduced dimensionality greatly increases the possibilities of external manipulation of the physical properties of these nanostructures and widens the area of potential applications of devices based on them. On the other hand, such an approach makes real the study of the changes of the properties of antiparticles’ complexes formed in semiconductor media under the influence of SQ. Combinations of particle-antiparticle pairs may form exotic atomic states, the most well-known example being positronium (Ps), the bound state between an electron and positron [15, 16]. There are two types of Ps: orthopositronium (parallel orientation of the spins) and <b>parapositronium</b> (antiparallel orientation). Orthopositronium has a lifetime τ ~ 1.4 × 10 − 7 s and annihilates with the emission of three gamma quanta, which by three orders exceed the lifetime of <b>parapositronium</b> [17 – 19]. Ps lifetime is long enough that it has a well-defined atomic structure. Thus, in other studies [20 – 23], the authors experimentally detected the occurrence of a positronium and its molecules in the structure of porous silicon and also detected positron lines of light absorption. Wheeler supposed that two positronium atoms might combine to form the dipositronium molecule (Ps 2) [24]. Schrader theoretically studied this molecule [25]. Because Ps has a short lifetime and it is difficult to obtain low energy positrons in large numbers, dipositronium has not been observed unambiguously. Mills and Cassidy’s group showed that dipositronium was created on internal pore surfaces when intense positron bursts are implanted into a thin film of porous silica. Moreover, in another study [26], the authors report observations of transitions between the ground state of Ps 2 and the excited state. These results experimentally confirm the existence of the dipositronium molecule. As a purely leptonic, macroscopic quantum matter–antimatter system, this would be of interest in its own right, but it would also represent a milestone on the path to produce an annihilation gamma-ray laser [27]. Further, in another work [21], porous silica film contains interconnected pores with a diameter d < 4 nm. From abovementioned follows that it is logically necessary to discuss size quantization effects related with this topic. In [28], additional quantization effects on the Ps states conditioned by QD confinement have been revealed along with quantization conditioned by Coulomb interaction in the framework of the standard (parabolic) dispersion law of CCs.|$|E
