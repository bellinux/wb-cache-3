5|$|What Would Ryan Lochte Do? began airing April 21, 2013, on E! and was {{cancelled}} {{after only}} one season, five weeks later. Lochte's <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> and character have inspired {{a series of}} unflattering Internet memes.|$|E
5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to the papacy for himself. He had sought to both have a <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> favourable to Leopold I, while also working to curry the favour of Louis XIV. The zelanti faction and Flavio Chigi opposed him, which was enough to stop his victory.|$|E

5000|$|The play provokes and entertains as {{it depicts}} great humour and the {{complexities}} of the men's private selves behind their <b>public</b> <b>personas.</b> The London production in 2016 followed debates about black representation and 'race relations, black empowerment, and the twisted nature of celebrity' raised by the 2013 premiere in America ...|$|R
5|$|Kijak {{revealed}} that upon thinking of Lynch's use of doppelgängers he {{was reminded of}} an interview where Yoshiki said he has two personalities, his <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> and a man wounded by the tragedies in his life. He made this the subtext of the film to have something deeper than the average rockumentary. He {{said one of the}} hardest aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|Bangerz {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from contemporary music critics, who praised its overall production and originality, and complimented Cyrus' <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> evolution. The record debuted at {{number one on}} the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 270,000 copies. In doing so, it became Cyrus' fifth non-consecutive number-one album, including earlier soundtracks in which she performed as her character Hannah Montana. It was the third-highest opening week for a female artist in 2013, and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after moving one million units.

5|$|Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, had eleven daughters, {{including}} the Queen of France, the Queen of Naples and Sicily, the Duchess of Parma, and five sons, including two Holy Roman Emperors, Joseph II and Leopold II. Of the sixteen children ten survived to adulthood. Though she {{was expected to}} cede power to Francis and Joseph, {{both of whom were}} officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia, Maria Theresa was the absolute sovereign who ruled with the counsel of her advisers. She criticised and disapproved of many of Joseph's actions. Maria Theresa understood the importance of her <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> and was able to simultaneously evoke both esteem and affection from her subjects.|$|E

25|$|In 2010 Brydon starred {{alongside}} Steve Coogan in Michael Winterbottom's partially improvised BBC Two sitcom series The Trip, {{in which}} both actors played fictionalized versions of their <b>public</b> <b>personas</b> (Brydon, optimistic and always eager to do an impression; and Coogan, misanthropic and bitter that he's not the major international star he believes he should be).|$|R
5000|$|The {{series is}} filmed {{in a more}} {{traditional}} sitcom style than the mockumentary style used by Gervais and Merchant in their previous series The Office. Each episode {{has at least one}} guest star: a television or film celebrity, who play what Gervais and Merchant have referred to as [...] "twisted" [...] versions of themselves; an exaggerated or inverted parody of their <b>public</b> <b>personas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her <b>public</b> <b>persona.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} outgoing <b>public</b> <b>persona.</b> He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Riya's {{on-screen}} performances {{have established}} {{her as a}} bold youth icon in India. Since entering the film industry, she has gained attention for wearing a bikini in Shaadi No. 1 and sharing on-screen kisses with co-stars Ashmit Patel in Silsiilay and Sharman Joshi in Style, respectively. Such performances garnered negative attention because of the relatively conservative outlook of Indian cinema {{at that time and}} her own statements about such practices. In 2008, Riya Sen was also linked to author Salman Rushdie. Before becoming a film star, she had a reputation for partying, which started at the age of fifteen. Riya's <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> is compared to her mother Moon Moon, who was seen as a sex symbol of her time, while her sister Raima is mostly compared to their grandmother Suchitra.|$|E

5000|$|Due to high ticket prices, [...] {{publicity}} {{campaigns and}} the occasional use of [...] material, the revue was typically patronized by audience members who earned even more and felt even less restricted by middle-class social mores than their contemporaries in vaudeville. Like much of that era's popular entertainments, revues often featured material based on sophisticated, irreverent dissections of topical matter, <b>public</b> <b>personae</b> and fads, though the primary attraction {{was found in the}} frank display of the female body.|$|R
5|$|While Schumacher was on {{the podium}} after winning the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari issued a press release stating that he would retire from racing {{at the end of}} the 2006 season. Schumacher {{confirmed}} his retirement. The press release stated that Schumacher would continue working for Ferrari. It was revealed on 29 October 2006 that Ferrari wanted Schumacher to act as assistant to the newly appointed CEO Jean Todt. This would involve selecting the team's future drivers. After Schumacher's announcement, leading Formula One figures such as Niki Lauda and David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of Formula One. The tifosi and the Italian press, who did not always take to Schumacher's relatively cold <b>public</b> <b>persona,</b> displayed an affectionate response after he announced his retirement.|$|E

25|$|During {{her early}} career, {{professional}} photographer Sam Lévin's photos contributed to her image of Bardot's sensuality. One showed Bardot from behind, {{dressed in a}} white corset. British photographer Cornel Lucas made images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s, that have become representative of her <b>public</b> <b>persona.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diary {{contains}} {{a lot of}} personal criticism of both Tyrmand's acquaintances (often hidden under initials) as well as <b>public</b> <b>personae.</b> He criticises first of all moral attitudes of artists, whom he considered lackeys of the state. Tyrmand engages in a dispute on Ernest Hemingway with Zygmunt Kałużyński. He also describes in detail his discussions with his friend Stefan Kisielewski. In the whole diary 570 names appear, including those of the people beginning to be known at that time, e.g., Stanisław Lem, Zbigniew Herbert, Jan Lenica, Julia Hartwig.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the close}} {{friendship}} and similar backgrounds {{and beliefs of}} Harris and Eves, the two have very different <b>public</b> <b>personae.</b> While Harris tried to be the embodiment of a grass-roots politician, Eves was just the opposite. He was always meticulously well-turned-out in expensive suits, with court-filings revealing he spent $25,000 a year on clothing, $5,000 a year on jewelry and cufflinks and $700 a month on dry cleaning. Eves also sported a slicked-back hair style that reinforced his image as a [...] "slick" [...] politician.|$|R
5000|$|Diana McLellan {{reveals the}} complex and {{intimate}} connections that roiled behind the <b>public</b> <b>personae</b> of Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Tallulah Bankhead, {{and the women who}} loved them. Private correspondence, long-secret FBI files, and troves of unpublished documents reveal a chain of lesbian affairs that moved from the theater world of New York City, through the heights of chic society, to embed itself in the power structure of the movie business. The Girls serves up a rich stew of film, politics, sexuality, psychology, and stardom. Via Goodreads ...|$|R
25|$|Rice was {{involved}} in creating a Tiki bar called Tiki Boyd's at the East Coast Bar in Denver, Colorado. Rice decorated the entire establishment {{out of his own}} pocket due to his fondness of Tiki culture, asking an open tab at the bar in return.

25|$|By 1989, while {{continuing}} his comeback, Foreman had sold {{his name and}} face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from grills to mufflers on TV. For this purpose his <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman {{had been replaced by}} a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing.|$|E
25|$|Lex Luthor has {{traditionally}} lacked superpowers or a dual identity and typically appears with a bald head. He periodically wears his Warsuit, a high-tech battle suit giving him enhanced strength, flight, advanced weaponry, and other capabilities.

He is well known for his philanthropy, donating vast sums of money to Metropolis over the years, funding parks, foundations, and charities.|$|E
5000|$|After five {{terms in}} the Minnesota House, Seaberg made an {{unsuccessful}} run for the Minnesota Senate. (He was succeeded in the House by Tim Pawlenty, {{who went on to}} become Governor of Minnesota.) Seaberg returned to politics in 2002, running for an open House seat in District 38A, but lost. In 2010, he publicly endorsed Independence Party candidate Tom Horner for governor, leading him to be temporarily banned from the state Republican Party. [...] The Independents, continue to support the choices and <b>public</b> <b>personae</b> of Mr. Seaberg.|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{the authors}} seem {{to adopt the}} <b>public</b> <b>personas</b> of the celebrities in {{question}} as their own characters, building a fictional universe based on the supposed real-life histories of their idols. Information from interviews, documentaries, music videos, and other publicity sources are assimilated into the stories. It is also very popular to write fiction about celebrity couples. Communities of writers build collective archetypes based on the celebrities' <b>public</b> <b>personas.</b> Communities also develop their own ethics on what sort of stories are acceptable [...] - [...] some are uncomfortable with slash fiction, or with mention of the celebrity's real-life families, or with stories involving suicide, murder, or rape. Like most fan fiction, the RPF genre includes stories of every kind, from innocuous to sadistic to pornographic. Like many fan fiction writers whose subject matter is commercially prepared entertainment, particularly {{before the advent of}} the Internet, a number of RPF authors report that they began writing on their own, without any awareness of a larger fan fiction community, and were surprised to learn that they were not alone. [...] Many report having been completely unaware of media fandom's taboo towards RPF; that is, many fans believe it is acceptable to write about the characters, but not about the actors who portray them.|$|R
5000|$|Herford's monologues {{were well}} {{received}} on the New York and London stages, and she numbered among her friends the royalty of English-speaking theater. For over 30 years, her tiny theatre was open only to her friends, who performed for each other, often taking roles {{they would never}} have essayed in their <b>public</b> <b>personas</b> as stars of the legitimate stage. Her theatre is a Massachusetts historical site and houses a notable collection of theater memorabilia and photographs, in addition to remaining in vibrant and active use as the home of the Vokes Players.|$|R
25|$|Ellington led the {{orchestra}} by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section. As a bandleader, Ellington {{was not a}} strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra {{with a combination of}} charm, humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> to deflect attention away from himself.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the paint}} {{was removed from the}} guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as {{evidenced}} from contemporary photographs. No further paint loss was seen over the subsequent twenty five years. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> and image. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Clark died in May 1991, {{he had become}} {{something}} of a national institution, as much for his <b>public</b> <b>persona</b> as for his historical work. His goatee beard, his bush hat, his stout walking stick and his enigmatic public utterances had become widely known even among people who had never opened any of his books. It was this which inspired the 1988 project of turning the History into a musical, Manning Clark's History of Australia - The Musical, funded by the Australian Bicentenary and with a script by Don Watson, historian and later speechwriter to Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating. The show was a flop, but did not detract from Clark's public standing. His last works were two volumes of autobiography, The Puzzles of Childhood (Viking 1989) and The Quest for Grace (Viking 1990). A third, unfinished volume, A Historian's Apprenticeship (Melbourne University Press 1992), was published after his death.|$|E

The Musical, in which they parody the concept of both DVD commentaries and musicals in general. In addition to songs by the main cast members (often parodying their own <b>public</b> <b>personas</b> or each others), it includes numbers by unnamed extras in the film, and a song explaining how the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike {{led to the creation}} of the web series.|$|R
40|$|The {{emergent}} {{trend of}} depicting sitting politicians and {{heads of state}} in mainstream British drama and film is considered through a reading of David Hare's play, Stuff Happens (2006), and Stephen Frear's film, The Queen (2006). These are seen as contemporary dramatisation(s) of {{the erosion of the}} gap between the public and private lives of the protagonists: private lives can now be the subject of plays or films only when and because <b>public</b> <b>personas</b> have been diminished. No longer held in high regard, the 'proximity' of public figures enables the dramatisation of private scenes which would have previously been unthinkable...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{shifting}} ideologies of {{gender of the}} seventeenth century, {{the arrival of the}} first actresses caused deep social anxiety: theatre gave women a voice to air grievances and to contest, through their own bodies, traditional gender roles. This paper studies two of the best-known actresses, Nell Gwyn and Anne Bracegirdle, and the different <b>public</b> <b>personae</b> they created to negotiate their presence in this all-male world. In spite of their differing strategies, both women gained fame and profit in the male-dominated theatrical marketplace, confirming them as the ultimate “gender benders,” who appropriated the male role of family’s supporter and bread-winne...|$|R
