50|$|In {{a vehicle}} which relies on gravity in some way, weight {{distribution}} directly affects {{a variety of}} vehicle characteristics, including handling, acceleration, traction, and component life. For this reason weight distribution varies with the vehicle's intended usage. For example, a drag car maximizes traction at the rear axle while countering the reactionary <b>pitch-up</b> <b>torque.</b> It generates this counter-torque by placing {{a small amount of}} counterweight at a great distance forward of the rear axle.|$|E
