In a nutshell, a single-tranche CDO is a CDO where the arranging bank does not simultaneously place the entirety of the capital structure. These CDOs are also called arbitrage CDOs because the arranging bank seeks to pay a lower return than the return available from hedging the single-tranche exposure.|$|E

We modified the basic mean-variance optimization problem to include rebalancing costs we incur on transacting securities in the portfolio. We also reduce trading as much as possible by applying the resampling approach any time we rebalance our <b>portfolio.</b> <b>Transaction</b> costs are assumed to be a percentage of the amount of securities transacted.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{proportional}} transaction costs on dynamic portfolio strategies for an agent who maximizes his expected utility of terminal wealth. For portfolios composed of a single risky asset and a single riskless asset, Constantinides (1979) shows that the optimal investment policy is described in terms of a no transaction region, where the optimal policy is to refrain from trading if initial portfolio holdings lie within the region, and to transact to the nearest boundary of the region if portfolio holdings lie outside the region. Because the boundaries could not be derived analytically, we developed an efficient and tractable algorithm to obtain the boundaries, which are expressed as the ratio of the dollar holdings in stocks and bonds. We considered two cases: the same transaction costs for the two assets, and costs incurred on only the risky asset. We derived the optimal trading strategies and utility levels for a large set of realistic parameters. In particular, we show that the no transaction region narrows and converges rapidly to the infinite horizon limit as the time horizon increases. optimal <b>portfolio,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, optimal rebalancing, liquidation costs, power utility...|$|E

It describes the accounting entries for the revenues, expenses and valuations per portfolio. It makes a comparative analysis between Greek GAAP, IFRS 4 and U.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the theoretical literature that analyses the link between international asset trade and international risk sharing. Despite the massive increase in cross-border asset trade since the 1990 's, consumption risk sharing across countries remains limited. In standard international business cycle models, efficient risk sharing requires that consumption should be higher {{in the country where}} it is cheaper to consume, implying a high positive correlation between relative consumption and real exchange rate, which is strongly rejected in the data. Recent contributions show {{that it is possible to}} account for this so-called 'consumption-real exchange rate anomaly' in models with goods and financial market frictions where international asset trade is restricted to a single non-contingent bond. Chapter 1 analyses whether this class of models can account for the anomaly under a richer asset market structure where agents can trade in domestic and foreign currency bonds. Even such a small departure from the single bond economy implies too much risk sharing compared to the data although the number of assets that can be traded is less than the number of shocks affecting each economy. Introducing demand shocks alongside sector-specific productivity shocks can improve the performance of the model only under specific parameter and monetary policy settings. Chapter 2 extends this analysis to study the implications of international trade in equities, <b>portfolio</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and recursive utility. Chapter 3 studies the interaction between monetary policy and foreign currency positions in more detail. Different monetary policy regimes can lead to different foreign currency positions by changing the cyclical properties of the nominal ex- change rate. These external positions, in turn, affect the cross-border transmission of monetary policy shocks via a valuation channel. The way export prices are set has important implications for optimal foreign currency positions and the valuation channel when prices are sticky and financial markets are incomplete. Chapter 4 compares the international transmission of uncertainty shocks under alternative asset markets with an emphasis on the behaviour of net foreign assets, exchange rate and currency risk premium and shows that a model with restricted asset trade performs better than a model with complete financial integration in matching certain aspects of the data regarding the dynamics of these variables in response to increased macroeconomic uncertainty.

40|$|In real markets, to some degree, every trade will incur a non-zero {{cost and}} will {{influence}} {{the price of}} the asset traded. In situations where a dynamic trading strategy is implemented these liquidity effects can play a significant role. In this thesis we examine two situations in which such trading strategies are inherent to the problem; that of pricing a derivative contingent on the asset and that of executing a large <b>portfolio</b> <b>transaction</b> in the asset. The asset's finite liquidity has been incorporated explicitly into its price dynamics using the Bakstein-Howison model [4]. Using this model we have derived the no-arbitrage price of a derivative on the asset and have found a true continuous-time equation when the bid-ask spread in the asset is neglected. Focussing on this pure liquidity case we then employ an asymptotic analysis to examine the price of a European call option near strike and expiry where the liquidity effects are shown to be most significant and closed-form expressions for the price are derived in this region. The asset price model is then extended to incorporate the empirical fact that an asset's liquidity mean reverts stochastically. In this situation the pricing equation is analyzed using the multiscale asymptotic technique developed by Fouque, Papanicolaou, and Sircar [22] and a simplified pricing and calibration framework is developed for an asset possessing liquidity risk. Finally, the derivative pricing framework (both with and without liquidity risk) is applied to a new contract termed the American forward which we present as a possible hedge against an asset's liquidity risk. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we investigate how to optimally execute a large transaction of a finitely liquid asset. Using stochastic dynamic programming and attempting only to minimize the transaction's cost, we first find that the optimal strategy is static and contains the naive strategy found in previous studies, but with an extra term to account for interest rates neglected by those studies. Including time risk into the optimization procedure we find expressions for the optimal strategy in the extreme cases when the trader's aversion to this risk is very small and very large. In the former case the optimal strategy is simply the cost-minimization strategy perturbed by a small correction proportional to the trader's level of risk aversion. In the latter case the problem is shown to be much more difficult; we analyze and derive implicit closed-form solutions to the much-simplified perfect liquidity case and show numerical results to demonstrate the agreement of the solution with our intuition.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{portfolio}} selection problem based on the possibility theory {{under the assumption that}} the returns of assets are LR-type fuzzy numbers. A possibilistic <b>portfolio</b> model with <b>transaction</b> costs is proposed, in which the possibilistic mean value of the return is termed measure of investment return, and the possibilistic variance of the return is termed measure of investment risk. Due to considering transaction costs, the existing traditional optimization algorithms usually fail to find the optimal solution efficiently and heuristic algorithms can be the best method. Therefore, a particle swarm optimization is designed to solve the corresponding optimization problem. At last, a numerical example is given to illustrate our proposed effective means and approaches.

This article presents a new way to improve market formation and integrity by proposing that patent portfolios be treated as securities.
