40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted during October 1971 aboard a sounding rocket {{to observe the}} operation of several heat pipes in a zero gravity environment. The pipe designs which were tested included a spiral artery, a pedestal artery, and a <b>plain</b> <b>groove.</b> Two control pipes without wicking were also flown. The two artery pipes {{were similar to those}} which will be used on the OAO-C satellite, while the groove pipe was similar to that used on the ATS-F spacecraft. The results of the experiment indicate that the heat pipes operated satisfactorily during the flight which included four minutes of zero gravity...|$|E
40|$|Geologic mapping and {{photographs}} of the Orientale multiring basin are studied as to origin, size, and nature and distribution of ejecta. Six facies of ejecta are observed around the Cordillera Mountains: concentric, radial, smooth <b>plains,</b> <b>grooved,</b> secondary impact craters, and fissured. Transport of these ejecta occurred by block gliding, landsliding, debris flow, and possibly by base surge, viscous flow, and ballistic ejection. The ejecta are mainly clastic types, but melts and annealed breccias {{are expected to be}} abundant. Mixing of ejecta and substrate materials must have occurred; compositions of the ejecta are probably zoned laterally and vertically...|$|R

Ways {{in which this}} data {{is expected to be}} augmented by the Viking mission are briefly reviewed. Information given in map form includes permanent ice, layered deposits, etched plains, volcanic constructs (shields, domes, or cones), volcanic plains, moderately cratered plains, cratered plains, hummocky terrain, channel deposit, undivided <b>plains,</b> and <b>grooved</b> terrain...|$|R
40|$|A summary is {{presented}} {{of the results}} of some new observations on Martian volcanic features made from the Viking orbiters. Most of these observations are concerned with the Tharsis and Alba regions. The youth, size, and style of the volcanic features in these areas render them particularly susceptible to analysis. Excellent coverage was also acquired of Apollinaris Patera. It has many features of the Tharsis shields, with a cliff around its circumference and a large central caldera. Olympus Mons and its vicinity are examined, taking into account the shield of Olympus Mons, mass movement features along the basal scarp, the basal plains, the relative ages of Olympus Mons and the basal <b>plains,</b> and <b>grooved</b> terrain...|$|R
40|$|A commercially {{available}} code is utilized to analyze a <b>plain</b> and <b>grooved</b> liquid annular seal. These type seals {{are commonly used}} in modern turbopumps and have a pronounced effect on the rotordynamic behavior of these systems. Accurate prediction of both leakage and dynamic reaction forces is vital to ensure good performance and sound mechanical operation. The code SCISEAL developed by CFDRC is a generic 3 -D, finite volume based CFD code solving the 3 -D Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations. The code allows body-fitted, multi-blocked structured grids, turbulence modeling, rotating coordinate frames, as well as integration of dynamic pressure and shear forces on the rotating journal. The code may be used with the {{commercially available}} pre-and post-processing codes from CFDRC as well...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{experimental}} investigations on friction factor, Nusselt {{number and}} thermal hydraulic performanceof a tube {{equipped with the}} classic three modified internally grooved tubes. The working fluid is water and ethylene glycolmixture 90 : 10 (by weight). Local heat transfer by forced convection from <b>plain</b> and <b>grooved</b> tubes is investigated for Reynoldsnumber ranges 4900 to 13300. The increase in forced convective heat transfer coefficient in water and ethylene glycolmixtures results in a heat exchanger under turbulent flow is also reported. Among the grooved tubes, heat transferenhancement obtained for {{the flow of water}} and ethylene glycol mixture is up to 36 % for circular grooved tube 55 % for squaregrooved tube and 10 % for trapezoidal grooved tube in comparison with the plain tub...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution radar {{images from}} the Magellan {{spacecraft}} have revealed the first details of the morphology of the Lavinia Planitia region of Venus. A number of geologic units can be distinguished, including volcanic plains units {{with a range of}} ages. Transecting these plains over much of the Lavinia region are two types of generally orthogonal features that we interpret to be compressional wrinkle ridges and extensional grooves. The dominant tectonic features of Lavinia are broad elevated belts of intense deformation that transect the plains with complex geometry. They are many tens to a few hundred kilometers wide, as much as 1000 km long, and elevated hundreds of meters above the surrounding plains. Two classes of deformation belts are seen in the Lavinia region. “Ridge belts” are composed of parallel ridges, each a few hundred meters in elevation, that we interpret to be folds. Typical fold spacings are 5 – 10 km. “Fracture belts” are dominated instead by intense faulting, with faults in some instances paired to form narrow grabens. There is also some evidence for modest amounts of horizontal shear distributed across both ridge and fracture belts. Crosscutting relationships among the belts show there to be a range in belt ages. In western Lavinia in particular, many ridge and fracture belts appear to bear a relationship to the much smaller wrinkle ridges and grooves on the surrounding plains: Ridge morphology tends to dominate belts that lie more nearly parallel to local plains wrinkle ridges, and fracture morphology tends to dominate belts that lie more nearly parallel to local <b>plains</b> <b>grooves.</b> We use simple models to explore the formation of ridge and fracture belts. We show that convective motions in the mantle can couple to the crust to cause horizontal stresses of a magnitude sufficient to induce the formation of deformation belts like those observed in Lavinia. We also use the small-scale wavelengths of deformation observed within individual ridge belts to place an approximate lower limit on the venusian thermal gradient in the Lavinia region at the time of deformation...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 179 - 190 A {{review of}} several {{different}} types of hydrodynamic journal bearings that are commonly found in turbomachinery is presented. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} key geometric design parameters of each type. The discussion covers <b>plain</b> journal, axial <b>groove,</b> pressure dam, offset split, lemon bore, multilobe and titling-pad bearings. The application of the critical speed map and some basic non-dimensional bearing parameters as tools for preliminary bearing selection and comparison are discussed. These tools are applied to two case studies, which demonstrate the proper application of different bearing designs to industrial turbomachinery...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to understand jet flow development from <b>plain</b> and <b>grooved</b> rectangular nozzles of aspect ratio 2 :I using two-component hotwire anemometry. Grooves of square configuration (side 4 mm) and length 5 mm were introduced in the (i) minor-axis, (ii) major-axis and, (iii) in both minor- and major-axes directions. The equivalent diameter of the plain rectangular nozzle is 37 - 5 min. Studies were carried out for a nominal jet exit velocity of 20 ms(- 1) and for Reynolds number based on equivalent diameter of 54, 000. The introduction of grooves in either plane does not show any influence on the potential-core length but results in faster jet-decay thereafter. It is observed that the grooves when introduced ill minor-axis direction inhibit the jet growth in that plane while promoting the jet growth along major-axis plane and hence, delays the phenomena of axis-switching. However when introduced in major-axis direction, the grooves promote jet growth along major-axis plane while inhibiting jet-growth in minor-axis plane. Cross-sectional contours of mean-velocity suggest that the grooves modify the process of overall jet development significantly in the plane in which they are introduced relative to the plain jet and hence, significantly affect the axis-switching location in each case...|$|R
5000|$|The subdiaphanous to dingy white {{shell is}} small. Its length {{measures}} 5.3 mm. The 2½ helicoid whorls of the protoconch are loosely coiled, decidedly elevated, and about one-fifth immersed. Their axis is at {{a right angle}} {{to that of the}} later whorls. The ten whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded. They are somewhat overhanging, the greatest convexity being on the lower third of the exposed portion of the whorls, traversed by 14 broad, coarse and strong, oblique, and somewhat flexuous axial ribs on the fourth and seventh whorl and 18 on the eighth. These ribs extend over the angulated periphery to the umbilical region, appearing fainter on the base. The deep intercostal grooves terminate at the periphery,i. e., do not appear on the base as gouged out spaces, as they do posterior to the periphery, but simply as <b>plain</b> shallow <b>grooves</b> between the ribs formed by the raising of these above the general surface of the shell. The whorls slope rapidly toward the suture and are somewhat contracted and shouldered at the summit, thus marking a prominent subchanneled suture. The aperture is large, broadly ovate, showing the axial ribs within. The outer lip is thin, subpatulous, shortly curved to meet the short, somewhat revolute, slightly twisted, columella.|$|R
40|$|Voyager 2 {{photography}} has complemented that of Voyager I in revealing many additional {{characteristics of}} Saturn and its satellites and rings. Saturn's atmosphere contains persistent oval cloud features reminiscent of features on Jupiter. Smaller irregular features track out {{a pattern of}} zonal winds that is symmetric about Saturn's equator and appears to extend to great depth. Winds are predominantly eastward and reach 500 meters per second at the equator. Titan has several haze layers with significantly varying optical properties and a northern polar "collar" that is dark at short wavelengths. Several satellites have been photographed at substantially improved resolution. Enceladus' surface ranges from old, densely cratered terrain to relatively young, uncratered <b>plains</b> crossed by <b>grooves</b> and faults. Tethys has a crater 400 kilometers in diameter whose floor has domed to match Tethys' surface curvature and a deep trench that extends at least 270 ° around Tethys' circumference. Hyperion is cratered and irregular in shape. Iapetus' bright, trailing hemisphere includes several dark-floored craters, and Phoebe has a very low albedo and rotates in the direction opposite to that of its orbital revolution with a period of 9 hours. Within Saturn's rings, the "birth" of a spoke has been observed, and surprising azimuthal and time variability {{is found in the}} ringlet structure of the outer B ring. These observations lead to speculations about Saturn's internal structure and about the collisional and thermal history of the rings and satellites. ...|$|R
