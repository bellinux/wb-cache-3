50|$|Owing to its {{distance}} from the Hindi-speaking areas of North India, the newspaper had difficulty in finding subscribers. The publisher tried to get government subscription, and patronage {{in the form of}} <b>postal</b> <b>fee</b> exemption for eight newspapers to be posted to North India. However, it didn't receive the subscription and only one newspaper was allowed <b>postal</b> <b>fee</b> exemption, which meant that the paper could never be financially viable. Nevertheless, it briefly gained prominence for featuring the controversy that rose Bengali-language magazine, Samachar Chandrika and traders from interiors, who were based in Calcutta.|$|E
50|$|The begin of the stamp's postal {{validity}} {{coincides with}} the inauguration of the Austro-German Postal Union which had the aim of simplifying the hitherto diverse postal system in Germany, including the payment of postage and the settlement of <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> between {{the members of the}} union. Postage stamps had by then already proven convenient in other countries.|$|R
50|$|Get Into London Theatre is a {{discount}} ticket scheme run by SOLT {{that takes place}} annually from January to mid-February. The scheme, initially launched in 2001, offers the public to see over 50 of the capital's most popular shows (including plays, musicals, opera and dance) at the highly reduced prices of £10, £20, £30 and £40. There are no booking or <b>postal</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{national}} [...] essentially {{conformed to}} the design features of the New York Postmaster's provisional—not surprisingly, given that both the provisional and national issues were designed and printed by the same New York firm (Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson). With the issue of stamps for nationwide use, postmasters' provisionals became obsolete—having played, however, an appreciable role in accustoming the public {{to the use of}} stamps for prepaying <b>postal</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
50|$|New users {{receive a}} 1-point bonus per every five book that they register. After having {{registered}} the first 100 books, this incentive {{is no longer}} valid and users receive points only for shipping books to other users (which means that the users {{have to pay the}} <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> for sending the books, but receiving a book is free). Though the site offers a free service, users may purchase 5 points per month if they wish to (purchased points cost $2 each).|$|R
50|$|Postage stamps {{revolutionized}} this process, {{leading to}} universal prepayment; but {{a precondition for}} their issue by a nation was the establishment of standardized rates for delivery throughout the country. If <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> were to remain (as they were in many lands) a patchwork of many different jurisdictional rates, the use of stamps would only produce limited gains in efficiency, for postal clerks {{would still have to}} spend time calculating the rates on many letters: only then would senders know how much postage to put on them.|$|R
50|$|The St. Louis Bears are {{a set of}} Provisional stamps {{issued by}} the St. Louis Post office in 1845-46 to {{facilitate}} prepayment of <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> {{at a time when}} the United States Post Office had not yet issued postage stamps for national use. St. Louis, whose postmaster, John M. Wimer, instigated the production, was one of eleven cities to produce such stamps. Bears were offered in three denominations: 5¢, 10¢ and 20¢; the earliest known postmark date on a stamp of the issue is November 13, 1845.|$|R
25|$|In 1953 the LSSP {{took the}} lead in organising the Hartal. The {{immediate}} cause for the Hartal was a hike in the price of rice from 25 cent to 70 cent per measure by the UNP government. At the time J.R. Jayawardena was the finance minister of the country. Maintaining the price of rice at 25 cent had been an electoral promise given by UNP in the 1952 elections, and when the new rates were introduced to the public there was a massive anger against it. Other harsh ingredients of the 1953 budget included suspension of the meals given to schoolchildren and hikes in rail ticket fares and <b>postal</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the {{elections}} the government faced sudden economic difficulties, Finance Minister J. R. Jayewardene introduced a budget which abolished the subsidy on rice, increased {{the price of}} sugar, did away with the free mid-day meal for school children and increased <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> and rail fares, as world rice prices increased because of the Korean War. In 1952 the UNP government promised to give a measure of rice for 25 cents, but within few months this soon increased to 75 cents. Numerous welfare programmes were also withdrawn. The more than doubling {{of the cost of}} rice was the main reason for the organizers of the hartal.|$|R

5000|$|An Act of Congress of March 3, 1845 (effective July 1, 1845), {{established}} uniform (and mostly reduced) {{postal rates}} throughout the nation, with a uniform rate of five cents for distances under 300 miles (500 km) and ten cents for distances between 300 and 3000 miles. However, Congress did not authorize {{the production of}} stamps for nationwide use until 1847; still, postmasters realized that standard rates now {{made it feasible to}} produce and sell [...] "provisional" [...] issues for prepayment of uniform <b>postal</b> <b>fees,</b> and printed these in bulk. Such provisionals included both prepaid envelopes and stamps, mostly of crude design, the New York Postmaster's Provisional being the only one of quality comparable to later stamps.|$|R
50|$|The society {{publishes the}} members’ {{magazine}} Die Harfe (The Harp) {{three times per}} year. All aspects of Irish philately are treated in more than 200 pages annually. The first 30 volumes are also available digitally, on DVD or USB flash drive. In particular, the magazine deals with Irish postal history. It encompasses, among others, old postal routes, the transport of mail on board overseas steamboats, national and international <b>postal</b> <b>fees,</b> and the Maltese Cross postmarks used in Ireland. Documentation of the postal history of the Irish independence movement {{is also an important}} field. Furthermore, the FAI researches the use of postmark machines, military postal history, postal censorship and post from prisoners of war, Irish postal stationery, international reply coupons, and revenue stamps.|$|R
5000|$|On November 3, 1917, {{the normal}} letter rate was raised from 2¢ to 3¢ {{in support of}} the war effort. The rate hike was {{reflected}} in the first postwar commemorative—a 3¢ [...] "victory" [...] stamp released on March 3, 1919 (not until July 1 would <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> return to peacetime levels). Only once before (with the Lincoln Memorial issue of 1909) had the Post Office issued a commemorative stamp unconnected to an important national exposition; and the appearance of the Pilgrim Tercentenary series in 1920 confirmed that a new policy was developing: the Post Office would no longer need the pretext of significant patriotic trade fairs to issue commemoratives: they could now freely produce stamps commemorating the anniversaries of any notable historical figures, organizations or events.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first series}} of North Ingrian stamps were issued in 21 March 1920. They {{were based on}} the 1917 Finnish [...] "Model Saarinen" [...] series, a stamp {{designed}} by the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen. The first series were soon sold to collectors, as the postage stamps became the major financial source of the North Ingrian government. The second series was designed for the North Ingrian postal service and issued 2 August 1920. The value of both series was in Finnish marks and similar to the <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> of Finland. The number of letters sent from North Ingria was about 50 per day, most of them were carried to Finland. They were mainly sent by the personnel of the Finnish occupying forces. Large number of letters were also sent in pure philatelic purposes.|$|R
50|$|Collicott leased {{his land}} and sailed for Hobart on 23 January 1819 and there entered {{business}} variously as a storekeeper, estate agent, auctioneer and speculator. In August 1823 Collicott {{was on the}} board that established the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, holding {{a considerable number of}} shares on his death. On the 17 August 1822 he was appointed postmaster at Hobart and conducted the post office from his rooms at Murray Street. At first he received no fixed salary but retained the <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> he collected. Lieutenant-governor George Arthur later transferred the post office to government control granting Collicott 300 pounds per year. In 1834 he was appointed as a Commissioner of the Peace and in 1838 his salary was raised to 450 pounds. He was one of the original investors of the Port Phillip Association who were a group of businessmen who sent John Batman across to Port Phillip in 1835 to purchase a vast tract of land where Melbourne now stands.|$|R
50|$|Rentals cost £3.50 to £4.50 {{and lasted}} for five nights, usually from Monday to Friday {{due to the}} <b>postal</b> service. Late <b>fees</b> of £0.70 to £0.90 per disc applied if a disc was not {{returned}} on time.|$|R
40|$|The Universal Postal Union was {{established}} in 1874 to regularize international mail procedures. Conventions were established and treaties were signed so that countries would handle each other’s mail consistently and reciprocally. It shortly became apparent that further work was needed to make standard procedures and rates to facilitate international parcel-post service. In the fall of 1880, the UPU held a three-week meeting in Paris at which many countries were represented. Sweden sent Adolph Wilhelm Roos, regarded by many as Sweden’s most important postmaster general. On November 3, an agreement was signed {{by most of the}} participants, the provisions of which were to go into effect on October 1, 1881. The 1880 Convention was not fully successful as not all the countries agreed to the terms. The U. S. and Great Britain, for example, were not interested in the program. Procedures and Cross-Border Rates for International Parcel Post The proposed agreement included an initial simplified rate scheme. It was suggested that <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> for transiting an international parcel as heavy as 5 kilograms should cost the equivalent of 50 French centimes to be received by each country handling the item. However, some countries, includ...|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{provisional}} stamps became practical {{after an}} act of Congress on March 3, 1845 standardized <b>postal</b> <b>fees</b> throughout the nation at 5¢ for a normal-weight letter transported up to 300 miles and 10¢ for a letter transported between 300 and 3000 miles. [...] (Before standardization, the many different postal rates in different jurisdictions had made fees too unpredictable to prepay all letters with stamps {{as a matter of}} course, with the result that recipients of letters--rather than senders--generally paid the postage on them.) St. Louis was one of eleven U. S. cities that issued these so-called Postmasters' Provisionals, and--owing to its distance from Atlantic population centers--the only one to offer a provisional denomination larger than 10¢. Moreover, none of the ten other cities produced a provisional stamp design so ambitious in its visual content (its homespun artistic realization notwithstanding). Some provisionals were merely handstamps; others offered engraved letters and numerals and/or reproduced signatures; while two presented portraits of George Washington, one of them--the New York Postmaster's Provisional--engraved with considerable skill by a firm specializing in bank notes. The use of provisionals ceased in the U. S. after national postage stamps became available on July 1, 1847.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to stamps, postage franking {{can be in}} the form of printed or stamped impressions made in an authorized format and applied directly by a franking machine, postage meter, computer generated franking labels or other similar methods ("Postage Evidencing Systems"), any form of preprinted [...] "postage paid" [...] notice authorized by a postal service permit ("Indicia"), or any other marking method accepted by the postal service and specified by its regulations, as proof of the prepayment of the appropriate <b>fees.</b> <b>Postal</b> franking also includes [...] "Postage Due" [...] stamps or markings affixed by a postal service which designate any amount of insufficient or omitted postage fees to be collected on delivery.|$|R
50|$|For {{the general}} public, stamp {{production}} {{became the most}} well-known activity of State Printing House over the decades. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Hungarian government {{found it necessary to}} pay for the <b>postal</b> and office <b>fees</b> with its own stamp in order to emphasize national sovereignty and for financial and administration reasons. Previously, these fees could be paid for only by parallel-published (Austrian-Hungarian) stamps which were produced in Vienna. The fee stamps were produced in Hungary from 1869, in the State Printing House managed by the independent Finance Ministry. The provision of the 1867 Compromise concerning postal services came into effect on 1 May. All of the post offices on the territory of Hungary came under the competence of the Hungarian Post Directorate. So a natural claim came forward that independently published Hungarian stamps should be put on the mails of the Hungarian Post. As this claim was approved by the emperor’s government, the first Hungarian newspaper stamp was published on 20 June 1868. However, this was printed in the Viennese printing house and a German inscription could be read on the watermark. The inscription on the stamp itself was Hungarian, and the stamp design was decorated by the Hungarian coat of arms and crown. The first postal stamp produced in Hungary was issued in 1871 after the stamp production line of State Printing House was developed.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. As indicated by the title {{the purpose of the}} thesis is to trace the development of social legislation for blind or deaf persons in England between 1834 and 1939. No attempt is made to deal with assistance whether from statutory or voluntary sources for war blinded or deafened persons. In the first chapter a survey is made of the position of the blind or deaf under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 and succeeding Poor Law legislation up to 1919. Chapter two deals with the enquiry into the condition of the blind carried out in 1874 - 75 by the Charity Organisation Society and the much more comprehensive survey {{of the state of the}} blind or deaf made between 1884 and 1888 by the Royal Commission on the Blind, Deaf and Dumb which reported in 1889. The latter enquiry resulted in the passing of the Education (Blind and Deaf Children) Act of 1893 and also provided the essential data on which state action for the two disabilities could be based. The third chapter gives an account of the campaign to secure legislation for the blind which culminated in the Blind Persons Act of 1920. How the Blind Persons Act was implemented at the local level and the effect on blind welfare of the work of the Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind and the passing of the Local Government Act of 1929, is the concern of chapter four. Chapter five describes the events leading up to the enactment of legislation relating to the issue of free dog licences in respect of guide dogs for the blind, concessionary <b>postal</b> rates, reduced <b>fees</b> in respect of wireless receiving licences, and the Blind Voters Act of 1933. In Chapter six the story of the campaign for legislation for the blind is continued up to the passing of the Blind Persons Act of 1938. The penultimate chapter relates the attempts made to secure legislation provision for the deaf in the form of a Deaf Persons Act broadly similar in scope to the Acts on behalf of the blind. The thesis concludes with a consideration of certain conclusions drawn from the subject matter presented in the preceding chapters...|$|R
