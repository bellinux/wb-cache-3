40|$|A {{collective}} {{is a set}} of self-interested agents which try {{to maximize}} their own utilities, along with a a well-defined, time-extended world utility function which rates the performance of the entire system. In this paper, we use theory of collectives to design time-extended payoff utilities for agents that are both “aligned ” with the world utility, and are “learnable”, Le., the agents can readily see how their behavior affects their utility. We show that in systems where each agent aims to optimize such <b>payoff</b> <b>functions,</b> coordination arises as a byproduct of the agents selfishly pursuing their own goals. A game theoretic analysis shows that such <b>payoff</b> <b>functions</b> have the net effect of aligning the Nash equilibrium, Pareto opcimal solution and world utility optimum, thus eliminating undesirable behavior such as agents working at cross-purposes. We then apply collective-based <b>payoff</b> <b>functions</b> to the token collection in a gridworld problem where agents need to optimize the aggregate value of tokens collected across an episode of finite duration (i. e., an abstracted version of rovers on Mars collecting scientif-ically “interesting ” rock samples, subject to power limitations).

40|$|Secure {{equilibrium}} is a {{refinement of}} Nash equilibrium, which provides some {{security to the}} players against deviations when a player changes his strategy to another best response strategy. The concept of secure equilibrium is specifically developed for assume-guarantee synthesis and has already been applied in this context. Yet, not much is known about its existence in games with more than two players. In this paper, we establish the existence of secure equilibrium in two classes of multi-player perfect information turn-based games: (1) in games with possibly probabilistic transitions, having countable state and finite action spaces and bounded and continuous <b>payoff</b> <b>functions,</b> and (2) in games with only deterministic transitions, having arbitrary state and action spaces and Borel <b>payoff</b> <b>functions</b> with a finite range (in particular, qualitative Borel <b>payoff</b> <b>functions).</b> We show that these results apply to several types of games studied in the literature.
