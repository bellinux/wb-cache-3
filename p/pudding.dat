5000|$|There is {{a popular}} myth that plum <b>pudding's</b> {{association}} with Christmas goes back to a custom in medieval England that the [...] "pudding should {{be made on the}} 25th Sunday after Trinity, that it be prepared with 13 ingredients to represent Christ and the 12 apostles, and that every family member stir it in turn from east to west to honour the Magi and their journey in that direction". However, recipes for plum <b>puddings</b> appear mainly, if not entirely, in the 17th century and later. The collect for the Sunday before Advent in the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer begins with the words [...] "Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people; that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruit of good works...". This led to the custom of preparing Christmas <b>puddings</b> on that day which became known as Stir-up Sunday. <b>Puddings</b> possible ancestors include savoury <b>puddings</b> such as those in Harleian MS 279, crustades, malaches whyte, creme boiled (a kind of stirred custard), and sippets.
