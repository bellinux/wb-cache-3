40|$|Abstract. <b>Polacrilin</b> {{potassium}} is an {{ion exchange}} resin used in oral pharmaceutical formulations as a tablet disintegrant. It is a weakly acidic cat{{ion exchange resin}}. Chemically, it is a partial potassium salt of a copolymer of methacrylic acid with divinyl benzene. It ionizes to an anionic polymer chain and potassium cations. It was hypothesized that <b>polacrilin</b> potassium {{may be able to}} improve the permeability of anionic drugs according to the Donnan membrane phenomenon. The effect of <b>polacrilin</b> potassium on the permeability of diclofenac potassium, used as a model anionic drug, was tested in vitro using diffusion cells and in vivo by monitoring serum levels in rats. The amount of drug permeated across a dialysis membrane in vitro was significantly more in the presence of <b>polacrilin</b> potassium. Significant improvement was found in the extent of drug absorption in vivo. It could be concluded that <b>polacrilin</b> potassium may be used as a high-functionality excipient for improving the bioavailability of anionic drugs having poor gastrointestinal permeability.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium NF is a {{commonly}} used weak cation exchange resin disintegrant in pharmaceutical tablets. The {{objective of this}} research was to evaluate the effects of sorbed moisture on physical characteristics and disintegrant performance of four brands of <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium NF. The disintegrants were stored in five different relative humidity chambers and their dynamic vapor adsorption–desorption analysis, effect of moisture on their compressibility, compactability, particle size, morphology, water uptake rate, and disintegration ability were studied. Moisture seemed to plasticize the disintegrants, reducing their yield pressures. However, certain optimum amount of moisture was found to be useful in increasing the compactablity of the tablets containing disintegrants. The tablets, however, lost their tensile strengths beyond this optimum moisture content. Moisture caused two brands of the disintegrants to swell; however, two other brands aggregated upon exposure to moisture. Swelling without aggregation increased the water uptake, and in turn the disintegrant performance. However, aggregation probably reduced the porosities of the disintegrants, reducing their water uptake rate and disintegrant performance. Different brands of <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium NF differed in the abilities to withstand the effects of moisture on their functionality. Effect of moisture on disintegrant performance of <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium NF needs to be considered before its use in tablets made by wet granulation.

40|$|The current {{monograph}} for <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium, NF {{does not}} specify tests that could assist in distinguishing between different brands of this disintegrant. The {{objective of this}} work {{was to examine the}} physical characteristics of four brands of <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium, NF and relate the observed differences to differences in their functionality. Significant differences were observed in the particle size, true density, porosity, surface area and morphology of the samples. Functionality tests, such as settling volume, intrinsic swelling, rate and extent of water uptake were carried out. Significant differences were observed in intrinsic swelling and the initial rate of water uptake. The disintegration times of the tablets were found to be a function of the initial rate of water uptake. Since the disintegration times were shown to be significantly different despite negligible differences in settling volumes, wicking and water uptake, as opposed to the magnitude of swelling, appear to be the major mechanisms that distinguish disintegration performance between different brands of <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium, NF when incorporated into insoluble tablet matrices. Thus, the measurement of the rate of water uptake may be a useful functionality test for <b>Polacrilin</b> Potassium in particular, and for ion exchange resin type disintegrants in general...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{particle}} size, pH of medium, and presence of lubricant on the swelling behaviour, water uptake properties and disintegrant performance of <b>polacrilin</b> potassium was examined. Particle size {{did not affect}} the bulk swelling of disintegrant particles when measured as settling volume, but increased the water uptake and decreased the disintegration time of tablets containing this disintegrant. An increase in the pH of the medium from acidic to neutral increased the bulk swelling of the particles, whereas it decreased water uptake and disintegrant performance. Addition of lubricant had no effect on settling volume, but decreased the water uptake rate and the disintegrant performance significantly. It is concluded that wicking, i. e. capillary action, rather than swelling, is the major factor that contributes to the disintegration behaviour of <b>polacrilin</b> potassium...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polacrilin</b> {{potassium}} (PP), an {{ion exchange}} resin, {{was used as}} a superdisintegrant to improve the dissolution of rifampicin, from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) based pellets prepared by extrusion-spheronization. Production of fast release pellets by extrusion-spheronization using MCC is a complicated process. In the present study, pellets were prepared containing 50 % w/w rifampicin (BCS class II drug) and 40 % w/w MCC as extrusion-spheronization aid. Different levels of PP and lactose ratio investigated were 0 : 10, 2 : 8, 4 : 6, 6 : 4, 8 : 2, and 10 : 0. Pellets were evaluated for yield, size, size distribution, shape, porosity, friability, residual moisture, and dissolution efficiency (DE) at 30 minutes. Incorporation of this novel superdisintegrant had no adverse effect on the mechanical and micromeritic characteristics of pellets. All the batches of pellets showed high yields′, ~ 90 %; narrow particle size distribution; aspect ratio, 1. 0 - 1. 1; friability, < 1 %; and porosity, 45. 51 - 49. 84 %. Dissolution profiles were compared using model-independent approaches; DE and similarity factor, f 2. Addition of <b>Polacrilin</b> results in significant improvement in the DE of rifampicin. The dissolution profiles were significantly different from the dissolution profile of pellets formulated without PP. This preliminary study indicates that PP can serve as an effective superdisintegrant in MCC pellets prepared by extrusion-spheronization...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} work was to enhance the solubility of Carvedilol by solid dispersion method and to formulate a mouth dissolving tablet. Drugs are more frequently taken by oral administration. The solubility of Carvedilol enhanced with different ratios of PVP by the solvent evaporation method. In-vitro release profile of solid dispersion obtained in SGF with out enzymes and Ph 6. 8 phosphate buffer indicate that 100 % drug release found within 20 min.

40|$|The present work employs recent {{advances}} in high-resolution real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the disintegration process of tablets containing disintegrants. A temporal resolution of 75 ms and a spatial resolution of 80 x 80 m with a section thickness of only 600 m were achieved. The histograms of MRI videos were quantitatively analyzed with MATLAB. The mechanisms of action of six commercially available disintegrants, the influence of relative tablet density, {{and the impact of}} disintegrant concentration were examined. Crospovidone seems to be the only disintegrant acting by a shape memory effect, whereas the others mainly swell. A higher relative density of tablets containing croscarmellose sodium leads to a more even distribution of water within the tablet matrix but hardly impacts the disintegration kinetics. Increasing the <b>polacrilin</b> potassium disintegrant concentration leads to a quicker and more thorough disintegration process. Real-time MRI emerges as valuable tool to visualize and investigate the process of tablet disintegration...|$|E
