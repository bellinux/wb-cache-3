40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on pressure screen and hydrocyclone performance. The general contradictory interrelationships between capacity and selectivity in pressure screening and cleaning are commonly recognized, but deep understanding of the effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the state of operation is missing. As separation selectivity is closely dependent on thickening and pulp passage, an operation curve for separation was applied and its application further developed to examine the parameters affecting pressure screen and hydrocyclone separation. New information was found on the geometry of the screen plate, furnish quality parameters in pressure screen fibre fractionation, and the hydrocyclone separation of fibres, sand and gases. The capacity increases achieved by changes in the wire screen plate geometry were found to be achieved at the cost of separation selectivity in <b>probability</b> <b>screening.</b> The capacity of the screen plate was affected by the flow on the screen plate and through it. The hydraulic resistance both in the forward and reverse flow directions was found to be of great importance for the capacity of the screen plate. Previously unreported knowledge was found regarding the effects of wire width, height and shape. Pressure screening capacity was found to decrease with increasing fibre length, fibre network strength and flocculation. Pressure screen fibre fractionation selectivity was increased by broadening of the fibre length distribution of the feed furnish. The furnish properties also affected the separation selectivity of fibres, sand and gases in the hydrocyclone. An increase in fibre network strength reduced the separation selectivity of the hydrocyclone separation of fibres and sand. Any increase in the specific surface area, and especially in the amount of fines, was found to make gas removal more challenging. It was concluded that a broader range of the specific surface distribution can increase the selectivity of fibre fractionation in the hydrocyclone. Knowledge of the general effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the performance of pressure screen and hydrocyclone separation was deepened as a result of this work, which provides a framework for studying these effects further in pursuit of the general {{objective of}} maximizing capacity and selectivity while minimizing energy and investment costs...|$|E

40|$|This study {{extends the}} work of Estrella and Mishkin (1996, 1998) to show that interest-rate spreads and probit {{modeling}} {{can be used to}} predict recessions in many states as well as the nation. State recessions are defined as two or more consecutive quarters of declining real gross state product. The yield spread, "SPREAD", is defined as the difference between the 10 -year Treasury bond rate and the three-month Treasury bill rate. The national results are similar to those obtained by Estrella and Mishkin. Probit models are estimated for all 50 states using SPREAD and unemployment insurance claims, "UI", as alternative explanatory variables. For 34 of the 50 states, SPREAD is significant at the 0. 01 level as a predictor of state recessions. Much weaker results are obtained using "UI". Simulations for the 1979 - 2001 period are used to compute loss functions for the national and state models at <b>probability</b> <b>screens</b> of 30, 40, 50, and 60 percent.

40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{the second}} leading {{cause of cancer death}} in the United States, and {{endoscopic}} screening can both detect and prevent cancer, but utilization is suboptimal and varies across geographic regions. We use multilevel regression to examine the various predictors of individuals' decisions to utilize endoscopic CRC screening. Study subjects are a 100 % population cohort of Medicare beneficiaries identified in 2001 and followed through 2005. The outcome variable is a binary indicator of any sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy use over this period. We analyze each state separately and map the findings for all states together to reveal patterns in the observed heterogeneity across states. Results We estimate a fully adjusted model for each state, based on a comprehensive socio-ecological model. We focus the discussion on the independent contributions of each of three community contextual variables that are amenable to policy intervention. Prevalence of Medicare managed care in one's neighborhood was associated with lower <b>probability</b> of <b>screening</b> in 12 states and higher probability in 19 states. Prevalence of poor English language ability among elders in one's neighborhood was associated with lower <b>probability</b> of <b>screening</b> in 15 states and higher probability in 6 states. Prevalence of poverty in one's neighborhood was associated with lower <b>probability</b> of <b>screening</b> in 36 states and higher probability in 5 states. Conclusions There are considerable differences across states in the socio-ecological context of CRC screening by endoscopy, suggesting that the current decentralized configuration of state-specific comprehensive cancer control programs is well suited to respond to the observed heterogeneity. We find that interventions to mediate language barriers are more critically needed in some states than in others. Medicare managed care penetration, hypothesized to affect information about and diffusion of new endoscopic technologies, has a positive association in only a minority of states. This suggests that managed care plans' promotion of this cost-increasing technology has been rather limited. Area poverty has a negative impact {{in the vast majority of}} states, but is positive in five states, suggesting there are some effective cancer control policies in place targeting the poor with supplemental resources promoting CRC screening. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNDThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare rates of {{screening}} mammography among immigrant women in five Asian American ethnic groups in California, and ascertain the extent to which differences in mammography rates among these groups are attributable to differences in known correlates of cancer screening. METHODSUsing 2009 data from the California Health Interview Survey, we compared the rates of mammography among Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese immigrants 40 years and older. To assess the impact of Asian ethnicity on participation in screening, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis with models that progressively adjusted for acculturation, socio-demographic characteristics, access to health care and breast cancer risk factors, and examined the predicted <b>probabilities</b> of <b>screening</b> after adjusting for these factors. FINDINGSParticipation in screening mammography differed according to ethnicity, with Filipina and Vietnamese Americans having the highest rates and Korean Americans having the lowest rates of lifetime and recent (past two years) screening. These differences decreased substantially after adjusting for acculturation, socio-demographic factors and risk factors of breast cancer but differences still remained, most notably for Korean Americans, who continued to have the lowest predicted <b>probability</b> of <b>screening</b> even after adjustment for these factors. CONCLUSIONSThis analysis draws attention to low mammography screening rates among Asian American immigrants, especially recent immigrants who lack health insurance. Given that their breast cancer incidence is rising with length of stay in the United States, it is very important to increase regular mammography screening in these groups.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three {{research projects}} on cancer <b>screening</b> <b>probability</b> modeling. Cancer <b>screening</b> {{is the primary}} technique for early detection. The goal of screening is to catch the disease early before clinical symptoms appear. In these projects, the three key parameters and lead time distribution were estimated to provide a statistical {{point of view on}} the effectiveness of cancer screening programs. In the first project, cancer <b>screening</b> <b>probability</b> model was used to analyze the computed tomography (CT) scan group in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) data. Three key parameters were estimated using Bayesian approach and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The NLST CT arm data have been used for the estimation. The sensitivity for lung cancer screening using CT scan is much higher than those screening using X-ray. The transition probability from disease-free to preclinical state has a peak around age 70 for both genders. The posterior mean sojourn time is around 1. 5 years for all groups. The second project is dealing with lead time distribution estimation. Since the lead time is unobservable, the effectiveness of screening exams regarding the survival benefits becomes a major concern. In this study, the estimates for the projected lead time was presented by using the NLST CT arm data. Simulation results show that the probability of no-early-detection increases monotonically when the screening interval increases for both genders. The mean lead time appears longer for women than for men. In previous study, it was assumed that a person has no screening history before entering the study. However, the participants of the screening programs are usually aged population and they may already have at least one prior screening exam in the past and look healthy. In the third project, we extended the previously developed lead time distribution to consider an individual 2 ̆ 7 s screening history and to see how much this history will affect the lead time. We did simulation for each combination of initial screening ages, sensitivities, mean sojourn times, current ages and screening schedules in the past and in the future. We also applied the newly developed lead time distribution to the NLST data...|$|R

Large sets of survey data regarding six suppliers in the electronic parts industry are gathered from over 150 purchasers and are analyzed through spreadsheet modeling of the fuzzy algorithm. The resulting decision support system allows supply chain managers to improve supplier selection decisions by applying fuzzy measures of criteria and associated beliefs across the dataset.

It analyzes {{the duration of the}} exhibition runs of movies released by distributors who owned no theaters in Singapore during 2002 and 2003 through a survival model. The estimation shows that films released by these distributors are exhibited for shorter periods in distributor-owned theaters than in independently owned (i. e., unintegrated) theaters, and in theaters that belong to large theater chains than in the theaters of small theater chains. A spatial aspect of competition among theaters with different owners is revealed in the finding that a film is more likely to stay on at the theater at a given time when an adjacent rival theater still runs the same title. The increase in the <b>probability</b> of <b>screen</b> survival due to the spatial rivalry is greater the nearer the competing theater.

Packaging has been recognized as a significant contributor to the product cost for such SoCs. To reduce packaging cost and the test cost for packaged chips, wafer-level testing (wafer sort) is used in the semiconductor industry to screen defective dies. However, since test time is a major practical constraint for wafer sort, even more so than for package test, not all the scan-based digital tests {{can be applied to the}} die under test. We present an optimal test-length selection technique for wafer-level testing of core-based SoCs. This technique, which is based on a combination of statistical yield modeling and integer linear programming, allows us to determine the number of patterns to use for each embedded core during wafer sort such that the <b>probability</b> of <b>screening</b> defective dies is maximized for a given upper limit on the SoC test time.

40|$|Temperature cycling {{and random}} {{vibration}} {{have proven to}} be the two most effective environmental stress screens. This study presents an extensive research on the physical quantification and optimization of temperature cycling and random vibration screens. For temperature cycling screen, a general model has been proposed to describe a typical temperature response cycle and a typical power-temperature response cycle. The least-squares parameter estimates for the two modified Arrhenius models are derived. Two general models for quantifying the equivalent aging acceleration factor of a typical temperature cycle with or without power cycling, considering both reaction rate stress and temperature change rate stress and also incorporating the temperature dependence of the activation energy, are derived. A closed form solution under the mixed-exponential life distribution assumption and an iteration equation solution under the Weibull distribution assumption, of the optimum number of temperature cycles for a specified post-screen field Mean Residual Life (MRL) goal, are established. For the random vibration screen, the distributions of the cumulative damage and fatigue life, under both stationary narrow-band and stationary wide-band random stressings, are derived under both-normal, semi-normal, and Markov-process assumptions. A bimodal mixed P-S-N diagram is proposed, from the failure physics point of view, to describe the fatigue strength of a non-screened unit. The concepts of the threshold S-N curve and the <b>screening</b> <b>probability</b> for fatigue defect precipitation are proposed to facilitate the quantification of random vibration screens. Finally, the closed form solution of the optimum vibration duration for a specified <b>screening</b> <b>probability</b> is derived under both-normal, semi-normal and Markov-process assumptions, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} (BE) {{patients are}} routinely screened for high grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) through endoscopic screening, during which multiple esophageal tissue samples are removed for histological analysis. We propose a computational method called the multistage clonal expansion for EAC (MSCE-EAC) screening model {{that is used}} for screening BE patients in silico to evaluate the effects of biopsy sampling, diagnostic sensitivity, and treatment on disease burden. Our framework seamlessly integrates relevant cell-level processes during EAC development with a spatial screening process to provide a clinically relevant model for detecting dysplastic and malignant clones within the crypt-structured BE tissue. With this computational approach, we retain spatio-temporal information about small, unobserved tissue lesions in BE that may remain undetected during biopsy-based screening but could be detected with high-resolution imaging. This allows evaluation of the efficacy and sensitivity of current screening protocols to detect neoplasia (dysplasia and early preclinical EAC) in the esophageal lining. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this model by predicting three important clinical outcomes: (1) the probability that small cancers are missed during biopsy-based screening, (2) the potential gains in neoplasia detection <b>probabilities</b> if <b>screening</b> occurred via high-resolution tomographic imaging, and (3) the efficacy of ablative treatments that result in the curative depletion of metaplastic and neoplastic cell populations in BE {{in terms of the}} long-term impact on reducing EAC incidence...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Early {{detection}} and preemptive treatment of patients at risk {{is of great}} importance in reducing the excess risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, {{it is unclear how}} much screening is cost-effective in RA. The objective is to assess whether CV screening in RA proves to be cost-effective from a medical perspective, using different scenarios based on different guidelines. METHODS: A Markov chain model was used with a time horizon of 10 years. Parameter values were mainly obtained from literature and from RA patients screened for CV diseases at the Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness expressed as costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed and described in willingness-to-pay curves; several scenarios were built. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, in 82 % of the simulations, screening proved to be dominant compared to no screening. The mean QALY gain was 0. 09 (95 % percentile - 0. 07, 0. 27), and the mean cost savings were euro- 1, 057 (95 % percentile -euro 2, 825, euro 333). Different scenarios showed small differences in cost-effectiveness; the <b>probability</b> that <b>screening</b> is dominant remained high with the lowest probability being 50 % for a very conservative scenario.

The composition-dependent metal-to-semiconductor transition in the pyrochlore system is mirrored by the progressive decrease with composition parameter in (i) the density of electronic states at the Fermi energy in UPS, (ii) the plasmon frequency in HREELS, and (iii) the <b>probability</b> of <b>screening</b> a Ru : 3 d core hole in XPS. These changes are too gradual in themselves to pinpoint the transition, but are generally consistent with transport and X-ray diffraction data that indicate a metal-to-nonmetal transition at x = 1. 55 mediated by an interplay between disorder and correlation-induced electron localization. Comparison of {{the results for the}} pyrochlores with those from RuO 2 suggest that the fine structure in the Ru : 3 d spectrum of the latter material, previously believed to arise from differing oxidation states at the surface, should in fact be attributed to final-state screening effects in a stoichiometric material.

Methods 2004 – 2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS) were used to calculate the probability of self-reported cancer screening by number of children for adult men and women with adjustment for age, sex, marital status, race, education, current smoking status, obesity status, health insurance and having a usual health-care provider. Results The largest percentage of persons who had cancer screening was among respondents with no children in the household. In multivariate results, the probability of endoscopy was lower for persons with one child (24 %) and two or more children (21 %) in comparison with persons with no children living in the household (30 %). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing was lower among men with one child (17 %) and two or more children (14 %) in comparison with no children (22 %).

40|$|Fish screens {{can help}} prevent the {{entrainment}} or injury of fish at irrigation diversions, but only when designed appropriately. Design criteria cannot simply be transferred between sites or pump systems {{and need to be}} developed using an evidence-based approach with the needs of local species in mind. Laboratory testing is typically used to quantify fish responses at intake screens, but often limits the number of species that can studied and creates artificial conditions not directly applicable to screens in the wild. In this study a field-based approach was used to assess the appropriateness of different screen design attributes for the protection of a lowland river fish assemblage at an experimental irrigation pump. Direct netting of entrained fish was used along with sonar technology to quantify the <b>probability</b> of <b>screen</b> contact for a Murray-Darling Basin (Australia) fish species. Two approach velocities (0. 1 and 0. 5 m. sec 21) and different sizes of woven mesh (5, 10 and 20 mm) were evaluated. Smaller fish (, 150 mm) in the assemblage were significantly more susceptible to entrainment and screen contact, especially at higher approach velocities. Mesh size appeared to have little impact on screen contact and entrainment, suggesting that approach velocity rather than mesh size {{is likely to be the}} primary consideration when developing screens. Until the effects of screen contacts on injury and survival of these species are better understood, it is recommended that approach velocities not exceed 0. 1 m. sec 21 when the desire is to protect the largest range of species and size classes for lowland river fish assemblages in the Murray-Darling Basin.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} graduate education on the career progression of Navy surface warfare officers. The probability of promotion to LCDR (O- 4), CDR (O- 5) and CAPT (O- 6) grades {{as well as the}} <b>probability</b> of <b>screening</b> for XO and CO are used as career progression milestones. The analysis {{examines the}} effect on career outcomes of a graduate education background in general, differences in the effect of holding a Navy-funded graduate degree versus a non-funded degree, and whether the funded degree was in a technical or non-technical curricula. The thesis also investigates the effect of utilization of graduate education on career progression. Finally, the thesis examines the determinants of who decides to pursue (or is chosen to attend) a funded graduate program. The results support the conclusion that officers who select (or are selected for) the graduate education program have stronger undergraduate backgrounds and stronger job performance early in their careers. These traits raise a question of selection bias, since officers who have graduate education may have been more likely to promote even if they did not have graduate education. A test for selection bias was developed and incorporated in the career progression models. The results indicate that a fully funded graduate degree has a positive effect on the selected measures of career progression. The probability of promotion to O- 6 was higher for officers who utilized their graduate degrees as an O- 5 compared to those who utilized earlier in their careers. Finally, officers with non-technical graduate majors had a higher probability of promoting than those with technical majors. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|R
40|$|A set of 8 {{multiplex}} real-time SYBR Green PCR (SG-PCR) assays including 3 target primers and {{an internal}} amplification control (IAC) primer was simultaneously evaluated in 3 [*]h or less {{with regard to}} detection of 24 target genes of 23 foodborne pathogens in 7 stool specimens of foodborne outbreak using a 96 -well reaction plate. This assay, combined with DNA extraction (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit), offered detection of greater than 103 - 104 foodborne pathogens per g in stool specimens. The products formed were identified using melting point temperature (Tm) curve analysis. This assay was evaluated {{for the detection of}} foodborne pathogens in 33 out of 35 cases of foodborne outbreak, using 4 different PCR instruments in 5 different laboratories. No interference from the multiplex real-time SG-PCR assay, including IAC, was observed in stool specimens in any analysis. We found multiplex real-time SG-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 24 target genes of foodborne pathogens to be comprehensive, rapid, inexpensive, accurate, of high selectivity, and good for <b>screening</b> <b>probability...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wafer-level testing (wafer sort) {{is used in}} the {{semiconductor}} industry to reduce packaging and test cost. However, a large number of wafer probe contacts leads to higher yield loss. Therefore, it is desirable that the number of chip pins contacted by tester channels during wafer sort be kept small to reduce the yield loss resulting from improper contacts. Since test time and the number of contacted chip pins are major practical constraints for wafer sort, not all scan-based digital tests {{can be applied to the}} die-under-test. We propose an optimization framework that addresses test access mechanism (TAM) optimization and test-length selection for wafer-level testing of core-based digital SoCs. The objective here is to design a TAM architecture and determine test-lengths for the embedded cores such that the overall SoC defect <b>screening</b> <b>probability</b> at wafer sort is maximized. Defect probabilities for the embedded cores, obtained using statistical yield modeling, are incorporated in the optimization framework. Simulation results are presented for five of the ITC’ 02 SoC Test benchmarks. I...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} whether acculturation {{was associated with}} the receipt of clinical breast examinations and mammograms among Colombian, Ecuadorian, Dominican, and Puerto Rican women aged 18 to 74 years in New York City in 1992. METHODS: A bilingual, targeted, random-digit-dialed telephone survey was conducted among 908 Hispanic women from a population-based quota sample. Outcome measures included ever and recent use of clinical breast examinations and mammograms. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of acculturation on screening use. RESULTS: When demographic, socioeconomic, and health system characteristics and cancer attitudes and beliefs were controlled for, women who were more acculturated had significantly higher odds of ever and recently receiving a clinical breast examination (P < or =. 01) and of ever (P < or =. 01) and recently (P < or =. 05) receiving a mammogram than did less acculturated women. For all screening measures, there was a linear increase in the adjusted <b>probability</b> of being <b>screened</b> as a function of acculturation. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood and health system interventions to increase screening among Hispanic women should target the less acculturated...|$|R
40|$|March 2002 This {{document}} has two purposes. First, it briefly {{reviews the}} construction of the weights for Wave One of the Three-City Study. Second, it summarizes the decisions of the Co-Principal Investigators in three areas of weight usage: (1) weight variance and trimming; (2) weight normalization; and (3) adjustment of variances of estimated quantities for the complex survey design. Construction of the Weights A full description of {{the construction of}} the weights can be found in Jones (2000). The sampling design and its scientific rationale can be found in Winston et al. (1999). Here we provide a relatively nontechnical summary. The unit of observation in the Three-City Study is a child age 0 - 4 or 10 - 14 years. Each unit has a constructed weight. Each is a product of four separate weights: W = (W 1) x (W 2) x (W 3) x (W 4) where W 1 = inverse of the probability that a dwelling unit (DU) was selected for screening W 2 = inverse of the <b>probability</b> that a <b>screened</b> eligible household was selected for the sampl...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom {{has voted}} {{to leave the}} European Union and, until {{the terms of the}} ‘Brexit’ are negotiated, this has led to {{considerable}} uncertainty over the future practice of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in the UK. Here we show that multiple obligations exist outside the scope of the EU which mean that EIA and SEA will continue to be required in the long-term, but that their future compliance with the Directives remains unclear. We consider three scenarios for Brexit and present the implications of each; these are: signing up to the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement; membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but not EEA, or negotiate a separate agreement. The implications of no longer being subjected to the obligations of the Directives under some scenarios are discussed and include opening the door for increasing diversity of application across the regions of the UK, and the <b>probability</b> of raised <b>screening</b> thresholds so as to reduce the burden of assessment on developers...|$|R
