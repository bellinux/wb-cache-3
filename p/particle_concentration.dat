By {{means of}} {{mechanical}} properties test and microstructure observation，the relationship between mechanical properties,microstructure graph of core-shell Ni/TiO 2 group <b>particles</b> <b>concentration</b> of EMR and different electric field, magnetic field or electric- magnetic field have been researched.

The {{dry deposition}} measurements were made with a smooth surrogate surface on an automated dry deposition sampler (Eagle II) and the ambient <b>particle</b> <b>concentrations</b> were measured with a dichotomous sampler. These long-term measurements were made in Chicago, IL, South Haven, MI, and Sleeping Bear Dunes, MI, from December 1993 through October 1995 {{as part of the}} Lake Michigan Mass Balance Study. In general, the dry deposition fluxes of elements were highly correlated with coarse <b>particle</b> <b>concentrations,</b> slightly less well correlated with total <b>particle</b> <b>concentrations,</b> and least well correlated with fine <b>particle</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The calculated overall dry deposition velocities obtained using coarse <b>particle</b> <b>concentrations</b> varied from approximately 12 cm s− 1 for Mg in Chicago to 0. 2 cm s− 1 for some primarily anthropogenic metals at the more remote sites. The velocities calculated using total <b>particle</b> <b>concentrations</b> were slightly lower.

25|$|However, the {{concentration}} of LDL particles, {{and to a lesser}} extent their size, has a stronger and consistent correlation with individual clinical outcome than the amount of cholesterol within LDL particles, even if the LDL-C estimation is approximately correct. There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), {{and to a lesser extent}} size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low. If LDL <b>particle</b> <b>concentration</b> is used to predict cardiovascular events, many other correlates of these clinical outcomes, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity and smoking, lose most of their predictive accuracy.|$|E
