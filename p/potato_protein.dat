In this research, the foaming behavior of <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> have been studied, using a commercial sample of <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> enriched in patatin (Laffort), intended for use as a fining agent in wine. The <b>potato</b> <b>proteins,</b> solubilized in buffers at different pH (3 - 7), were subjected to foaming by sparging N 2, air and CO 2, in the same conditions of pressure and time. The results showed a significant foam expansion (400 %) in samples in which N 2 and CO 2 were sparged. However, some differences were observed in foam stability. In particular, foam was very stable when produced with N 2 (40 %), less stable with air (30 %) and very unstable with CO 2 (10 %). Image analysis carried out on foams by a stereomicroscope and d 32 (Sauter mean diameter) measurements showed significant differences related {{to the nature of the}} sparged gas and the pH. In particular, the foam obtained with N 2 produced very small bubbles, with low polydispersity. Electrophoretic analyses of the proteins migrating into the foam revealed differences in protein patterns, especially in relation to the sparged gas, indicating that the nature of the dissolved gas affects the behavior of the different protein components. In conclusion, the patatin preparation here tested produces foams with stability and expansion which depend not only on the pH but also on the type of gas sparged in the liquid...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} pH and various {{additives}} on the precipitation and (re) solubility at pH 7 of <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> from industrial <b>potato</b> fruit juice (PFJ) were studied. The use of various strong and weak acids {{did not result}} in differences in protein precipitation, which on average occurred to a maximum of 60 % of total protein at pH 3. Weak acids did, however, result in precipitates with a higher resolubility at pH 7 compared with strong acids. At pH 5, addition of FeCl 3 or ZnCl 2 increased both precipitation and resolubility compared with the situation without additives. The largest increases in both precipitation and resolubility were achieved using organic solvents at pH 5 as an additive, resulting in a maximum precipitation and maximum resolubility at pH 7 of 91 and 83 % of total protein respectively. The results described in this study lead to the hypothesis that precipitation and resolubilisation of <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> from PFJ are not determined by their isoelectric pH but by their interactions with low-molecular-weight components. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|Consumers’ {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} healthiness and sustainability of food presents {{a great challenge}} to food industry to develop healthier, biologically active and sustainable food products. Bioactive peptides derived from food proteins are known to possess various biological activities. Among the activities, the most widely studied are antioxidant activities and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity related to blood pressure regulation and antihypertensive effects. Meanwhile, vast amounts of byproducts with high protein content are produced in food industry, for example potato and rapeseed industries. The utilization of these by-products could be enhanced by using them as a raw material for bioactive peptides. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the production of bioactive peptides with ACE inhibitory and antioxidant properties from rapeseed and <b>potato</b> <b>proteins.</b> Enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation were utilized for peptide production, ultrafiltration and solid-phase extraction were used to concentrate the active peptides, the peptides were fractionated with liquid chromatographic processes, and the peptides with the highest ACE inhibitory capacities were putified and analyzed with Maldi-Tof/Tof to identify the active peptide sequences. The bioavailability of the ACE inhibitory peptides was elucidated with an in vitro digestion model and the antihypertensive effects in vivo of rapeseed peptide concentrates were investigated with a preventive premise in 2 K 1 C rats. The results showed that rapeseed and <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> are rich sources of ACE inhibitory and antioxidant peptides. Enzymatic hydrolysis released the peptides effectively whereas fermentation produced lower activities. The native enzymes of potato were also able to release ACE inhibitory peptides from <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> without the addition of exogenous enzymes.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the major potato allergen patatin, Sol t 1, with IgE was investigated on a quantitative level {{as a function of}} heat treatment at different temperatures. On the basis of a number of publications, potato {{is considered to be a}} heat-labile allergen, but the molecular explanation for this behavior was not given. In this work, heat treatment of patatin in the absence and presence of other <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> mimicking the proteinaceous environment of the potato was studied. Using far-UV circular dichrosim spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry, the molecular transitions during heating of patatin were investigated. It was found that as long as patatin is not aggregated, denaturation of patatin on a secondary or tertiairy folding level is reversible with only a minor effect on the IgE affinity. Aggregation of patatin results in a nonreversible unfolding and a concomitant important decrease in affinity for IgE (25 -fold). Aggregation of patatin in the presence of other <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> results in a less condensed aggregate compared to the situation of isolated patatin, resulting in a more pronounced decrease of affinity for IgE (110 -fold). It is concluded that the heat lability of patatin-IgE interaction is explained by aggregation of patatin with other <b>potato</b> <b>proteins</b> rather than by denaturation of patatin itself.

The foam-forming properties of patatin could be strongly improved by partial unfolding of the protein. Whipping tests, at both low (0. 5 mg/mL) and high (10 mg/mL) protein concentration, also indicated that foams made with an ethanol-precipitated protein isolate were more stable than those made with β-casein and β-lactoglobulin. More generally, it can be concluded that when proteins are used as a foaming agent, a high concentration is required, because the protein available is inefficiently used. Also, there are several variables that may all, in different ways, affect both foam formation (amount of foam, bubbles size distribution) and foam stability.

Patatin is a protein that unfolds partly due to either heat or acid treatments. When the protein is highly structured {{at the start of a}} heat treatment (near-neutral pH), an apparent two-state thermal unfolding is observed. At low pH, when the starting conformation is already irreversibly unfolded to a certain extent, only minor changes occur upon heating.

In Exp. 1, 185 weanling pigs (initially 9. 7 Ib and 15. 5 d of age) were blocked by weight and gender and allotted in a randomized complete block design to one of five dietary treatments. The control diet was formulated to 1. 5 % lysine and. 42 % methionine and contained 3 % SDPP and 25 % dried whey.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to prepare protein-coated potato chips and {{evaluate}} type of proteins and storage time on the quality of final product. Potato slices were prepared, blanched, immersed in solu-tions of sodium caseinate, whey proteins concentrate (WPC), or egg white and deep-fried in a mixture of corn oil and commercial hydrogenated oil. Chips were packed and stored for different times. The results showed that sodium bisulphite in blanching solution improved binding of <b>proteins</b> to <b>potato</b> slices. <b>Protein</b> coating resulted in significantly lower oil uptake of potato chips. Coating potato chips with sodium caseinate, WPC and egg white proteins resulted in 14, 5 and 12 % reduction in oil uptake, respec-tively. Water retention and protein content significantly increased in protein-coated chips. Peroxide values increased with storage time in all samples. Protein-coated chips had a decrease in peroxide value between 30 to 50 %. Sensory evaluation of chips showed that at all storage time intervals, flavour of sodium caseinate-coated chips were more acceptable than non-coated, WPC or egg white protein-coated chips.

The experimental part deals with optimalization of methods needed for evaluation of antibacterial activities of selected substances. Optimized were methods of McFarland Turbidity Standards, Most-probable number method and Resazurin antibacterial assay. It was found that increase of optical density, measured by spectrometer at 620 nm, is in direct correlation with increase of bacterial suspension concentration (CFU/ml).
