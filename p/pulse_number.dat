In the past, several space-based laser missions have suffered from anomalous performance loss or even failure after short operation times. To mitigate the risks involved in these long-term operational conditions, a laser damage test bench has been developed and is operated at the German Aerospace Establishment to test laser optics in the IR, VIS, and in the UV spectral range. The testing is performed under application oriented conditions, i. e. under high-vacuum using dry pump systems. The main goal of the test campaign is to identify the critical components {{in terms of their}} laser damage threshold for very high <b>pulse</b> <b>numbers</b> applied per site. Characteristic damage curves according to ISO 11 254 are evaluated for each component under investigation for up to 10 000 shots per site.

The {{aim of this study}} was to observe the effect of ArF laser on the dental hard tissues. Materials and Methods: For this research human molar teeth with no caries or dental restoration and enamel cracks were used. Irradiation laser energies were taken 95, 70 and 50 mJ for enamel and 80, 70 and 50 mJ for dentine. Then, for each of energy values <b>pulse</b> <b>numbers</b> (repetition rate) were adjusted at 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1500.

Results: For each energy value, the ablation dimension increased by increasing <b>pulse</b> <b>numbers.</b> Ablation depth in dentine was more than that of for enamel.
