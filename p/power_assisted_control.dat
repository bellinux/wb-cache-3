25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>control</b> system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E

Paper clarifies regarding generalised structure of Force-Sensor-less <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> using two force observer. The Force, {{which is used to}} <b>assist</b> the <b>control</b> system is estimated by using encoders instead of using force-sensors. This Paper also compares other FSPAC’s with the FSPAC using two observer methodology.

40|$|Recently, <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suits which support human {{physical}} activities have been researched. We {{are developing a}} <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit for workers in a nuclear power plant. If a 	disaster happens, the workers have to wear heavy radiation protective equipment.

40|$|The {{fuel cell}} powered vehicle {{is one of}} the most {{attractive}} candidates for the future due to its high efficiency and capability to use hydrogen as the fuel. However, its relatively poor dynamic response, high cost, and limited life time have impeded its widespread adoption. With the emergence of large supercapacitors (also know as ultracapacitors, UCs) with high power density and the shift to hybridization in the vehicle technology, fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid fuel cell vehicles are gaining more attention. Fuel cells in conjunction with supercapacitors can create high power with fast dynamic response, which makes it well suitable for automotive applications. Hybrid fuel cell vehicles with different powertrain configurations have been evaluated based on simulations performed at the Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California-Davis. The following powertrain configurations have been considered: (a) Direct hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) without energy storage (b) FCVs with supercapacitors directly connected in parallel with fuel cells (c) FCVs with supercapacitors coupled in parallel with fuel cells through a DC/DC converter (d) FCVs with fuel cells connected to supercapacitors via a DC/DC converter Simulation results show that hybridization of fuel cell vehicles with supercapacitors with load leveling control can significantly reduce the stress on fuel cells electrically and mechanically and benefit fuel economy of the vehicles. Compared to fuel cell vehicles without energy storages, fuel cell-supercapacitor hybridization achieved fuel economy increases of up to 28 % on the FUDS cycle and up to 24 % on the US 06 cycle for mid-size passenger vehicles. In general, the maximum fuel economy improvements are greater using supercapacitors than batteries. The simulation results show that the <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> strategy is better than load-level control for batteries because of the lower losses in the DC/DC converter and batteries, but load level control is better for supercapacitors. The best approach for hybridization of the fuel cell vehicles is to use supercapacitors with load leveled control as it greatly mitigates the stress on fuel cells and results in a near maximum improvement in fuel economy and fuel cell durability.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to design new control strategies to improve safety, robustness, smoothness in human-robot interaction and performances such as speed response, maximum and precision end effector force production for <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> robots. <b>Power</b> <b>assist</b> robots are rising in interest for three main reasons. <b>Power</b> <b>assist</b> devices increase performances such as muscle strength and endurance for workers, wild land firefighters, and soldiers. <b>Power</b> <b>assist</b> devices support elderly and disabled people. Rehabilitation process and physical training carried out {{with the use of}} <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> devices {{have been shown to be}} faster, more intense, more motivational via audiovisual feedback and game mode, and easier reproducible do to quantitative outcome measurements. Although big progresses have been done in recent years, there are still three main challenging aspects where more investigation and innovative solutions are needed: safety for the user and the surrounding environment, a more comfortable interaction in a human-friendly way, increase in performances such as response, force production and energy efficiency. Most of the ongoing researches focus on mechanical and control design with a pure engineering approach, neglecting the inspiration from nature. Biologically inspired robotics is a process that goes beyond merely copying what nature shows at first sight. It involves three phases: observation and understanding nature, design robots embedding the desired nature functionalities, and finally implementation and development. Understanding humans and animal functionalities and the consequent implementation on robot applications has shown to improve robot performances such as robustness, safety, and flexibility in a variety of complex dynamic tasks. In order to improve performances of <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> robots, in this work biological motion control and actuation mechanism of humans and animals play the inspirational roles. Regarding the biological inspiration for motion control, humans and animals high vary impedance of their body to stabilize unstable dynamics. On the basis of this a new approach to force <b>control</b> for <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> devices [...] Force Sensor-less <b>Power</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>Control</b> (FSPAC) with Variable Impedance [...] is proposed. The proposed FSPAC with Variable Impedance is successfully implementation on an experimental door actuated by either a linear motor (low friction stem) or by a rotational motor and a balls-crew (high friction system). Comparison with traditional FSPAC is carried out. The superiority of the proposed FSPAC with Variable Impedance in respect to the traditional FPAC with Constant Impedance, in terms of safety, robustness and smooth assistance are experimentally shown. As for the biological inspiration for actuation mechanism design, humans and animals presents bi-articular muscles [...] muscles that span joints [...] which play a fundamental role for mechanical energy transfer, impedance modulation and stabilization of human and animal dynamics. In the design of bi-articularly actuated robots, our focus is on the resolution of the redundancy actuation. Two new approaches [...] the Infinity Norm and the Non Linear Phase Different Control (NLPDC) [...] are proposed. A human-like actuated robot named BiWi [...] Bi-articularly actuated Wi-re driven robot arm [...] is developed and used as an experimental apparatus to compare the two proposed redundancy resolution approach with the three traditional approaches [...] Phase Different Control (PDC), Pseudo inverse matrix, and Linear Programming. The proposed infinity norm approach allows the arm to produce greater end effector force compared the traditional pseudo-inverse matrix approach. The proposed infinity norm approach is suitable to increase the performances of any system with three inputs and two outputs. The NLPDC approach increases the output force precision compared to the PDC approach, and requires less computation compared with the Linear Programming approach. Moreover, the NLPDC allows the independent design of common and different modes for robot arms actuated by three pairs of antagonistic actuators, consisting of four mono- and two bi-articular actuators couple in antagonistic pairs. In addition, the NLPDC approach is the only method capable of calculating in a precise way at the maximum output force that can be produce at the end effector of a bi-articularly actuated robot arm given the desired output force direction, with a closed form equation. 報告番号: 甲 27503; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 7589 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|R

We have been developing a powered exoskeleton {{that is supposed}} to be used in case of a nuclear hazard.

Unfortunately, the former suffers from the decline in measuring accuracy or slips of EMG sensor by sweating.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cellular}} telephone success story prompts the wireless communications community to turn {{its attention to}} other information services, {{many of them in}} the category of “wireless data ” communications. One lesson of {{cellular telephone}} network operation is that effective power control is essential to promote system quality and efficiency. In recent we have applied microeconomic theories to power control taking into account notions of utility and pricing. Our earlier work has shown that this new approach to power control for wireless data performs better than traditional techniques applied for voice signals. However, the operating points of such a strategy result in an unfair equilibrium in that users operate with unequal signal-to-interference ratios. Further, the power control algorithms required to achieve such operating points are more complex than the simple signal-to-interference ratio balancing algorithms for voice.
