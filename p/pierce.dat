5|$|<b>Pierce</b> {{was married}} to Florene Lyons <b>Pierce</b> for 17 years and they had three children: Pamula <b>Pierce</b> Barcelou, Charles Bryant <b>Pierce</b> Jr., and Amanda <b>Pierce</b> Squitiero, along with six grandchildren. <b>Pierce</b> briefly married Cindy Butler, who {{appeared}} in a role in his film The Town That Dreaded Sundown; they also later divorced. He later married Beth Pulley, gaining two stepdaughters: Betsy Mathis Gillespie and Melissa Mathis Daley, and three step-grandchildren. <b>Pierce</b> was {{a fan of the}} Arkansas Razorbacks, the University of Arkansas college sports teams.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of Boggy Creek, <b>Pierce</b> was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted {{because he wanted to}} prove himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said <b>Pierce</b> liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. <b>Pierce</b> followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for <b>Pierce</b> to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to <b>Pierce,</b> Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. <b>Pierce</b> co-wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. <b>Pierce</b> made a trademark of casting his friends in his films, and <b>Pierce</b> himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, <b>Pierce</b> continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E
5|$|As the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked <b>Pierce</b> {{to run as}} a {{compromise}} candidate that could unite the fractured party, but <b>Pierce</b> refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, <b>Pierce</b> backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were soundly defeated for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, <b>Pierce</b> looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing {{to the people of}} Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{specialized}} cartilage piercings have since become popular. These include the tragus <b>piercing,</b> antitragus <b>piercing,</b> rook <b>piercing,</b> industrial <b>piercing,</b> helix <b>piercing,</b> orbital <b>piercing,</b> daith <b>piercing,</b> and conch <b>piercing.</b> In addition, earlobe stretching, while common in indigenous cultures {{for thousands of}} years, {{began to appear in}} Western society in the 1990s, and is now a fairly common sight. However, these forms of ear <b>piercing</b> are still infrequent compared to standard ear <b>piercing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The navel <b>piercing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common body piercings today. Popular culture has played a large role in the {{promotion}} of this <b>piercing.</b> The navel <b>piercing</b> first hit the mainstream when model Christy Turlington showed her navel <b>piercing</b> at a fashion show in London in 1993. The popularization of the <b>piercing,</b> however, is accredited to the 1993 Aerosmith music video for their song [...] "Cryin'," [...] wherein Alicia Silverstone has her navel <b>pierced</b> by body <b>piercer</b> Paul King. The easy concealment of a navel <b>piercing</b> with clothing, even during the healing process, has contributed to the widespread adoption of this <b>piercing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nose <b>piercing</b> is the <b>piercing</b> of {{the skin}} or {{cartilage}} which forms {{any part of the}} nose, normally for the purpose of wearing jewelry, called a Nose-jewel. Among the different varieties of nose piercings, the nostril <b>piercing</b> is the most common. Nose <b>piercing</b> is the second most common variety of <b>piercing</b> after earlobe <b>piercing.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1824, New Hampshire was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill {{laying the groundwork for}} a party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National Republicans), who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin <b>Pierce,</b> won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger <b>Pierce</b> had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin <b>Pierce,</b> voting him out of office, but Franklin <b>Pierce</b> won his first election: Hillsborough town moderator, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>piercing</b> gun: The vast {{majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears <b>pierced</b> with a <b>piercing</b> gun. The safety of <b>piercing</b> guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for <b>piercing</b> body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that <b>piercing</b> guns not be used for any <b>piercing,</b> requiring members to agree not to use <b>piercing</b> guns in their practice.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piercing</b> {{guns are}} widely criticized {{in the body}} <b>piercing</b> community. Shannon Larratt, editor and {{publisher}} of BME and a vocal critic of the <b>piercing</b> gun, penned an essay titled <b>Piercing</b> guns are blasphemy!, where he described the <b>piercing</b> gun as an inherently flawed, dangerous instrument that should never be used. Larratt also printed T-shirts which featured an image of a <b>piercing</b> gun with a red circle and line through it, to mean No <b>Piercing</b> Guns. BME also published an article titled Do <b>Piercing</b> Guns Suck?.|$|R

5|$|Charles B. <b>Pierce</b> {{was born}} in Hammond, Indiana on June 16, 1938, one of three boys born to Mack McKenny <b>Pierce</b> and Mayven Bryant <b>Pierce.</b> His family moved to the southwestern Arkansas city of Hampton {{when he was just}} a few months old. There he was a {{childhood}} friend and neighbor of future film and television director Harry Thomason, and the two made home movies together in their backyards using an old 8 mm camera. His first professional foray into media entertainment was in the mid-1960s as an art director at KTAL-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana. He later became a weatherman and hosted a children's cartoon show for that channel.|$|E

50|$|The Christina <b>piercing</b> is {{a surface}} <b>piercing,</b> {{situated}} on {{the lower part of}} the mons pubis where the outer labia meet. It is similar to the Nefertiti <b>piercing,</b> that can be seen as a combination between vertical clitoral hood <b>piercing</b> and Christina <b>piercing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In males, {{chastity}} <b>piercing</b> can {{be performed}} several ways.

50|$|A jestrum <b>piercing,</b> {{also known}} as a {{vertical}} medusa, is an upper lip <b>piercing</b> that is very similar to a labret <b>piercing,</b> or more specifically a vertical labret <b>piercing.</b> It is placed in the philtrum of the upper lip, directly under the nasal septum. Unlike the similar medusa <b>piercing,</b> a jestrum <b>piercing</b> uses a curved bar-bell, and both ends of the <b>piercing</b> are visible externally with {{the lower part of the}} bar-bell curving around the underside of the upper lip. Sometimes it is combined with a lower labret <b>piercing</b> to form a symmetrical look.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, <b>Pierce</b> {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. <b>Pierce,</b> meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. <b>Pierce</b> returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, <b>Pierce</b> would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E
5|$|Franklin <b>Pierce</b> (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57). <b>Pierce</b> was a {{northern}} Democrat {{who saw the}} abolitionist movement as a fundamental threat to {{the unity of the}} nation. His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing to stem conflict between North and South setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War. Historians and other scholars generally rank <b>Pierce</b> among the worst of U.S. Presidents.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, <b>Pierce</b> {{was honored}} at the Little Rock Film Festival, where festival {{producers}} screened a retrospective of his films, and {{presented him with}} a Lifetime Achievement Award. Also that year, the festival's best film award was renamed in his honor to the Charles B. <b>Pierce</b> Award for Best Film Made in Arkansas, In October 2009, the Arkansas Arts Council honored <b>Pierce</b> with the Judges' Special Recognition Award at the Governor's Arts Awards ceremony in Hot Springs. <b>Pierce</b> {{died of natural causes}} on March 5, 2010 at the Signature Care nursing home in Dover, Tennessee, where he had moved a few years earlier. He was 71. <b>Pierce</b> directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years. He was considered one of the first modern independent filmmakers, and was credited with breaking new ground for other independent filmmakers, particularly for the Arkansas film industry.|$|E
50|$|A navel <b>piercing</b> (also {{referred}} to as a belly button <b>piercing</b> or an umbilical dip <b>piercing)</b> is a type of <b>piercing</b> located in, or around, the navel. It may heal quickly and with no problems, like an ear <b>piercing,</b> or may heal more like a surface <b>piercing</b> with the associated extended healing time. Healing usually takes less than six months, and {{as long as it is}} cleaned, it will heal nicely. Unlike most surface piercings, this is one of the few that do not normally reject, although the rejection rate is higher than non-surface piercings, such as ear <b>piercing.</b> The actual navel is not <b>pierced</b> when a navel <b>piercing</b> is performed. The most common form of navel <b>piercing</b> is through the upper rim of the navel.|$|R
50|$|A {{clitoral}} hood <b>piercing</b> is {{a female}} genital <b>piercing</b> through the clitoral hood surrounding the clitoris. There {{are two main}} types of hood <b>piercing,</b> the vertical clitoral hood <b>piercing</b> and the horizontal clitoral hood <b>piercing.</b> As the name indicates, the difference is in the direction the <b>piercing</b> is oriented in the skin above the clitoris. Neither of these piercings penetrates the clitoris itself.|$|R
50|$|A bridge <b>piercing</b> is {{a facial}} <b>piercing</b> {{through the skin}} {{on the bridge of}} the nose, usually {{directly}} between the eyes of the wearer. A variation on this <b>piercing,</b> the vertical bridge <b>piercing</b> is a surface <b>piercing,</b> with all of the risks or potential complications related to surface piercings.|$|R
5|$|In {{his first}} seasons with White Sox, Pierce's control {{problems}} continued; his 137 walks in 1950 tied {{him for the}} fourth most ever by an AL left-hander. But those seasons also included indications of his developing excellence, {{as well as the}} struggles he would face in gaining run support. On May 29, 1949, in just his sixth start with Chicago (and the 11th of his career), the 22-year-old <b>Pierce</b> was matched against 42-year-old Negro league legend Satchel Paige in a road game against the defending World Series champion Cleveland Indians. The pitchers' duel went into the 11th inning, when <b>Pierce</b> walked leadoff hitter Ken Keltner, followed by two bunt singles. After <b>Pierce</b> was replaced by a reliever and the next batter lined to shortstop Luke Appling, Lou Boudreau singled to give Cleveland a 2–1 win; <b>Pierce</b> had himself scored Chicago's only run after singling in the eighth inning. And on June 15, 1950 against the World Series champion Yankees, <b>Pierce</b> got his first career shutout – a 5–0 one-hitter, interrupted by rain delays in the second, fourth and fifth innings totaling over an hour and a half, with the only hit being Billy Johnson's single in the fifth inning.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} two seasons with Chicago, <b>Pierce</b> posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen contributed to his {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in the sixth inning or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, <b>Pierce</b> was seen to be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, <b>Pierce</b> broke Ed Walsh's White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} will, which he signed January 22, 1868, <b>Pierce</b> left {{a large number}} of {{specific}} bequests such as paintings, swords, horses, and other items to friends, family, and neighbors. Much of his $72,000 estate (equal to $ today) went to his brother Henry's family, and to Hawthorne's children and Pierce's landlady. Henry's son Frank <b>Pierce</b> received the largest share.|$|E
50|$|The Isabella <b>piercing</b> {{was first}} {{documented}} in issue 17 of <b>Piercing</b> World Magazine. As an Isabella <b>piercing</b> intersects {{the shaft of}} the clitoris, it {{is considered to be}} high risk for nerve damage and is therefore extremely rare. Like other female genital piercings, the Isabella <b>piercing</b> is anatomy-dependent. Nerve damage can result from <b>piercing</b> a clitoris that is too small or from <b>piercing</b> through the shaft of the clitoris and through the dorsal nerve. <b>Piercing</b> through the shaft of the clitoris can also result in excessive bleeding and blood loss to the clitoris. Healing time is 2-3 months. The Nefertiti <b>piercing</b> was invented in response to the inherent dangers involved with the Isabella <b>piercing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to focus the {{awareness}} of complications of oral <b>piercing</b> among a group of adolescents and young Italian adults with intraoral piercings. Material and Methods: A total of 225 teenagers were asked to complete a questionnaire on the awareness of complications of oral <b>piercing.</b> An additional questionnaire was administered in case of oral <b>piercing</b> worn, based on site <b>piercing,</b> knowledge about <b>piercer</b> license, oral and systemic risks due to oral <b>piercing,</b> disinfection and sterilization of the material <b>pierced,</b> information by the <b>piercer</b> about <b>piercing</b> hygiene maintenance and post-piercing dentist check-up. After questionnaire all partecipants received a brochure with some information about risks and maintenance mode of <b>piercing.</b> Results: Data revealed that more than 50 % of teens surveyed was found to wear a <b>piercing.</b> Only 25. 3 % was aware of the risk of HCV cross-infection and only 17. 3 % reported of knowledge about risk of endocarditis. Only 17 % checked the <b>piercer</b> license and only 18 % sterilization and disinfection of the materials used. 53. 7 % did not received explanations about the risks associated with <b>piercing.</b> With regard to the maintenance mode of the <b>piercing,</b> it has been suggested to brush the <b>piercing</b> bar in 17 % of cases. The post <b>piercing</b> specialist visits have been suggested only in 7 % of cases. Conclusions: The general lack of awareness of complications and maintenance mode related to oral <b>piercing</b> needs to be addressed by some education programs performed at school and by dentists...|$|R
50|$|A tragus <b>piercing</b> is the {{perforation}} of the tragus, which projects {{immediately in}} front of the ear canal, for the purpose of inserting and wearing a piece of jewelry. The <b>piercing</b> itself is usually made with a small gauge hollow <b>piercing</b> needle, and typical jewelry would be a small diameter captive bead ring or small gauge post style <b>piercing</b> jewelry. A related <b>piercing</b> is known as the antitragus <b>piercing.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jane <b>Pierce</b> died of {{tuberculosis}} in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. <b>Pierce</b> was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in May 1864; {{he was with}} Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to <b>Pierce.</b> Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. <b>Pierce</b> grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.|$|E

2500|$|Ear <b>piercing</b> instruments, {{sometimes}} called ear-piercing guns, were originally developed for physician use but with modifications became available in retail settings. Today [...] {{more and more}} people in the Western world have their ears <b>pierced</b> with an ear <b>piercing</b> instrument in specialty jewellery or accessory stores, or at home using disposable ear <b>piercing</b> instruments. An earlobe <b>piercing</b> performed with an ear <b>piercing</b> instrument is often described as feeling similar to being pinched, or being snapped by a rubber band. <b>Piercing</b> with this method, especially for cartilage piercings, is not recommended by many <b>piercing</b> professionals and physicians, as it can cause blunt force trauma to the skin, and takes far longer to heal than needle <b>piercing.</b> In addition, the vast majority of ear <b>piercing</b> instruments are made of plastic, which means they can never be truly sterilized by use of an Autoclave, increasing chance of infection exponentially. In the case of cartilage <b>piercing,</b> doing it with an ear <b>piercing</b> instrument can shatter the ear cartilage and lead to serious complications.|$|R
