5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} {{largely due to}} U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis.

5|$|Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, {{had begun}} by 1801 {{to the east}} of Old Mill. It was the same height as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex. Decker Mill was {{completed}} in time to exploit the economic boom in the cotton trade that followed the brief <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war with France from 1802–1803. During its construction, the steam engine was replaced a more powerful 40hp Boulton and Watt engine.|$|E
5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid.

5|$|Mary strived for <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Charles paid no {{attention}} to the problems she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to wage war against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.|$|E

Meanwhile, an International Commission formed by the Great Powers to secure stability and <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.|$|E

5|$|As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony {{maintained}} {{a distance from}} politics throughout {{the reign of the}} new monarch, RadamaII, instead preferring to focus on his military responsibilities. Meanwhile, disputes between Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and King Radama grew frequent as the young sovereign pursued radical reforms that had begun to foment displeasure among the traditional masses. The situation came to a head on 7 May 1863, when Radama insisted on legalizing duels, despite widespread concern among the king's advisers that the innovation would lead to anarchy. The Prime Minister initiated the arrest of the menamaso, the prince's influential advisers, while Rainilaiarivony enacted his brother's instructions to keep the <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital city. However, the situation deteriorated in dramatic fashion and, by the morning of 12 May, King RadamaII was declared dead, having been strangled on the Prime Minister's orders.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} a loan and a {{guarantee}} of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying to expand into Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.|$|E

However, the attack was repulsed by a handful of men. A month later, on November 28, Sweden and Poland made <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Warsaw through the Warsaw Confederation which {{increased}} Sweden's position even further. Charles could now march, after having waited more than a year since Augustus was dethroned, against the Russian army under Ogilvy which had already by this time reached Grodno.|$|E

Benjamin More, a justice of the <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia, argued that the repeal of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution. Below, a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More, interpreted the repeal act prospectively, and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office.|$|E
5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters {{make it clear that}} by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to help make <b>peace.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E
5|$|The Huns {{destroyed}} Drobeta and Sucidava in the 440s, but the forts were restored under Emperor Justinian I (527565). Eastern Roman coins {{from the}} first half of the 6thcentury suggest a significant military presence in Olteniaa region also characterized by the predominance of pottery with shapes of Roman tradition. Although Eastern Roman emperors made annual payments to the neighboring peoples in an attempt to keep the <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, the Avars regularly invaded Scythia Minor from the 580s. The Romans abandoned Sucidava in 596 or 597, but Tomis, which was the last town in Scythia Minor to resist the invaders, only fell in 704.|$|E
