We show that the resonant behavior characteristic of type II excitability, already described for harmonic inputs, is also present for <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs.</b> With this in mind, we study {{the response of}} neurons to pulsed input trains whose frequency varies continuously in time, and observe that the receiving neuron synchronizes episodically to the input pulses, whenever the pulse frequency lies within the neuron's locking range. We propose this behavior as a mechanism of rate-code detection in neuronal populations.

Measurements were carried out in a secondary channel, the Loosahatchie Chute, in which rock dikes were constructed in the 1960 s to keep most flow in the main navigation channel. In 2008 – 2009, the dikes were notched to allow more flow into the secondary channel. Study sites were established based on relative distance downstream of the notched dikes. Additionally, a reference site was established north of the Loosahatchie Chute where the dikes remained unnotched. We compared various components of vegetation composition and productivity at sites in the riparian wetlands for two years. Salix nigra had the highest Importance Value at every site. Species with minor Importance Values were Celtis laevigata, Acer rubrum, and Plantanus occidentalis. Productivity increased more following the introduction of river water in affected sites compared to the reference. Aboveground net primary productivity was highest at the reference site (2926 ± 458. 1 g·m− 2 ·year− 1), the intact site; however, there were greater increase at the sites in the Loosahatchie Chute, where measurements ranged from 1197. 7 ± 160. 0 g m− 2 ·year− 1 ·to 2874. 2 ± 794. 0 g·m− 2 ·year− 1.

While it is well established that glacial ablation and snowmelt regulate stream discharge, linkage among streams and streamwater geochemistry, the controls of these factors on stream microbial biofilms remain insufficiently understood. We investigated glacial (metakryal, hypokryal), groundwater-fed (krenal) and snow-fed (rhithral) streams - all of them representative for alpine stream networks - and present evidence that these hydrologic and hydrogeochemical factors differentially affect sediment microbial biofilms. Average microbial biomass and bacterial carbon production were low in the glacial streams, whereas bacterial cell size, biomass, and carbon production {{were higher in the}} tributaries, most notably in the krenal stream. Whole-cell in situ fluorescence hybridization revealed reduced detection rates of the Eubacteria and higher abundance of α- Proteobacteria in the glacial stream, a pattern that most probably reflects the trophic status of this ecosystem. Our data suggest low flow during the onset of snowmelt and autumn as a short period (hot moment) of favorable environmental conditions with <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs</b> of allochthonous nitrate and dissolved organic carbon, and with disproportionately high microbial growth. Tributaries are relatively more constant and favorable environments than kryal streams, and serve as possible sources of microbes and organic matter to the main glacial channel during periods (e. g., snowmelt) of elevated hydrologic linkage among streams.

The present work looks in some detail at the dynamics of the bi-fan motif, using systems of ordinary differential equations to model the populations of transcription factors, mRNA and protein, with the aim of extending our understanding of what appear to be important building blocks of gene network structure. Results We develop an ordinary differential equation model of the bi-fan motif and analyse variants of the motif corresponding to its behaviour under various conditions. In particular, we examine the effects of different steady and <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs</b> to five variants of the bifan motif, based on evidence in the literature of bifan motifs found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commonly known as baker's yeast). Using this model, we characterize the dynamical behaviour of the bi-fan motif {{for a wide range of}} biologically plausible parameters and configurations. We find that there is no characteristic behaviour for the motif, and with the correct choice of parameters and of internal structure, very different, indeed even opposite behaviours may be obtained. Conclusion Even with this relatively simple model, the bi-fan motif can exhibit a wide range of dynamical responses. This suggests that it is difficult to gain significant insights into biological function simply by considering the connection architecture of a gene network, or its decomposition into simple structural motifs. It is necessary to supplement such structural information by kinetic parameters, or dynamic time series experimental data, both of which are currently difficult to obtain. </p...|$|E
40|$|The coastal {{northern}} Adriatic Sea receives <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs</b> of riverine nutrients, causing phytoplankton blooms and seasonally sustained dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) accumulation—hypothesized to cause episodes ofmassivemucilage. The underlying mechanisms regulating P and C cycles and their coupling are unclear. Extensive biogeochemical parameters, processes and community composition were measured in a 64 -daymesocosms deployed off Piran, Slovenia. We followed the temporal trends of C and P fluxes in P-enriched (P+) and unenriched (P−) mesocosms. An intense diatom bloom developed then crashed; however, substantial primary production was maintained throughout, supported by tightly coupled P regeneration by bacteria and phytoplankton. Results provide novel insights on post-bloom C and P dynamics and mechanisms. 1) Post-bloom DOC accumulation to 186 μM remained elevated despite high bacterial carbon demand. Presumably, {{a large part of}} DOC accumulated due to the bacterial ectohydrolytic processing of primary productivity that adventitiously generated slow-to-degrade DOC; 2) bacteria heavily colonized post-bloom diatom aggregates, rendering them microscale hotspots of P regeneration due to locally intense bacterial ectohydrolase activities; 3) Pi turnover was rapid thus suggesting high P flux through the DOP pool (dissolved organic phosphorus) turnover; 4) Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria dominated the bacterial communities despite great differences of C and P pools and fluxes in both mesocosms. However,minor taxa showed dramatic changes in community compositions. Major OTUs were presumably generalists adapted to diverse productivity regimes. We suggest that variation in bacterial ectohydrolase activities on aggregates, regulating the rates of POM→DOM transition as well as dissolved polymer hydrolysis, could become a bottleneck in P regeneration. This could be another regulatory step, in addition to APase, in the microbial regulation of P cycle and the coupling between C and P cycles...|$|E

The terrigenous component has been extracted from 57 bulk sediment samples at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 925 and 929 on Ceara Rise to obtain a Cenozoic record of riverine discharge from northern South America. From the early Eocene to early Miocene (55 - 20 Ma), terrigenous accumulation was dominated by moderate amounts of generally large-grained, gray to green sediment especially depleted in elements that are enriched in post-Archaean shale (e. g. Cs, Th, Yb). However, <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs</b> of relatively small-grained, gray to green terrigenous sediment less depleted in the above elements occurred in the late Eocene and Oligocene. The accumulation of terrigenous sediment decreased significantly until 16. 5 Ma. In the middle Miocene (16. 5 - 13 Ma), terrigenous accumulation was dominated by small amounts of small-grained, tan sediment notably depleted in Na and heavy rare earth elements. The accumulation rate of terrigenous sediment increased markedly from the latest Miocene (10 Ma) to the present day, a change characterized by deposition of gray-green sediment enriched in elements that are enriched in post-Archaean shale. Observed changes in terrigenous sediment at Ceara Rise record tectonism and erosion in northern South America. The Brazil and Guyana shields supplied sediment to the eastern South American margin until the middle Miocene (20 - 16. 5 Ma) when a period of thrusting, shortening and uplift changed the source region, probably first to highly weathered and proximal Phanerozoic sediments. By the late Miocene (9 Ma), there was a transcontinental connection between the Andes and eastern South America.

40|$|Deep-sea benthic {{ecosystems}} are sustained largely by organic matter settling from the euphotic zone. These fluxes {{usually have a}} more or less well-defined seasonal component, often with two peaks, one in spring/early summer, the other later in the year. Long time-series datasets suggest that inter-annual variability in the intensity, timing and composition of flux maxima is normal. The settling material may form a deposit of phytodetritus on the deep-seafloor. These deposits, which are most common in temperate and high latitude regions, particularly the North Atlantic, evoke a response by the benthic biota. Much of our knowledge of these responses comes from a few time-series programmes, which suggest that the nature of the response varies in different oceanographic settings. In particular, there are contrasts between seasonal processes in oligotrophic, central oceanic areas and those along eutrophic continental margins. In the former, it is mainly small organisms (bacteria and protozoans) that respond to <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs.</b> Initial responses are biochemical (e. g. secretion of bacterial exoenzymes) and any biomass increases are time lagged. Increased metabolic activity of small organisms probably leads to seasonal fluctuations in sediment community oxygen consumption, reported mainly in the North Pacific. Metazoan meiofauna are generally less responsive than protozoans (foraminifera), although seasonal increases in abundance and body size have been reported. Measurable population responses by macrofauna and megafauna are less common and confined largely to continental margins. In addition, seasonally synchronised reproduction and larval settlement occur in some larger animals, again mainly in continental margin settings. Although seasonal benthic responses to pulsed food inputs are apparently widespread on the ocean floor, they are not ubiquitous. Most deep-sea species are not seasonal breeders and there are probably large areas, particularly at abyssal depths, where biological process rates are fairly uniform over time. As with other aspects of deep-sea ecology, temporal processes cannot be encapsulated by a single paradigm. Further long time-series studies are needed to understand better {{the nature and extent of}} seasonality in deep-sea benthic ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe western {{continental}} margin of India {{is one of}} the highly productive regions in the global ocean. Primary productivity is induced by upwelling and convective mixing during the southwest and northeast monsoons respectively. Realizing the importance of high primary productivity, a sediment core was collected below the current oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) from the southwestern {{continental margin}} of India. This was dated by AMS radiocarbon and as many as 60 paleoclimate/paceoceanographic proxies, such as particle size, biogenic components, major, trace and rare earth elements (REEs) which were measured {{for the first time to}} determine sources of sediment, biogeochemical processes operating in the water column and their variations since the last glacial cycle. R-mode factor analysis of comprehensive data indicates that the dominant regulator of paleoproductivity is the southwest monsoon wind induced upwelling. Other paleoproductivity related factors identified are the marine biogenic component and biogenic detritus (as an exported component from the water column added to the bottom sediment). All paleoproductivity components increased significantly during the marine isotope stage- 1 (MIS- 1) compared to those accumulated from MIS- 4 to MIS- 2. The second group of factors identified are the terrigenous sediments with heavy minerals like zircon and ilmenite. The terrigenous sediment, in particular, increased during MIS- 2 when the sea-level was lower; however, the heavy mineral component fluctuated over time implying <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs</b> of sediment. The diagenetic fraction and reducing component are the third group of factors identified which varied with time with increased accumulation during the MIS transitions. The primary productivity along the southwestern continental margin of India seems to have been controlled principally by the upwelling during the southwest monsoon season that was weaker from MIS- 4 to MIS- 2, as relative to that during the MIS- 1. In contrast, increased glacial productivity noticed in sediments deposited below the current oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) along the north of the study area that can be linked to entrainment of nutrients through the intensified convective mixing of surface water during the northeast monsoon. The sequestration of greenhouse gases by the western continental margin of India was higher during glacial than interglacial cycles...|$|E

At the same stations profiles of median grain size, % organic carbon and % total nitrogen were measured to a sediment depth of 15 cm. Macrofauna densities decreased exponentially from similar to 8000 m(- 2) at 208 m to similar to 550 m(- 2) at the deepest stations (3673 and 4460 m). Most of the macrofauna was {{concentrated in the}} upper 1 cm of the sediment. The highest proportion (70 to 80 %) was in the upper 1 cm found at intermediate depths (670 to 1425 m), whereas at the deeper stations the fauna was more evenly distributed. Polychaeta were the most abundant taxon, with {{a high proportion of}} subsurface deposit-feeders at the deep stations and a high proportion of filter-feeders plus surface deposit-feeders at intermediate depth. Biomass values showed a very variable pattern, mainly due to a few extremely large individuals at some of the stations. Excluding these large individuals, a maximum biomass value was observed around 1000 m water depth. At most stations the biomass was concentrated below the upper 1 cm, which was also reflected in the vertical distribution pattern of the mean individual weight, showing small individuals in the upper 1 cm and larger individuals in the deeper sediment layers. Both density and biomass fell within the range of values usually observed at these depths. Only the biomass value at 1034 m was extremely high and concentrated in the upper 1 cm of the sediment. This may be due to <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs</b> of fresh material at this station, whereas at the deepest stations (3673 and 4460 m) a constant low input of refractory material supports the fauna of mainly deep-living subsurface deposit-feeders. Median grain size decreased with increasing water depth from similar to 90 pm at 208 m to similar to 8 mu m below 2000 m. The vertical profiles showed very homogeneous sediments to a depth of 15 cm at all stations, probably due to bioturbation by the relatively abundant deposit-feeders. In general, the % of total N and organic C in the upper 1 cm of the sediment increased with increasing water depth, but showed a peak at similar to 1000 m. The % C and especially N were lower in the deeper sediment layers at the deeper stations, resulting in C:N ratios of similar to 12 to 15 in contrast to similar to 7 to 8 in the upper 1 cm of the sediment. The C:N ratio at the midslope stations (similar to 1000 to 1500 m) did not decrease with depth in the sediment, indicating a rapid burial of organic matter by the high numbers of surface deposit-feeders at these stations.

40|$|The {{timing and}} {{composition}} of organic matter (OM) inputs to rivers are important as carbon {{plays a major role}} in river functioning. Management of Australian rivers since European settlement has altered inputs of organic matter to these systems. Heterotrophic microbes play a critical role in the transformation of OM in rivers, allowing transfer of carbon to other biota. Alteration to the proportions of OM from different sources affects microbial functioning due to differences in OM composition. Macrophytes can represent important sources of carbon to rivers, however their inputs and in-stream processing are poorly understood. The aim of my study was to examine inputs and microbial processing of macrophyte OM in Australian lowland rivers under different flows. Distributions of dominant macrophytes (Typha orientalis, Phragmites australis, Vallisneria gigantea and Persicaria prostrata) were mapped in three lowland river reaches in south eastern Australia. Integration with flow data in a GIS allowed the determination of macrophyte inundation patterns under different flows. Resource allocation (biomass and nutrients), live and dead shoot densities and litter production were monitored in the field over 18 months. DOM release from different macrophyte tissues was examined in the laboratory and leachate composition was assessed using nutrient and spectral analyses. Responses of riverine microbial communities to different OM sources were assessed from substrate-induced respiration and enzyme activity experiments and field measurements of respiration and enzymatic responses to varied OM inputs. Finally, all data were integrated into a model of microbial responses to macrophyte OM inputs induced by different flows. Large populations of macrophytes occurred at all three sites, at bed level, on in-channel benches and on banks. Bank slope, channel heterogeneity and the vertical distribution of macrophyte beds all affected macrophyte inundation patterns. Substantial differences in biomass allocation, nutrient dynamics and litter composition were observed among different plant growth forms and over time. While leaves represented the major shoot component in litter for all species, stems and reproductive structures were also important in some species. Aside from the litter pool, translocation to rhizomes represented a major sink for annual production in emergent plants. Patterns of shoot density and litter production over time varied among species, providing a source of variation for particulate, and hence dissolved OM inputs upon inundation. The majority of DOM release from POM occurred within 24 hours of inundation. Growth form, tissue type (blade, stem, etc.) and status (live or dead) affected rates, quantities {{and composition of}} DOM release, with implications for microbial utilisation. Both overall activity and patterns of carbon utilisation in riverine microbes changed in response to altered OM inputs. Patterns of microbial carbon use were shown to be specific to the carbon source which induced them. Modelling showed that flow regulation had a major impact on OM inputs and microbial metabolism, through the effects of flow variability on macrophyte vertical distributions, macrophyte bed inundation and dilution. Positive relationships between discharge, DOM inputs and microbial metabolism were observed at the most highly regulated site (drought < current < historic < flood). While a similar pattern occurred at the less regulated site in terms of total loading, dilution effects resulted in a reversal of this trend on a reach volume basis. Microbial metabolism and DOM inputs were restricted to summer/autumn under regulated flows compared to a greater emphasis on winter/spring inputs and microbial activity under unregulated flows. Continual OM inputs during winter with <b>pulsed</b> <b>inputs</b> in spring under natural flows probably benefit larger, slow-growing macro-invertebrates. River regulation promotes pulsed macrophyte OM inputs during spring/summer, potentially favouring riverine microbial and zooplankton production, although at lower levels due to the overall reduction in OM inputs. The predictive model of macrophyte OM inputs and microbial responses developed throughout this thesis represents a major step forward in our understanding of macrophytemicrobe interactions and our ability to manage our river systems. This work has shown that flow manipulation can be used to influence macrophyte organic matter inputs to rivers and microbial responses, affecting whole stream metabolism and food web interactions...|$|E

Moreover, our results indicate that seasonally varying food supply or a periodically <b>pulsed</b> <b>input</b> of organic matter to the sea floor affects nematode size spectra. The hypothesis is proposed that {{the life cycle of}} deep-sea nematode species and hence the size structure of their populations are related to seasonal energy availability. This dependence might result in one-year life spans of deep-sea nematodes and probably other meiofauna...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} are {{presented}} the expressions for all network functions of common-ground, uniform passive ladders having, in general, complex terminations at both their ends. The Elmore's delay and rise times calculated for selected types of RLC ladders have indicated their slight deviation from delay and rise times obtained {{according to their}} classical definitions. For common-ground, integrating type RC ladder with voltage-step input, the Elmore's delay- and rise-times are produced in closed-form, both for ladder nodes and points. Furthermore, it is proposed a particular common-ground, uniform RLC ladder being amenable to application as delay line for <b>pulsed</b> and analog <b>input</b> signals. For this ladder, the Elmore's delay and rise times relating to their node voltages are produced in a closed-form, enabling thus with the realization of artificial (a) pulse delay line with arbitrarily and independently specified overall Elmore's delay and rise times and (b) true delay line with arbitrarily specified delay time for frequency bounded analog and/or <b>pulsed</b> <b>input</b> signals. In cases (a) and (b), precise procedures are formulated for calculation of ladder length and of all its RLC parameters. The obtained results are illustrated with several practical examples and are, also, verified through pspice simulation...|$|R
40|$|Results {{on the use}} of {{a double}} a-SiC:H p-i-n {{heterostructure}} for signal multiplexing and demultiplexing applications in the visible range are presented. Pulsed monochromatic beams together (multiplexing mode), or a single polychromatic beam (demultiplexing mode) impinge on the device and are absorbed, accordingly to their wavelength. Red, green and blue <b>pulsed</b> <b>input</b> channels are transmitted together, each one with a specific transmission rate. The combined optical signal is analyzed by reading out, under different applied voltages, the generated photocurrent. Results show that in the multiplexing mode the output signal is balanced by the wavelength and transmission rate of each input channel, keeping the memory of the incoming optical carriers. In the demultiplexing mode the photocurrent is controlled by the applied voltage allowing regaining the transmitted information. A physical model supported by a numerical simulation gives insight into the device operation...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis {{in terms of}} computational and experimental results of a high power erbium doped fibre amplifier using the bidirectional pumping scheme is presented. The differences between the signal evolution are discussed for unidirectionally and bidirectionally pumped amplifier for a single channel CW input. A comparison is made between the theoretically predicted gain and the experimental results for bidirectional pumping. The numerical analysis is further extended to multiwavelength propagation in the forward and bidirectional pumping schemes. In {{the case of a}} <b>pulsed</b> <b>input,</b> enhanced nonlinearity of the doped fibre and the differences in gain evolution between the different pumping schemes result in drastic changes in the pulse quality during its propagation through the amplifier fibre. The modifications of a Gaussian pulse in the time and spectral domains due to propagation through the doped fibre are analysed qualitatively to emphasise the advantages of bidirectional pumping for high power amplification. © Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|This letter {{presents}} a low power and compact area LC-tank-based frequency multiplier. In the proposed architecture, the input signals have a pulsed waveform that involves many high-order harmonics. Using an LC-tank that amplifies only the target harmonic component, while suppressing others, the output signal {{at the target}} frequency can be obtained. Since the core current flows for a very short duration, due to the <b>pulsed</b> <b>input</b> signals, the average power consumption can be dramatically reduced. Effective removal of spurious tones due to the damping of the signal is achieved using a limiting amplifier. In this work, a prototype frequency tripler using the proposed architecture was designed in a 65 -nm CMOS process. The power consumption was 950 μW, and the active area was 0. 08 mm 2. At a 3. 12 -GHz frequency, the phase noise degradation {{with respect to the}} theoretical bound was less than 0. 5 dB. close...|$|R
