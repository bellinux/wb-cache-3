25|$|In late 2007, CAFE {{standards}} {{received their}} first overhaul {{in more than}} 30 years through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), and were set to rise to 35 mpg by the year 2020. However, in May 2009 the Obama Administration announced a new harmonized national policy that will require an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016. The flex-fuel CAFE credits are scheduled to end in 2016, but because the 2007 EISA made CAFE credits exchangeable between different classes of automobiles and tradable between companies, and also carmakers are allowed to carry over credits {{for up to five}} years, the flex-fuel credits accumulated up to 2016 can be carried over and traded until 2020. The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive extra credit but only when the carmakers present data <b>proving</b> <b>how</b> much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that American {{automakers}} have been producing E85 flex models motivated by a loophole in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements, that allows for a fuel economy credit for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not in practice these vehicles are fueled with E85. This loophole might allow the car industry to meet the CAFE targets in fuel economy just by spending between [...] and [...] that it cost to turn a conventional vehicle into a flex-fuel, without investing in new technology to improve fuel economy, and saving them the potential fines for not achieving that standard in a given model year.

500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{rated the}} episode 8.5/10. He commented that in {{resetting}} {{the events of}} [...] "Sectionals", it [...] "felt a bit rushed", but concluded: [...] "Glee continues to work because it has its cake and eats it too. It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also <b>proving</b> <b>how</b> fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns feel a little too sudden, leaving us not quite sure how we got from here to there." ...|$|E

Social media integration as an access point is a very useful and mutually beneficial tool for users and providers. All major news providers have visibility and an access point through networks such as Facebook and Twitter maximizing their breadth of audience. Through social media people are directed to, or provided with, information by people they know. The ability to [...] "share, like, and comment on...content" [...] increases the reach farther and wider than traditional methods. People like to interact with information, they enjoy including the people they know in their circle of knowledge. Sharing through social media has become so influential that publishers must [...] "play nice" [...] if they desire to succeed. Although, it is often mutually beneficial for publishers and Facebook to [...] "share, promote and uncover new content" [...] to improve both user base experiences. The impact of popular opinion can spread in unimaginable ways. Social media allows interaction through simple to learn and access tools; The Wall Street Journal offers an app through Facebook, and The Washington Post goes a step further and offers an independent social app that was downloaded by 19.5 million users in 6 months, <b>proving</b> <b>how</b> interested people are in the new way of being provided information.|$|E

Nika also said that the video contrasted with Lady Gaga's style and that it was another [...] "pop art effect" [...] for Knowles. Matthew Perpetua of the same publication {{wrote that the}} video had a [...] "variety of dazzling looks that could definitely be emulated by fans on the cheap". He stated, [...] "the clip is nearly as joyful and super-charged as the song itself, with its barrage of world-class hooks complemented by a rapid succession of memorable, charming and sexy images." [...] Ray Rahman of New York magazine wrote that Knowles [...] "packs the short video with all her classic signatures: being amazing at dancing, recruiting teams of others to be amazing at dancing, and <b>proving</b> <b>how</b> even her fingers are amazing at dancing. But also, and possibly most importantly: Babyoncé!" [...] Kathleen Perricone of Daily News wrote that [...] "Beyoncé's baby isn't even born yet – and already it's a star" [...] referring to her abdomen in the video. Erika Ramiirez of Billboard commented that [...] "even with a bun in the oven, Beyoncé can still bring it." [...] CNN wrote that [...] "the imagery is a hodge-podge of modern and retro styling created in an ultra-bright palette, and staccato camera work effortlessly matches 'Countdown's' beat." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "And though Beyoncé's video for 'Countdown' is close to the top of pack simply on the strength of extreme shoulder work, the video art form is going through a phase of robust, competitive health, probably because the money's gone." ...|$|E
