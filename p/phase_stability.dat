The theoretical investigations {{have been made in}} close collaboration with experimental research and have addressed both bulk electronic properties and surface electronic properties of the materials. Among the bulk studies are investigations on the effects of substoichiometry on the relative <b>phase</b> <b>stabilities</b> and the electronic structure of several phases of MoC {{and the nature of the}} resulting vacancy peaks. The changes in <b>phase</b> <b>stabilities</b> and homo-geneity ranges in the group IV to VI transition metal carbides have been studied and explained, from calculations of the T= 0 energies of formation and cohesive energies. The anomalous volume behavior and <b>phase</b> <b>stabilities</b> in substoichiometric TiC was studied including effects of local relaxations around the vacancy sites. The vacancy ordering problem in this compound was also studied by a combination of electronic structure calculations and statistical physics. The studies of the surface electronic properties include research on the surface energies and work functions of the transition metal carbides and an investigation on the segregation of transition metal impurities on the TiC (100) surface. Theoretical studies with the aim to facilitate the realization of novel designer hard materials were made, among these a survey of means of stabilizing potentially super-hard cubic RuO 2, studying the effects of alloying, substoichiometry and lattice strains. A mechanism for enhancing hardness in the industrially important hard transition metal carbides and nitrides, from the discovery of multi-phase/polytypic alloys, has also been predicted from theoretical calculations...|$|R

Not only parameters of the natural environment of crystallization may be elucidated, also the history of up-rise within the earth to the surface and the development during procedures, eventually applied by mankind to enhance the physical properties of crystals, may be detectable. Structural reactions resulting in phase separation due to chemical stress during change of physical parameters shed light on the borders of solid solution and exsolution domains. Natural crystals of proper quality allow us to evaluate a time factor in <b>phase</b> <b>stabilities.</b> Therefore, detailed research on inclusions may provide at least knowledge of the mineral growth environment. But the relation between guest and host crystals may be very different: proto-genetic, syn-genetic, and epi-genetic relations may be recognized and interpreted. As mineral crystals usually have a geo-genetic history, which means that they are found at the earth´s surface, but usually have been crystallized within the earth interior, the parameters of crystallization and outcrop may vary substantially, usually the factor time has geological scale dimensions.

By making use of the basic thermodynamic properties heat capacity, reaction enthalpies, Gibbs free energies, FactSage proved to be extremely efficient for phase diagram calculations and determining <b>phase</b> <b>stabilities.</b> However, many different “styles” of visualising thermochemistry data can be found, which often complicates a direct comparison of obtained results with available literature. In common phase diagrams (e. g. the iron-carbon phase diagram), the concentration is plotted on the abscissa and the temperature represents the ordinate. Beside their frequent use for solid and liquid mixtures, it appears to be very uncommon to see such diagrams for the interaction between a gaseous phase and a solid material. Research in the field of metal-gas interactions often refers to <b>phase</b> <b>stabilities,</b> displayed in an Ellingham-Richardson style which uses an energy scale instead of (molar) composition. Although identical thermochemical values have been used, the results emphasise totally different parameter ranges of interest. Beside the frequent use of Ellingham-Richardson diagrams for high temperature applications, especially in steel industry and for tool hardening, this presentation emphasises on the visualisation and translation of thermochemistry data into common diagram styles.

5000|$|Nanogeoscience {{deals with}} structures, {{properties}} {{and behaviors of}} nanoparticles in soils, aquatic systems and atmospheres. One of the key features of nanoparticles is the size-dependence of the nanoparticle stability and reactivity.

In general, the free energy of nanoparticles is inversely proportional to their particle size. For materials that can adopt two or more structures, size-dependent free energy may result in <b>phase</b> <b>stability</b> crossover at certain sizes. Free energy reduction drives crystal growth (atom-by-atom or by oriented attachment [...] ), which may again drive the phase transformation due to the change of the relative <b>phase</b> <b>stability</b> at increasing sizes.
