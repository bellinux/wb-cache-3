The extent of chemical modifications of such reagents on viral proteins {{needs to be}} extensively investigated to better control the reactions and quality of vaccines. We have evaluated the effect of BPL inactivation on two candidate re-assortant vaccines (NIBRG- 121 xp and NYMC-X 181 A) derived from A/California/ 07 / 2009 pandemic in-fluenza viruses using high-resolution FT-ICRMS-based proteomic approaches. We report here an ultra performance LC MS/MS method for determining full-length protein sequences of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase through protein delipidation, various enzymatic digestions, and subsequent mass spectrometric analyses of the proteolytic peptides. We also demonstrate the ability to reliably identify hundreds of unique sitesmodified by <b>propiolactone</b> {{on the surface of}} glycoprotein antigens. The location of these modifications correlated with changes to protein folding, conformation, and stability, but demonstrated no effect on protein disulfide linkages. In some cases, these modifications resulted in suppression of protein function, an effect that correlated with the degree of change of themodified amino acids ’ side chain length and polarity.

40|$|Abstract- Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) is a one of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} worldwide sexually transmitted infection. HSV- 2 causes recurrent genital ulcers, neonatal herpes, and also, increases the risk for HIV acquisition. Many HSV- 2 vaccines have been tested in humans, but were not consistently effective. In the present work we tried to produce a model vaccine for HSV- 2 formulated in different formulae as an attempt for development of an effective prophylactic and therapeutic HSV- 2 vaccine. Beta <b>propiolactone</b> (BPL) as virus inactivant was compared with the conventional formalin. Also, calcium phosphate nano-particles (CPN) as a vaccine adjuvant was compared with current used aluminum phosphate gel (alum) micro-particles. Stability of adjuvanted and non adjuvanted vaccine models was monitored at different thermal conditions. Subcutaneous route was conducted in balb-c mice to determine the immune response of vaccine formulations. Data revealed that Al-BPL-HSV- 2 vaccine showed the highest and longer durative immune response compared with other vaccine candidates. Different formulations of the test vaccine showed the same pattern of stability at different thermal conditions (4 °C and 37 °C and 45 °C). Also, Al-BPL-HSV- 2 vaccine formulation could efficiently develop antibody level that could neutralize the challenge dose of HSV- 2 and no viral infection could be detected in the vaginal tissues using direct immune-fluorescent assay.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The current {{recommended}} inactivating {{agent for}} the rabies virus, beta <b>propiolactone</b> (BPL) is very expensive and potentially carcinogenic. There {{is a need to}} evaluate alternative chemicals, which will inactivate the virus without affecting its antigenicity. In this study the effect of ascorbic acid on the infectivity of the rabies virus has been investigated. Method: Vero cell grown fixed rabies virus CVS strain was treated with 0. 1 mg/ml, 0. 5 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml final concentrations of ascorbic acid and 5 μg/ml of copper sulfate and kept at 4 °C along with untreated virus material. Each aliquot was titrated after various intervals for viral infectivity using both mice inoculation and titration in vero cells. The antigenicity of the virus material was determined by antibody induction in mice and modified NIH tests in parallel with virus material inactivated with a 1 : 4000 concentration of BPL. Results: An optimal concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml of ascorbic acid and 5 μg/ml of copper sulfate completely inactivated the virus after 72 hours. The inactivated virus retained good antigenicity and potency value, which was comparable with using BPL. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ascorbic acid can be used as an inactivating agent for fixed rabies virus grown in cell culture particularly for the preparation of diagnostic reagents. Further studies are required to evaluate its effect on the cell associated virus, probable therapeutic potential and feasibility of replacing BPL in production of inactivated rabies vaccine...|$|E
40|$|New {{methods for}} the syntheses of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (P 3 HB) and poly(3 -hydroxypropionate) (P 3 HP) from {{epoxides}} are reported. Epoxides are readily available, inexpensive starting materials {{that can be}} transformed into valuable biodegradable and biocompatible polyesters. We successfully developed a one-pot synthesis of P 3 HB from propylene oxide and carbon monoxide using a multicatalytic transformation. The intermediate !-butyrolactone was formed and subsequently polymerized in situ. The carbonylation of propylene oxide to !-butyrolactone was accomplished using a catalyst of the form [Lewis acid]+[Co(CO) 4]-, and the lactone monomer was then polymerized by a (BDI) ZnOAc (BDI = !-diiminate) catalyst. The two catalysts {{were found to have}} orthogonal reactivity, and were compatible with each other {{as well as with the}} solvent, substrate, and any reaction side-products. The reaction proceeded with high activity and selectivity to synthesize P 3 HB with high molecular weights. Furthermore, this dual-catalyst approach eliminated exposure to the toxic !-butyrolactone monomer. We also report the synthesis of P 3 HP from ethylene oxide and carbon monoxide. The carbonylation of ethylene oxide proceeded in greater than 99 % yield and high selectivity with the bimetallic catalyst [(ClTPP) Al(THF) 2]+[Co(CO) 4](ClTPP = meso-tetra(4 -chlorophenyl) porphyrinato; THF = tetrahydrofuran). Ringopening polymerization of !-propiolactone by organic ionic compounds afforded poly(3 -hydroxypropionate) (P 3 HP) in high yields. The catalyst [P(N=P(N(CH 2) 4) 3) 4]+ [tBuCO 2]- displayed the highest activity for the ring-opening polymerization of <b>propiolactone,</b> and produced polyesters with molecular weights over 100, 000 g/mol and narrow molecular weight distributions.

40|$|Rabies is {{an acute}} disease of {{vertebrate}} animals which may affect all animals from amphibian to man {{and it is}} a single stranded negative sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Lyssavirus of the family Rhabdoviridae. The production of vaccines, diagnosis and further research will therefore continue in this field because a cure for rabies would be a big boon for the developing countries. Virus inactivation is essential for the preparation of vaccines, diagnostic reagent and research purposes. The beta <b>propiolactone</b> (βPL) is widely used as an inactivatent; βPL is very considerable value in the production of biological for virus inactivation and perhaps for DNA inactivation. The inactivation results indicate that the rate of inactivation is directly proportional to the concentration of βPL used. Assessment of the residual βPL present in the vaccine is a mandatory test to vaccine. Vaccine manufacturing also assess the efficacy of inactivation procedure by various in process quality control tests such as tissue culture virus amplification test and inactivation kinetics. This experiments are based on the changing the parameters as well as the various concentration of βPL in the clarified, concentrated high titer of PV 11 rabies strain, subsequently that are further purified and formulated with suitable additives and stabilizers. The immunogenicity of the vaccines is analyzed. During the βPL inactivation kinetics gives an idea of the predictable time of inactivation and also the order of inactivation, validation of the inactivation process {{is an essential part of}} quality assurance. In the immunobiological industry the time is a crucial factor because to get more inactivated viral harvest yield in a short period and they are processed to further purification and downstream processing.

The goals {{of the present study}} is to compare the NIH ("National Institute of Health") and the indirect ELISA tests to the Habel test and produce the National Reference Vaccine (VRN) experimentally, {{to be used in the}} NIH. Two hundred and ten 10 ts of vaccine have been tested by the NIH test parallel to the Habel testo The NIH test, following the limits 0, 9 UI; 0, 97 UI; 0, 98 UI; 1,OUI and 1, 1 UI approved, respectively, 77, 62 %; 75, 71 %; 75, 23 %; 73, 81 %; 71, 90 %, while the Habel test approved 82, 38 % ofthe 10 ts. The cut offvalue determined for the NIH was more than 0, 98 DI so 1, 0 UI is recomended as the official cut-offvalue. The indirect ELISA was applied in seras of mice immunized with 70 lots of vaccines with varied results in the Habel. The cut off values, the sensibility (8), the specificity (E), the predictable values for positive (VPRP) and negative (VPRN) results and the ratio between positive standard sera and no vaccinated mice sera were determined, so it was decided to adopt in this method the dilution of 1 / 400 that presents cut-off value of 0, 225; 8 = 97 %; E= 1 O 0 %; VPRP= 100 % and VPRN= 78 %. The National Reference Vaccine (VRN) was produced in BHK cells, C 13, with the Pasteur vírus (PV). The viral suspensions (5 !!!
