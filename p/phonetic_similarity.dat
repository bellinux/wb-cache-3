2500|$|A final area of his work, {{which has}} only {{recently}} been re-discovered, was his etymological analysis of the Hebrew language. Most of this work is contained in his Torah commentary, where he analyses and compares the shorashim (three-letter root forms) {{of a large number}} of Hebrew words and develops an etymological system of the Hebrew language. This approach is based on the idea that letters that share a <b>phonetic</b> <b>similarity,</b> have similar meaning. For example, the words Zohar (light), Tzohar (translucent window), and Tahor (purity) are related words because the letters Zayin, Tzadie, and Tet are phonetically similar. This is an approach used in many places by the renowned biblical commentator Rashi as well.

2500|$|A golden chalice {{enclosed}} {{in a field}} of azure has been the symbol of Galicia since the 13th century. Originated as a Canting arms due to the <b>phonetic</b> <b>similarity</b> between the words [...] "chalice" [...] and Galyce ("Galicia" [...] in old Norman language), the first documented mention of this emblem is on the Segar's Roll, an English medieval roll of arms where are represented all the Christian kingdoms of 13th-century Europe. In following centuries, the Galician emblem was variating; diverse shapes and number of chalices (initially three and later one or five), wouldn't be until the 16th century that its number was fixed finally as one single chalice. Centuries after, a field of crosses was slowly added to the azure background, and latterly also a silver host. Since then basically the emblem of the kingdom would be kept until nowadays.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century an {{alternative}} method, lexicostatistics, was developed, which is mainly associated with Morris Swadesh but is based on earlier work. [...] This uses a short word list of basic vocabulary in the various languages for comparisons. [...] Swadesh used 100 (earlier 200) items that {{are assumed to be}} cognate (on the basis of <b>phonetic</b> <b>similarity)</b> in the languages being compared, though other lists have also been used. Distance measures are derived by examination of language pairs but such methods reduce the information. An outgrowth of lexicostatistics is glottochronology, initially developed in the 1950s, which proposed a mathematical formula for establishing the date when two languages separated, based on percentage of a core vocabulary of culturally independent words. In its simplest form a constant rate of change is assumed, though later versions allow variance but still fail to achieve reliability. Glottochronology has met with mounting scepticism, and is seldom applied today. Dating estimates can now be generated by computerised methods that have fewer restrictions, calculating rates from the data. However, no mathematical means of producing proto-language split-times on the basis of lexical retention has been proven reliable.|$|E
