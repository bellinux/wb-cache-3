5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>dose</b> was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E

30|$|Intensity-modulated {{radiation}} therapy (IMRT) [1, 2] {{is an effective}} radiotherapy technique that attacks cancer without inflicting serious damage to critical normal tissues by delivering radiation beams from many angles. For designing IMRT inverse plans, an optimization strategy is typically used to minimize an objective or cost function of radiation beam weights [3]. We widely utilize the objective function to achieve as high as possible proportions of the total volumes receiving doses greater than and less than the prescribed doses for planning target volumes (PTVs) and organs at risk (OARs), respectively. However, in practice, it is often impossible to fill all the volumes with <b>permissible</b> <b>doses.</b> Namely, the inverse problem generally becomes inconsistent, so the optimization problem has no optimum solution. Dose-volume constraints (DVCs) expressed {{as a percentage of}} the prescription dose are a natural way to specify the objective and have been the standard way of evaluating the treatment in practice. Most of the conventional methods are constructed for solving inconsistent inverse problems with, e.g., dose-based, dose-volume based, and biology-based objective functions [4 – 8], and one expects to obtain a feasible solution that minimally violates the DVCs. Therefore, planning for IMRT requires a trial-and-error process and human intervention [9] due to the difference between the optimization objective and the evaluation of planning results.|$|R

These individuals would suffer an increased incidence of detrimental radiation effects, and distort the shape of the dose response relationship. The radiosensitivity of these groups depend on the expression levels of specific proteins. The plan was to investigate the effect of 3 relatively rare, high penetrate genes available in mice, namely Atm, mRad 9 & Brca 1. The purpose of radiation protection is to prevent! deterministic effects of clinical significance and limit stochastic effects to acceptable levels.

Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to detect the cutoff 24 -hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 24) /MIC ratio that best correlated with the clinical outcome.

A total of 168 patients were included, and 330 trough and 239 peak concentrations were used for the popPK analysis. Creatinine clearance (CrCL) was the only covariate that improved the model fit (levofloxacin CL = 0. 399 + 0. 051 x CrCLCKD-EPI [creatinine clearance estimated by means of the chronic kidney disease epidemiology]). Drug doses ranged between 500 mg every 48 h and 500 mg every 12 h in relation to different renal functions.

Using different years as separate sets, a total of 29 data sets were obtained from eight locations on various soil types. A large variation was found in Nmin base levels (unfertilised) between locations and between years at a given location. For doses low enough not to affect crop N recovery, every 100 kg N applied was associated with 3 – 4 kg residual Nmin in autumn. This is considered very low compared to Nmin base levels, but values differed significantly from zero. After normalising N-doses from different sources (mineral fertiliser and cattle slurry) {{with the help of}} a coefficient expressing effectiveness based on crop N uptake, no difference was found between fertiliser and slurry in terms of their effect on residual Nmin. The above also holds for nitrate leaching as measured. The sources do differ, however, with respect to long-term effects and these are quantified with a first-order approximation. It it shown that, also after incorporation of long-term effects, much higher N-doses on grassland are justified than the 170 kg N per ha per year in animal manures currently proposed by the European Commission. On normal productive cut grassland as in the analysed experiments, total N doses in cattle slurry up to 400 kg per ha per year have very little effect on residual Nmin, if not accompanied by high fertiliser doses.
