40|$|This paper {{presents}} a magnetically <b>sensitive</b> <b>transistor</b> using a nc-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction as an emitter junction. By adopting micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology and {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) method, the nc-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction silicon magnetically <b>sensitive</b> <b>transistor</b> (HSMST) chips were designed and fabricated on a p-type orientation double-side polished silicon wafer with high resistivity. In addition, a collector load resistor (R L) was integrated on the chip, and the resistor converted the collector current (I C) to a collector output voltage (V out). When I B = 8. 0 mA, V DD = 10. 0 V, and R L = 4. 1 kΩ, the magnetic sensitivity (S V) at room temperature and temperature coefficient (α C) of the collector current for HSMST were 181 mV/T and − 0. 11 %/°C, respectively. The experimental {{results show that the}} magnetic sensitivity and temperature characteristics of the proposed transistor can be obviously improved by the use of a nc-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction as an emitter junction...|$|R

40|$|Typical optical {{metrology}} {{systems for}} surface and shape characterization {{are based on}} a separated camera and projection unit, yielding to a limitation concerning the miniaturization of the sensor. We present a compact, highly integrated optical distance sensor applying the inverse confocal principle using a bidirectional OLED microdisplay (BiMiD). This microdisplay combines light emitting device (AM-OLED microdisplay) and <b>photo</b> <b>sensitive</b> detectors (photodiode matrix) on one single chip based on OLED-on-CMOS-technology. Comparable to conventional confocal sensors, the object is shifted through the focal plane (±?z) and the back reflected/scattered light is collected via an special designed optic and detected by the <b>photo</b> <b>sensitive</b> detector elements. The detected photocurrent depends on movement (?z) of the measurement plane. In contrast to conventional confocal sensors, our inverse confocal sensor detects a minimum of reflected/scattered light if the object is positioned in the focal plane. We present a novel sensor concept as well as system and optical simulations that demonstrate the principle of the novel inverse confocal sensor setup...|$|R
40|$|Introduction One major {{drawback}} {{of active}} pixel sensors and, {{to a lesser}} extent, of CMOS passive pixels or photo diode arrays too, is that {{a significant part of}} the pixel's surface is used for readout circuitry, which is not part of the light receptor or photo diode. Light falling on these regions is collected by the junctions of this circuitry. This essentially is the reason for the low fill factor problem of active pixel sensors. 2. Proposed pixel structure A method to raise the fill factor should manage to get all (or a large part) of the photo generated charge into the collection junction, instead of into the unrelated junctions. We have realised this by placing a small but effective electrostatic barrier between the <b>photo</b> <b>sensitive</b> volume and the unrelated junctions, which is absent between the <b>photo</b> <b>sensitive</b> volume and the useful junction (fig. 1). n++ n++ n p+ p++ (substrate) p- potential minimum unrelated circuitry photo diode ee -...|$|R

In analog timing imagers, connected to the photo diode are fast switches, which direct the current {{to one of two}} (or several) memory elements (e.g. a capacitor) that act as summation elements. In digital timing imagers, a time counter, that can be running at several gigahertz, is connected to each photodetector pixel and stops counting when light is sensed.|$|R
25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their <b>sensitive</b> <b>transistors.</b> Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|R

The sample immersed in methylene―blue solution is was radiated under UV―light for 20 min and the transmittance of the solution measured byUV―Vis spectrophotometer.

The spin transistor comes about {{as a result of}} research on the ability of electrons (and other fermions) to naturally exhibit one of two (and only two) states of spin: known as [...] "spin up" [...] and [...] "spin down". Unlike its namesake predecessor, which operates on an electric current, spin transistors operate on electrons on a more fundamental level; it is essentially the application of electrons set in particular states of spin to store information.|$|R

In either case, the construction must be such to reduce light leaks, or any unwanted light from striking the film until the holder is {{held in place by}} a camera and considered [...] "light tight".

Two models of the membrane potential were also compared. The models were implemented in Hardware Description Language (VHDL-AMS) in order to provide the future possibility for the mixed domain, mixed signal simulation of the microsystem incorporating the sensors, operating circuit and analog to digital conversion circuits.

40|$|The {{detection}} of motion with an active electrical device like a transistor allows {{to shrink the}} transducer to a few micrometers and to integrate it into a CMOS-process. A promising method for that is using the piezoresistive effect in the channel of a transistor. We have investigated the fundamental behavior of strain <b>sensitive</b> <b>transistors</b> with respect to different transistor parameters. Therefore the transistors have been simulated by using a modified BSIM 3. 3 model. The simulations showed an increase of the drain current between 3. 5 % and 5. 8 % for a 60 MPa stress and an acceptable shift of threshold voltage and almost no increase of leakage current. For metrological characterization pressure sensitive silicon membranes have been fabricated as strain inducing elements. First measurements with elongated membranes confirmed the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|CMOS image sensors include control {{transistors}} in the pixel itself, {{which generally}} {{results in a}} square or rectangular shape {{in the design of}} the <b>photo</b> <b>sensitive</b> surface, which is thus much smaller than the total pixel surface. The CMOS process also results in the presence of a stack of layers (dielectric and metallic) with specific optical properties, deposited above the <b>photo</b> <b>sensitive</b> area. In order to focus the maximum number of photons on the optically sensitive area of the pixel, a micro lens is fabricated on the top of the stack. The aim of this study is to optimise the micro lens to maximise photon collection in the photodiode. Especially we have evaluated the influence of micro lens cross sectional and base shapes on the light focusing and sensitivity. For this study we used the optical modelling software ZEMAX (ray tracing) and modelled the CMOS image sensor by a simple optical system: micro lens, media ("stack") with particular optical properties and a photosensitive area. Concerning the cross sectional shape, our results show that it is important to optimise the process to obtain a spherical one. Furthermore, even though the photosensitive area is rectangular, the best base shape for the micro lens is not necessarily a square: a significant portion of the photon gain due to the base shape (square or octagonal) is lost in the non-sensitive area of the pixel. Moreover, the gain in sensitivity on-axis due to the larger size of a square base is relatively small, and is offset by a significant loss in relative illumination versus incidence angle...|$|R

A MOSFET has been optimized to enhance the photocurrent and use a parasitic photodiode formed between the source and substrate as a PSD. A conventional BJT structure with a small emitter area has been optimized to enhance the photocurrent and utilize the parasitic photodiode formed at the base-collector junction as a PSD. In addition, a field effect modified (FEM) vertical BJT with a collector-connected annular ring around a small emitter area {{has been used to}} create a more sensitive and faster responding parasitic photodiode at the base-collector junction that {{can be used as a}} PSD. Each of the three distinct structures has been fabricated in both 1. 2 and 3. 0 micro technology in a number of different geometries as part of a parameter optimization study. A number of experiments have been carried out on the test cells to measure photocurrent as a function of light intensity using incandescent and LASER light sources. The most sensitive PSD was formed using a 3. 0 micro FEM BJT design. The device is being used to create a <b>photo</b> <b>sensitive</b> array that will act as input nodes for an artificial neural network that is being employed as an intelligent sensor for process control based on non-contact measurement. As the array will be used to image LASER generated patterns formed by object-oriented beam steering, high sensitivity is not necessary, whereas a structure that can be readily integrated into a regular array is most important.
