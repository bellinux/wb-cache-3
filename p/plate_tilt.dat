40|$|In water {{hydraulic}} systems, {{requirements for}} better energy efficiency {{call for the}} development of variable displacement axial piston pumps. Most axial piston units utilizing water as pressure medium lack the possibility of adjusting the swash <b>plate</b> <b>tilt</b> angle because of difficulties in constructing robust water compatible swash plate pivot bearings. Without smooth enough adjustment motion, the lubrication conditions between the swash plate and the piston slipper pads become disturbed and loss of fluid film may lead to early pump failure. This study reports on measurements made with a test rig built for investigating tribological phenomena in variable displacement axial piston pumps. In the tests, the effects of changing the swash <b>plate</b> <b>tilt</b> angle were measured in a test setup with constant high pressure which loaded the piston. Lubricating film thickness and lateral force acting on the piston were measured together with changes in these quantities in response to changes in swash <b>plate</b> <b>tilt</b> angle...|$|E

40|$|The {{hemagglutination}} inhibition assay (HAI) {{is widely}} used to evaluate vaccine-induced antibody responses {{as well as to}} antigenically characterize influenza viruses. The results of an HAI assay are based on an endpoint titration where the titers are generally manually interpreted and recorded by a well-trained expert. For serological applications, the lack of standardization in endpoint interpretation and interference from non-specific inhibitors in clinical samples can translate into a high degree of variability in the results. For example, <b>tilting</b> HAI <b>plates</b> at 45 - 60 degrees to look for a "tear drop pattern" with avian red blood cells is a common practice by many, but not all, research laboratories. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that an automated image analysis algorithm can be used to achieve an accurate and non-subjective interpretation of HAI assays-specifically without the need to <b>tilt</b> <b>plates.</b> In a side-by-side comparison study performed during FDA's biannual serological screening process for influenza viruses, titer calls for more than 2200 serum samples were made by the Cypher One automated hemagglutination analyzer without tilting and by an expert human with tilting. The comparison yielded 95. 6 % agreement between the expert reader and automated interpretation method (within ± 1 dilution) for the complete dataset. Performance was also evaluated relative to the type of red blood cell (turkey and guinea pig) and influenza strain (12 different viruses). For the subset that utilized guinea pig red blood cells (~ 44 % of the samples), for which no <b>plate</b> <b>tilting</b> was required, the agreement with an expert reader was 97. 2 %. For the subset that utilized turkey red blood cells (~ 56 % of the samples), for which <b>plate</b> <b>tilting</b> was necessary by the expert reader, the agreement was 94. 3 %.

Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A database of 192 computed tomography scans of abdomens/pelvises of patients (ages, 5 - 19 years) with no known orthopaedic issues, reformatted to neutral tilt, inclination, and rotation, were utilized for the normal cohort, the Camasymp cohort, and to create an age- and sex-matched control cohort. In addition, a retrospective review of all patients treated for femoroacetab-ular impingement (FAI) with preoperative advance imaging was conducted, and patients were separated to CamIP and CamSCFE cohorts. The alpha angle and tilt angle were measured on each hip. Statistical analysis was performed.

40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 35 A {{thin plate}} of {{crystalline}} quartz has been fabricated {{for use as}} a quarterwave plate with He -Ne 3. 39 -um lasers and has been used to determine the birefringence of the quartz at that wavelength. With a single thin plate, first -order relative retardation is achieved without recourse to an air - spaced pair of thicker plates having opposing retardation. Compared with such thick, air-spaced plates, thin quartz plates are much less costly to make, and they allow use of this excellent optical material much farther out into the infrared region. Because the birefringence at 3. 39 um had not yet been measured, an extrapolated value was used to determine an approximate thickness for the plate that was to be fabricated. Using the plate thus fabricated (0. 128 mm thick), two methods were followed to independently determine the birefringence: First, with the plate normal to a linearly polarized 3. 39 -um laser beam, the state of polarization of the transmitted beam was measured, yielding the relative retardation, and hence the birefringence, after determination of the plate thickness. The second independent determination of birefringence was obtained by measuring the <b>plate</b> <b>tilt</b> necessary to produce exactly circularly polarized light. The average of the 3. 39 -um birefringence values obtained from the two methods was. 0065 t. 0001, corresponding to a quarterwave plate thickness of. 1304 mm. The possibility of using thin crystalline quartz for infrared wave plates is attractive. However, one must consider both anisotropic absorption and anisotropic Fresnel reflection, which vary with wavelength. Only if these anisotropic losses can be balanced or made negligible (as by anti - reflection coating) can a perfect waveplate be made...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: The development and validation of an open-source, partial task simulator that teaches the fundamental {{skills necessary for}} endonasal skull-base neuro-endoscopic surgery. METHODS: We defined the Neuro-Endo-Trainer (NET) SkullBase-Task-GraspPickPlace with an activity area by analyzing the computed tomography scans of 15 adult patients with sellar suprasellar parasellar tumors. Four groups of participants (Group E, n = 4 : expert neuroendoscopists; Group N, n = 19 : novice neurosurgeons; Group R, n = 11 : neurosurgery residents with multiple iterations; and Group T, n = 27 : neurosurgery residents with single iteration) performed grasp, pick, and place tasks using NET and were graded on task completion time and skills assessment scale score. RESULTS: Group E had lower task completion times and greater skills assessment scale scores than both Group N and R (P ≤ 0. 03, 0. 001). The performance of Groups N and R {{was found to be}} equivalent; in self-assessing neuro-endoscopic skill, the participants in these groups were found to have equally low pretraining scores (4 / 10) with significant improvement shown after NET simulation (6, 7 respectively). Angled scopes resulted in decreased scores with tilted plates compared with straight plates (30 ° P ≤ 0. 04, 45 ° P ≤ 0. 001). With tilted plates, decreased scores were observed when we compared the 0 ° with 45 ° endoscope (right, P ≤ 0. 008; left, P ≤ 0. 002).
