50|$|Descriptions of the {{successful}} mutiny are one-sided, because the only survivors who could tell their story were the mutineers and those who {{went along with the}} mutiny. Allegedly in the latter class was ship's navigator Abacuk <b>Pricket,</b> a survivor who kept a journal that was to become a key source for the narrative of the mutiny. According to <b>Pricket,</b> the leaders of the mutiny were Henry Greene and Robert Juet. Pricket's narrative tells how the mutineers set Hudson, his teenage son John, and seven crewmen—men who were either sick and infirm or loyal to Hudson—adrift from the Discovery in a small shallop, an open boat, effectively marooning them in Hudson Bay. The <b>Pricket</b> journal reports that the mutineers provided the castaways with clothing, powder and shot, some pikes, an iron pot, some meal, and other miscellaneous items.|$|E

In 1622 he issued a volume of satires by John Taylor the Water Poet called The Water Cormorant His Complaint. He published the types of religious books that were so common in his era, like Bishop Gervase Babington's Works, Containing Comfortable Notes on the Five Books of Moses (1615).

50|$|Abacuk <b>Pricket</b> was the {{navigator}} of the Discovery on {{the fourth}} voyage of captain Henry Hudson. He {{was one of the}} mutineers who set Hudson adrift in a small boat, and then returned to England, eventually being one of only eight sailors who made it back to England alive. He was tried in 1618, but the authorities did not want to execute those who had saved the expedition and did not prosecute them for mutiny, but for murder. The court found that it was not murder to turn experienced seamen adrift near a shore that was neither barren nor uninhabited and acquitted <b>Pricket.</b>|$|E
50|$|Magnificient Style {{made her}} racecourse debut on 8 April 1996 in a ten-furlong maiden at Kempton Park. Jockey Willie Ryan held her {{up near the}} rear of the field and took the lead with two furlongs left to run. In the closing stages she pulled clear and won by six lengths from Migwar. Magnificient Style's next start came in the Pretty Polly Stakes at Newmarket.

5000|$|In {{the context}} of candlesticks, a <b>pricket</b> is a sharp point onto which a candle is placed to keep it erect. On a regular candlestick, {{this may be a}} short point on the seat of the candle, but a [...] "pricket candlestick" [...] refers to a very large point (onto which the candle is placed) with a small base.|$|E

50|$|The {{field for}} the 1996 Epsom Oaks was not a strong one, with the Rockfel Stakes winner Bint Salsabil being {{the only one of}} the eleven fillies to have won at Group race level. The best filly of the season, Bosra Sham (also owned by Saïd and trained by Cecil), was rested during the summer after winning the 1000 Guineas. Lady Carla was made 100/30 second {{favourite}} behind <b>Pricket,</b> the representative of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation. <b>Pricket</b> had been trained by Henry Cecil before until Sheikh Mohammed had withdrawn all his horses from the Warren Place stable the previous autumn. Pat Eddery positioned Lady Carla among the leaders from the start and turned into the straight in second place behind Moody's Cat. Two furlongs from the finish, Lady Carla took the lead and accelerated clear of the field, winning by nine lengths from <b>Pricket,</b> with Mezzogiorno half a length back in third. The winning distance was the fourth longest of the century, after those of Sun Princess (twelve lengths in 1983), Noblesse (ten lengths in 1963) and Jet Ski Lady (ten lengths in 1991). Only five fillies appeared to oppose Lady Carla in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh in July, and she started at odds of 1/2 to maintain her unbeaten record. The build-up to the race was marked by controversy, with Cecil angrily denying claims from the television pundit John McCririck that the filly had developed a serious respiratory condition. In the race, Eddery attempted to lead from the start, but when Lady Carla was challenged in the straight she failed to respond and was soon beaten. She finished fourth behind the Dermot Weld-trained Dance Design, beaten by four and a half lengths.|$|E
50|$|Qin Shi Huang (259-210 BC) was {{the first}} emperor of the Chinese Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC).

50|$|After the mutiny, Captain Hudson's shallop {{broke out}} oars {{and tried to}} keep pace with the Discovery for some time. <b>Pricket</b> {{recalled}} that the mutineers finally tired of the David-Goliath pursuit and unfurled additional sails aboard the Discovery, enabling the larger vessel to leave the tiny open boat behind. Hudson and the other seven aboard the shallop were never seen again. Despite subsequent searches/expeditions, including those conducted in 1612 by Thomas Button and in 1668-70 by Zachariah Gillam,their fate is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Diminuendo was a {{chestnut}} filly {{with a white}} {{star and}} three white socks, bred in Kentucky by Nancy Dillman. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Diesis, a British-bred stallion who was the top-rated two-year-old in Europe in 1982. Diesis {{went on to become}} a successful breeding stallion, and though based at Mill Ridge Stud in Kentucky, he had his greatest successes in Europe: his best winners included Love Divine, Ramruma, Elmaamul and Halling. Diminuendo's dam, the American-bred mare Cacti, also produced <b>Pricket,</b> a filly who finished second in the 1996 Epsom Oaks.|$|E
50|$|Pricket's {{journal and}} {{testimony}} have been severely criticized for bias, on two grounds. Firstly, {{prior to the}} mutiny the alleged leaders of the uprising, Greene and Juet, had been friends and loyal seamen of Captain Hudson. Secondly, Greene and Juet did not survive the return voyage to England. <b>Pricket</b> knew {{he and the other}} survivors of the mutiny would be tried in England for piracy, {{and it would have been}} in his interest, and the interest of the other survivors, to put together a narrative that would place the blame for the mutiny upon men who were no longer alive to defend themselves.|$|E
50|$|In any case, the <b>Pricket</b> {{narrative}} {{became the}} controlling {{story of the}} expedition's disastrous end. Only 8 of the 13 mutinous crewmen survived the return voyage to Europe. They were arrested in England, and some were put on trial, but no punishment was imposed for the mutiny. One theory holds that the survivors were considered too valuable as sources of information {{for it to be}} wise to execute them, as they had traveled to the New World and could describe sailing routes and conditions. Perhaps for this reason, they were charged with murder—of which they were acquitted—rather than mutiny, of which they likely would have been convicted and executed.|$|E
50|$|Some ahlspiesse have thicker spikes {{which are}} round and much {{shorter than the}} usual form. These are seen in 14th century {{illustrations}} suggesting {{that they may have}} been the precursors of the longer type which came later. These shorter forms are also known by the Italian term candeliere which refers to a round candlestick of the period that had in the center a small <b>pricket</b> or spike that held the candle in place. An excavated and partially restored candeliere is present {{in the collection of the}} castle of Grandson in Switzerland. There were also forms of the ahlspiess which lacked a rondel guard and these were known as breach pikes.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} caskets which {{are such a}} large part of {{production}} throughout the period, there were many other types of objects made in Limoges enamel. Those made for church use have had a better chance of surviving, and {{in the early part of}} the period probably predominated. Some types of objects, such as candlesticks, which are usually small with a <b>pricket,</b> and ornamental medallions for chests, usually have secular or neutral decoration and were probably made the same for both markets. In the later period other objects can have distinctly secular decoration, such as chivalric scenes of knights in combat, or rarer scenes of courtly love. Religious book-covers (or treasure bindings) were made in numbers throughout the period, usually in pairs of plaques which have rarely survived together; God the Father and the Crucifixion of Christ are common subjects.|$|E
5000|$|The play {{consists}} of five acts in rhyming couplets. There are two prologues, two epilogues {{and a short}} final speech. The play begins with Bolloxinion, King of Sodom, authorising same-sex sodomy as an acceptable sexual practice within the realm. General Buggeranthos reports that this policy is welcomed by the soldiers, who spend less on prostitutes as a consequence, but has deleterious effects on women of the kingdom who have recourse to [...] "dildoes and dogs". Prince <b>Pricket</b> and Princess Swivia commit incest with one another. With the court and country reduced to erotic madness, the court physician counsels: [...] "Fuck women, and let Bugg'ry be no more". The king himself, however is unconvinced, while the Queen dies of venereal disease. Amid the appearance of demons, fire, and brimstone, Bolloxinion declares his intention to retire to a cavern and die {{in the act of}} sodomising his favorite - Pockenello.|$|E

First Aristaios (Aristaeus) laden with gifts, he of the herds and he of the wilds, as he was named, the flood of allwise Apollon and Kyrene (Cyrene) so ready with her hands, wedded Autonoe according to the rules of lawful marriage. Agenorides (Kadmos son of Agenor) did not refuse his daughter to a goodson well acquainted with the art of feeding many; nay, he gave her to a very clever husband, a lifesaving son of Apollon, after he head calmed the pestilential star of fiery Maira the Dog Star by the life-preserving breezes of heaven-sent Etesian winds. The wedding-feast also was very rich, since he gave the unyoked maid oxen for her treasure, he gave goats, he gave mountain-bred flocks; many a line of burden-bearers was forced to lift the load of great jars full of olive-oil, his marriage gifts, much travail of the clever honeybee he brought, in the riddled comb her masterpiece [...] [...] [...] blessings that Aristaios conferred on man follow, see the Blessings of Aristaios below.This was he, the Keian (Cean) son of Phoibos (Phoebus), whom Eros (Love) escorted to the Aonian wedding. All the city Thebes wreathed in garlands was busy about the cattle-sacrifice, and the straighcut streets were all busy dancing. Before the gates of the bridal chamber the people twirled their reeling legs for the wedding; the women struck up a lovely sounding noise of melody, the Aionian hoboys tootled with the bridal pipes.Afterwards from the bed of Aristaios and Autonoe, arose Aktaion (Actaeon). His passion was for the rocks; and having in him the blood of the Hunter[...] [...] he once came across Artemis bathing naked, was transformed into a stag and torn apart by his own hounds.Pheme (Rumour) self born had flown from the hills to Autonoe, proclaiming her sons Aktaions fate torn to pieces by his dogs [...] [...] [...] Old Kadmos shore off his hoary hair, Harmonia cried aloud; the whole house resounded heavy booming with the noise of women wailing in concert. Autonoe along with Aristaios her husband went in search of the scattered remains of the dead. She saw her son, but knew him not; she beheld the shape of a dappled deer and saw no aspect of a man. Often she passed the bones of a fawn unrecognized, lying on the ground, and did not understand; for her boy was dead, and she looked to find him in human shape [...] [...] [...] Passing over the forest ridges with wandering feet, she trod the rough back of the rugged hill, unshod, with loosened robe, and returned home form the mountain ranging task; grieving for her unsuccessful cares she fell asleep at last beside her husband, unhappy father! Both were haunted by shadowy dreams, their eyes glimpsing the wing of a nightingale sleep.The young mans ghost stood by his disconsolate father, wearing the shadowy form of a dappled stag; but from his eyelids he poured tears of understanding and spoke with a human voice : ‘You sleep, my father, and you know not my fate. Wake, and recognise my unknown changeling looks; wake, and embrace the horn of a stag you love [...] [...] [...] tells his father the circumstances of his death and requests proper burial. I heard that Phoibos, the Archeresss brother, slept with Kyrene and begat my father, and I thought to draw Artemis to marriage in the family [...] [...] [...]’So spoke the dream the intelligent <b>pricket,</b> and without warning it was flown and gone. Autonoes husband leapt up, and threw off the wing of this revealing sleep.

40|$|ABSTRACT- We {{designed}} and field tested an expandable, easy-to-build radiocollar for subadult male fallow deer (Dama dama). This collar is inexpensive (it only costs few eu-ros), and breaks away {{due to the}} natural growth of the neck without causing injury. Elastic rubber bands (expandable section) are covered by a leather layer that protects it from pre-mature breakaway. We evaluated the effectiveness of 37 expandable collars deployed on <b>pricket</b> (1 - 2 y. o.) fallow deer, by using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Average dura-tion of collars from their deployment to their natural drop off was almost 2 years (mean ±SE, 91. 7 ± 6. 4 weeks). This enabled us to monitor subadult fallow deer during maturation and {{to collect data on}} their spatial behaviour for the first time. Very little is known on the behavioural ecology and life history of subadult cervids. Accordingly, breakaway radiocol-lars are important research tools whose use should increase among field biologists...|$|E
