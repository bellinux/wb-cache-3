5|$|As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also {{growth in the}} Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824–26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical front with tall tower.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|Equal {{franchise}} {{was eventually}} won with the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Representation of the People Act 1928.

5|$|His accomplishments {{were not}} {{confined}} to the track. He was deeply resentful toward the treatment given toward amateur athletes.

5|$|Hsu {{worked to}} make Tainan a smoke-free environment.

Other historical sites covered by the regulation include Tainan Confucian Temple, Fort Zeelandia, and Eternal Golden Castle.|$|E

The Senate passed the Act unanimously through voice vote, and it passed the House of Representatives 265–79. Signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on August 1, 1946, it went into effect on January 1, 1947, and the Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|New {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903. While in theory the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act should have resulted in significant prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document.|$|E
