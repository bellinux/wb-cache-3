damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before

embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one

40|$|This work is {{an attempt}} to review the {{literature}} and identify the key findings about the forms of psychological work needed for persons suffering from intellectual disability (ID) regarding their availability and efficiency. Though frequency of mental disturbances among <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> is greater than among general population, psychological interventions are often beyond their reach. Scarce availability of treatments excluded them from the scope of researches and therefore ensued with very few findings based on the proofs of their efficiency. Historically speaking, problems of mental health of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> have so far been dealt with by the medications administering or by applying techniques of behavioral modification. The main obstacles in obtaining psychological treatment for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> are negative attitudes, physical and financial barriers, and insufficient education of psychotherapists on intellectual disability. In this work, the main findings in regard to the outcomes of treatments of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> upon applying behavioral therapies, individual and group psychodynamic therapies, cognitive-behavioral therapies, cognitive therapies, counseling and systemic family therapies are presented. The results indicate that the service of psychological work with <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> has yet to be improved...|$|R
40|$|Limitations in {{mobility}} {{are common}} in persons with intellectual disabilities (ID). As balance and gait capacities are key aspects of mobility, the prevalence of balance and gait problems {{is also expected to}} be high in this population. The objective {{of this study was to}} critically review the available literature on balance and gait characteristics in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> Furthermore, the consequences of balance and gait problems in relation to falls were studied, as well as the trainability of balance and gait in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> The systematic literature search identified 48 articles to be included in this review. The literature consistently reports that balance and gait capacities are affected in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> compared to their age-matched peers. These problems start at a young age and remain present during the entire lifespan of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> with a relatively early occurrence of age-related decline. From these results a conceptual model was suggested in which the development of balance and gait capacities in the ID population across the life span are compared to the general population. Regarding the second objective, our review showed that, although the relationship of balance and gait problems with falls has not yet been thoroughly investigated in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> there is some preliminary evidence that these aspects are also important in the ID population. Finally, this review demonstrates that balance and gait are potentially trainable in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> These results suggest that falls might be prevented with ID-specific exercise interventions...|$|R
40|$|Longer life {{expectancy}} is resulting in increasing numbers of elderly adults with intellectual disability (ID). There has been the question whether <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> demonstrate early signs of aging before the general population. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> (with and without Down syndrome) showed premature aging changes compared with a control group. Elderly persons (n = 24, average age of 61) from one residential care center in Israel and younger adults from another center (n = 37, average age of 45) were compared with elderly residents without ID in an independent living facility. The study considered demographic data, medical data, anthropometric measurements, body fat and body mass index, flexibility, and sensorimotor function tests. The results showed that the <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> had basically similar body composition to that of <b>persons</b> without <b>ID,</b> however, the functional performance of elderly adults with ID was more impaired. We postulate that the slower functioning responses may be explained by a less physically active lifestyle, that may accelerate the onset of disease and result in symptoms associated with aging that are detrimental to health. It is therefore important that <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> participate in physical activity and exercises in order to promote health and prevent disease...|$|R

40|$|In {{the general}} elderly population, multifactorial {{screening}} of fall risks {{has been shown}} to be effective. Although persons with intellectual disabilities (ID) fall more often, there appears to be no targeted screening for them. The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a falls clinic for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> Based on guidelines, literature, and expert meetings, a falls clinic for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> was developed. In total, 26 <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> and a fall history participated in the study. Process evaluation was conducted with evaluation forms and focus groups. Fifty interventions (0 - 8 per person) were prescribed. The (para) medical experts, clients, and caregivers described the falls clinic as useful. Advice for improvement included minor changes to clinic content. Logistics were the largest challenge for the falls clinic, for example organizing meetings, completing questionnaires prior to meetings, and ensuring that a personal caregiver accompanied the <b>person</b> with <b>ID.</b> Furthermore, the need for a screening tool to determine whether a person would benefit from the falls clinic was reported. In conclusion, the falls clinic for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> was considered feasible and useful. Some minor content changes are necessary and there is a need for a screening tool. However, logistics concerning the falls clinic need improvement. More attention and time for multifactorial and multidisciplinary treatment of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> is necessary. Implementation on a larger scale would also make it possible to investigate the effectiveness of the falls clinic with regard to the prevention of falls in this population...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{persons with}} {{intellectual}} disability (<b>ID)</b> and <b>persons</b> with dementia have high disease burdens, and consequently also high health care needs. As life expectancy increases for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> {{the group of}} persons with the dual diagnosis of ID and dementia will become larger. METHOD: Through national registries, we identified 7936 persons who had received support directed to <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> during 2012, and an age- and gender-matched sample from the general population. A national registry was also used to collect information on health care utilisation (excluding primary care) for the period 2002 - 2012. Health care utilisation was measured as presence and number of planned and unplanned in-patient and out-patient visits, as well as length of stay. RESULTS: In comparison with <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> but without dementia, <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> and dementia {{were more likely to}} have at least one planned out-patient visit (odds ratio [OR] 8. 07), unplanned out-patient visit (OR 2. 41), planned in-patient visit (OR 2. 76) or unplanned in-patient visit (OR 4. 19). However, among those with at least one of each respective outcome, the average number of visits did not differ between those with and without dementia. <b>Persons</b> with <b>ID</b> and dementia were less likely to have at least one planned out-patient visit than persons with dementia in the general population sample (OR 0. 40), but more likely to have at least one unplanned in-patient visit (OR 1. 90). No statistically significant differences were found for having at least one unplanned out-patient or planned in-patient visit. Nevertheless, among those with at least one unplanned out-patient visit, the number of visits was higher in the general population sample. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Persons</b> with <b>ID</b> and dementia are less likely to receive planned health care than persons with dementia in the general population. They have, however, higher levels of unplanned health care utilisation. This may be an indication that the current support system is not sufficient to meet the challenges of increased longevity among <b>persons</b> with <b>ID...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{the life}} {{expectancy}} of people with intellectual disability (ID) has progressed, they have become similarly at risk of cancer as individuals of the general population. Epidemiological studies indicate a reduced incidence and mortality from lung cancer in {{the total population of}} <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> However, the pattern is heterogeneous and the risk is strongly correlated with the impairment level; persons with mild intellectual impairment have higher cancer risk, and this subgroup also has the highest tobacco consumption (the major risk factor for lung cancer) compared to individuals with more severe impairment. Clinical presentation of lung cancer in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> is often atypical, with symptoms frequently hidden by the mental state and communication impairments. Treatment can be impeded by incomplete understanding and lack of cooperation {{on the part of the}} patient; nevertheless, general principles for treating lung cancer must be applied to <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> Early diagnosis and implementation of an adapted treatment plan may result in lung cancer outcomes similar to those of individuals in the general population.

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data. Participants were caregivers of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> who were over 50 years old and living in a residential care center. A PA questionnaire and a daily rapport form were used to gather information about the type and rate of daily PA of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> for 12 consecutive days.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to explore the role of family- and paid-carers in meeting the health needs of people with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID). Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three family-carers and ten paid-carers who supported people with ID. Interview topics looked at roles and different aspects of health. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: Roles were undefined, leading to difficulty in deciphering who was responsible for the healthcare of the people they supported. Some paid-carers claimed that health was not their remit. The difficulty of monitoring health problems was noted, and carers disclosed skills and techniques to explain health messages to <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> Changes in the living circumstances of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> have seen responsibility for their health become the provenance of paidand family-carers. Conclusion: If the health goals of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> are to be met, a more consistent approach to health care within the community setting is needed. This may mean a less than smooth integration of health and social care services...|$|R
40|$|Person re-identification is {{the problem}} of {{matching}} multiple occurrences of a person in large amounts of image or video data. In this work we propose an approach specically tailored to re-identify people across different camera views in aerial video recordings. New challenges that arise in aerial data include unusual and more varied view angles, a moving camera and potentially large changes in environment and other inuences between recordings (i. e. between ights). Our approach addresses these new challenges. Due to their recent successes, we apply deep learning to automatically learn features for person re-identification on a number of public datasets. We evaluate these features on aerial data and propose a method to automatically select suitable pretrained features without requiring <b>person</b> <b>id</b> labels on the aerial data.

Face-to-face interactions were perceived as the only type of communication with capacity to mediate social isolation. Unfortunately, neither the quantity nor type of online communication offered was sufficient to mediate some students’ feelings of social isolation, with expressions such as feeling isolated alone as don’t meet fellow students in <b>person</b> (<b>ID</b> 239) conveying the depth of experience. Reflecting on the provision of audio recordings from the same subject’s internal lectures, a full-time disability support worker from Sydney described, I was just an outsider listening to number of interactions between others which I had no part in (ID 261). This student, like others who perceived loneliness (ID 15) as a key disadvantage, found DE to be a lonely experience, regardless of the quantity and type of CMC/TMC interactions, and elaborated it is hard to gauge progress without peers around (ID 261).|$|E

40|$|Closure of {{institutions}} designed for adults with intellectual disability (ID) {{has meant that}} those with more complex psychiatric and/or medical conditions have been admitted to health care settings designed for {{the general population of}} non-disabled adults. This paper describes the characteristics and service utilization of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> receiving inpatient psychiatric care in Ontario, and compares them to patients without ID in the same setting. Results reveal that significant discrepancy exists between the identified needs and services offered to patients with ID, with most interventions focused on behaviour management, including use of psychotropic medication, seclusion rooms, and confinement to unit. As in other jurisdictions in Canada and abroad, greater emphasis has been place on the integration of persons with intellectual disability (ID) into mainstream society. In Ontario, responsibility for services to <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> rests with the Ministry of Community and Social Services (MCSS), which has closed thirteen of the sixteen institutions for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> and plans to close the last three by March 2009 (MCSS, 2004). As a result of deinstitutionalization, the health and social service systems will experience an influx of adults with ID with complex care needs, many of whom will require long-term, mental health or home health care services. Though health care settings designed for the general population may not yet be equipped to deal with the needs of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> there is considerable urgency for this situation to change. The inability of community and long term care agencies {{to meet the needs of}} former psychiatric patients should serve as a cautionary tale in planning for the needs of persons leaving institutions. This paper represents the first of two studies describing the characteristics of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> receiving services in psychiatric and complex continuing care hospitals/units, and aims to improve our understanding of how they differ from patients without ID and to help determine what expertise needs to be developed as more adults with ID access these services.

40|$|Mobility {{limitations}} {{are common in}} persons with Intellectual Disabilities (ID). Differences in balance and gait capacities between <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> and controls have mainly been demonstrated by instrumented assessments (e. g. posturography and gait analysis), which require sophisticated and expensive equipment such as force plates or a 3 D motion analysis system. Most physicians and allied healthcare professionals working with <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> do not have such equipment at their disposal, so they must rely on clinical tests to determine whether balance and gait are affected. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether existing clinical balance and gait tests are feasible in older persons with mild to moderate ID and to examine whether these tests are able to show limitations in balance and gait capacities in the ID population compared to age-matched peers in the general population. Furthermore, it was aimed to identify the most important determinants of balance and gait disability in <b>persons</b> with the <b>ID.</b> A total of 76 older persons with mild to moderate ID (43 male, mean age 63. 1 +/- 7. 6 years) and 20 healthy controls (14 male, mean age 62. 2 +/- 5. 6 years) participated. Balance and gait abilities were assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Functional Reach test (FR), the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), the timed Single Leg Stance (SLS) and the Ten Metre Walking Test (TMWT). Our study showed that it is feasible to conduct standard clinical balance and gait tests in older persons with mild to moderate ID. Balance and gait performance of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> is substantially worse compared to older persons of the general population.

However, SpecialOlympics （SO） participants, who are <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> are given the opportunity for year-round sports training and athleticcompetition. The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe the prevalence of obesity based on the body mass index（ BMI） inJapanese SO participants with ID, and their exercise habit. The BMI was calculated from the following formula: （body mass,kg） / （body height, m） 2. Their exercise habit （duration and frequency of exercise） was evaluated using the questionnaire. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. For male subjects, 10 % of them were underweight, 70 % in the normalrange, and 20 % obese. For female subjects, 6 % of them were underweight, 79 % in the normal range, and 15 % obese. Theprevalence rate of the BMI status in both male and female subjects was similar to the corresponding value in Japanese personswithout ID.

Although there has been extensive research on risk factors for falling in the general elderly population, research on this topic in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> is rather sparse. This is the first study to prospective investigate risk factors for falling among elderly persons with mild to moderate <b>ID.</b> Seventy-eight ambulatory <b>persons</b> with mild to moderate ID (mean age 62. 8 +/- 7. 6 years; 44 (56 %) men; 34 (44 %) mild ID) participated in this study. This longitudinal cohort study involved extensive baseline assessments, followed by a one-year follow-up on fall incidents. Falls occurred in 46 % of the participants and the fall rate was 1. 00 falls per person per year. The most important risk factors for falling in elderly persons with mild to moderate ID were (mild) severity of ID, (high) physical activity, (good) visuo-motor capacity, (good) attentional focus and (high) hyperactivity-impulsiveness, which together explained 56 % of the fall risk.

40|$|Objective: This article aims to {{describe}} the presence, content and implementation strategies of written policies on end-of-life decisions in Flemish residential care facilities (RCFs) accommodating persons with intellectual disabilities (ID), and {{to describe}} training, education and quality assessments of end-of-life care. Methods: A cross-sectional mail survey was conducted among general directors of all RCFs accommodating <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> (n = 140) in Flanders, Belgium. Institutions {{were asked to provide}} us with a copy of their end-of-life care policy documents for content analysis. Results: Of the 140 institutions, 84 (60 %) completed the questionnaire and 25 institutions provided 45 policy documents. Presence of policies on specific end-of-life decisions with a possible life-shortening effect lay between 18 % (palliative sedation) and 26 % (withdrawing or withholding of life-prolonging treatment). The content analysis showed that the focus in the majority of these policy documents is on palliative care, while end-of-life decisions with a possible life-shortening effect are mentioned but rarely elaborated on. Furthermore, few documents incorporate the distinctive features and needs of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> regarding end-of-life care. On the other hand, half of the institutions trained and educated their professional care providers in some aspects of end-of-life care while one-third assessed the satisfaction of residents and families on several of these aspects. However, more than half reported explicitly that they have no plans for such assessments. Conclusions: The presence of end-of-life care policies is low in Flemish RCFs and their content is not very specific for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID...</b>|$|R

A qualitative method was an appropriate method for capturing the informants’ points of view. Participants were adults with intellectual disability who would be able to give their consent verbally and in written form. Women (n = 7) and men (n = 6). Data were collected from focus group interviews and analysed according to a qualitative content analysis of the tape-recorded and verbatim transcribed interviews. The participants took part in four workshops about healthy food, and ten physical activities addressing the connection to physical, social and emotional health. The results of the focus group interviews show that participants have knowledge about the importance of a healthy lifestyle for good health including physical activity and healthy food. Participants also describe social interaction and self-determination as important aspects in their life. It could then be concluded that the health promotion program result point at consciousness about a healthy lifestyle. There is still lack of research information of what public health nurses can do to reducing health disparities of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID.</b> Public health nurses work in community-based services and therefore they also might support <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> through health intervention programs...|$|R

40|$|Background Persons with {{intellectual}} disability (ID) and sleep problems exhibit more daytime challenging behaviours than <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> without sleep problems. Several anecdotal reports suggest that melatonin {{is not only}} effective {{in the treatment of}} insomnia, but also decreases daytime challenging behaviour. However, the effect of melatonin treatment on daytime challenging behaviour in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> has not been investigated in a randomised controlled trial. Method We investigated the effects of melatonin on challenging behaviour using data from two randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of melatonin on sleep problems in 49 persons (25 men, 24 women; mean age 18. 2 years, SD = 17. 1) with ID and chronic insomnia. Participants received either melatonin 5 mg (< 6 years 2. 5 mg) or placebo during 4 weeks. Daytime challenging behaviour was measured by the Storend Gedragsschaal voor Zwakzinnigen – Maladaptive Behaviour Scale for the Mentally Retarded (SGZ; Kraijer & Kema, 1994) at baseline week {{and the end of the}} fourth treatment week. Salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was measured at baseline and the last day of the fourth treatment week. Sleep logs were used to gather information on sleep parameters. Results Melatonin treatment significantly reduced SGZ scores, sleep latency, and number and duration of night wakes, and treatment increased total sleep time and advanced DLMO. However, after 4 weeks of treatment, change in SGZ scores did not significantly correlate with change in sleep parameters, nor with change in DLMO. Relatively strong correlations were found between change in SGZ scores, change in DLMO and number of night wakes. Conclusions Melatonin treatment in <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> and chronic insomnia decreases daytime challenging behaviour, probably by improving sleep maintenance or by improving circadian melatonin rhythmicity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Most {{people prefer}} {{to stay in}} their own {{environment}} until the end of their life. Familiarity is also an important value for people with Intellectual Disabilities (ID). However, end-of-life care at home may not always be the best option. A framework to guide relatives and care professionals in these decisions is lacking. Aim: To gain insight into the considerations of people with ID, relatives and care professionals when they are confronted with dilemma’s about care setting transfers at the end-of-life. Methods: Mixed methods were used: a literature study was performed to synthesize what was found about care setting transfers in this target group. Focus group discussions, using moral case deliberation, were used to elicit considerations about care setting transfers of relatives and care professionals. Nominal group technique was used to elicit considerations of people with ID. Questionnaires were sent to about 500 physicians, nurses and social workers to study considerations of a broader group of care professionals. Results: The wish for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> {{to stay in their}} own environment can be in conflict with providing high quality end-of-life care. The wish to stay at home was based on ensuring emotional security and autonomy according to <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> relatives as well as care professionals, and also reflected the wish of care professionals to care for their clients until they pass away. Elements that seemed to determine perceived quality of care were the available nursing competencies, self-confidence in providing end-oflife care, availability of 24 -hour care and housing facilities. The emotional security of other residents also played a role. Conclusions: Choices about care setting transfers require an open attitude of relatives and care professionals to be able to identify and weigh all considerations and underlying values, such as respect for autonomy, emotional security of both the <b>person</b> with <b>ID</b> and other residents, and quality of care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{a sequel}} {{to a report by}} the Health Council of the Netherlands on {{contraception}} in persons with intellectual disabilities (IDs), a fierce debate about parenthood by such persons occurred, in which a lack of knowledge about parenting competences became clear. Therefore, the Ministry of Health commissioned a study investigating examples of 'successful parenthood' by <b>persons</b> with <b>IDs.</b> METHODS: In conformity with the literature and with legal categories, we defined 'successful parenthood' as 'good enough parenthood', meaning no indications for child abuse and/or neglect, no dealings with child protection agencies and no legal custody. We combined a nationwide quantitative questionnaire study with a qualitative interview study. Questionnaires were sent to all institutions involved in caring for <b>persons</b> with <b>ID,</b> interviews were held with 'good enough' parents and their professional caregivers, {{selected on the basis of}} returned questionnaires. RESULTS: Parenthood occurs in around 1. 5 % of <b>persons</b> with <b>ID</b> in the Netherlands and is mostly restricted to those with mild handicaps. In total, 51 % of the cases were regarded, by caregivers, as not-good-enough parenthood, 33 % were clearly good enough and 16 % were doubtful. Predicting factors included the ability and the willingness to follow advice, the quality of the social network and the acceptance of parenting in the community. However, there is not one decisive predicting factor; particularly, the predictive value of the IQ alone is small. CONCLUSIONS: A general policy of discouragement of parenthood, as advocated by the Dutch Ministry, is not supported by our results; moreover, it would probably be impossible and have negative effects on social acceptance of parents with ID. The overall conclusion from the study therefore is that some kind of balancing model, in which positive and negative factors are weighed, may be useful to predict success and need for suppor...|$|R
