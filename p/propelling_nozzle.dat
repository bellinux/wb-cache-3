50|$|The {{fundamental}} performance {{task for}} a single shaft turbojet is to match {{the operation of the}} compressor, turbine and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> For example, the way the compressor operates is determined by the flow resistances behind it, which occur in the combustor, turbine, tailpipe and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form a turboprop {{consists of}} an intake, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor. Fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor, where the fuel-air mixture then combusts. The hot combustion gases expand through the turbine. Some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor. The rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing to the propeller. Further expansion of the gases occurs in the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle,</b> where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure. The <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propelling</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{accelerate}} the available gas to subsonic, transonic, or supersonic velocities {{depending on the}} power setting of the engine, their internal shape and the pressures at entry to, and exit from, the nozzle. The internal shape may be convergent or convergent-divergent (C-D). C-D nozzles can {{accelerate the}} jet to supersonic velocities within the divergent section, whereas a convergent nozzle cannot accelerate the jet beyond sonic speed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Propelling</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{may have}} a fixed geometry, or they may have {{variable}} geometry to give different exit areas to control {{the operation of the}} engine when equipped with an afterburner or a reheat system. When afterburning engines are equipped with a C-D nozzle the throat area is variable. Nozzles for supersonic flight speeds, at which high nozzle pressure ratios are generated, also have variable area divergent sections.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhaust gas}} {{temperature}} (EGT) of the thermoreactor using the Humphrey cycle being lower than in the conventional Brayton cycle by hundreds of degrees, the exhaust airflow out of the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzles</b> at {{the trailing edge of}} the front wings can be directed onto the upper surface of the rear wings. The speedier airflow and the resulting Coandă effect around the curvature allow a higher lift coefficient and a smaller wingspan. This technique is quite similar to the blown wing used notably on the Breguet 941, Boeing YC-14 and Antonov An-72.|$|R
50|$|The nozzle, {{by virtue}} of setting the back-pressure, acts as a {{downstream}} restrictor to the compressor, and thus determines what goes into {{the front of the}} engine. It shares this function with the other downstream restrictor, the turbine nozzle. The areas of both the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> and turbine nozzle set the mass flow through the engine and the maximum pressure. While both these areas are fixed in many engines (i.e. those with a simple fixed <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle),</b> others, most notably those with afterburning, have a variable area <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> This area variation is necessary to contain the disturbing effect on the engine of the high combustion temperatures in the jet pipe, though the area may also be varied during non-afterburning operation to alter the pumping performance of the compressor at lower thrust settings.For example, if the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> were to be removed to convert a turbojet into a turboshaft, the role played by the nozzle area is now taken by the area of the power turbine nozzle guide vanes or stators.|$|E

50|$|In 1942 MV {{started work}} on thrust augmentation. The {{resulting}} Metropolitan-Vickers F.3 {{was the first}} British turbofan engine to be designed, built and tested. Indeed, {{it could be said}} that the F.3 was also the very first 3-shaft jet engine to be built, although the configuration was completely {{different from that of the}} much later Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan series, since the fan was located at the rear of the engine, not unlike that of the General Electric CJ805-23. Using a stock F.2/2, MV added a separate module to the rear of the engine (directly behind the HP turbine) which comprised contra-rotating LP turbines attached to two contra-rotating fans. Apart from the first stage nozzle guide vanes, the LP turbine was completely statorless, with four consecutive rotor stages. Rotors 1 and 3 drove the front fan clockwise (viewed from front), whereas the rear fan was driven anticlockwise by rotors 2 and 4. Although the front fan had inlet guide vanes, there were no vanes between the contra-rotating fan rotors or, downstream, any exit guide vanes. The core and bypass streams exhausted through separate coaxial <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzles.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{its basic}} {{infantry}} form, the system comprises a missile {{in a sealed}} tube which is inserted into a launch tube prior to use. When the target is sighted and the missile is fired, the launch motor fires through the rear <b>nozzle</b> <b>propelling</b> the missile from the tube. As the missile exits the launch tube first four wings just forward of the flight motor spring open forwards followed by four tail control surfaces which flip open rearwards as the missile completely exits the launch tube. At approximately 50-65 meters downrange the flight motor ignites and boosts the missile's speed to approximately 600 miles per hour (or 1000 kilometers per hour). IR sensors bore-sighted to the optical sight continuously monitor {{the position of a}} IR source on the missile relative to the line-of-sight, and generates error signals which are sent via the command link to the missile's integral guidance unit. The missile's guidance unit then corrects the trajectory of the missile via the control surface actuators.|$|R

50|$|A <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{converts}} a {{gas turbine}} or gas generator into a jet engine.

Turbofan engines may have an additional and separate <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> which produces a high speed propelling jet from the energy {{in the air that}} has passed through the fan.

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of a shock}} wave with a boundary layer is a classic viscous/inviscid interaction problem that occurs {{over a wide range}} of high speed aerodynamic flows. For example, on transonic wings, in supersonic air intakes, in <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzles</b> at offdesign conditions and on deflected controls at supersonic/transonic speeds, to name a few. The transonic interaction takes place at Mach numbers typically between 1. 1 and 1. 5. On an aerofoil, its existence can cause problems that range from a mild increase in section drag to flow separation and buffeting. In the absence of separation the drag increase is predominantly due to wave drag, caused by a rise in entropy through the interaction. The control of the turbulent interaction as applied to a transonic aerofoil is addressed in this thesis. However, the work can equally be applied to the control of interaction for numerous other occurrences where a shock meets a turbulent boundary layer. It is assumed that, for both swept normal shock and unswept normal shock interactions, as long as the Mach number normal to the shock is the same, then the interaction, and therefore its control, should be the same. Numerous schemes have been suggested to control such interaction. However, they have generally been marred by the drag reduction obtained being negated by the additional drag due to the power requirements, for example the pumping power in the case of mass transfer and the drag of the devices in the case of vortex generators. A system of piezoelectrically controlled flaps is presented for the control of the interaction. The flaps would aeroelastically deflect due to the pressure difference created by the pressure rise across the shock and by piezoelectrically induced strains. The amount of deflection, and hence the mass flow through the plenum chamber, would control the interaction. It is proposed that the flaps will delay separation of the boundary layer whilst reducing wave drag and overcome the disadvantages of previous control methods. Active control can be utilised to optimise the effects of the boundary layer shock wave interaction as it would allow the ability to control the position of the control region around the original shock position, mass transfer rate and distribution. A number of design options were considered for the integration of the piezoelectric ceramic into the flap structure. These included the use of unimorphs, bimorphs and polymorphs, with the latter capable of being directly employed as the flap. Unimorphs, with an aluminium substrate, produce less deflection than bimorphs and multimorphs. However, they can withstand and overcome the pressure loads associated with SBLI control. For the current experiments, it was found that near optimal control of the swept and unswept shock wave boundary layer interactions was attained with flap deflections between 1 mm and 3 mm. However, to obtain the deflection required for optimal performance in a full scale situation, a more powerful piezoelectric actuator material is required than currently available. A theoretical model is developed to predict the effect of unimorph flap deflection on the displacement thickness growth angles, the leading shock angle and the triple point height. It is shown that optimal deflection for SBLI control is a trade-off between reducing the total pressure losses, which is implied with increasing the triple point height, and minimising the frictional losses...|$|R
25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and <b>nozzle,</b> <b>propelling</b> the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|R
50|$|The <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{at speeds}} above about Mach 2 usually has extra {{internal}} thrust losses because the exit area is {{not big enough}} as a trade-off with external afterbody drag.|$|E
50|$|For smaller, low {{performance}} rockets such as {{attitude control}} thrusters where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid {{is used as}} propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although a bypass engine {{improves}} propulsive efficiency it incurs {{losses of}} its own inside the engine itself. Machinery has {{to be added to}} transfer energy from the gas generator to a bypass airflow. The low loss from the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> of a turbojet is added to with extra losses due to inefficiencies in the added turbine and fan. These may be included in a transmission, or transfer, efficiency [...] However, these losses are more than made up by the improvement in propulsive efficiency. There are also extra pressure losses in the bypass duct and an extra <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
50|$|In aviation, exhaust mixer is {{a feature}} of many {{turbofan}} engines, where the bypass (cold/slow) air is mixed with the core (hot/fast) exhaust gases, before exhausting to atmospheric pressure through a common (mixed flow) <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a gas}} turbine is increased by raising the overall pressure ratio, requiring higher-temperature compressor materials, and raising the turbine entry temperature, requiring better turbine materials and/or improved vane/blade cooling. It is also increased by reducing the losses as the flow progresses from the intake to the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> These losses are quantified by compressor and turbine efficiencies and ducting pressure losses. When used in a turbojet application, where the output from the gas turbine is used in a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle,</b> raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity. This reduces the propulsive efficiency, giving a loss in overall efficiency, as reflected by the higher fuel consumption, or SFC.|$|E
50|$|The {{turbojet}} is an airbreathing jet engine, usually used in aircraft. It {{consists of}} a gas turbine with a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The gas turbine has an air inlet, a compressor, a combustion chamber, and a turbine (that drives the compressor). The compressed air from the compressor is heated by the fuel in the combustion chamber and then allowed to expand through the turbine. The turbine exhaust is then expanded in the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> where it is accelerated to high speed to provide thrust. Two engineers, Frank Whittle in the United Kingdom and Hans von Ohain in Germany, developed the concept independently into practical engines during the late 1930s.|$|E
50|$|A jet exhaust {{produces}} a net thrust from the energy obtained from combusting fuel which {{is added to}} the inducted air. This hot air passes through a high speed nozzle, a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle,</b> which enormously increases its kinetic energy.|$|E
50|$|A {{rocket engine}} nozzle is a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> (usually of the de Laval type) {{used in a}} rocket engine to expand and {{accelerate}} the combustion gases produced by burning propellants so that the exhaust gases exit the nozzle at hypersonic velocities.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{pressure}} ratio (EPR) {{is the total}} {{pressure ratio}} across a jet engine, measured as {{the ratio of the}} total pressure at the exit of the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> divided by the total pressure at the entry to the compressor.|$|E
5000|$|Turbojets {{consist of}} an inlet, a compressor, a combustor, a turbine (that drives the compressor) and a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The {{compressed}} air is heated in the combustor and {{passes through the}} turbine, then expands in the nozzle to produce a high speed propelling jet ...|$|E
50|$|In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine {{the high}} {{temperature}} and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> and produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power {{produced by the}} turbine. In a bypass design extra turbines drive a ducted fan that accelerates air rearward {{from the front of}} the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to turboprops in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine's gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between turbojets, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less). Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gave significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet's low-loss <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct and extra <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> compared to the turbojet's single nozzle.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|E
50|$|The {{afterburner}} {{received the}} exhaust from the turbine {{as well as}} the bleed air from the compressor.
