40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The Pacific Coast {{variety of}} Douglas-fir was investigated. The samples were tested using both forced and free {{vibrations}}. Transverse vibrations were introduced by excitations {{on the side}} of the samples. Forced vibrations were applied from 5000 to 0 hertz by a vibration generator, and free vibrations were initiated by a sharp blow from an impacter. By using forced vibrations the transverse resonant frequencies of the samples were determined. An amplitude ratio was created to compare the sound pole to defective specimens. This ratio is zero or near zero for tests on the sound pole. Poles with brown rot had amplitude ratios which were proportional to the size of the decay <b>pockets.</b> <b>Samples</b> with white rot and pitch pockets had ratios which were consistantly greater than 0. 1. The results of this research, together with the findings of Professor L. C.

Anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14. 5 isolates vs. 8. 4 isolates, respectively; P <. 001). Infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10. 3 isolates vs. 6. 9 isolates, respectively; P <. 05). Eubacterium aerofaciens, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella oris were frequently isolated.

In this study, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence were combined to investigate the prevalence and abundance of BU 045 and BU 063 in comparison to T. forsythia in plaques from gingivitis, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) and chronic periodontitis. Phylotype-specific FISH probes identified BU 045 and BU 063 as elongated thin rods with a segmented structure. Two structurally similar and previously unknown, rare phylotypes (127 + and 997 +) were also identified due to partial 16 S rRNA sequence identity with T. forsythia. In gingivitis, NUG and periodontitis patients, BU 045, BU 063, 127 +, 997 + and T. forsythia were detected with prevalences of 50 / 83 / 71 / 14 and 81 %, 100 / 100 / 86 / 17 and 53 %, and 100 / 100 / 12 / 0 and 100 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: Two genotypes can be {{distinguished}} within the species Peptostreptococcus micros: a smooth (Sm) and a rough (Rg) type. To date no systematic study has been performed on the prevalence and proportion of both types in untreated periodontitis patients and subjects without destructive periodontal disease. Therefore, {{the present study was}} performed to investigate: 1) the relative importance of the Sm and the Rg genotype of P. micros in periodontitis and gingivitis; 2) the correlation between smoking and the 2 genotypes of P. micros; and 3) the systemic antibody response against the 2 genotypes in relation to the periodontal condition and smoking. Methods: A total of 104 untreated periodontitis patients and 41 individuals with gingivitis underwent clinical examination and microbiological <b>sampling.</b> <b>Pocket</b> <b>samples</b> were cultured anaerobically on blood agar plates to determine the prevalence and proportion of the Sm and Rg types of P. micros. Serum antibody titers against both types of P. micros were determined in all subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using whole bacterial cells as antigen. Additionally, in a representative group of subjects, the antigen specificity of the serum antibodies was assessed by immunoblotting experiments. Results: The prevalence of the Sm genotype was higher in subjects with periodontitis (94 %) compared to subjects with gingivitis (59 %), whereas the prevalence of the Rg type was not significantly different (38 % versus 29 %). Similar analyses were performed for subgroups of smokers and non-smokers; within the periodontitis group, the prevalence of the Sm type was not different between smokers and non-smokers (96 % and 92 %, respectively), whereas the prevalence of the Rg type was higher in smokers (48 %) compared to non-smokers (19 %). No difference in prevalence of both types was observed between smokers and non-smokers within the gingivitis group. The titers and specificity of P. micros-specific immunoglobulins in periodontitis patients were not different from those in gingivitis subjects, nor were they related to smoking status or culture-positivity. Conclusions: The {{results of this study suggest}} that both the Sm and the Rg genotypes of P. micros are part of the normal oral microbiota. However, the elevated prevalence of the Sm genotype in periodontitis and the elevated prevalence of the Rg type in periodontitis patients who smoke implies that both types can behave as opportunistic pathogens in destructive periodontal disease...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} Î²-lactamase-producing oral anaerobic bacteria and screen them for the presence of cfxA and BlaTEM genes that are responsible for Î²-lactamase production and resistance to Î²-lactam antibiotics. Material and Methods Periodontal <b>pocket</b> debris <b>samples</b> were collected from 48 patients with chronic periodontitis and anaerobically cultured on blood agar plates with and without Î²-lactam antibiotics. Presumptive Î²-lactamase-producing isolates were evaluated for definite Î²-lactamase production using the nitrocefin slide method and identified using the API Rapid 32 A system. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed using disc diffusion and microbroth dilution tests as described by CLSI Methods. Isolates were screened for the presence of the Î²-lactamase-TEM (BlaTEM) and Î²-lactamase-cfxA genes using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Amplified PCR products were sequenced and the cfxA gene was characterized using Genbank databases. Results Seventy five percent of patients carried two species of Î²-lactamase-producing anaerobic bacteria that comprised 9. 4 % of the total number of cultivable bacteria. Fifty one percent of Î²-lactamase-producing strains mainly Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Bacteroides carried the cfxA gene, whereas none of them carried blaTEM. Further characterization of the cfxA gene showed that 76. 7 % of these strains carried the cfxA 2 gene, 14 % carried cfxA 3, and 9. 3 % carried cfxA 6. The cfxA 6 gene was present in three Prevotella spp. and in one Porphyromonas spp. Strains containing cfxA genes (56 %) were resistant to the Î²-lactam antibiotics.

Twenty-one subjects from Arabic countries, aged between 22 and 48 years, who had previously not been exposed to any dental care other than extractions and fillings, were selected. The percentage of pockets deeper than 3 nim was 13 per cent and the percentage of sites bleeding upon probing was 62 per cent. Subgingival microbial samples were taken from the deepest <b>pockets.</b> Seventy-eight <b>samples</b> were available for DNA-probe analysis. P. intermedia was present in all individuals, P. gingivalis was identified in 19 subjects, and A. actinomycetemcomitans in six. Eighty-two per cent of all samples were P. intermedia positive, 79 per cent were positive for P. gingivalis and 23 per cent for A. actinomycetemcomitans. A highly significant association was observed between the presence of P. intermedia and P. gingivalis (Fischerâs exact test, P < O. O O l). Only 8 per cent of all samples were positive for P. gingivalis but not for P. intermedia, and only 6 per cent were P. intermedia, but not P. gingivalis positive.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of conformational dynamics to substrate specificity {{have been examined}} by the application of principal component analysis to molecular dynamics trajectories of Î±-lytic protease. The wild-type Î±-lytic protease is highly specific for substrates with small hydrophobic side chains at the specificity pocket, while the Met 190 âAla binding pocket mutant has a much broader specificity, actively hydrolyzing substrates ranging from Ala to Phe. Based {{on a combination of}} multiconformation analysis of cryo-X-ray crystallographic data, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and normal mode calculations, we had hypothesized that the large alteration in specificity of the mutant enzyme is mainly attributable to changes in the dynamic movement of the two walls of the specificity pocket. To test this hypothesis, we performed a principal component analysis using 1 -nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations using either a global or local solvent boundary condition. The results of this analysis strongly support our hypothesis and verify the results previously obtained by in vacuo normal mode analysis. We found that the walls of the wild-type substrate binding pocket move in tandem with one another, causing the pocket size to remain fixed so that only small substrates are recognized. In contrast, the M 190 A mutant shows uncoupled movement of the binding pocket walls, allowing the <b>pocket</b> to <b>sample</b> both smaller and larger sizes, which appears to be the cause of the observed broad specificity. The results suggest that the protein dynamics of Î±-lytic protease may {{play a significant role in}} defining the patterns of substrate specificity.

Concentrations of alkenes and PAH shows that these compound classes are at relatively low levels, and as such are of less concern in the assessed basins. JRC. C. 5 -Air and Climat...|$|R
40|$|The mass-weighted {{molecular}} dynamics simulation method was developed previously for sampling the multidimensional conformational space of linear and cyclic polypeptides and studying their conformational flexibility. Herein results from {{molecular dynamics}} simulations of the protein-ligand complex of the aspartyl protease rhizopuspepsin and a polypeptide inhibitor are reported. The dihedral conformational space sampling for the linear peptide inhibitor in situ {{was found to be}} increased in the mass-weighted simulation as in other molecular systems previously studied. More significantly, the physical space of the enzyme binding <b>pocket</b> was also <b>sampled</b> efficiently in the simulations and multiple binding sites were identified for the inhibitor. These results suggest that it may be possible now to study, by computer simulations, the putative initial enzyme-inhibitor complex suggested experimentally from the time-dependent kinetics of enzyme inhibition by slow-binding inhibitors (Morrison, J. F., and C. T. Walsh. 1988. Adv. Enzymol. 61 : 201), and/or conformational substates in protein-ligand complexes suggested in the study of reassociation dynamics of myoglobin and carbon monoxide following photolysis (Austin, R. H., K. W. Beeson, L. Eisenstein, H. Frauenfelder, and I. C. Gunsalus. 1975. Biochemistry. 14 : 5355). Moreover, the intermediate binding steps and the molecular flexibility of the inhibitor shown in the MWMD simulation may have crucial roles in the ligand binding process...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} novel a-helix mimetic inhibitors of protein-protein {{interactions}} {{is of interest}} to pharmaceuticals and chemical genetics researchers as these inhibitors provide a chemical scaffold presenting side chains in the same geometry as an a-helix. This conformational arrangement allows the design of high affinity inhibitors mimicking known peptide sequences binding specific protein substrates. We show that GAFF and AutoDock potentials do not properly capture the conformational preferences of a-helix mimetics based on arylamide oligomers and identify alternate parameters matching solution NMR data and suitable for molecular dynamics simulation of arylamide compounds. Results from both docking and molecular dynamics simulations {{are consistent with the}} arylamides binding in the p 53 peptide binding pocket. Simulations of arylamides in the p 53 binding pocket of hDM 2 are consistent with binding, exhibiting similar structural dynamics in the pocket as simulations of known hDM 2 binders Nutlin- 2 and a benzodiazepinedione compound. Arylamide conformations converge towards the same region of the binding pocket on the 20 ns time scale, and most, though not all dihedrals in the binding <b>pocket</b> are well <b>sampled</b> on this timescale. We show that there are two putative classes of binding modes for arylamide compounds supported equally by the modeling evidence. In the first, the arylamide compound lies parallel to the observed p 53 helix. In the second class, not previously identified or proposed, the arylamide compound lies anti-parallel t...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility {{and composition of}} subgingival biofilms in generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) patients treated using mechanical/antimicrobial therapies, including chlorhexidine (CHX), amoxicillin (AMX) and metronidazole (MET). GAP patients allocated to the placebo (C, n = 15) or test group (T, n = 16) received full-mouth disinfection with CHX, scaling and root planning, and systemic AMX (500 mg) /MET (250 mg) or placebos. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-therapy from 3 â 4 periodontal <b>pockets,</b> and the <b>samples</b> were pooled and cultivated under anaerobic conditions. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of AMX, MET and CHX were assessed using the microdilution method. Bacterial species present in the cultivated biofilm were identified by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. At baseline, no differences in the MICs between groups were observed for the 3 antimicrobials. In the T group, significant increases in the MICs of CHX (p < 0. 05) and AMX (p < 0. 01) were detected during the first 3 months; however, the MIC of MET decreased at 12 months (p < 0. 05). For several species, the MICs significantly changed over time in both groups, i. e., Streptococci MICs tended to increase, while for several periodontal pathogens, the MICs diminished. A transitory increase in the MIC of the subgingival biofilm to AMX and CHX was observed in GAP patients treated using enhanced mechanical therapy with topical CHX and systemic AMX/MET. Both protocols presented limited effects on the cultivable subgingival microbiota...|$|R

40|$|Background: Survival {{rates in}} implant {{dentistry}} today are high, although late failures do occur due to multifactorial reasons, including peri-implant infections. The primary {{objective of this}} study was to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after up to 22 years. Secondary objectives were to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiological, radiographic and clinical parameters. Methods: 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical examination. Clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. Radiographic bone level was measured around implants. Microbiological samples were taken from implants, contralaterals and the deepest <b>pocket</b> per quadrant. <b>Samples</b> were analysed with DNA-DNA hybridization including 40 species. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon Signed ranks tests, McNemar tests and Spearman correlation coefficients with 0. 05 significance level. Results: Mean follow-up was 18. 5 years (range 16 - 22). Tannerella forsythia (1. 5 x 10 (5)) and Veillonella parvula (1. 02 x 10 (5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and T. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. Mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for Parvimonas micra, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, T. forsythia and Treponema denticola. Total DNA count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r= 0. 409) and interproximal probing depth (r= 0. 307). No correlations were present with plaque index, nor radiographic bone level. Conclusions: In the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. Although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (5 / 40), the majority of implants presents with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss...|$|R
40|$|A {{treatment}} for periodontal infections often consists of consecutive rootplanings (per quadrant, at a 1 - to 2 -week interval), without a proper disinfection {{of the remaining}} intra-oral niches (untreated pockets, tongue, saliva, mucosa and tonsils). Such an approach, could theoretically lead to a reinfection of previously-treated pockets. The present study aims to {{examine the effect of}} a full-mouth disinfection on the microbiota in the above-mentioned niches. Moreover, the clinical benefit of such an approach was investigated. 16 patients with severe periodontitis were randomly allocated to a test and a control group. The patients from the control group were scaled and rootplaned, per quadrant, at 2 -week intervals and obtained oral hygiene instructions. The patients from the test group received a full-mouth disinfection consisting of: scaling and rootplaning of all pockets in 2 visits within 24 h, in combination with tongue brushing with 1 % chlorhexidine gel for 1 min, mouth rinsing with a 0. 2 % chlorhexidine solution for 2 min and subgingival irrigation of all pockets (3 x in 10 min) with 1 % chlorhexidine gel. Besides oral hygiene, the test group rinsed 2 x daily with 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and sprayed the tonsils with a 0. 2 % chlorhexidine for 2 months. Plaque <b>samples</b> (<b>pockets,</b> tongue, mucosa and saliva) were taken at baseline and after 2 and 4 months, and changes in probing depth, attachment level and bleeding on probing were reported. The full-mouth disinfection resulted in a statistically significant additional reduction/elimination of periodontopathogens, especially in the subgingival pockets, but also in the other niches. These microbiological improvements were reflected in a statistically-significant higher probing depth reduction and attachment gain in the test patients. These findings suggest that a disinfection of all intra-oral niches within a short time span leads to significant clinical and microbiological improvements for up to 4 months. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} role {{of environmental}} factors, including nursesâ scrubs, {{in the spread}} of infection {{is an area of}} growing interest. Laundering {{plays an important role in}} decontaminating scrubs. Our goal was to qualitatively assess the presence of S. aureus and MRSA on nursing student scrub tops, before and after laundering in college dormitory facilities. Study participants included junior and senior nursing students from Simmons College, Boston MA, who interned in acute inpatient clinical units during the 2013 - 14 academic year. Each participant was provided with sterile culturette swabs, swabbing templates, coded labels, sample transport bags, and detailed written and video sampling instructions. Participants used the template to standardize the swabbing area (abdominal, above the <b>pockets),</b> and collected <b>samples</b> after wearing the scrub top to clinicals, and again after laundering. Swabs were collected on Simmons campus, refrigerated and delivered weekly to UMass Lowell. Samples were cultured within 24 hr to mannitol salt agar, tryptic soy agar and Staphylococcus enrichment broth to ensure recovery of low numbers. Plates were incubated for up to 48 hr before determination of no growth. Positive enrichment broths with corresponding no growth plates were plated. Colonies morphologically consistent with S. aureus were identified with Gram stain, catalase and a commercial kit. Oxacillin and chromogenic MRSA plates were used to confirm methicillin susceptibility. Forty-three scrub tops were sampled pre and post laundering. Of the pre laundering samples, 11 (26 %) were contaminated with S. aureus, 5 (45 %) of which survived the laundering process. There were two instances of S. aureus on the post sample but not the pre. These pilot study findings demonstrate that student nursing scrub tops may act as a vector for infectious microorganisms, and that traditional laundering practices may not remove all pathogens. Additional samples will be obtained, and laundry conditions analyzed for possible correlation to survival post laundry...|$|R
