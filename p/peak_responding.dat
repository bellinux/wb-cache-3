Multiple timing measures can be derived from <b>peak</b> <b>responding.</b> These measures are typically presented as averages across many trials based on the implicit assumption that <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> is stable throughout the session. We tested this assumption by examining whether <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> changed {{over the course of the}} session in 45 mice that were trained on a fixed-interval 30 -s schedule. All common measures of <b>peak</b> <b>responding,</b> except stop times, changed over the course of the session: start times increased, response rates and spreads decreased, and, although less reliably, peak times also shifted rightward. These results are congruent with a motivational interpretation, whereby increased satiety leads to the observed behavioral signature of within-session modulation of timed anticipatory responding...|$|E

The normalized demand analysis suggests that characteristics of averaged normalized demand curves {{may be used to}} predict progressive-ratio breakpoints and <b>peak</b> <b>responding.</b> By contrast, the demand analysis holds that traditional measures of relative reinforcer efficacy (breakpoint, peak response rate, and choice) correspond to specific characteristics of non-normalized demand curves.

Consistent with the first approach, predicted peak normalized response output values obtained under single-schedule conditions ordinally predicted progressive-ratio breakpoints and peak response rates obtained in a separate condition. Combining the minimum-needs hypothesis with the normalized demand analysis helped to interpret prior findings, but was less useful in predicting choice between food and water—two strongly complementary reinforcers. Predictions of the demand analysis had mixed success. Peak response outputs predicted from the non-normalized water demand curves were significantly correlated with obtained <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> for water in a separate condition, but none of the remaining three predicted correlations was statistically significant.

We briefly discuss sensor fabrication and show measured binding dynamics for example biomaterials {{in use in}} our laboratories.

These <b>peaks</b> <b>respond</b> uniquely to the biomolecular event, thereby enriching the data set available for event quantification. The peaks result from individual, polarization-dependent resonant leaky modes that are the foundation of this technology.

40|$|AC Analog {{voltmeters}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular electronic measuring instruments in use today. They are used to measure the RMS voltage of the many waveforms commonly found in electronics. This article will provide you with the basics of AC analog voltmeters. It will give you a better understanding of their operation, allowing you to select the right one for your particular measurement. The RMS or root-mean-square voltage is measured because this value gives us the most information about the waveform. The RMS voltage is equivalent to a DC voltage which produces the same heating effect as the AC signal being measured. For example, 1 volt of DC across a 1 ohm resistor will dissipate 1 watt. If we substitute any periodic waveform in place of the DC source and adjust its amplitude so that we again have 1 watt of power dissipated in the load, then our AC signal has an RMS or effective value of 1 volt. In addition to its RMS value, a waveform also has a peak and average voltage value. See Figure 1. ov This sine wave has an RMS value of 1 volt. Its peak value is 1. 4 times its RMS value, or 1. 4 volts. Its rectified average or DC value is. 636 times the peak or. 9 volts in the above example. AC voltmeters are designed to respond to one of these three values. This classifies the meters into true RMS responding, average responding and <b>peak</b> <b>responding.</b> The average and <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> voltmeters are designed to measure only sine waves. Average Responding With an average responding voltmeter, a sine wave being measured is fed through a DC blocking capacitor, amplified or attenuated, rectified by the diode bridge and fed to the meter. The meter then responds to this rectified average or DC value. The average value of a sine wave is zero, so when we say average responding we mean the rectified average or DC component after rectification. This DC component deflects a d’Arsonval (moving coil) meter to indicate the RMS value of a sine wave...|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{findings}} suggest that the dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) plays a role in timing of appetitive conditioned responding. The present article explored the relationship between the extent of DHPC damage and timing ability, in a pooled analysis of three published studies from our laboratory. Initial analyses of variance confirmed our previous reports that DHPC damage reduced peak time (a measure of timing accuracy). However, the spread (a measure of timing precision) was unchanged, such that the coefficient of variation (spread/peak time) was significantly larger in DHPC-lesioned animals. This implies that, in addition to the well-established effect of DHPC lesions on timing accuracy, DHPC damage produced a deficit in precision of timing. To complement this analysis, different generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) were performed on the combined dataset, to examine which combinations of the different behavioral measures of timing were the best predictors of the degree of hippocampal damage. The results from the GLMM analysis suggested that the greater the DHPC damage, the greater the absolute difference between the observed peak time and reinforced duration. Nevertheless, this systematic relationship between damage and performance was not specific to the temporal domain: paradoxically the greater the damage the greater the magnitude of <b>peak</b> <b>responding.</b> We discuss these lesion effects in terms of scalar timing theory...|$|E

Compared the kinetic energy with the wind stress work and the pressure work, it is also found that the barotropic pressure work which is mainly contributed by the sea surface height (SSH) corresponding to the mesoscale eddies behaves like the kinetic energy. The contribution of the mesoscale eddies to the kinetic energy can be up to 90 % sometimes and reach deep level every time. Using the satellite altimeter data, the paths of mesoscale eddies contributing to the kinetic energy variability are traced back. In the winter half of the year, the mesoscale eddies propagating along the northern South China Sea shelf or across the basin from the west of the Philippines toward Xisha arrive at Xisha, influencing the kinetic energy.

These vegetation trends have been linked to Arctic sea ice decline and thus to the sea ice/albedo feedback known as Arctic amplification. However, the interactions between climate, sea ice and tundra vegetation remain poorly understood. Here we reveal a 50 - year growth response over a > 100, 000 km 2 area to a rise in summer temperature for alder (Alnus) and willow (Salix), the most abundant shrub genera respectively at and north of the continental treeline.

40|$|We review {{empirical}} data from both ethology and psychology about generalization, {{that is how}} animals respond to sets of stimuli including familiar as well as novel stimuli. Our main conclusion is that many characteristics of generalization are universal behavioural phenomena, suggesting that they originate from general properties of nervous mechanisms and/or that evolutionary strategies to cope with novelty and variability in stimulation are limited. We also reach the following conclusions. First, patterns of generalization are largely independent of systematic group (evidence is available for insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans), behavioural context (feeding, drinking, orientation, etc.), modality (light, sound, etc.) and of whether reaction to stimuli is learned or genetically inherited. Second, two major shapes of the generalization gradient can be identified, corresponding to two types of stimulus dimensions. When changes in stimulation involve a rearrangement of a constant amount of stimulation on the sense organs, the generalization gradient peaks close to familiar stimuli, and <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> is not much higher than responding to familiar stimuli. When the dimension involves increase or decrease of the intensity of stimulation, the gradient is often monotonic, and responding to some novel stimuli is considerably stronger than responding to familiar stimuli, compared to non-intensity dimensions. Third, rearrangement gradients are better described by Gaussian curves, rather than exponential...|$|E
40|$|Mephedrone (MMC) is a {{relatively}} new recreational drug that has rapidly increased in popularity in recent years. This study explored the characteristics of intravenous MMC self-administration in the rat, with methamphetamine (METH) used as a comparator drug. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to nose poke for intravenous MMC or METH in daily 2 h sessions over a 10 d acquisition period. Dose-response functions were then established under fixed- and progressive-ratio (FR and PR) schedules over three subsequent weeks of testing. Brains were analyzed ex vivo for striatal serotonin (5 -HT) and dopamine (DA) levels and metabolites, while autoradiography assessed changes in the regional density of 5 -HT and serotonin transporter (SERT) and DA transporter (DAT) and induction of the inflammation marker translocator protein (TSPO). Results showed that MMC was readily and vigorously self-administered via the intravenous route. Under a FR 1 schedule, <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> for MMC was obtained at 0. 1 mg/kg/infusion, versus 0. 01 mg/kg/infusion for METH. Break points under a PR schedule peaked at 1 mg/kg/infusion MMC versus 0. 3 mg/kg/infusion for METH. Final intakes of MMC were 31. 3 mg/kg/d compared to 4 mg/kg/d for METH. Rats self-administering MMC, but not METH, gained weight at a slower rate than control rats. METH, but not MMC, self-administration elevated TSPO receptor density in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, while MMC, but not METH, self-administration decreased striatal 5 -hydroxyindolacetic acid (5 -HIAA) concentrations.

40|$|Floods and {{droughts}} are common, recurring {{natural hazards}} in East African nations. Studies of hydro-climatology at daily, seasonal, and annual time scale {{is an important}} in understanding and ultimately minimizing the impacts of such hazards. Using daily in-situ data {{over the last two}} decades combined with the recently available multiple-years satellite remote sensing data, we analyzed and simulated, with a distributed hydrologic model, the hydro-climatology in Nzoia, one of the major contributing sub-basins of Lake Victoria in the East African highlands. The basin, with a semi arid climate, has no sustained base flow contribution to Lake Victoria. The short spell of high discharge showed that rain is the prime cause of floods in the basin. There is only a marginal increase in annual mean discharge over the last 21 years. The 2 -, 5 - and 10 -year peak discharges, for the entire study period showed that more years since the mid 1990 's have had high peak discharges despite having relatively less annual rain. The study also presents the hydrologic model calibration and validation results over the Nzoia Basin. The spatiotemporal variability of the water cycle components were quantified using a physically-based, distributed hydrologic model, with in-situ and multi-satellite remote sensing datasets. Moreover, the hydrologic capability of remote sensing data such as TRMM- 3 B 42 V 6 was tested in terms of reconstruction of the water cycle components. The spatial distribution and time series of modeling results for precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and change in storage (dS/dt) showed considerable agreement with the monthly model runoff estimates and gauge observations. Runoff values responded to precipitation events that occurred across the catchment during the wet season from March to early June. The hydrologic model captured the spatial variability of the soil moisture storage. The spatially distributed model inputs, states, and outputs, were found to be useful for understanding the hydrologic behavior at the catchment scale. Relatively high flows were experienced near the basin outlet from previous rainfall, with a new flood <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> to the rainfall in the upper part of the basin. The monthly peak runoff was observed in the months of April, May and November. The analysis revealed a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff for both wet and dry seasons.

40|$|The {{documented}} {{decline of}} amphibian populations {{over the past}} two decades has increased attention towards amphibian conservation. Much of this attention has been focused on testing hypotheses as to the causal factors of these declines, however providing convincing data to support any of these hypotheses has proved difficult. The testing of these hypotheses and the implementation of endangered species recovery programs has been restricted by a lack of knowledge of the ecology and population demography of amphibian species that have suffered dramatic declines. This thesis presents aspects of the research phase of the recovery program for the Southern Corroboree Frog, Pseudophryne corroboree, a species that declined to very low numbers during the early 1980 's. In particular, this research aimed to determine the distribution, abundance, population dynamics and demography of this rare species. A complete reassessment of the conservation status of P. corroboree was undertaken and the nature of the persistence of this species across the landscape was analysed. Temporal trends in abundance and its relationship with population size were also investigated. Early life-history survivorship and recruitment to metamorphosis were studied at the scale of individual nest sites and populations, and the adult male population age structure and annual mortality were investigated using skeletochronology. The shout/response survey technique was used to survey and monitor the number of breeding male P. corroboree during this study. This method was found to provide consistent results when the surveys were conducted over a short (two week) period during the peak breeding season in January. Neither time of day, nor the number of males present at a pool, was found to influence the level of responsiveness of male P. corroboree to the shout/response technique. Variation in the number of responding males to the shout/response technique through the breeding season, assessed at a single site over two seasons, was unimodal with the <b>peak</b> <b>responding</b> period occurring during the last two weeks of January during both the 1998 and the 1999 breeding seasons. A systematic survey covering 213 sites across the entire historic distribution of P. corroboree found this species to be persisting at 79 sites. The majority of these sites were in the northwestern portion of the species former range, around the Jagungal Wilderness area, while no extant sites were found in the south-eastern portion of the species former range in the Smiggin Holes and Perisher Blue ski resorts area. The overall abundance of males at persistent sites was extremely low, with 92 percent of sites having fewer than ten responding males. Only one site was found to support greater than fifty responding males. A logistic regression analysis found the persistence of P. corroboree to be associated with increased number of pools within a site, decreased distance to nearest extant population and geographic position (latitude and longitude) in the landscape. While annual variation was observed in the number of breeding males for individual sites, there was no overall trend for an increase or decrease in the number of males, regardless of population size. The average annual extinction rate for local populations was five percent during this study, with those populations becoming extinct having very few breeding males (between one and three) during the previous season. Embryonic and tadpole survivorship was monitored for individual nests at three sites across three years. Recruitment to metamorphosis for P. corroboree was characterised by high variation in survivorship between nest sites, populations and years, while overall recruitment for nest sites was skewed towards lower survivorship. Average nest survivorship to metamorphosis across all sites and years was ten percent but the skewed nature of this survivorship meant that the majority of nest sites attained very low or no survivorship. The low proportion of nest sites that did attain high survivorship provided the greatest contribution to overall recruitment. The levels of embryonic and tadpole mortality observed in this study would be providing a considerable contribution to the regulation of current population sizes. The greatest level of early life-history mortality was observed during the late autumn/winter egg and tadpole stage, with high survivorship during the summer and early autumn egg stage and the post-winter tadpole stage. The estimated sex ratio for seven populations, based on the number of eggs within male nest sites, indicated that for most populations, regardless of population size, there was a greater proportion of females to males. In general, the estimated sex ratio of smaller populations showed greater annual variation and had a lower average number of females to males than the single large population. Tadpole surveys conducted across remnant populations during both 1998 and 1999 found recruitment to metamorphosis to be very low for the majority of populations. A third of all populations during both years attained no recruitment to metamorphosis, with those populations that did attain recruitment typically having fewer than 20 tadpoles. While sites with more frogs generally recruited more tadpoles, there was no strong relationship between population size and the number of tadpoles recruited per male at the scale of either pool or site. There was also no significant difference in recruitment levels between the two years. Tadpole surveys across breeding pools within the single large population also found very low tadpole abundance. There was no strong relationship between the number of male frogs at a pool and the number of tadpoles per male and there was no significant difference in tadpole abundance between the two years. Based on the low density of males at pools and sites (typically less than five), and the skewed nature of nest survivorship identified from monitoring individual nest sites, it seems likely that both deterministic and stochastic factors are influencing recruitment levels in remnant populations of P. corroboree. This study determined that adult male P. corroboree could be accurately aged using the technique of skeletochronology, and this technique was used to determine the adult male population age structure for three populations. The results indicated that adult male P. corroboree can reach sexual maturity from metamorphosis in three years, but the majority of individuals take four years. The oldest individual identified in this study was nine years old from metamorphosis. The adult male age structure at the single large site showed very little annual variation, whereas the two smaller populations showed highly pulsed age structures from one year to the next. The size of adult males was found to be a poor predictor of age. Annual adult male survivorship, calculated by following cohorts from one year to the next, was 55 percent. Based on this calculation of annual adult male survivorship, it seems likely that the initial decline in P. corroboree involved increased levels of adult mortality. The results of this study indicate that the persistence of. corroboree in the wild is precarious in the short-term. For this reason, it is recommended that efforts be undertaken to secure this species ex situ. Attempts to increase population numbers in the wild would greatly benefit from determining the factor(s) that have caused the decline in this species, however, failure to do so should not preclude field experimental management aimed at developing technique to increase the size of remnant populations. This is because it is likely that small population stochasticity is contributing to the current regulation of population size and it is possible that the factors that caused the decline in this species cannot be removed from the environment...|$|E

Both positive and negative phases have been noticed in this study. The positive storm phase over equatorial station {{is found to be}} more frequent, while the drop in ionization in most of the cases was observed at low-latitude station. It is concluded that the reaction as seen at different ionospheric stations may be quite different during the same storm depending on both the geographic and geomagnetic coordinates of the station, storm intensity, and the storm onset time. Modulation in the F- 2 layer critical frequency at low and equatorial stations during geomagnetic disturbance of 20 - 23 November 2003 was caused by the storm-induced changes in O/N- 2.

In this paper, we explore various scenarios for the cloud formation based on the underlying principle that the source of plasma is ultimately that portion of the gas trapped by the central black hole from the interstellar medium. Based on {{what we know about the}} Galactic Center, it is likely that in highly dynamic environments such as this, the supply of matter is due mostly to stellar winds from the central cluster. Winds accreting onto a central black hole are subjected to several disturbances capable of producing shocks, including a Bondi-Hoyle flow, stellar wind-wind collisions, and turbulence. Shocked gas is initially compressed and heated out of thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field; a cooling instability sets in as the gas is cooled via inverse-Compton and bremsstrahlung processes. If the cooling time is less than the dynamical flow time through the shock region, the gas may clump to form the clouds responsible for broad line emission seen in many AGN spectra. Clouds produced by this process display the correct range of densities and velocity fields seen in broad emission lines. Very importantly, the cloud distribution agrees with the results of reverberation studies, in which it is seen that the central line <b>peak</b> <b>responds</b> slower to continuum changes than the line wings.

30|$|In this paper, a {{detailed}} mathematical formulation coordinating the pumped-storage and battery-storage problem is proposed {{to accommodate the}} reverse peak regulation and variability characters of the wind power. The proposed method can be extended to any combination of high-capacity and fast-response energy storages. Based on the characters of pumped-storage and battery-storage, a practical framework for the optimal operation of Day-Ahead plan and Intra-Day scheduling is designed. Three cases {{have been used to}} study the advantages of the coordination of pumped-storage and battery-storage in three test systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the coordination method has good performance in the aspects of shifting <b>peak</b> load, <b>responding</b> to the wind power ramping, reducing the curtailment of wind and steadying the output of thermal units.|$|R
30|$|Growing {{penetration}} of wind power challenges to power system security, since the conventional generators {{may not have}} sufficient capacity to compensate wind power fluctuation plus the reverse peak regulation. In this paper, the high-capacity pumped-storage and fast-response battery-storage are coordinated to compensate the variation of both wind power and load, aiming at shifting <b>peak</b> load, <b>responding</b> to wind power ramping, reducing the curtailment of wind and stabilizing the output of thermal units. A practical framework is designed for optimizing {{the operation of the}} hybrid system consisting of the wind, pumped-storage, and battery storage, which can take full advantages of pumped-storage and battery-storage. The detailed mathematical formulations of the pumped-storage and battery-storage are built. Three cases are studied to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed coordination method.|$|R
40|$|Rats {{were trained}} on a mixed fixed-interval {{schedule}} in which stimulus A (tone or light) indicated food availability after 10 s and stimulus B (the other stimulus) indicated food availability after 20 s. Testing consisted of nonreinforced probe trials {{in which the}} stimulus was A, B, or the compound AB. On single-stimulus trials, rats <b>responded</b> with a <b>peak</b> of activity around the programmed reinforced time. On compound-stimulus trials, rats showed a single scalar <b>peak</b> of <b>responding</b> at a time midway between those for stimulus A and B. These results suggest that when provided with discrepant information regarding the temporal predictability of reinforcement, rats compute an average of the scheduled reinforcement times for the A and B stimuli and use this average to generate an expectation of reward for the compound stimuli...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{study of}} the seasonal variations of the subauroral electron temperature enhancement was undertaken {{using data from the}} Langmuir probe experiment on the DE 2 satellite throughout most of the mission (1981 - 1982). In the winter hemisphere the nighttime background electron temperature is the highest and the magnitude of the <b>peak</b> Te <b>responds</b> most weakly to the geomagnetic activity. This behavior can be explained by seasonal trends in the nighttime downward heat flux due to conjugate photoelectrons. Moreover, model results indicate that a factor of about three increase in heat inflow during equinox relative to solstice is required to raise the electron temperature to a given level. This is a consequence of the higher electron densities at the Te peak near equinox. The Te peak occurs on field lines which thread the outer plasmasphere in the vicinity if the plasmapause and thus {{can be used as a}} tracer of the plasmapause position...|$|R
40|$|The {{respiration}} {{of fresh}} slices of preclimacteric avocado (Persea americana Mill. var. Hass) and banana (Musa cavendishii var. Valery) fruits is stimulated by cyanide and antimycin. The respiration {{is sensitive to}} m-chlorobenzhydroxamic acid {{in the presence of}} cyanide but much less so in the presence of antimycin. In the absence of cyanide the contribution of the cyanide-resistant pathway to the coupled preclimacteric respiration is zero. In uncoupled slices, by contrast, the alternate path is engaged and utilized fully in avocado, and extensively in banana. Midclimacteric and peak climacteric slices are also cyanide-resistant and, in the presence of cyanide, sensitive to m-chlorobenzhydroxamic acid. In the absence of uncoupler there is no contribution by the alternate path in either tissue. In uncoupled midclimacteric avocado slices the alternate path is fully engaged. Midclimacteric banana slices, however, do not respond to uncouplers, and the alternate path is not engaged. Avocado and banana slices at the climacteric <b>peak</b> neither <b>respond</b> to uncouplers nor utilize the alternate path in {{the presence or absence of}} uncoupler...|$|R
30|$|With the {{large-scale}} wind power grid integration, shifting <b>peak</b> load and <b>responding</b> {{to the wind}} power variations become challenging problems. Limited by the adjustable level and ramping rate, the conventional units may not have sufficient capacity {{to deal with these}} problems. Storage systems provide an effective way to settle both problems because they can quickly balance the power. However, the utilization of most storage systems is barricaded by the techno-economical feasibilities [1]. For example, compressed-air energy storage [2] and spinning flywheel are considerably complex in practice; the cost of large-scale ultra-capacitors is expensive. Pumped-storage and battery-storage are two most mature and widespread technologies used in practice [3, 4].|$|R
40|$|How pigeons generalize across patial {{locations}} {{was examined}} in the 4 experiments reported in this article. During training, a square was presented at a fixed height at 1 of 2 horizontal locations on a monitor screen. One location (S +) signaled reward, whereas the other one (S-) signaled no reward. The birds were then tested occasionally {{with a range of}} locations. After training with S+ only, the generalization gradient peaked at S + and was approximately Gaussian in shape. After training with equal numbers of S + and S- trials, response rates were higher on the S + side of the distribution. This asymmetry diminished over testing. When the S + and S- were close together, the <b>peak</b> of <b>responding</b> was shifted on initial generalization tests. Generalization gradients along the orthogonal vertical dimension were approximately exponential in shape. This is the first demonstration f generalization and peak shift in the spatial domain. An important task for the experimental analysis of behavior has been to understand how stimuli present when behavior is reinforced to gain control over the behavior.

40|$|The present {{experiment}} examined whether discrimination learning {{shapes the}} single-peaked response distributions usually obtained with the peak procedure. Two sources {{of learning in}} pigeons were disclosed: learning to respond near the time of reinforcement on fixed interval (FI) trials and learning to withhold responding once the FI duration had elapsed on peak interval (PI) trials. Pigeons also produced a highly unexpected second <b>peak</b> in <b>responding</b> on nonreinforced PI trials at 3 times the FI duration. Follow-up experiments showed that a 1 : 4 FI:PI duration ratio supported double peaks, but only 1 peak was obtained with a 1 : 8 FI:PI duration ratio. Finally, 4 peaks could be observed on extra-long PI trials under a 1 : 4 : 8 FI:PI:PI ratio procedure. The multiple-peaked response distributions are an unprecedented finding that present a major challenge to any theory of time perception. In the 25 years since Catania (1970, p. 11) first proposed the peak procedure {{as a means of}} gaining further insight into the discriminative control of operant behavior by the pas-sage of time, it has become a very popular method of studying the temporal control of operant responding (e. g. ...|$|R
