25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} is a variable condition; {{the degree of}} severity is not tightly linked to whether it is Usher I, II, or III. For example, someone with type III may be unaffected in childhood, but go on to develop a <b>profound</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and a very significant loss of sight by early to midadulthood. Similarly, someone with type I, who is therefore profoundly deaf from birth, may keep good central vision until the sixth decade of life, or even beyond. People with type II, who have useful hearing with a hearing aid, can experience {{a wide range of}} severity of the RP. Some may maintain good reading vision into their 60s, while others cannot see to read while still in their 40s.|$|E
2500|$|Most private {{healthcare}} providers in the United States {{do not provide}} coverage for hearing aids, so all costs are usually borne by the recipient. The cost for a single hearing aid can vary between $500 and $6,000 or more, depending {{on the level of}} technology and whether the clinician bundles fitting fees into the cost of the hearing aid. Though if an adult has a hearing loss which substantially limits major life activities, some state-run vocational rehabilitation programs can provide upwards of full financial assistance. Severe and <b>profound</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> often falls within the [...] "substantially limiting" [...] category. Less expensive hearing aids {{can be found on the}} internet or mail order catalogs, but most in the under-$200 range tend to amplify the low frequencies of background noise, making it harder to hear the human voice.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: The cochlea and {{vestibule}} {{are related}} developmentally. Therefore individuals with severe to <b>profound</b> sensourineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> have additional risk for vestibular dysfunction. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess saccular function using vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) in children with severe to <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (SNHL) who are candidates for cochlear implant. Methods: Thirty children (17 males and 13 females) with bilateral severe to <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in the age range of 3 - 15 years participated in this study. 17 children (9 males and 8 females) with normal hearing in the age range of 3 - 13 years participated as the control group. All children in each group were evaluated for saccular function by performing vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in both ears. Results: Comparison of mean threshold values between the two groups revealed statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05). In addition, comparison of mean amplitude values between the two groups revealed statistically significant difference (p 0. 05). Out of the 30 children with bilateral severe to <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> eight children (26. 66 %) had absent VEMP responses in both ears. Conclusion: Children with severe to <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> who are candidates for cochlear implant ha d more potential for saccular abnormalities compared to normal-hearing children. Therefore, assessment of vestibular function is very important in this population...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The study aims {{to compare}} the {{performance}} of hearing aids fitted according to the NAL-NL 1 and DSL v 5 prescriptive procedure for children. Design: This is a crossover four period trial. Study sample: Sixteen school-aged children with moderately severe to <b>profound</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> participated in the study. The children were fitted with Phonak Naida V SP hearing aids according to the two prescriptive procedures. Results: The results showed that children performed significantly better with DSL v 5 than with NAL-NL 1 prescription for sentence perception in quiet. The paired-comparison judgments of speech intelligibility showed seven children significantly preferred the DSL v 5 prescription while two children preferred the NAL-NL 1 prescription. The average scores on functional and ratings by parents and teachers performance of children in real life were significantly better for the DSL v 5 prescription. At {{the end of all}} trials, nine children preferred the DSL v 5 prescription, four preferred the NAL-NL 1 prescription, and two had no preference. Conclusions: Hearing aids fitted based on the DSL v 5 procedure would seem to be more appropriate than the NAL-NL 1 procedure for children with moderately severe to <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> at least in quiet listening environments. 11 page(s...|$|R

ObjectiveTo study P 300 in subjects with severe or <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> MethodsThis was a descriptive cross-sectional prospective study. It included 29 individuals of both genders with severe or <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> without other type of disorders, aged 11 to 42 years; all were assessed by behavioral audiological evaluation and auditory evoked potentials. ResultsA recording of the P 3 wave was obtained in 17 individuals, with a mean latency of 326. 97 ms and mean amplitude of 3. 76 V. There were significant differences in latency in relation to age and in amplitude according to degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> There was a statistically significant association of the P 300 results with the degrees of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (p= 0. 04), with the predominant auditory communication channels (p< 0. 0001), and with time of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> ConclusionsP 300 can be recorded in individuals with severe and <b>profound</b> congenital sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss; it may {{contribute to the}} understanding of cortical development and is a good predictor of the early intervention outcome...|$|R

To {{investigate}} the treatment {{outcome of a}} simultaneous labyrinthectomy and cochlear implantation in patients with single-sided MÃ©niÃ¨reâs disease and <b>profound</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Study Design. Prospective study. Method. Five patients with single-sided MÃ©niÃ¨reâs disease with active vertigo and functional deafness were included. In all cases, simultaneous cochlear implantation combined with labyrinthectomy surgery was performed. The outcome has been evaluated by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and speech recognition. Results. The combined labyrinthectomy and cochlear implantation led in all patients to a highly significant reduction of dizziness up to a restitutio ad integrum. After activation of the cochlear implant and rehabilitation, a mean monosyllabic speech understanding of 69 % at 65 [*]dB was observed. Conclusion.
