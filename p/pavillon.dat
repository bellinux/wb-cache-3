5|$|From 1789 until 1792, {{when the}} French royal court {{resided in the}} Tuileries, the {{apartment}} of {{the ground floor of}} the <b>Pavillon</b> de Flore housed the office of the princesse de Lamballe, being {{side by side with the}} apartment of queen Marie Antoinette in the ground floor of the main building of the Tuileries, while the first floor of the <b>Pavillon</b> housed the apartment of Madame Elisabeth.|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolution, the <b>Pavillon</b> de Flore {{was renamed}} <b>Pavillon</b> de l'Égalité (House of Equality). Under its new name, {{it became the}} meeting point for several of the Committees of the period. Many other {{committees}} of the Revolutionary Government occupied the Palais des Tuileries (referred to by contemporaries as the Palace of the Nation) {{during the time of}} the National Convention. Notable occupiers included the Monetary Committee, the Account and Liquidation Examination Committee. However, the most famous was the Committee of Public Safety.|$|E

It has been suggested that this is when the name <b>Pavillon</b> de Flore came into use, although the earliest known written mention is in 1726. <b>Pavillon</b> de Flore is the name used today, although other names have been used in between.|$|E

5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the <b>Pavillon</b> de Flore; due to {{the fragility of the}} paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E
5|$|US$525 {{million was}} {{paid by the}} city of Abu Dhabi {{for the use of the}} Louvre brand name, with US$195 million payable within a month. In {{addition}} to this, US$247 million will be paid for the loan of artworks from the Louvre over a ten-year period, with a total of between two hundred and three hundred artworks expected. The Parisian Louvre will also be providing management advice to its Middle Eastern counterpart, at a cost of US$214.5 million. An additional US$253.5 million will be paid for various special exhibitions. A total of four exhibitions will be hosted per year over a period of fifteen years. The city of Abu Dhabi will also make a direct donation of US$32.5 million to the Louvre to refurbish a wing of the <b>Pavillon</b> de Flore for the display of international art.|$|E
5|$|During the Restoration (1814–30), LouisXVIII and CharlesX {{between them}} added 135pieces {{at a cost}} of 720,000francs and created the {{department}} of Egyptian antiquities curated by Champollion, increased by more than 7,000works with the acquisition of antiquities in the Edme-Antoine Durand, the Egyptian collection of Henry Salt or the second collection former by Bernardino Drovetti. This was less than the amount given for rehabilitation of Versailles, and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris. After the creation of the French Second Republic in 1848, the new government allocated twomillion francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the Galerie d'Apollon, the Salon Carré, and the Grande Galérie. In 1861, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte bought 11,835artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the Campana collection. During the Second French Empire, between 1852 and 1870, the French economy grew; by 1870 the museum had added 20,000new pieces to its collections, and the <b>Pavillon</b> de Flore and the Grande Galérie were remodelled under architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel.|$|E

5|$|The six storied Baden-Powell House is {{designed}} in the modern architectural style, as pioneered by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a LeCorbusier architectural design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his <b>Pavillon</b> Suisse at the Cité Internationale Universitaire in Paris. Additionally, LeCorbusier's Sainte Marie de La Tourette priory in Lyon shows two floors of monk's cells with small windows, cantilevered over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the facade of Baden-Powell House. While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern architectural style of LeCorbusier, he used more architectural restraint in his own design choices. For example, he made the main visible building component brick rather than concrete. This heavier evolution of LeCorbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the Brutalist style in the later 1960s.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, Gleizes was {{commissioned}} to paint murals for the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at the Paris World’s Fair.

At {{the end of}} 1938, Gleizes volunteered {{to participate in the}} free seminars and discussion groups for young painters set up by Robert Delaunay at his Paris studio. Then Gleizes, in collaboration with Jacques Villon, conceived the idea of executing a mural for the auditorium of the École des Arts et Métiers; the latter was rejected by the school authorities as too abstract, but immense panels by Gleizes survive as Four Legendary Figures of the Sky (San Antonio, TX, McNay A. Inst.). Other examples of this ambitious public style include The Transfiguration (1939–41; Lyon, Mus. B.-A.).|$|E
