We obtain an existence theorem and a characterization theorem of Nash equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> <b>for</b> two-player nonzero-sum stochastic differential games with nonlinear cost functionals defined {{with the help of}} doubly controlled backward stochastic differential equations. Our results extend former ones by Buckdahn et al. (2004) [3] and are based on a backward stochastic differential equation approach...|$|R
25|$|In {{games with}} mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, the {{probability}} of a player choosing any particular strategy can be computed by assigning a variable to each strategy that represents a fixed probability for choosing that strategy. In order for a player to be willing to randomize, their expected <b>payoff</b> <b>for</b> each strategy should be the same. In addition, the sum of the probabilities for each strategy of a particular player should be 1. This creates a system of equations from which the probabilities of choosing each strategy can be derived.|$|E
25|$|For many {{classes of}} options, {{traditional}} valuation techniques are intractable {{because of the}} complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the underlying asset, each of which results in a <b>payoff</b> <b>for</b> the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an expectation value for the option. Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for American styled options is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.|$|E

The message further stressed the importance of Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ in a quick return to constitutional rule and the need, therefore, for the junta to include him in an interim regime. Lodge replied affirmatively, indicating the United States should encourage other friendly countries to publicly recognize the new junta first with the assurance that the US would follow suit shortly thereafter. The United States would then resume the Commercial Import Program (CIP) that had been suspended in the meantime. Lodge advised the CIP be resumed quietly to avoid the appearance that it was a <b>payoff</b> <b>for</b> the coup.|$|E

40|$|Decisions {{involving}} {{charitable giving}} often occur {{under the shadow}} of risk. A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behavior could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this paper shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky <b>payoffs</b> <b>for</b> themselves and risky <b>payoffs</b> <b>for</b> a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing <b>payoffs</b> <b>for</b> themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types. Charitable giving; prosocial behavior; altruism; risk preferences...|$|R
50|$|A {{symmetric}} {{game is a}} {{game where}} the <b>payoffs</b> <b>for</b> playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them.

On the eve of the January transfer window, chief executive Peter Pannu confirmed that player sales were necessary to stave off the risk of administration.
