40|$|Abstract The usual {{formulas}} for estimating {{tree density}} from prism cruise data presume that dbh has been measured exactly. In practice, trees are often tallied by diameter class using inexact measurements. Without further information, this can bias estimates of tree density, especially for trees of small diameter or trees in wide diameter classes. Here, tables of expansion factors that utilize prior information about stand diameter distribution are presented and compared with conventional methods of estimating tree density. The {{context of the}} cruise, and assumptions about the stand, {{have important implications for}} measurement and calculation protocols in <b>prism</b> <b>cruising...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Snags and cavity {{trees are}} {{important}} structural features in forests, {{but they are}} often sparsely distributed, making efficient inventories problematic. We present a straightforward modification of horizontal line sampling designed to facilitate inventory of these features while remaining compatible with commonly employed sampling methods for the living overstory. The method is simpler in its implementation than traditional horizontal line sampling. We develop unbiased estimators and present methods for dealing with special cases, including boundary overlap. A field test of the method shows it to have time efficiency comparable with or better than ordinary <b>prism</b> <b>cruising,</b> and it requires far fewer sample locations to achieve similar confidence limits. The method may also be useful for inventorying other rare or unusual trees...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{probability}} {{proportional to}} size sampling, including <b>prism</b> <b>cruising</b> {{and other forms}} of point and line sampling, calculation of an exact expansion factor requires that size be recorded exactly. When sizes are binned or recorded by class, this information is lost. While several alternatives for calculating the expansion factor have been proposed, theoretical attention has been lacking. A decision-theoretic perspective helps distinguish between the alternatives and offers some support {{to the use of the}} arithmetic mean size in calculating the expansion factor, a choice which had previously come under some criticism. However, consistency arguments strongly favor estimators based on squared error loss or minimax principles. Some new alternatives are suggested when prior information about the diameter distribution in a stratum is available...|$|E

They will describe the results of several current observation programs: 1. Buoy Network for Puget Sound, a private-public partnership between industry and the University of Washington. 2.

However, because these tables are based on site classes, they are not directly applicable to uneven-aged mixed- wood cover types. A four-parameter nonlinear model was employed to express various stand attributes as a function of stand age and recently developed basal area indices for the major species in Ontario. The resulting variable stockingyield functions will be applicable to even-aged stands as well as the boreal mixedwood. Basal area index proved superior to site index for esti- mating both merchantable basal area and volume for the James RiverJMarathon data set representing boreal mixed from Northcentral Ontario. In addition, stand basal area index may be determined easily and inexpensively via horizontal point sampling or <b>prism</b> <b>cruising...</b>|$|E
