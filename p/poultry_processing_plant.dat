40|$|Food safety {{technology}} can increase a company’s capacity {{to prevent a}} foodborne contamination. A food safety audit—a quality control tool in which an auditor observes whether a <b>plant’s</b> <b>processing</b> practices and technologies are compatible with good food safety practices—can indicate how effectively food {{safety technology}} is being used. Fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and other major customers of meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> conduct their own audits or hire auditors to assess the soundness of a <b>plant’s</b> <b>processing</b> operation. Meat and poultry plants can also audit themselves {{as a way to}} help maintain process control. In this report, we document the extent of food safety audits in meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants.</b> We also examine the associations between the use of audits and plant size, firm structure, and food safety technology use. Results show that larger plants, plants subject to food safety audits, and plants that are part of a multiplant firm use more food safety technology than other plants. Plants subject to both plant-hired and customer-hired audits had greater technology use than single (plant- or customer-hired) audit <b>plants.</b> Meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>processing,</b> safety standards, product recalls, food safety technology, food safety audits, Agribusiness, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Industrial Organization, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Predetermined {{areas from}} 24 {{selected}} {{pieces of equipment}} in thirteen Georgia <b>poultry</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> were swabbed prior to start-up and before and after midday cleanup on two consecutive days {{in an attempt to}} detect potential sources of contamination and to determine the effectiveness of the cleanup procedure. A moistened calcium alginate swab was used to take samples {{from the surface of the}} equipment. A one percent sodium citrate solution was used in making serial dilutions. Significantly less contamination of equipment was found on Mondays than Tuesdays. Picker fingers were found to be the most difficult piece of equipment to clean. Knives and scissors used in the evisceration procedure and in cut-up operations were found to be highly contaminated before start-up in most of the plants surveyed which indicated inadequate clean-up. When scald tanks and chillers were permitted to overflow during lunch break, a dilution effect occurred which reduced the microbial load. Microbial counts of ice ranged from a low of 10 to a high of 4, 500 per ml. Packaging materials were found to have higher microbial counts prior to start-up than before or after lunch break. Gloves were found to be more highly con-taminated than the hands of the employees wearing the gloves. I t was concluded that <b>poultry</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> need the information which a microbio-logical survey can provide in order to locate potential sources of microbial contamination throughout the plant. The control or elimination of such contamination can result in increased shelf life of the product...|$|R
