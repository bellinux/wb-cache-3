40|$|This paper {{considers}} Shigeo Okamura’s Principles of Social Welfare (1983) {{by discussing}} the logical structure of Okamura’s social welfare theory, as grounded as a “unique social welfare perspective”, and then elucidates {{some of the}} challenges to its further development. The features of Okamura’s social welfare theory may be summarized as follows: (1) a critical collaboration between “legislated” and “voluntary” models of social welfare, (2) a “unique social welfare perspective” grounded in the “basic requirements of social life” and “subjective aspects of social relations”, and (3) the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> that are derived from this “unique social welfare perspective. ” To further the development of Okamura’s social welfare theory, the following questions arise. Does social welfare develop irrevocably along a single track? Can the basic requirements of social life still have any validity today? Is the assistance derived from his unique social welfare perspective effective in actual practice? What sort of challenges to social structures could render such assistance effective? By corroborating such challenges {{with a focus on}} the ordinary people’s perspectives, {{it will be possible to}} facilitate the further development and expansion of Okamura’s social welfare theory. 本論では、岡村重夫の『社会福祉原論』（ 1983 年）をテキストとし、「社会福祉固有の視点」にもとづく岡村社会福祉論の論理構造を検討し、発展的検討に向けた課題の一端を明らかにした。岡村の社会福祉論の特徴は、（１）「法律による社会福祉」と「自発的な社会福祉」との批判的協力関係、（２）「社会生活の基本的要求」と「社会関係の主体的側面」に基づく「社会福祉固有の視点」、（３）「社会福祉固有の視点」から導き出される援助の原理、という３点にまとめることができる。岡村社会福祉論の更なる展開のために以下のような課題が引き出される。社会福祉は後戻りすることなく単線的に発展するのか。社会生活の基本的要求は今日においても妥当性を持ちうるのか。社会福祉固有の視点から導き出される援助は実際に有効なのだろうか。そうした援助を有効なものとしうる社会構造上の課題とはいかなるものなのか。生活当事者の視点を中心に据えた検証作業によって、岡村社会福祉論の発展は可能となる...|$|E
40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> {{says that}} the global rich should help the global poor because {{they are able to}} do so, and at little cost.

This paper explores {{the relationship between the two}} principles and offers support for one version <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance.</b> The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> is most plausible, the paper argues, when formulated so as to identify obligations that arise from the needs of particular identifiable members of the global poor, not from impersonal rules or values. Under that formulation, the principle can explain why knowledge of the circumstances faced by individual members of the global poor can have such a marked effect upon the willingness of the global rich to provide help, and can offer a better grounded motivational basis for helping the global poor. These are real advantages, the paper argues, and ones that cannot be matched by stories that focus upon the ways in which the global rich contribute to global poverty...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of relief to civilians in armed conflict is a sensitive activity, subject to specific regulation in IHL treaties. Challenges emerged {{on the ground}} have questioned the comprehensive nature of this legal framework and generated debate on the concept <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>assistance</b> itself, the role {{of different kinds of}} actors (local/external, governmental/nongovernmental, armed/unarmed) in providing it, and the value and meaning <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> traditionally associated to it—humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence. This research, examining the evolution of State practice and opinio juris, provides a comprehensive analysis of the legal regime applicable to the {{provision of}} relief to civilians in armed conflict and the different categories of actors involved in it, identifying answers offered by international law (primarily IHL) to issues emerged in practice. It is argued that humanitarian assistance is a well-defined and limited concept under IHL. Rules on this issue have been subject to progressive development, e. g. those on the protection of humanitarian workers in non-international armed conflict, but State practice has revealed that sovereignty remains important, and the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>assistance</b> continue to embody the balance acceptable to States between military necessity and humanitarian considerations. No right to access or to provide humanitarian assistance without consent from the Parties concerned has developed, including no right to provide relief in non-international armed conflict in territory controlled by non-State armed groups without State consent. Participation in the provision <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>assistance</b> by local and external actors is not prohibited, but the level of protection they enjoy depends on their position under IHL. Different regimes are applicable to distinct armed actors (belligerents/peacekeepers/external armed forces/private security companies) but in all cases respect for the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> distinction is central. In general, special protection for relief actions and actors remains connected to respect for the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>assistance.</b> This has been confirmed by belligerents’ reactions to the increased engagement of humanitarian organisations in protection, as the second essential component of humanitarian action: belligerents have claimed their entitlement to require respect by humanitarian personnel also for the most contested principle—neutrality, meaning non-interference in hostilities and even abstention from involvement in politics...|$|R

On June 8, 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a law about chaplaincy in prisons #419-VIII [...] "On Amendments to Several Legislative Acts of Ukraine (regarding activity of chaplains in {{the bodies and}} institutions belonging to {{the jurisdiction of the}} State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine). Prison chaplaincy is now experiencing the time of revival after the long period of atheism. Prison pastoral care was {{at the very heart of}} spirituality of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church throughout her history. Now we cannot imagine any prison without presence of a chaplain. It was a merit of former heads of the State Penal Department of Ukraine Volodymyr Liovochkin, Ivan Shtanko and Vasyliy Koschinets. They opened the gates of any prison for church pastors. The workers of the Social, Educational and Psychological Service of the prison system of Ukraine were the main link assisting establishment of prison chaplaincy step by step. Prison Pastoral of the UGCC, though it is still very young, is taking successive steps to integrity. It was restored in 1990 after the Church, formerly forbidden, emerged from the underground. Pastoral care has grown steadily from several prison facilities in the Western Part of Ukraine to more than 40 penal institutions in every region of the country. The most active prison chaplains are the Redemptorist Fathers. Since 2001 the UGCC is the co-founder of the Ukrainian Interdenominational Christian Mission [...] "Spiritual and Charitable Care in Prisons" [...] including twelve Churches and Denominations. This Mission is a part of the World Association of Prison Ministry.|$|R

The humanitarian community’s {{strategy was to}} distribute assistance according to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> impartiality. A closer analysis, however, shows that assistance {{was not so much}} determined by need as by status and location – in other words, how people were displaced and their proximity to Goma had a large influence on the level <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> they received. This article argues that such imbalances can be partly explained by policies adopted within the humanitarian community: first, by privileging the political considerations of the Congolese Government when deciding which groups of internally displaced persons would receive better levels <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> and protection; secondly, through a growing unwillingness by many agencies to negotiate their own access to populations with all parties of the conflict; and thirdly, in an inflexibility towards programme financing and management, which added considerable bureaucratic delays and difficulties to the delivery <b>of</b> <b>assistance.</b> By reflecting on the choices made by aid agencies in the context of mass displacement, this article shows how humanitarianism can restrict rather than enhance the options of forcibly displaced populations...|$|R
