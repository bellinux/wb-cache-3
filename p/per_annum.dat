5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2014, Metallon Corporation was Zimbabwe's largest gold miner. The {{group is}} looking to {{increase}} its production to 500,000 ounces <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> by 2019.|$|E
5|$|External costs, also {{referred}} to as hidden costs, are quantifications of the environmental and climate impacts of air transport. Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely, figures have been produced for the most significant. In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £1.4billion, rising to £4.8billion <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> by 2030. The impact of noise was costed at around £25million <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> in 2000, and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £119million and £236million <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b> Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total external cost for 2000 of around £6billion.|$|E
5|$|This loss, totalling {{one-third of}} its passengers, would {{translate}} into revenue loss of some HK$17 million <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> for Star Ferry.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{noteworthy}} incidents have occurred across the massif {{over the last}} two centuries which stand out from the routine toll of mountain-related deaths, of which there are now approximately 100 <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nick Smith's Cabinet Paper {{noted that}} the New Zealand Treasury had {{estimated}} that the long-term costs of intensity-based allocation of units to industry and agriculture would be 'very significant', {{in the order of}} $NZ900 million <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> by 2030.|$|E
5|$|The University of Salford {{moved its}} media-related {{teaching}} and research to the MediaCityUK site in October 2011. The move will controversially cost the university more than £2.25million in rent <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> until 2020.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} receipts from 1852 to 1883 were £40,000 for all non-ore traffic, i.e. {{less than}} £1,300 a year. On 7 November 1898 traffic was suspended by {{agreement with the}} Ebbw Vale Company, who paid £5,000 <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> in compensation.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component of the city's economy is tourism which currently accounts for DKK 1.2 billion (US$200 million) <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b> Provisional figures show an increase of 16.6% in overnight stays for 2014. The cathedral and the Viking Ship Museum attract more than 100,000 visitors per year although 20 years ago there were some 200,000 visits to the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In 1737, the {{navigation}} was leased to {{three of the}} company shareholders for 14 years, and a new 7-year lease was made in 1751. After 1758, the company managed {{the navigation}} itself. Tolls for the next 10 years raised an average of £7006 <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> indicating healthy traffic levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1922 John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute, {{had sold}} the entire site {{and it was}} bought by the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited for £30,000, it was then leased to the Cardiff Athletic Club (cricket and rugby sections) for 99 years {{at a cost of}} £200 <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian jelly {{industry}} is worth approximately $1121million <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> and Aeroplane Jelly is the market leader with a 25% share. Over 19million packets of Aeroplane Jelly are sold each year. Strawberry flavour {{is the top}} selling jelly variant with nearly 2 million packs sold each year. In 1953, Aeroplane Jelly introduced Australia's first low calorie jelly. In 1988, in honour of the Australian Bicentenary, jelly was available in special Australian flavours such as Lilly Pilly, Quandong and Midjinberry. These flavours were phased out by 1992. Now Aeroplane Jelly is owned by American company, McCormicks foods; {{it used to be}} owned by Traders Pty Ltd. One of the least selling though was the lemon flavor which sold over 100,000 packets <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Glenlivet is {{the best}} selling malt whisky in the United States, and the fourth best selling in the UK with a 7% market share. The Glenlivet is the world's second best selling single malt whisky, and current global sales total 6 million bottles <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the new Skyway Monte Bianco cable car on the Italian side of the massif {{is expected to increase}} visitor numbers to Courmayeur from 100,000 to 300,000 <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> following complete replacement of an earlier cable car system in 2015. It takes tourists from La Palud up to the Torino Hut at its top on Pointe Helbronner.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{distillery}} {{is owned}} by the French alcoholic beverages company Pernod Ricard and they oversee the distillery's production of 5,900,000 proof litres <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b> The majority of this – enough for 6 million bottles – is sold as The Glenlivet single malt, with the remainder being used in Pernod Ricard's blended whisky brands.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, Christy {{accepted}} an assistant professorship at the University of Chicago, at {{a salary of}} $5,000 <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> twice {{what he had been}} making before the war. He moved back to Chicago in February 1946, but suitable housing was hard to find in the immediate post-war period, and Christy and his family shared a mansion with Edward Teller and his family.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of {{successful}} plays, Planché was never particularly wealthy, and he felt pressure from needing to support his grandchildren. Circumstances improved when in 1871 he was awarded a civil list pension of £100 <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> 'in recognition of his literary services'. Planché died {{at his home in}} Chelsea on 30 May 1880 at the age of 84. His wealth {{at the time of his}} death was under £1000.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
5|$|From 1888 to 1893, the Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} was leased by the United States Secretary of the Treasury for a {{total of}} US$1.00 (20 cents <b>per</b> <b>annum)</b> to the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club for use as its headquarters. It was listed as the southernmost yacht club in the United States, and the tallest in the world. After the lease expired, the yacht club moved to Coconut Grove, where it continues.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked closely}} with Nobel Prize-winning {{experimental}} physicist Ernest O. Lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers, helping them understand the data their machines were producing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 1936 Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3300 <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b> In return {{he was asked to}} curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, England leased these islands to the English East India Company in 1668 for a sum of £10 <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b> The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675. The islands were subsequently attacked by Yakut Khan, the Siddi admiral of the Mughal Empire, in October 1672, Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India on 20 February 1673, and Siddi admiral Sambal on 10 October 1673.|$|E
5|$|In recent centuries the Mendips, {{like the}} Cotswolds to the north, have been quarried for stone {{to build the}} cities of Bath and Bristol, as well as smaller towns in Somerset. The {{quarries}} are now major suppliers of road stone to southern England, among them producing around twelve million tonnes of limestone every year, employing over two thousand people, and turning over approximately £150million <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, the {{production}} declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, {{the products of}} Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, particularly by travelling Jewish traders from the city. At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna, Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained {{an important source of}} income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 francs <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|More {{detailed}} negotiations {{will begin}} with a final approval expected early in 2016. If the final agreement goes ahead, Cardiff Athletic Club would receive an upfront payment of approximately £8 million. As part of the agreement, the bowls section would have to vacate its current site at the Arms Park and {{move to a new}} facility. At present Cardiff Blues pay Cardiff Athletic Club rent of around £115,000 <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> however this would nearly double to around £200,000.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b> The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b> Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means. In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E
5|$|The Mont Blanc massif {{is now a}} {{significant}} tourist destination. The region attracts over sixmillion people <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> with around one in five gaining access to its slopes by means of mechanical infrastructure (cable cars or funicular railways). Some surveys have shown that tourists mostly come to the Mont Blanc massif and its environs for winter sports such as skiing as well as summer outdoor activities like hiking, climbing and cycling.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{statutory}} entitlement for {{paid holidays}} was increased from 4.8 to 5.6 weeks <b>per</b> <b>annum,</b> and Child Benefit was disregarded in calculating income for Housing and Council Tax Benefit {{as a means}} of improving work incentives and the incomes of many low-income families. Parents with children up to the age of 16 were given the statutory right to request flexible working arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The {{school is}} selective; {{admission}} {{is based on}} assessments in English, mathematics and reasoning, an academic reference from the applicant's current school and an interview. The main entry point to enter the Lower School is at age 7 (Year 3), and ages 11 (Year 7), 13 (Year 9) and 16 to enter the Senior School. There are academic, music and other scholarships which reduce school fees by up to one-fifth, as well as means-tested bursaries up to the entirety of school fees. In addition, the charitable trust of the Dyers' provide a bursary to cover half the school fees of one pupil in each academic year. Cathedral choristers also receive bursaries which cover half of school fees through the Norwich Cathedral Choir Endowment Fund. The fees for the 2013/2014 academic year for the Lower School are £11,997 <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> (£3,999 per term), and £13,167 <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> (£4,389 per term) for the Senior School. The school also charges fees for lunches and entries for public examinations.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms occur from May to September, {{that are}} {{occasionally}} severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Although downtown Boston {{has never been}} struck by a violent tornado, the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city. Boston has a relatively sunny climate for a coastal city at its latitude, averaging over 2,600 hours of sunshine <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of his father in 1853 Markham needed paid employment, and in December 1853 secured a junior clerkship in the Legacy Duty Office of the Inland Revenue at a salary of £90 <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> (around £6,000 in 2008). He found the work tedious, but after six months was able to {{transfer}} to the forerunner of what became, in 1857, the India Office. Here, the work was interesting and rewarding, with sufficient time to allow him to travel and pursue his geographical interests.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Government {{released}} a new Defence White Paper, Defence 2000 – Our Future Defence Force that placed {{a greater emphasis}} on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year; in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> in real terms in the period to 2012–13. In 2003 and 2005, the Defence Updates emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Melbourne {{received}} the International Air Transport Association Eagle Award for service and two National Tourism Awards for tourism services. The airport comprises four terminals: one international terminal, two domestic terminals and one budget domestic terminal. Most recently Melbourne Airport was awarded by Skytrax {{for having the}} best Airport hotel in the Australia/Pacific in the World Airport Awards. Melbourne Airport was also ranked the 43rd best airport for 2012. Melbourne reached 30 million passengers {{for the first time}} in the 12 months ending July 2013. This increased to 33.1 million passengers <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> by July 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff {{including}} more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. There are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances. These fees and allowances were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about £30,000 <b>per</b> <b>annum.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1908, Archibald Leitch {{wrote to}} the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) – who had a rail depot {{adjacent}} to the proposed site for the football ground – {{in an attempt to}} persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of £10,000, to be paid back at the rate of £2,000 <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down. The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated £2,750 <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> in fares offsetting the £9,800 cost of building the station. The station – Trafford Park – was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned. The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground, but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from Manchester Central railway station. It is currently known as Manchester United Football Ground.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{earnings}} have exponentially increased {{following his}} death. According {{to a report}} by Forbes in 2016, he had been the top-earning dead celebrity each year since his death, with triple-digit millions <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> ($825 million in 2016). In December 2015, Thriller became the first album in the United States to surpass 30 million shipments, certifying it 30× platinum. One year later, the album was certified again at 33× platinum, surpassing 33 million shipments after Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to album certifications.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{emigration}} marked {{most of the}} post-WWII period (particularly {{during the}} 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth {{became known as the}} Celtic Tiger. The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> between 1995 and 1999, in which year the Republic joined the euro. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in {{the world in terms of}} GDP per capita.|$|E
