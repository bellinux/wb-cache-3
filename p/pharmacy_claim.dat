40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to use {{statistical}} and data mining techniques in Base SAS(R) and SAS(R) Enterprise Miner TM to proactively reduce the number of false positives caused by data anomalies in Medicaid <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> data when employing a rule-based approach to identify overpayments. Typically rule-based techniques are based on specific state Medicaid laws and policies using certain formulas to detect and identify over charged payments. False positives are defined as an identified overpayment that is erroneously positive when a claim was paid correctly due to data anomalies or unknown factors. False positives substantially increase the amount of time and resources spent by the auditors. The specific objective of the study is to detect and reduce data anomalies by examining the relationships among key variables such as Medicaid amount paid (MAP), average wholesale price (AWP) and quantity of service in Medicaid <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> data. <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> data were simulated and the overpayment was calculated by a rule-based approach developed by AdvanceMed Corporation.

40|$|Abstract Aims: We {{describe}} current treatment {{patterns for}} early pregnancy failure (EPF) among women enrolled in two Michigan health plans. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of EPF treatment among Michigan Medicaid enrollees between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2004, and enrollees of a university-affiliated health plan between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005. Episodes {{were identified by}} the presence of a diagnostic code for EPF. Surgical treatment was distinguished from nonsurgical management using procedure codes. Facility charges, procedure, and place of service codes were used to determine whether a procedure was done in an office as opposed to an operating room. Cases without a claim for surgical uterine evacuation were examined for a misoprostol <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> and, if present, were classified as medical management. Cases without a procedure or <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> were classified as expectant management. Results: Respectively, we identified 21, 311 and 1, 493 episodes of EPF in the Medicaid and university-affiliated health plan databases, respectively. Women enrolled in Medicaid {{were more likely to be}} treated with surgery than were enrollees of the university-affiliated health plan (35. 3 vs. 18. 0 %, respectively, p< 0. 000). Among Medicaid enrollees, only 0. 5 % of surgical evacuations occurred in the office, but office procedures were common among enrollees of the university-affiliated health plan (30. 5 %, p< 0. 000). The proportion of cases managed with misoprostol was < 1 % in both groups. Caucasian race and age were both associated with having a surgical uterine evacuation (p< 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{examined}} the relationship between coping style and understanding of diabetes self-care among African American and white elders in a southern Medicare-managed care plan. METHODS: Participants were identified through a diabetes-related <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> or ICD- 9 code and completed a computer-assisted telephone survey in 2006 - 2007. Understanding of diabetes self-care was assessed using the Diabetes Care Profile Understanding (DCP-U) scale. Coping styles were classified as active (talk about it/take action) or passive (keep it to yourself). Linear regression was used to estimate the associations between coping style with the DCP-U, adjusting for age, sex, education, and comorbidities. Based on the conceptual model, 4 separate categories were established for African American and white participants who displayed active and passive coping styles. RESULTS: Of 1420 participants, the mean age was 73 years, 46 % were African American, and 63 % were female. Most respondents (77 %) exhibited active coping in response to unfair treatment. For African American participants in the study, active coping was associated with higher adjusted mean DCP-U scores when compared to participants with a passive coping style. No difference in DCP-U score was noted among white participants on the basis of coping style. CONCLUSIONS: Active coping was more strongly associated with understanding of diabetes self-care among older African Americans than whites. Future research on coping styles may give new insights into reducing diabetes disparities among racial/ethnic minorities...|$|E

Methods This cross-sectional study compares primary care provider (PCP) medication lists and <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claims</b> for 100 patients seen in 8 primary care practices and examines the association of congruence with demographic, clinical, and practice characteristics. Medication list congruence was measured as agreement of <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claims</b> with the entire PCP chart, including current medication list, visit notes, and correspondence sections. Results Congruence between <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claims</b> and the PCP chart was 65 %. Congruence was associated with large chronic disease burden, frequent PCP visits, group practice, and patient age ≥ 45 years. Conclusion Agreement of medication lists between the PCP chart and pharmacy records is low.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{warfarin}} for {{the treatment}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) is often complicated by the associated narrow therapeutic index and frequent monitoring. Dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, does not require routine monitoring, produces rapid therapeutic anticoagulation, and has the potential to improve thromboprophylaxis through increased adherence. As such, it is important to evaluate adherence and the incidence of bleeding and systemic embolism with dabigatran in a real-world population with AF. OBJECTIVE: To measure adherence and incidence of bleeding and systemic embolism with dabigatran in a state Medicaid population with AF. METHODS: Medicaid members 3 ̆e 18 years of age with AF were included if they had 3 ̆e 1 paid claim for dabigatran between February 1, 2011 and September 30, 2011. Members were excluded if they had breaks in Medicaid coverage, supplemental insurance or were a female of childbearing age. The index date was defined as the date of the first <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> for dabigatran. Adherence was measured using medication possession ratios (MPR) for members with 3 ̆e 2 paid claims for dabigatran and members with an MPR 3 ̆e 0. 8 were considered adherent. The incidences of bleeding, stroke and all-cause hospitalization were determined using medical claims data for one year post-index date.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} compared {{the risks of}} exacerbations and COPD-related healthcare costs between patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) initiating tiotropium (TIO) alone and patients initiating triple therapy with fluticasone-salmeterol combination (FSC) added to TIO. Methods Managed-care enrollees who had an index event of ≥ 1 <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> for TIO during the study period (January 1, 2003 -April 30, 2008) and met other eligibility criteria were categorized into one of two cohorts depending on their medication use. Patients in the TIO+FSC cohort had combination therapy with TIO and FSC, defined as having an FSC claim on the same date as the TIO claim. Patients in the TIO cohort had no such FSC use. The risks of COPD exacerbations and healthcare costs were compared between cohorts during 1 year of follow-up. Results The sample comprised 3333 patients (n = 852 TIO+FSC cohort, n = 2481 TIO cohort). Triple therapy with FSC added to TIO compared with TIO monotherapy was associated with significant reductions in the adjusted risks of moderate exacerbation (hazard ratio 0. 772; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 641, 0. 930) and any exacerbation (hazard ratio 0. 763; 95 % CI 0. 646, 0. 949) and a nonsignificant reduction in COPD-related adjusted monthly medical costs. Conclusions Triple therapy with FSC added to TIO compared with TIO monotherapy was associated with significant reductions in the adjusted risks of moderate exacerbation and any exacerbation over a follow-up period of up to 1 year.

Alcohol Controls had an alcohol-related diagnosis and were not prescribed an alcoholism treatment medication. Non-Alcohol Controls had no alcohol-related diagnosis and no prescription for an alcoholism treatment medication. The control groups were matched three to one to the naltrexone group on demographic and other relevant measures. Healthcare expenditures were calculated for the six-month periods before and after the index naltrexone drug claim (or matched date for controls). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the groups on key characteristics and on healthcare costs. Results Naltrexone patients (n= 1, 138; 62 % male; mean age 45 ± 11 years) had significantly higher total health care expenditures in the pre-index period than either of the control groups. In the post-index period, naltrexone patients had a significantly smaller increase than Alcohol Controls in total alcohol-related expenditures. Total non–alcohol-related expenditures also increased significantly less for the Naltrexone Group than for either control group. Multivariate analyses showed that naltrexone treatment significantly reduced alcohol-related, non–alcohol-related, and total healthcare costs relative to Alcohol Controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple factors limit {{identification}} {{of patients with}} depression from administrative data. However, administrative data drives many quality measurement systems, including the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS). METHODS: We investigated two algorithms for {{identification of}} physician-recognized depression. The study sample was drawn from primary care physician member panels of a large managed care organization. All members were continuously enrolled between January 1 and December 31, 1997. Algorithm 1 required at least two criteria in any combination: (1) an outpatient diagnosis of depression or (2) a <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> for an antidepressant Algorithm 2 included the same criteria as algorithm 1, but required a diagnosis of depression for all patients. With algorithm 1, we identified the medical records of a stratified, random subset of patients with and without depression (n = 465). We also identified patients of primary care physicians {{with a minimum of}} 10 depressed members by algorithm 1 (n = 32, 819) and algorithm 2 (n = 6, 837). RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were: Algorithm 1 : 95 percent, 65 percent, 49 percent; Algorithm 2 : 52 percent, 88 percent, 60 percent. Compared to algorithm 1, profiles from algorithm 2 revealed higher rates of follow-up visits (43 percent, 55 percent) and appropriate antidepressant dosage acutely (82 percent, 90 percent) and chronically (83 percent, 91 percent) (p 3 ̆c 0. 05 for all).

MethodsHealth Alliance Medical Plans piloted VBBD for diabetes medications for a subgroup of 5400 enrollees in January 2007 while keeping drug benefits unchanged for the remaining plan enrollees. A difference in difference method (DID) was used to {{evaluate the}} effect of VBBD based on <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> data. Patients with unchanged benefits in the same plan were used as the control group. Adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered. Propensity score weighting was used to balance characteristics of the case group and the control group. ResultsThere were 71 patients in the case group and 5037 patients in the control group. The patients in the two groups had comparable characteristics after propensity score weighting. After the implementation of VBBD, the average copayment per 30 days of supply for diabetes medications decreased from $ 15. 3 to $ 10. 1 for the case group and increased from $ 14. 6 to $ 15. 1 for the control group. The probability of being adherent increased from 75. 3 % to 82. 6 % for the case group and was roughly unchanged from 79. 1 % to 78. 5 % for the control group.

Methods: We undertook a retrospective database cohort study of 5258 {{beneficiaries of the}} Quebec provincial health insurance plan between 1999 and 2002. Subjects were aged 65 to 84 years and diagnosed with depression by primary care physicians or psychiatrists between October 2000 and March 2001; they had no depression diagnosis in the previous year. We defined receipt of psychoactive medication as having a <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claim</b> in the year following the depression diagnosis. We determined receipt of recommended first-line pharmacotherapy from the first psychoactive medication dispensed following diagnosis and defined it accordingly; we defined first-line pharmacotherapy according to the 2001 Canadian Psychiatric Association guidelines. We used multivariate generalized estimating equations models to identify the determinants of the 2 outcomes. Results: A total of 4421 (84. 1 %) patients received psychoactive medication following diagnosis; 2623 (59. 3 %) patients had not received antidepressants in the previous year. Of these, 1310 (49. 9 %) received recommended first-line pharmacotherapy. Independent predictors of receiving psychoactive medication were female sex, depression not otherwise specified (NOS), increasing comorbidity, and living in rural areas. Independent predictors of receiving recommended first-line pharmacotherapy were male sex, depression NOS, receiving medication in the month following diagnosis, and having the same physician diagnosing and treating the patient.

The pharmacy-based and in patient-diagnosis models perform comparably overall, with pharmacy data better able to split off a group of truly low-cost people and inpatient diagnoses better {{able to find a}} small group with extremely high future costs. The model th at uses both kinds of data performed significantly better than either model alone, with an R 2 value of 11. 8 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive pharmacy and inpatient diagnosis classification systems are each helpful for discriminating among people according to their expected costs. Properly organized and in combination these data are promising predictors of future costs...|$|R
40|$|Background: There are {{concerns}} that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are being over prescribed in both {{primary and secondary}} care. This study aims to establish potential cost savings in a community drug scheme for a one year period according to published clinical and cost-effective guidelines for PPI prescribing. Methods: Retrospective population-based cohort study in the Republic of Ireland using the Health Services Executive (HSE) Primary Care Reimbursement Services (PCRS) <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claims</b> database. The HSE-PCRS scheme is means tested and provides free health care including medications to approximately 30...|$|R
40|$|After {{the launch}} of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4), a new oral hypoglycemic drug (OHD), in December 2009, severe {{hypoglycemia}} cases were reported in Japan. Although the definite cause was unknown, co-administration with sulfonylureas (SU) was suspected {{as one of the}} potential risk factors. The Japan Association for Diabetes Education and Care (JADEC) released a recommendation in April 2010 to lower the dose of three major SUs (glimepiride, glibenclamide, and gliclazide) when adding a DPP- 4 inhibitor. To evaluate the effectiveness of this risk minimization action along with labeling changes, dispensing records for 114, 263 patients prescribed OHDs between December 2008 and December 2010 were identified in the Nihon-Chouzai <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claims</b> database. The adherence to the recommended dosing of SU co-prescribed with DPP- 4 inhibitors increased from 46. 3 % before to 63. 8 % after the JADEC recommendation (p < 0. 01 by time-series analysis), while no change was found in those for SU monotherapy and SU with other OHD co-prescriptions. The adherence was significantly worse for those receiving a glibenclamide prescription. The JADEC recommendation, along with labeling changes, appeared to have a favorable effect on the risk minimization action in Japan. In these instances, a <b>pharmacy</b> <b>claims</b> database can be a useful tool to evaluate risk minimization actions...|$|R
