5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E

The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by employing a periodic medium, {{and in that case}} one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with no minimum <b>particle</b> <b>velocity,</b> a phenomenon known as the Smith–Purcell effect. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a photonic crystal, one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the <b>particle</b> <b>velocity).</b>|$|E

50|$|Traditionally sound {{pressure}} is measured using microphones. Microphones have a polar pattern describing their sensitivity {{as a function}} of the direction of the incident sound. Many microphones have an omnidirectional polar pattern which means their sensitivity is independent of the direction of the incident sound. Microphones with other polar patterns exist that are more sensitive in a certain direction. This however is still no solution for the sound localization problem as one tries to determine either an exact direction, or a point of origin. Besides considering microphones that measure {{sound pressure}}, it is also possible to use a <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> probe to measure the acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> directly. The <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> is another quantity related to acoustic waves however, unlike sound pressure, <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> is a vector.
