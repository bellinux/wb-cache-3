He also undertook a task for Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) when the institute developed Guggulipid, a hypolipideamic agent produced from the Ayurvedic drug, guggul. He completed the clinical trials for the <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> <b>preparation</b> which was subsequently cleared by the Drug Controller General of India for commercial marketing.|$|E
40|$|Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L., Lamiaceae) is an {{aromatic}} and {{medicinal plant}} {{that has been}} used in folk medicine, <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations,</b> food preservatives, and as an aromatic ingredient. The effect of Thymus vulgaris essential oil (TEO) and its isolated constituents thymol and cavacrol (CVL) were studied in the following experimental models: ear edema, carrageenan-induced pleurisy, and chemotaxis in vitro. In the pleurisy model, TEO, CVL, and thymol significantly inhibited inflammatory edema. However, only TEO and CVL inhibited leukocyte migration. In the in vitro chemotaxis experiment, CVL inhibited leukocyte migration, whereas thymol exerted a potent chemoattractant effect. In the ear edema model, CVL (10 [*]mg/ear), applied topically, reduced edema formation, exerting a topical anti-inflammatory effect. Thymol did not reduce edema formation but rather presented an irritative response, probably dependent on histamine and prostanoid release. Our data suggest that the antiinflammatory effects of TEO and CVL are attributable to the inhibition of inflammatory edema and leukocyte migration...|$|R
40|$|Ginkgo biloba (GB) {{preparations}} are now {{among the}} leading herbal medicines that exert {{a broad spectrum}} of possible clinical applications. Several methods have been reported for quantification of ginkgolides of GB and its pharmaceutical preparations and the HPLC techniques are now considered to be the method of choice. However, most reported HPLC methods are not simple and their work-up procedure are inadequate. The present paper describes a simple and non-expensive method for extraction and determination of ginkgolides A and B in GB leaves and their phytopharmaceuticals. The method is based upon extraction of ginkgolides from aqueous solution by activated charcoal, followed by extraction with Methanol and injection of the Methanolic solution into chromatographic system. Ginkgolides were separated on an ODS column with a mobile phase of water-methanol (67 : 33 v/v) at a flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min and were detected at 220 nm. The mean recoveries of ginkgolide A and B were 97 and 98. 4 %, respectively. This method is simple and can be used for routine analysis of GB extracts and <b>phytopharmaceuticals</b> <b>preparations...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpray drying {{has been}} {{successfully}} employed for the encapsulation of herbal bioactive compounds resulting in stable <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations.</b> Bidens pilosa L. is a South American medicinal plant with proved antimalaric, hepatoprotector and antioxidant activities, generally linked to their secondary metabolites, flavonoids and polyacetylenes. In this work the physicochemical stability of an optimized spray dried composition from a B. pilosa extract was evaluated at three different stress storage conditions in open containers and in sealed sachets. High performance liquid chromatography was employed to monitor the concentration of three marker compounds over 12 months. Color variation of the stored samples was evaluated by using a color spectrophotometer. It was observed that the concentration of the monitored compounds of the plant decreases more drastically in samples stored in open containers. The two flavonoids monitored, rutin and hyperoside, showed lower degradation than the polyacetylene. The concentration of the markers did not change significantly at the lowest temperature. With regard to color, darker hues were observed at higher temperatures and storage times. This study showed that the storage conditions cause significant impact on stability of standardized spray dried B. pilosa extract...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the composition of active constituents in <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations,</b> valid analytical methods are required. For {{the determination of the}} active terpene constituents of Ginkgo biloba (the ginkgolides and bilobalide), a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method has been developed using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) in the negative ion mode. This detection mode was found to be much more sensitive and selective compared to UV; indeed the ginkgo terpene trilactones lack strong UV chromophores and flavonoids interfere with their UV detection. LC-APCI/MS detection allowed a considerable reduction in analysis time when compared to LC-UV, because LC resolution was only needed between the pair of isomers ginkgolide B and ginkgolide J. All compounds were selectively detected by single ion monitoring of their specific deprotonated molecules [M-H](-). The samples were directly injected without pre-purification, and a fast gradient was applied, reducing the total time of analysis to 14 min. With this method, the ginkgo terpene trilactones were detected on-line in the picogram range. Several commercial ginkgo preparations on the Swiss market were analysed, and the ginkgolide and bilobalide contents were evaluated using the method described.

40|$|AbstractThe total {{flavonoid}} content (TFC), total polyphenols content (TPC), and {{in vitro}} antioxidant activity (AA) of six Bidens pilosa L., Asteraceae, populations harvested from different localities were evaluated in this work. The plants were separated in roots, stems, and leaves/flowers, {{and the influence}} of extraction methods was investigated. A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC) was developed and employed to obtain characteristic HPLC fingerprints of the bioactive compounds present in the extractive solutions, which were correlated with the TFC, TPC, and AA. Extractive solutions of leaves/flowers presented a higher AA when compared with those obtained {{from other parts of the}} plant (IC 50 of 35. 35 ± 0. 10 μg/mL). The stem extracts presented the lowest AA (IC 50 117. 2 ± 1. 96 μg/mL). A direct correlation of AA with TFC and TPC was evidenced. The highest AA was obtained by dynamic maceration and was statistically different from the AA presented by the extractive solutions obtained by other extraction methods. The results of this work evidenced differences that can be found at different stages of development of <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations</b> from B. pilosa and highlighted the importance of using the concentration of marker compounds as well as HPLC fingerprints as quality control parameters...|$|R
