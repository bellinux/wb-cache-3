50|$|<b>Predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> campaigns {{can achieve}} agent {{productivity}} of 50 minutes {{per hour and}} nuisance ratios of 3% or less. The system is continually updating <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> probabilities and monitoring nuisance ratios for performance and compliance with legislation.For example, <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> is useful in sales campaigns to call {{a large number of}} contacts and maximizing the working time of agents.|$|E
50|$|Natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> has the {{benefits}} {{of all of the}} above dialing modes. With natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing,</b> call progress analysis (CPA) occurs in parallel with the agent connection, as opposed to the agent being connected after the CPA has determined that a live person is on the phone. This results in {{the benefits}} of CPA automation as in <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> while also allowing an agent to always be available as in power dialing. The primary disadvantage to natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> is that it is patented and is only available through a single vendor.|$|E
50|$|Natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> is a {{technology}} that was developed to eliminate the problems that are typically associated with <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing.</b> These problems include abandoned calls, initial call delays, government regular, consumer dissatisfaction, and host of other problems.|$|E

50|$|A {{silent call}} is a {{telephone}} call that is generated by a <b>predictive</b> <b>dialler</b> (or dialler) which {{does not have an}} agent immediately available to handle the call. In this instance the call, may be terminated by the dialler, and the called party receives a silence ("dead air") or a tone from the telephone company which indicates the call has been dropped.|$|R
50|$|Within the {{telecommunication}} industry, a NAD will {{be connected}} to a user's telephone. When the user dials a number, the NAD will 'listen' to the dialled digits and reroute the call through a network that will provide the best rates for the destination of the call. The NAD {{is often referred to}} as a <b>dialler,</b> <b>predictive</b> <b>dialler</b> or least cost routing dialler.|$|R
50|$|<b>Predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> is a {{state-of-the-art}} pacing mode {{used to call}} {{a large number of}} customers within a short period of time. <b>Predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> optimizes the time of agents by reducing the idle times between connected calls and freeing agents from dialing calls. <b>Predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> gathers statistics concerning the duration of calls, how long it takes for calls to be answered, and how often are calls answered. When an agent is about to become idle, The system places several calls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{core benefit}} of natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> {{is the more}} {{pleasant}} human interactions that occur during calls that are actually being made by an automated system connected to agents. In natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing,</b> the agents hear the called party say [...] "hello" [...] and can respond accordingly. [...] The technology works well on small and large scales (one user up to thousands). Contact centers that require a natural calling experience and wish to also have the productivity benefits associated with <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> can utilize this technology to obtain both benefits.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} of <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> takes {{into consideration the}} accuracy of the contact lists and the policies on nuisance calls. If the contact list is poor, the {{performance of}} the <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> campaign is at risk as agents are not connected to live contacts and are not able to do business.|$|E
50|$|A <b>predictive</b> dialer <b>dials</b> {{a list of}} {{telephone}} numbers and connects answered dials to people making calls, {{often referred to as}} agents. Predictive dialers use statistical algorithms to minimize the time that agents spend waiting between conversations, while minimizing the occurrence of someone answering when no agent is available.|$|R
40|$|The early {{detection}} of a developing aircraft-subsystem fault {{has the potential to}} lessen its ultimate severity. The lack of capability for such {{early detection}} is becoming critical in the aviation community. In the commercial sector, for example, twin-engine aircraft are being used for extended transport operations over water. One method to decrease the severity of a developing problem is to predict its behavior and to take appropriate corrective action. In order to investigate pilots' ability to predict events, an experiment was conducted where eighteen airline pilots predicted the time to an alert using three different displays of dials and three different time profile complexities. The three displays of dials were as follows: standard, resembling current aircraft dial presentations; history, indicating the value five seconds in the past; and predictive, indicating the value five seconds into the future. The time profiles describing the behavior of the parameter consisted of constant velocity profiles, decelerating profiles, and accelerating then decelerating profiles. Although pilots indicated that they preferred the <b>predictive</b> <b>dial,</b> the objective data did not support its use. The objective data did show that the time profiles had the most significant effect on performance in estimating the time to an alert...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aviation}} community, the {{early detection of}} the development of a possible subsystem problem during a flight is potentially useful for increasing the safety of the flight. Commercial airlines are currently using twin-engine aircraft for extended transport operations over water, and the early detection of a possible problem might increase the flight crew's options for safely landing the aircraft. One method for decreasing the severity of a developing problem is to predict the behavior of the problem so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken. To investigate the pilots' ability to predict long-term events, a computer workstation experiment was conducted in which 18 airline pilots predicted the alert time (the time to an alert) using 3 different dial displays and 3 different parameter behavior complexity levels. The three dial displays were as follows: standard (resembling current aircraft round dial presentations); history (indicating the current value plus the value of the parameter 5 sec in the past); and predictive (indicating the current value plus the value of the parameter 5 sec into the future). The time profiles describing the behavior of the parameter consisted of constant rate-of-change profiles, decelerating profiles, and accelerating-then-decelerating profiles. Although the pilots indicated that they preferred the near term <b>predictive</b> <b>dial,</b> the objective data did not support its use. The objective data did show that the time profiles had the most significant effect on performance in estimating the time to an alert...|$|R

5000|$|At its core, natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> {{technologies}} {{are based on}} the concept that call automation should work with agents, instead of call automation working before agents are connected, and then agents being connected to calls that have been determined to be 'live' people. In natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> the call automation (sometimes called Call Progress Analysis (CPA)) can work before during or after an agent has interfaced with a call. [...] This interweaving of automation and human agents provides productivity increases traditionally associated with automation technologies, while working to eliminate the unnatural affect that many call automation technologies have on the human-interaction aspects of the call.|$|E
50|$|When dialing numbers {{one at a}} time, {{there are}} two sources of delay. First, only some {{fraction}} of dials are answered. So, for example, if 1 out of 3 dials are answered, a <b>predictive</b> dialer might <b>dial</b> 3 lines every time an agent becomes available. Second, even dials that are answered take some time before being picked up. If it typically takes 10 seconds for someone to pick up, and conversations typically last 90 seconds, a predictive dialer might start dialing at 80 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Dialing one {{number at}} a time, only when an agent is available, {{typically}} keeps agents utilized for 40 minutes per hour (33% idle time). <b>Predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> can increase utilization to 57 minutes per hour (5% idle time).|$|E

50|$|There are 4 {{different}} dialing modes {{depending on}} how software dialers selects the contacts {{that are going to}} be called and starts making the calls. Automated dialers such as those sold by Noble Systems, Avaya, and Convoso (formerly SafeSoft Solutions) can place calls using *preview*, *power*, auto dialing, or <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing.</b> The dialing modes are defined according to the campaign and type of business.|$|E
5000|$|The only commercially {{available}} natural predictive dialer {{is provided by}} a single vendor. [...] Additionally, patents protecting the technology make it more expensive than many other systems, such as those available for free based on the Asterisk platform. Many contact centers and other organizations don't necessarily need the benefits associated with the natural <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> technology and can save money by using a more inexpensive or less-proprietary system.|$|E
50|$|TeleBlock is a {{software}} program that automatically screens and blocks outbound calls against available federal, state, wireless, third party, and in-house Do-Not-Call (DNC) lists. Designed for use in telemarketing and outbound call centers, TeleBlock is applied to a subscriber's telephone carrier, provided voice lines, or delivered through their <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. The system triggers all predetermined outbound calls to query a proprietary customer specific DNC database in real-time.|$|E
50|$|Dialogic System Release 6, {{proprietary}} software developed by Dialogic Inc., provided <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing,</b> conferencing and {{interactive voice response}} (IVR) services which take calls from clients or customers and route the callers to the appropriate individual or data system. The software was used for automated answering services in AT&T, PG&E, Bank of America and other large corporations. Although often complicated and difficult to navigate, these systems allowed corporations to streamline their telephone service and provide information to customers {{without the need for}} human interaction.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 {{founder and}} CEO James K. Noble, Jr. created the Noble {{solution}} by utilizing early <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> software ("a predictive dialer is a telephone control system that automatically calls {{a list of}} telephone numbers in sequence, screening out no-answers, busy signals, answering machines and disconnected numbers while predicting at what point a human caller {{will be able to}} handle the next call."). Four years later, in 1989, the CEO officially formed Noble Systems Corporation, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Noble was the first vendor to offer an open, scalable, fully distributed platform.|$|E
50|$|A power dialer {{like the}} Dolphin Power Dialer, is {{autodialer}} software that enables telemarketers, sales teams, and call centers to dial {{a list of}} phone numbers automatically and completely hands-free, thus, saving them valuable time and energy {{that would otherwise be}} wasted dialing by hand. Power dialing is suitable for all campaigns, from customer care follow-up calls to telemarketing. For example, power dialing is useful to call <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> contacts that resulted in nuisance to ensure that an agent is available to talk to the customer. A 2012 research study conducted by The Bridge Group, Inc. discovered that while inside sales jobs and career demand is up 54 percent, most sales leverage comes with power dialer software.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{specialized}} application {{space of}} agent-assisted automation goes under numerous headings including outbound prospecting, cold calling, solicitation, fund-raising, etc. Turnover is high among agents {{engaged in this}} kind of work because the task is tedious and emotionally difficult. It is tedious because you spend the bulk of your day, not talking to qualified leads, but in getting wrong numbers and answering machines. As good and as ubiquitous as <b>predictive</b> <b>dialing</b> technology has become, it still makes a lot of mistakes because the phone number inputs are outdated. It is emotionally difficult work because, beyond the tedium, {{you spend a lot of}} time hearing the word “No!”, getting hung-up on, and cussed at. The pre-recorded audio allows you to dispense with wrong numbers and answering machines while you move onto the next call. Agents can easily handle two or three overlapping calls, an immediate productivity hit. Additionally, agents using the technology don’t seem to take the gruff treatment as personally. They report that it feels as if the customer is saying “no” to the software, not to them. Finally, contribution amounts and conversion rates can be improved by adding some intelligence into the scripts, for example by raising and lowering the initial contribution amount based on the wealth of the area you are calling into or using pre-recorded audio with different accents, Southern when calling in the South, for example. Another benefit of the technology is that it enables the work to be done by lower cost agents in offshore locations.|$|E
