60|$|It was. Other people besides Anne {{thought so}} when they {{stumbled}} on it. It was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill straight through Mr. Bell's woods, where the light came down sifted through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as {{the heart of a}} diamond. It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches, white stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of <b>pigeonberries</b> grew thickly along it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees overhead. Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet--which, with Anne and Diana, happened about once in a blue moon. Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{many species}} first {{described}} by Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, it still bears its original binomial name. Other common names include Australian olive, <b>pigeonberry</b> ash, maulwood, and clove berry. In Chinese, {{it is called}} 腺叶木犀榄 (...)

Other smaller plants of interest include the walking stick palm and the Macleay laurel.|$|E

50|$|A spring on the estate, and a {{waterfall}} on Oakley Creek, was ample for domestic and fire prevention purposes. A farm, consisting of nearly 200 acres, {{was attached to}} the asylum, providing for healthful recreation and fresh vegetables. There were approximately 50 milk cows on the estate, and numerous pigs. An unlimited supply of fresh eggs was obtained from the farm's poultry. Part of the land was turned into an experimental sewage farm. The oldest building has several notable trees and shrubs of interest including holm oak, sweetgum, chaste tree, and <b>pigeonberry.</b> now part of the Unitec Arboretum http://www.unitec.ac.nz/advance/index.php/a-living-collection-unitecs-arboretum. In 1969, the Auckland University Council decided that the farm was not suitable for university development, but wanted to convert 50 acre for playing fields while Auckland Technical Institute wanted 20 acre.|$|E
