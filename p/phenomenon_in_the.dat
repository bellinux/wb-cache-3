5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global <b>phenomenon.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E

5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally {{involved in the}} crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences lost {{sight of the fact that}} the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half of the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists {{a number}} of barbarian {{military}} settlements in the empire. Known as laeti or gentiles ("natives"), these were {{an important source of}} recruits for the army. Groups of Germanic or Sarmatian tribespeople were granted land to settle in the Empire, in return for military service. Most likely each community was under a treaty obligation to supply a specified number of troops to the army each year. The resettlement within the empire of barbarian tribespeople in return for military service was not a new <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th century: it stretches {{back to the days of}} Augustus. But it does appear that the establishment of military settlements was more systematic and on a much larger scale in the 4th century.|$|E

5|$|The winds on Saturn are {{the second}} fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data {{indicate}} peak easterly winds of 500m/s (1800km/h). In {{images from the}} Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering. Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known {{example of such a}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185°C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122°C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.|$|E
5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry, after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began with}} a Maryland kickoff to California, who were stopped for {{a net loss of}} 4yards and forced to punt. On Maryland's first possession, it mounted a 60-yard drive that culminated in a 24-yard {{touchdown}} rush by Da'Rel Scott. California quarterback Kevin Riley then threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, which allowed Scott to rush for his second score of the game. California made a field goal, but on the following series, Maryland drove 60yards and tight end Dan Gronkowski made a touchdown reception. The Golden Bears made another field goal to end the first half with a score of 21–6, in Maryland's favor. During the second quarter, Riley threw a short screen pass to running back Jahvid Best, who immediately received a hard hit from Maryland cornerback Kevin Barnes. While still lying on the field, Best rolled to his side to vomit. Footage of the tackle and its aftermath circulated widely on the internet and became a viral video <b>phenomenon.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third period, Chris Turner completed a pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 27-yard touchdown to end the quarter with Maryland in the lead, 28–6. In the final period, California scored two touchdowns against a preventative defense, before Maryland responded with a fifth score on a one-yard rush by Davin Meggett. In the final minutes, Maryland placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 27-yard field goal which would have clinched the victory. Instead, California scored a third touchdown to close within eight points. With 1:55 remaining to play, California attempted an onside kick, but it bounced out of bounds, and Maryland was able to run out the clock to win the upset, 35–28.|$|E
