5000|$|During {{the first}} {{revision}} session, Carli tells Simon {{that she and}} her older, rugby player boyfriend Tom have split up, which leads them to share numerous kisses at the next session and Carli accepts the invitation to join Simon {{and the rest of the}} gang at the nearby pub for a post-exam celebratory drink. Simon rushes to tell Will - only to be shunned by his friend, who is cracking under the pressure of the looming exams. Jay is advised by his dad to make sure he always knows where Chloe is, and he begins texting her on a regular basis (about [...] "15, 16 times a day, and messaging her on MySpace, Bebo, etc."). The final exams come around, and both Simon and Jay are too distracted with their love lives to do any work on the paper; Simon doodles on it and Jay loses his mobile phone to Mr. Gilbert, who tells Jay that his phone [...] "didn't even go once". With all of the energy drinks he has taken in, including staying up to revise in the middle of the night, Will develops stomach trouble, and, to his horror, he ends up soiling himself during the last exam. Neil, on the other hand, has left his <b>PE</b> <b>clothes</b> at home, and Will (in the voice-over) says he's [...] "struggled to keep his balls in his boxer shorts", as the PE teacher has forced him to complete his physical exam in his undershorts.|$|E
30|$|When 13 of the {{participants}} (girls n =  8; boys n =  5) tried to obtain a uniform for a sport or for their PE class, the school or organization did not have their size uniform. These experiences made all of them uncomfortable and made them feel like outsiders. Six (girls n =  4; boys n =  2) of the 13 participants explained {{that they had to}} have their size custom-ordered, while the other seven wore the poor-fitting athletic clothes. Sarah had to special-order her <b>PE</b> <b>clothes</b> the first week of school, and then {{had to go to the}} office to pick up her uniform. She explained this made her feel embarrassed: “Like it’s not really a bad thing but sometimes it is because people ask why are you going to the office and you don’t really want to tell them you have to custom-order”. When asked if she would ever feel comfortable telling anyone that she had to get a different-sized uniform, she quickly responded with a confident “no”. Imani said they did not have her size uniform for volleyball and that she had to special-order it. For this uniform, the kids who needed a larger size had to pay extra, and this was not an option for Imani’s family. She explained that her mom did not have a job at the time and was on unemployment. Darren remembered a time when the baseball organizers did not have his pant size. When asked if it made him feel uncomfortable he explained that he knew other kids were “making a face”. Four children (girl n =  3, boy n =  1) explained that custom-ordering a uniform was not an option, and that they had to wear the wrong size. One participant explained that he wore a football jersey that covered only half of his stomach. He said, “It was really embarrassing at first, but I got used to it after a while”.|$|E
