5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further <b>plans.</b> <b>At</b> this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5. <b>Plans</b> <b>at</b> {{the time were}} {{to build a new}} {{alignment}} from east of Ridgefield to Little Ferry southeast of Hackensack and form Route S5 (now Route 93) along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new Route 6 would share the alignment of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where it would turn southeast onto a new alignment to Little Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own alignment to the George Washington Bridge.|$|E

5|$|It was {{discovered}} in October 1851 by William Lassell and named for a character in two different pieces of literature. As of 2017, much of the detailed knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986, which managed to image around 35% of the moon's surface. There are no active <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> present to return to study the moon in more detail, although various concepts such as a Uranus orbiter and probe have been proposed from time to time.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, Booth {{learned that}} Lincoln would be {{attending}} {{a performance of}} the play Still Waters Run Deep at a hospital near the Soldier's Home.

5|$|Smith enlisted as {{a private}} in the Indiana Army National Guard in 1911. In 1917, during World War I, he was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant.

In 1941, he became Secretary of the General Staff, and in 1942 he became the Secretary to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. His duties involved taking part in discussions of war <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> the highest level, and Smith often briefed President Franklin D. Roosevelt on strategic matters.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Lincoln Center campus {{and some of the}} Upper West Side community residents have been strained, over campus development. In 2010 the New York State Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by the Alfred Condominium Complex. The suit was filed in response to the University's expansion <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> Lincoln Center and their expected visual and auditory impact on the surrounding community. The Lincoln Center campus does, however, have a lively connection to the artistic scene in Manhattan through its dance and theater productions and visual art exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Although Henry had {{announced}} his <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> the November 1399 parliament, {{he did not}} attempt a winter campaign, but continued to hold quasi-negotiations 'in which he must have felt the Scots were profoundly irritating.' At the same time, {{it appears that the}} House of Commons was not keen on the forthcoming war, and, since extravagence had been a major complaint against Henry's predecessor, Henry was probably constrained in requesting a subsidy. At this point, parliament was clearly still opposed to a Scottish war, and may eve have believed a possible French invasion the imperative issue. In June 1400, the king summonsed his Duchy of Lancaster retainers to muster at York, and they in turn brought their personal feudal retinues. At this point, with the invasion being obvious to all, the Scots attempted to re-open negotiations. Although Scottish ambassadors arrived at York to meet the king around 26 June, they returned to Scotland within two weeks.|$|E
5|$|By 1909 {{the school}} library had 6,000 books valued at $3,500 and Ray D. Fisher was librarian. During November of that year the library {{received}} new furniture as Eaton Hall opened, and many departments were moved to it from Waller Hall. The library was re-cataloged in 1912 by Lucia Haley, a specialist from New York City hired by the school for this task. At that time the librarian was Dr. Lyle. <b>Plans</b> <b>at</b> this time called for constructing a building where the Art Building now stands {{to serve as a}} memorial to the pioneers of the university. This was to be the future home of the library, but the building was never built. In 1913, the librarian was Mary Field, and the collection was still about 6,000 volumes. Field was replaced the following year by Fannie J. Elliot.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Otto Octavius is {{preparing}} to attach an exoskeleton onto Alex O'Hirn's body, modeled after that of a rhinoceros. Though Octavius is wary about going through with the experiment, Hammerhead forces him to activate it. O'Hirn's body is surgically attached to the suit and is given immeasurable strength. Meanwhile, Peter Parker is at the Daily Bugle trying to ask out Betty Brant to his school's fall formal, despite their four-year age difference; she finally agrees to consider it and Peter hurries homeward, exhilarated, until he realizes he will need money for the date. He tells his best friend Harry about his <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> school the next day. Peter then receives a text message that his Aunt May is having lunch with Betty at the Bugle. Flash Thompson then gives Peter a noogie just before Peter runs off.|$|E
5|$|He {{was linked}} with {{a move to}} League One club Crewe Alexandra in February 2008, having been unable to figure in Mixu Paatelainen's <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> Hibs, meaning he was frozen {{out of the first}} team. Donaldson {{finished}} 2007–08 with 21 appearances and 6 goals, his last goal of the season coming against Falkirk in December 2007. In the summer of 2008, he was told that he was available for transfer by Hibs. Crewe were believed to be lining up a bid for him in July 2008, who had money available after selling striker Nicky Maynard to Bristol City for £2.25million and held negotiations with Donaldson. The move stalled after a six-figure fee had been agreed but Donaldson later agreed personal terms.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Marcello Lippi, Roberto Bettega and Umberto Agnelli {{announced}} that Baggio no longer featured in their <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> Juventus {{and decided to}} focus on the emerging star Alessandro Del Piero, who would inherit Baggio's number 10 shirt. Baggio faced difficulties with Agnelli, Luciano Moggi and Juventus management during his final season, as they stated they would only renew his contract if he reduced his salary by 50%. After strong pressure from A.C. Milan chairman Silvio Berlusconi and manager Fabio Capello, Baggio was sold to the Milanese club for £6.8million, amidst several protests from Juventus fans. At the time, Baggio had been linked with Internazionale, Real Madrid and English Premier League clubs Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers.|$|E

Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a wildling lookout and takes the warrior girl Ygritte captive; though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Qhorin, who faces certain execution at Mance's hands, commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their <b>plans,</b> <b>at</b> any cost. Jon pretends to disavow the Night's Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their trust. With Qhorin's silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost.|$|E
5|$|In January 1952, Pollard succeeded Colonel John Wilton as Director of Military Operations and <b>Plans</b> <b>at</b> Army Headquarters, {{and became}} Chairman of the Joint Planning Committee. That August {{he was one}} of the Australian delegates joining the Minister for External Affairs, Richard Casey, for the inaugural meeting of the ANZUS Council in Honolulu; the US and New Zealand {{delegations}} were led, respectively, by Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Minister for External Affairs Clifton Webb. Pollard also took part in planning for the atomic test at Montebello, Western Australia, in October 1952. Promoted to temporary brigadier in March 1953, Pollard acted as Australian military advisor to Prime Minister Robert Menzies at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London that June. From July to November he served as commander of the Australian Army Component of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea; the role was responsible for managing the turnover of Australian troops in the theatre and the upkeep of their personal records. Pollard was later appointed Deputy Adjutant General at Army Headquarters, and his rank of brigadier became substantive in December 1953.|$|E

He returned to Washington D.C. for an assignment as director of personnel management for the Army, subordinate to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, General Maxwell R. Thurman. Schwarzkopf was promoted to major general. In June 1983, he became commanding general of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army's senior member on the Military Staff Committee at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings with representatives from other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he sat in on arms reduction talks with leaders from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 2014, O'Keefe {{eventually}} {{secured a}} loan {{move away from}} Palace {{on the final day}} of the emergency loan window, joining struggling Championship club Blackpool on loan until 1 January 2015, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Kevin Foley. He made his debut on 29 November 2014, starting in a 1–1 draw with Rotherham United, being replaced by Nathan Delfouneso after 56 minutes, and went on to make four appearances for the team before returning to Palace. On his return to Selhurst Park, O'Keefe found himself under a new manager for the fourth time since August 2014, following the appointment of Alan Pardew. Despite being handed a starting spot in Pardew's first match in charge at the club, a 4–0 win over non-League team Dover Athletic in the third round of the FA Cup on 4 January 2015, he was later informed that he was not part of the manager's new <b>plans</b> <b>at</b> the club.|$|E
