Czech legal regulations of awarding of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> are transposed from European legal regulations. Statute Nr. 137 / 2006 Coll., about awarding of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> contains institutions of Directive 2004 / 17 EC of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedure of entities {{operating in the}} water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and Directive 2004 / 18 /EC of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of <b>public</b> works <b>contracts,</b> <b>public</b> supply <b>contract</b> and <b>public</b> service <b>contracts.</b> The main purpose of these directives is coordinating procedure of awarding of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> in all member states of European Union.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>contracts</b> were {{traditionally}} {{conceived as}} instruments of domestic public law and used within markets {{confined to the}} territory of the state party to the contract. Globalization, however, subjects <b>public</b> <b>contracting</b> to an increasing number of processes that take place at a transnational level and that have transformative impact on the very concept of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> law. Globalization, in other words, has the effect of reshaping <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> into instruments of governance within a transnational legal space. In adopting a transnational concept of law, the present book maps the different processes, actors and instruments involved in the transnationalization of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> law. It covers the impact of different areas of binding international law on <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> as well as less obvious and more indirect processes in which domestic <b>public</b> <b>contracting</b> becomes influenced by the activities of private and public entities, such as multinational enterprises or international organizations, through lending and financing, or by developing model laws or model agreements for certain areas of <b>public</b> <b>contracting...</b>|$|R
40|$|The issue solved in {{this thesis}} is the {{procedure}} for the award of <b>public</b> <b>contract,</b> which is explored {{from the perspective of the}} Act No. 137 / 3006 Coll., on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts,</b> as Amended. With the help of latest Amendment No. 55 / 2012 Coll., number of changes was allocated into the tables. These changes fundamentally modify the view on the Act of <b>Public</b> <b>Contract.</b> Process of the award of <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> is then analyzed and evaluated by the tender dossier, from which the data about qualification requirements and evaluation criteria was drawn. Evaluation is performed using graphs and tables. The result of this thesis is to demonstrate a significant effect of the Amendment on the entire procedure and the decrease of assigned <b>public</b> works <b>contracts</b> with regard to <b>public</b> supply <b>contracts</b> and <b>public</b> service <b>contracts.</b> Future recommendation is to re-amend the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contract</b> and try to allow the re-growth of awarded <b>public</b> <b>contracts,</b> and to reclaim significant negative impact of the Amendment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>contracts</b> {{constitute}} a special method of making contracts, where {{one side is}} represented by a public contractor, who intends to expend public funds. There are legal adjustments aimed to make this expenditure effective and economical. The domain of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> is also significant for the European Union, and there are standard procedures which should guarantee that subjects from any member state can apply for the <b>public</b> <b>contracts.</b> Consequently the <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> adjustment is {{also included in the}} European law, in the form of directions. The topic of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> is a very complex one, therefore in my research I concentrate only on its more important aspects. First, I follow the historic development in this domain and how it was influenced by European law. Then I discuss the main institutes of <b>public</b> <b>contracts,</b> such as the definition of <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> itself, individual assignment procedures, the issue of qualification, methods of offer evaluation and law supervision. In the final part I provide some findings from application practice. Basic conclusions of my work identify the excessively complicated and formal legal regulations, which are often consequence of frequent changes of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> legislation, to be a main obstacle for the proper law application. In my opinion, the solution to this situation should consist in stabilizing the legal regulations in its present form. This would mean that the emerging problems could be solved by judicial doctrina...|$|R

40|$|RESUMÉ CONTRACTING ENTITY OF <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>CONTRACT</b> The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} and represent the current legal regulation of <b>contracting</b> entity of <b>public</b> <b>contract,</b> {{as well as to}} highlight some of the key judgments of the ECJ and decisions and opinions of the Office for the Protection of Competition in relation to the <b>contracting</b> entity of <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> In this thesis, I have tried to focus on the general definition of a <b>contracting</b> entity of <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> and the descriptions of different types of <b>contracting</b> entity of <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> - a contracting authority, a subsidized contracting entity, as well as a sector entity. Undoubtedly an interesting area, which is also the subject of this thesis, is the centralized procurement.

40|$|Through the {{institute}} of public procurement a considerable volume of financial resources is allocated. It is therefore {{in the interest of}} contracting entities to seek ways of how to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. Some public contract-awarding entities, along with some public-administration authorities in the Czech Republic, believe that the use of a single evaluation criterion (the lowest bid price) results in a more efficient tender for a <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> It was found that contracting entities in the Czech Republic strongly prefer to use the lowest bid price criterion. Within the examined sample, 86. 5 % of public procurements were evaluated this way. The analysis of the examined sample of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> proved that the choice of an evaluation criterion, even the preference of the lowest bid price criterion, does not have any obvious impact on the final cost of a <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> The study concludes that it is inappropriate to prefer the criterion of the lowest bid price within the evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> that are characterised by their complexity (including <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> for construction works and <b>public</b> service <b>contracts).</b> The findings of the Supreme Audit Office related to the inspection of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> indicate that when using the lowest bid price as an evaluation criterion, a <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> may indeed be tendered with the lowest bid price, but not necessarily the best offer in terms of supplied quality. It is therefore not appropriate to use the lowest bid price evaluation criterion to such an extent for the purpose of evaluating work and services. Any improvement to this situation requires a corresponding amendment to the Law on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> and mainly a radical change in the attitude of the Office for the Protection of Competition towards proposed changes, as indicated within the conclusions and recommendations proposed by this study...|$|R

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{according to}} the Act. No. 137 / 2006 Coll., on <b>public</b> <b>contracts,</b> as amended, represents a distinctive contracting process characterized by a significant level of legal regulation and formalization, which differs the procedure from the standard contracting process {{according to the}} general laws. Despite this difference, public procurement is still a civil contracting process, which is by its nature a special contracting procedure to the general contracting procedure. Therefore, {{the subject matter of}} this thesis is an analysis of selected aspects, specifics, and differences of <b>public</b> procurement <b>contracting</b> procedures from genereal contracting procedures. The thesis is divided into three chapters. Chapter one deals with the position of the public procurement law in the system of law.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{feature of}} private contracting is its relational nature. When faced with unforeseen or unexpected circumstances, private parties, {{as long as}} the relation remains worthwhile, adjust their required performance without the need for costly renegotiation or formal recontracting. <b>Public</b> <b>contracting,</b> on the other hand, seems to be characterized by formalized, standardized, bureaucratic, rigid procedures. Common wisdom sees <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> as generally more inflexible, requiring more frequent formal renegotiation, having a higher tendency to litigate, and providing weaker incentives. In sum, <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> are perceived to be less "efficient. " In this paper I develop a theory of <b>public</b> <b>contracting</b> that accommodates these stark differences between private and <b>public</b> <b>contracting.</b> The thrust of the paper is that these differences arise directly because of the different hazards present in public and purely private contracts, which directly impact the nature of the resulting contractual forms. A fundamental corollary of this result is that the perceived inefficiency of <b>public</b> or governmental <b>contracting</b> is simply the result of contractual adaptation to different inherent hazards, and as such is not directly remediable. Finally, I apply the main insights from the general framework developed here to understand the characteristics of concession contracts. ...|$|R
