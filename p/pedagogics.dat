30|$|How the {{analysis}} is used {{will depend on the}} analyst’s purposes. Once patterns of discourse in each component have been described, along with relations between components, {{the next step is to}} interpret the patterns of <b>pedagogic</b> register that they realise. For example, how inclusive are <b>pedagogic</b> relations, how effective are <b>pedagogic</b> activities for groups of learners, how well are <b>pedagogic</b> modalities deployed to this end, what knowledge structures are construed, and how are they evaluated? This level of interpretation may enable evaluation of <b>pedagogic</b> practices ([McNaught in prep]), and design of more effective practices ([Kartika in prep]). It may enable articulation with other models of <b>pedagogic</b> practice, such as Bernstein’s theory of <b>pedagogic</b> discourse, or Maton’s legitimation code theory. It is capable of describing exhaustively how the categories of any <b>pedagogic</b> theory are realised as genre, register and language.|$|R
30|$|This example {{illustrates}} the variable relations between <b>pedagogic</b> cycle phases and <b>pedagogic</b> exchange roles. While the teacher directs activity with A 2 commands, their <b>pedagogic</b> function in cycles 2, 5 and 6 is Focus, followed by Identify and and Affirm/Reject phases. Furthermore, the initial Identify phase is enacted as a K 2 question, that is rejected. The student’s non-verbal A 1 actions in cycles 3 and 6 {{can also be}} analysed pedagogically as Identify phases, since they are evaluated by the teacher. In efforts to interpret Bernstein’s analysis of <b>pedagogic</b> discourse in terms of exchange structure, it has been proposed to code knowledge exchanges as ‘instructional’ and action exchanges as ‘regulative’ (e.g. Christie [2002]). However, as action exchanges often also have an instructional function, Martin et al. ([2007]) propose a ‘double coding’ of such exchanges as both action and knowledge. In contrast, <b>pedagogic</b> exchange structures and <b>pedagogic</b> activity cycles are analysed here as serving distinct interpersonal and ideational functions. <b>Pedagogic</b> activity is negotiated as <b>pedagogic</b> exchange, and both require distinct, complementary analyses.|$|R

The author theoretically substantiates the potential of the historical <b>pedagogic</b> research concerning the conceptual and terminological structure of the Russian pedagogy.

The main research findings include identifying methodological requirements for analyzing the conceptual scientific formation in historical context; substantiating the resource basis; revealing the investigation principles; describing the tools and their implementation peculiarities with regard to the specifics of pedagogical concepts and terms.

40|$|In this article, {{by way of}} an {{analysis}} of a case of mathematics teacher training, I explore the general idea of <b>pedagogic</b> expectation of an alignment of <b>pedagogic</b> identities and specific realisations of mathematics in <b>pedagogic</b> contexts. The particular case analysed has a constructivist orientation, but the analytic resources brought to bear in the analysis can be used more generally for the description and analysis of <b>pedagogic</b> situations. The analysis is framed chiefly by the philosophical work of Georg Hegel alongside Basil Bernstein’s sociological discussion of evaluation in <b>pedagogic</b> contexts. The argument proceeds in three inter-related parts, {{the first of which}} produces an analytic description of the discursive production of the desired <b>pedagogic</b> subject–in this case, a teacher/student of geometry–in which I show how explication and abbreviation are used discursively in an attempt to construct the desired teacher/student–that is, a particular <b>pedagogic</b> identity. The second part of the argument describes the discursive production of mathematics content in a manner intended to align content with the desired teacher/student and introduces the notion of a regulative orientation in order to grasp the differences in the mathematical work of students. The third part is a synthesis of parts one and two, showing how <b>pedagogic</b> identity and mathematics contents are brought together as correlative effects of each other. </span...|$|R

He talked very quickly, with a flow of easy words and in a deep, resonant voice. He had a short, odd little laugh which showed his white teeth. They had followed him with difficulty, for his mind darted from subject to subject with a connection they did not always catch. He talked of <b>pedagogics,</b> and this was natural enough; but he had much to say of modern theories in Germany which they had never heard of and received with misgiving. He talked of the classics, but he had been to Greece, and he discoursed of archaeology; he had once spent a winter digging; they could not see how that helped a man to teach boys to pass examinations, He talked of politics. It sounded odd to them to hear him compare Lord Beaconsfield with Alcibiades. He talked of Mr. Gladstone and Home Rule. They realised that he was a Liberal. Their hearts sank.

But luck was against him, and Martin, who did not in the least consider himself an ordinary guide, walked up and down in moody reflection, or grimly threw himself upon the ground, gazing upward at the sky--not half so blue as he was--but never walking or resting so far away that he could not hear the first cry from her should snake, bear, dragon-fly, or danger of any kind approach her.|$|E

"One of {{the duties}} which fell to my share, {{during the period}} to [...] which I have referred, was the {{instruction}} of a class in [...] mathematics, and I usually found that Euclid and the ancient [...] geometry generally, when addressed to the understanding, formed a [...] very attractive study for youth.

The population of this ex-post facto research was all teaching practice students of Mechanical Engineering Education Study Program 2013. Data was analyzed using multiple regression technique.
