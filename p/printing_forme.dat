50|$|A {{process called}} {{electrotyping}} produced a similar result using electrodeposition of copper usually {{to form a}} plate replica of the <b>printing</b> <b>forme.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose : Prepress {{begins with}} the input of texts and images into the system where digitization, {{correction}} of texts and images, page design, adaptation to the used printing technique and technology take place, and finishes with {{the production of the}} <b>printing</b> <b>forme.</b> In particular, the field of image processing and half-toning techniques which enable a high-quality facsimile reproduction in the most modern printing techniques are addressed. Methodology/approach: An overview of the historical development shows an increasing degree of the reproduction “objectivity”, which is especially important in the production of facsimiles, the best possible copies of unique originals, especially manuscripts and other peerless works. With a complete reproduction of the details of an original an important difference between a reprint and a facsimile is defined. Results: In the case of the first true facsimiles of the first Slovenian books, i. e. Catechismus and Abecedarium from 1550, and Abecedarium from 1555 issued by the publisher Slovenska knjiga in 2000, the need for an investigation of the original and in this case also of the facsimile can be approved and new questions about the history and users of this work arise. Research limitation: Only the process of digitization is dealt with. The resolution, the output format, and the file size should be tailored {{to meet the demands of}} publishing on the web. Originality/practical implications: The knowledge of prepress technology allows the evaluation of “objectivity”, the quality and applicability of facsimiles and opens new possibilities for the study of valuable originals. <br /...|$|E
50|$|The museum {{made several}} {{important}} acquisitions {{in the following}} years, among them a second Gutenberg Bible, the Shuckburgh Bible in two volumes (1978), and two block books <b>printed</b> using wooden <b>formes</b> and today extremely rare. Another major change was {{the introduction of the}} museum’s educational unit in 1989. In 2000, the old museum building was restored and extended.|$|R
2500|$|The Folio was typeset {{and bound}} in [...] "sixes" [...] – 3 sheets of paper, taken together, were folded into a booklet-like quire or {{gathering}} of 6 leaves, 12 pages. Once printed, the [...] "sixes" [...] were assembled and bound {{together to make}} the book. The sheets were <b>printed</b> in 2-page <b>formes,</b> meaning that pages 1 and 12 of the first quire were printed simultaneously {{on one side of}} one sheet of paper (which became the [...] "outer" [...] side); then pages 2 and 11 were printed {{on the other side of}} the same sheet (the [...] "inner" [...] side). The same was done with pages 3 and 10, and 4 and 9, on the second sheet, and pages 5 and 8, and 6 and 7, on the third. Then the first quire could be assembled with its pages in the correct order. The next quire was printed by the same method: pages 13 and 24 on one side of one sheet, etc. This meant that the text being printed had to be [...] "cast off" [...] – the compositors had to plan beforehand how much text would fit onto each page. If the compositors were setting type from manuscripts (perhaps messy, revised and corrected manuscripts), their calculations would frequently be off by greater or lesser amounts, resulting in the need to expand or compress. A line of verse could be printed as two; or verse could be printed as prose to save space, or lines and passages could even be omitted (a disturbing prospect for those who prize Shakespeare's works).|$|R
