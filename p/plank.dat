5|$|The modern routing of NY317 was {{originally}} {{the northern part}} of the Jordan and Skaneateles <b>Plank</b> Road. Chartered in 1855, the Jordan and Skaneateles <b>Plank</b> Road Company was set to provide a <b>plank</b> road from Jordan southward to Skaneateles. This <b>plank</b> road was constructed in the 1850s in place of the Syracuse and Auburn Railroad and a small railroad from Skaneateles to Skaneateles Junction, two crude railroads that were in the area which had ended service in 1836 and 1850 respectively. On March25, 1853, the New York State Assembly proposed an additional toll gate to be constructed in Elbridge along the <b>plank</b> road. On June15, 1853, the bill was passed by the Legislature and went into effect.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was once}} part of the Jordan and Skaneateles <b>Plank</b> Road, a <b>plank</b> road {{established}} by a New York State Legislature charter in the 1850s. It spanned {{a short distance from}} Jordan to the village of Skaneateles and was a successor to the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad, which ceased operations in 1834. However, the <b>plank</b> road lasted less than two decades. In 1866, the Legislature granted another charter, this time creating the Skaneateles Railroad and its corporation, which bought out most of the <b>plank</b> road company.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 was {{the first}} King's Highway in Lambton County when it was assumed in 1927 between Highway3 at Morpeth and Highway7 at Reece's Corners. This {{original}} section of highway changed from a mudhole to a <b>plank</b> road circa 1860. When James Miller Williams, a Hamilton businessman, set out one day from during a drought to dig a well, he chose a spot downhill from an existing oil seep {{in the village of}} Black Creek. Instead of encountering water, Williams hit a shallow oil deposit. As a result of the ensuing oil-boom, which would begin the petroleum industry in North America, Williams laid out the village and changed its name to Oil Springs. Two competing <b>plank</b> road companies were formed, the Black Creek <b>Plank</b> Road Company (of which Williams was a principal investor) and the Sarnia to Florence <b>Plank</b> Road Company, both of which aimed their roads through Oil Springs. Although both roads were constructed, the former company was more prosperous in its endeavours; in 1886, {{a significant portion of the}} Sarnia to Florence <b>Plank</b> Road was closed up and turned over to local property owners. The Black Creek <b>Plank</b> Road Company meanwhile had transformed the muddy quagmire of a path into a well-maintained road. By 1863, three miles of road south of Wyoming had been paved, and the remainder south to Oil Springs planked (the Sarnia Road followed two years later). However, as the oil boom faded, so too did improvement to the road.|$|E
50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>planking</b> has generated a backlash. Some people {{object to the}} more ridiculous photos that have circulated, such as a girl <b>planking</b> with her head in a toilet or a woman <b>planking</b> on a stripper pole. Also, <b>planking</b> in dangerous places has resulted in many injuries {{and at least one}} death.|$|R
50|$|The <b>planks</b> were {{alleged to}} be 38 cm wide, 22 cm tall and about 0.5 cm thick. The edges and {{surfaces}} of the <b>planks</b> are uneven and near the top there are two holes for joining the <b>planks.</b> The text is carved into the <b>planks</b> and later covered with some coloring. Text alignment lines (roughly straight and parallel) are drawn across the <b>planks</b> and the tops of letters are aligned with these lines. The text is written below the lines, rather than above. The {{size and shape of}} the letters are different, suggesting that more than one person wrote the text. Some <b>planks</b> were partially or mostly rotten.|$|R
50|$|By 1837, the Michigan Road {{had reached}} Logansport. The roadway {{consisted}} of leveled dirt and log bridges, which decayed with every rain and snow fall. By 1850 the state approved funding {{to have the}} road <b>planked.</b> The roadbed was leveled and then covered with a wooden structure. <b>Planking</b> consisted of log sills or sleepers, laid lengthwise along the outer edges. Crosswise, <b>planks</b> were nailed to the sleepers. The <b>planks</b> were 2 or 3 in thick. Each sleeper run could be up to 10 ft in length. When necessary, multiple sleeper sections were linked end to end. Together, these <b>planks</b> provided a road free of dust and mud. With age, mud holes formed under the <b>planks</b> and sprayed outwards and up between the <b>planks,</b> making some sections of roadway impassible during the muddy season.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, Route 3 was legislated {{along the}} Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road portion of present-day Route 120. It was {{eventually}} designated {{along the entire}} portion of current Route 120. In 1953, Route 3 was moved to its current freeway alignment, replacing Route S3, and a portion of Route 20 was designated to run from current Route 3 north to Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road while Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road {{was removed from the}} state highway system. The portion of Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road that lost its state highway status in 1953 gained it back in 1972, when it became an extension of Route 20 {{as a result of the}} construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. As this route was not connected to the mainline of Route 20, it was designated Route 120 by the 1990s. As a result of the construction of American Dream Meadowlands, the interchange between Route 3 and Route 120 was improved. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in 2009 and a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was legislated to {{run along the}} Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road portion of today’s Route 120 {{as part of its}} route between Secaucus and Greenwood Lake. By 1947, Route 3 had been {{designated}} along the entire alignment of current Route 120. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, Route 3 was moved to a new freeway alignment that was Route S3. As a result of this realignment, the portion of the route between modern Route 3 and Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road became a portion of Route 20 while the section along Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road was removed from the state highway system. Paterson <b>Plank</b> Road between County Route 503 and Route 17 joined the state highway system again as an extension of this portion of Route 20 in 1972 when the Meadowlands Sports Complex was slated to be built. At this point, Route 20 had consisted of three disconnected segments. Since none of these segments were connected, this portion of road was redesignated Route 120 by the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|On April17, 1866, the <b>plank</b> road {{company was}} bought {{out by the}} Skaneateles Railroad Company. The state {{chartered}} the bill, the railroad was constructed and tolls were to be collected by the railroad company rather than the <b>plank</b> road company.|$|E

5000|$|Carvel, {{in which}} a smooth hull is formed by edge joined <b>planks</b> {{attached}} to a frame. The <b>planks</b> may be curved in cross section like barrel staves. Carvel <b>planks</b> are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the <b>planks</b> and covered with some waterproof substance. It {{takes its name from}} an archaic ship type and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean. A number of boat building texts are available which describe the carvel <b>planking</b> method in detail.|$|R

5|$|By 1854, {{when it was}} incorporated, Crescent City had a {{population}} of 800 but no road leading inland. The Crescent City and Yreka <b>Plank</b> and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work stopped with the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City <b>Plank</b> Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a <b>plank</b> road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, {{where there was a}} toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing {{back and forth between the}} states, to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish Hatchery Road, and OR 238.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the road}} from Marcellus to Camillus along the Nine Mile Creek route was {{improved}} by the Camillus and Marcellus <b>Plank</b> Road Company, which was first chartered in 1853 and authorized to collect tolls from travelers using the road. The improvement of the road led to it becoming a stagecoach route {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. The former <b>plank</b> road alignment in the village of Marcellus (North Street) and the southward continuation along Cherry Street (now South Street) was paved in 1911 as part of the construction of a new state highway that would pass through the town.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of wood {{are used in the}} construction of the Luna. White Oak is a strong, dense wood used for outboard hull <b>planking,</b> pilothouse <b>planking,</b> keels and keelsons, hull structure and frames, and knees to connect right angles. Cypress is a highly rot-resistant wood used for main deckhouse <b>planking,</b> boat deck (also called the [...] "Texas") and pilothouse decking, and bulwark <b>planking</b> (original). It is being replaced by cedar during restoration. Douglas Fir is a straight-grained and strong wood used for main deck <b>planking,</b> and fore and aft masts. Live Yellow Pine is rot-resistant and flexible; it is used for inboard hull [...] "ceiling" [...] <b>planking,</b> deck beams, deckhouse coamings, and deckhouse studs. Locust is a tough wood that expands. It is used for wooden treenails, also called trunnels, to fasten wooden <b>planks</b> to frames in drilled holes.|$|R
40|$|In {{construction}} works of concrete slab, form works can be deleted by unsing PC <b>planks</b> as embedded forms. In addition, the <b>planks</b> {{act as a}} pa. rt of the slab section. If both PC <b>planks</b> and cast-in-place concrete combine well, this composite slab can be treated as PC member rather than 'RC. The authors have carried out series of fatigue tests with five different types of composite beams which were made under various conditions. The results are as follows; 1. Thin PC <b>planks</b> can be made using pretensioning bench and sliding forms. 2. The bond between PC <b>planks</b> and cast-in-place concrete is satisfactory, just by making transverse ditches on the top surface of PC <b>planks.</b> 3. The prestress of PC <b>planks</b> in composite slabs acts against crack propagation effectively. 4. Designing the composite slab as type III PC is the most suitable method. 1...|$|R
50|$|While wooden pegs (often called treenails) {{can be used}} {{to fasten}} thicker clinker <b>planks,</b> this {{technique}} only works if the <b>planks</b> are thick enough to hold the pegs. Because of this, large ships were often built using pegs, while smaller boats would use sewn <b>planks.</b>|$|R

5|$|On April13, 1825, the {{legislature}} chartered the Auburn and Port Byron Turnpike Company. The Auburn and Port Byron Turnpike {{began at the}} Auburn State Prison in Auburn and proceeded northward along the routing of NY38 to meet the north branch of the Seneca Turnpike {{in the town of}} Brutus (now Throop). From there, the turnpike continued on NY38 through Port Byron to the Seneca River, where it ended at a bridge crossing the river at Mosquito Point. In 1851, the Auburn and Moravia <b>Plank</b> Road Company was incorporated. They were tasked with connecting Moravia to Auburn by way of a <b>plank</b> road along the western side of Owasco Lake (now NY38).|$|E
50|$|The {{name of the}} problem, {{specifically}} for the sets of points between parallel hyperplanes, comes from the visualisation {{of the problem in}} R2. Here, hyperplanes are just straight lines and so <b>planks</b> become the space between two parallel lines. Thus the <b>planks</b> {{can be thought of as}} (infinitely long) <b>planks</b> of wood, and the question becomes how many <b>planks</b> does one need to completely cover a convex tabletop of minimal width w? Bang's theorem shows that, for example, a circular table of diameter d feet can't be covered by fewer than d <b>planks</b> of wood of width one foot each.|$|R
50|$|The cedar ropes that {{secured the}} <b>planks</b> to the {{uprights}} and beams allowed {{the people to}} deconstruct their homes and bring their <b>planks</b> {{with them to the}} next location.

5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a <b>plank</b> road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new <b>plank</b> road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the <b>plank</b> road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California.|$|E

50|$|Working {{up from a}} stout oaken keel, the shipwrights would rivet the <b>planks</b> {{together}} using {{wrought iron}} rivets and roves. Ribs maintained {{the shape of the}} hull sides.

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) <b>planking,</b> a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping <b>planks</b> that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge <b>planking</b> with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker <b>planking</b> is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping <b>planking,</b> though not with a true clinker technique.|$|R
5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the <b>plank</b> road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City <b>Plank</b> Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E
