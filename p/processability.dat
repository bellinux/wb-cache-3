50|$|Since most {{conductive}} polymers require oxidative doping, {{the properties}} of the resulting state are crucial. Such materials are salt-like (polymer salt), which diminishes their solubility in organic solvents and water and hence their <b>processability.</b> Furthermore, the charged organic backbone is often unstable towards atmospheric moisture. The poor <b>processability</b> for many polymers requires the introduction of solubilizing or substituents, which can further complicate the synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is divided}} into old type and new type: Old types include ACM (copolymer of acrylic acid ester and 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether) {{containing}} chlorine and ANM (copolymer of acrylic acid ester and acrylonitrile) without chloride. Other than the slightly better water resistance of ANM, there are no physical differences; even <b>processability</b> is poor for both types. Since prices are also high, demand is not so high vis-à-vis the characteristics. On the other hand, the new type of acrylic rubber does not contain any chlorine despite its unclear chemical composition. <b>Processability</b> has been improved; most of the tackiness to rolls, as well as staining problems related to mold have been solved.|$|E
5000|$|Thermoplastic polyesters {{containing}} CHDM exhibit enhanced strength, clarity, and solvent resistance. The exact {{properties of}} the polyesters vary from the high melting crystalline poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate), PCT, to the non-crystalline copolyesters with the combination of ethylene glycol and CHDM in the backbone. The {{properties of the}}se polyesters is also dependent on the cis/trans ratio of the CHDM monomer. [...] CHDM has low melting point and reduces the degree of crystallinity of PET homopolymer, improving its <b>processability.</b> With improved <b>processability,</b> the polymer tends to degrade less to acetaldehyde and other undesirable degradation products. The copolymer with PET is known as glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate, PETG. PETG is used in many fields, including electronics, automobiles, barrier, and medicals etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Processability</b> {{theory is}} a theory and a model of second {{language}} acquisition developed by Manfred Pienemann that touches the linguistic structures that surface in the learning of a second language. The theory {{has been used as}} a framework by several scientists from Europe and Australia.|$|E
50|$|PET polymer is very {{sensitive}} to hydrolytic degradation, resulting in severe reduction in its molecular weight, thereby adversely affecting its subsequent melt <b>processability.</b> Therefore, {{it is essential to}} dry the PET flakes or granules to a very low moisture level prior to melt extrusion.|$|E
50|$|Using a {{colloidal}} {{method to}} make CIGS and CIS nanoparticles for photovoltaic applications provide materials that possess the desired elemental ratios or stoichiometry, {{which can be}} adjusted to meet specific needs. The nanoparticles are passivated with organic capping agents, providing solubility and thus solution <b>processability.</b>|$|E
50|$|EBS is a {{synthetic}} wax {{used as a}} dispersing agent or internal/external lubricant for benefits in plastic applications to facilitate and stabilize the dispersion of solid compounding materials to enhance <b>processability,</b> to decrease friction and abrasion of the polymer surface, and to contribute color stability and polymer degradation.|$|E
50|$|Gelatin is {{prepared}} from the denaturation of collagen and many desirable properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-immunogenity in physiological environments, and easy <b>processability</b> make this polymer {{a good choice}} for tissue engineering applications. It is used in engineering tissues for the skin, bone and cartilage and is used commercially for skin replacements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Processability</b> {{theory is}} part of the {{cognitive}} approach to second language acquisition that attempts to increase understanding of the ways L2 learners restructure their interlanguage knowledge systems to be in greater conformity to L2 structures. <b>Processability</b> theory states that learners restructure their L2 knowledge systems in an order of which they are capable at their stage of development. For instance, In order to acquire the correct morphological and syntactic forms for English questions, learners must transform declarative English sentences. They do so by a series of stages, consistent across learners. Clahsen proposed that certain processing principles determine this order of restructuring. Specifically, he stated that learners first, maintain declarative word order while changing other aspects of the utterances, second, move words to {{the beginning and end of}} sentences, and third, move elements within main clauses before subordinate clauses.|$|E
50|$|A {{responsive}} macromolecule {{changes its}} conformation and/or properties in a controllable, reproducible, and reversible manner {{in response to}} an external stimulus (solvent, pH, temperature, etc.). These changes can be used to create a large variety of smart devices. The good <b>processability</b> of most smart polymers facilitates their incorporation into devices and adds additional advantages (e.g. all plastic electronic/optical sensors).|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of conductive polymers is their <b>processability,</b> mainly by dispersion. Conductive polymers are not plastics, i.e., {{they are not}} thermoformable, yet they are organic polymers, like (insulating) polymers. They can offer high electrical conductivity but have different mechanical properties than other commercially used polymers. The electrical properties can be fine-tuned using the methods of organic synthesis and of advanced dispersion.|$|E
50|$|The {{polymerizing}} {{temperature is}} approximately 5℃ {{in the case}} of SBR and 5∼10℃ {{in the case of}} NBR. Since rubber molecule types have a smaller number of branches than hot rubber polymerized at high temperature (50℃) and are characterized by good stereoregularity, cold rubber has superior <b>processability</b> as well as the ability to produce vulcanized materials with good tensile strength, expansion and aging resistance, and flex resistance.|$|E
50|$|They are UV stable, in {{contrast}} to other bioplastics from polymers such as polylactic acid, partial ca. temperatures up to 180 °C, and show a low permeation of water. The crystallinity can lie {{in the range of}} a few to 70%. <b>Processability,</b> impact strength and flexibility improves with a higher percentage of valerate in the material. PHAs are soluble in halogenated solvents such chloroform, dichloromethane or dichloroethane.|$|E
50|$|Methyl {{acrylate}} {{is used as}} a comonomer in the polymerization with {{a variety}} of acrylic and vinyl monomers. In doing so it has a similar range of uses as ethyl acrylate. When using methyl acrylate as comonomer resulting acrylic paints are harder and more brittle than those with the homologous acrylates. Copolymerizing methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile improves their melt <b>processability</b> to fibers, which could be used as precursors for carbon fibers.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] RDF typed links are {{fundamental}} in [...] LOD datasets for identifying the relationship (predicate) type of [...] RDF triples, {{contributing to the}} automatic <b>processability</b> of machine-readable statements of the Giant Global Graph on the Semantic Web. The typed links in [...] RDF are expressed as {{the value of the}} [...] property, defining the relationship type using well-established controlled vocabulary terms or definitions from [...] LOD datasets such as ...|$|E
50|$|Asahi Kasei’s product Xyron {{contributes}} {{several major}} advantages and {{contributions to the}} company. For instance, Xyron is a halogen-free flame retardancy. It has low mold shrinkage, paired with dimensional accuracy and stability. Xyron resists acid and alkalis and is created for electrical property. Not only does it have <b>processability</b> and workability, but contributes a low-water absorption, hot-water resistance, and hydrolytic stability. Xyron has a low-specific gravity of 1.06-1.10 (EEP/PS non-fill). Finally, it has a heat resistance of up to 85-170 degrees Celsius.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the unique}} {{attributes}} of LaRC-SI is that when it is exposed to temperatures above its softening point of 250 °C, it cannot be redissolved, yet it maintains its amorphous character and melt <b>processability.</b> As an amorphous thermoplastic, the LaRC-SI can be reformed at elevated temperature and pressures. It can be applied {{in the form of}} a spray, spin, dip coating, paint, or spread with a doctor's blade. The LaRC-SI has excellent adhesive and dielectric properties. It can also be recycled.|$|E
50|$|Conductive {{polymers}} or, more precisely, intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) are organic polymers that conduct electricity. Such compounds {{may have}} metallic conductivity {{or can be}} semiconductors. The biggest advantage of conductive polymers is their <b>processability,</b> mainly by dispersion. Conductive polymers are generally not thermoplastics, i.e., they are not thermoformable. But, like insulating polymers, they are organic materials. They can offer high electrical conductivity but do not show similar mechanical properties to other commercially available polymers. The electrical properties can be fine-tuned using the methods of organic synthesis and by advanced dispersion techniques.|$|E
50|$|The mental {{processes}} that underlie second-language acquisition {{can be broken}} down into micro-processes and macro-processes. Micro-processes include attention; working memory; integration and restructuring. Restructuring is the process by which learners change their interlanguage systems; and monitoring is the conscious attending of learners to their own language output. Macro-processes include the distinction between intentional learning and incidental learning; and also the distinction between explicit and implicit learning. Some of the notable cognitive theories of second-language acquisition include the nativization model, the multidimensional model and <b>processability</b> theory, emergentist models, the competition model, and skill-acquisition theories.|$|E
50|$|Aggregation {{has also}} been combated by varying the {{chemical}} structure. For example, when conjugated polymers aggregate, which is natural in the solid state, their emission can be self-quenched, reducing luminescent quantum yields and reducing luminescent device performance. In opposition to this tendency, researchers have used tri-functional monomers to create highly branched polyfluorenes which do not aggregate due to the bulkiness of the substituents. This design strategy has achieved luminescent quantum yields of 42% in the solid state.This solution reduces the ease of <b>processability</b> of the material because branched polymers have increased chain entanglement and poor solubility.|$|E
50|$|The 1990s saw {{a host of}} new {{theories}} {{introduced to}} the field, such as Michael Long's interaction hypothesis, Merrill Swain's output hypothesis, and Richard Schmidt's noticing hypothesis. However, the two main areas of research interest were linguistic theories of SLA based upon Noam Chomsky's universal grammar, and psychological approaches such as skill acquisition theory and connectionism. The latter category also saw the new theories of <b>processability</b> and input processing in this time period. The 1990s also saw the introduction of sociocultural theory, an approach to explain second-language acquisition in terms of the social environment of the learner.|$|E
50|$|If {{there was}} a way to create {{reversible}} covalent bonds, this would combine high <b>processability,</b> repairability, and performance. There have been already many strategies tried that would allow such plastics. Vitrimers combine the desirable properties of both classes: they show the mechanical and thermal properties of thermosets and can be also molded under the influence of heat. Vitrimers can be welded like (silicon) glasses or metals. Welding by simple heating allows the creation of complex objects. Vitrimere like (silicon) glasses or metals are welded. A weld by simply heating allows customizing complex objects. Vitrimers could thus be a new and promising class of materials with many uses.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, so far {{most of the}} peptide {{structures}} formed are in 1 or 2-D, {{whereas in}} nature most biological structures are in 3D.Critique {{has been made in}} light of the fact that there is a lack in theoretical knowledge about the self-assembling behaviours of peptides. This knowledge could prove to be very useful in facilitating rational designs and precise control of the peptide assemblies.Lastly, although an extensive amount of work is being conducted on developing self-assembling peptide related applications, issues such as commercial viability and <b>processability</b> has not been paid the same amount of attention. Yet it is crucial for these issues to be assessed if the applications were to be realized.|$|E
5000|$|Due to its stability, <b>processability,</b> and {{electrical}} and optical properties, PPV {{has been considered}} {{for a wide variety}} of applications.1 In 1989 the first polymer-based light emitting diode (LED) was discovered using PPV as the emissive layer. Polymers are speculated to have advantages over molecular materials in LEDs, such as ease of processing, reduced tendency for crystallization, and greater thermal and mechanical stability. Ever since the first breakthrough in 1989, a large number of PPV derivatives have been synthesized and used for LED applications. Although solid-state lasing has yet to be demonstrated in an organic LED, polyvinylene (MEH-PPV) has been proven to be a promising laser dye due to its high fluorescence efficiency in solution.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} poor <b>processability,</b> {{conductive}} polymers have few large-scale applications. They have promise in antistatic materials {{and they have}} been incorporated into commercial displays and batteries, but there have been limitations due to the manufacturing costs, material inconsistencies, toxicity, poor solubility in solvents, and inability to directly melt process. Literature suggests they are also promising in organic solar cells, printing electronic circuits, organic light-emitting diodes, actuators, electrochromism, supercapacitors, chemical sensors and biosensors, flexible transparent displays, electromagnetic shielding and possibly replacement for the popular transparent conductor indium tin oxide. Another use is for microwave-absorbent coatings, particularly radar-absorptive coatings on stealth aircraft. Conducting polymers are rapidly gaining attraction in new applications with increasingly processable materials with better electrical and physical properties and lower costs. The new nanostructured forms of conducting polymers particularly, augment this field with their higher surface area and better dispersability.|$|E
50|$|The thermal-oxidative {{degradation}} of a polymer starts at lower temperatures than the merely thermal degradation. Both types of degradation proceed via a radical mechanism. Aromatics offer a good protection against {{both types of}} degradation, because free radicals can be delocalized through the π-system of the aromatic and stabilized. In this way the thermal stability is strongly increasing. Poly(p-phenylene) can serve as an example, it consists exclusively of aromatics and provides extremely stability, even at temperatures above 500 °C. On the other hand the rigidity of the chains makes it more or less inprocessible. To find a balance between <b>processability</b> and stability, flexible units {{can be incorporated into}} the chain (e.g., O, S, C(CH3). Aromatics can also be substituted by other rather rigid units (e. g. SO2, CO). By mixing these different elements the diversity of high-performance plastics is created with their different characteristics.|$|E

50|$|PVC or {{polyvinyl}} chloride production {{dates back to}} the 19th century but began being widely used in the 1950's when companies discovered it's versatility. By the 1980's, 20 companies were producing PVC. The advancements in chemical makeup made the material ideal for construction. It's low cost, durability, and <b>processability</b> made it a widely used product outside of construction into markets like IT, healthcare, and transportation The market for PVC extended out of construction into beauty products like aerosol hairspray. PVC was largely deemed harmless until four workers died of angiosarcoma in a PVC production factory in Louisville, Kentucky. After this, the vinyl industry developed a standard of one part per million (1ppm) as the acceptable level during the production of PVC and also removed PVC from hairspray products (award of commendation article). The Vinyl Institute claimed that only resin workers were at risk during the production and that the new (1ppm) standard protected against that.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to their}} poor <b>processability,</b> {{conductive}} polymers have few large-scale applications. They have some promise in antistatic materials {{and have been}} built into commercial displays and batteries, but have had limits due to the production costs, material inconsistencies, toxicity, poor solubility in solvents, and inability to directly melt process. Nevertheless, conducting polymers are rapidly gaining attraction in new uses with increasingly processable materials with better electrical and physical properties and lower costs. With the availability of stable and reproducible dispersions, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polyaniline have gained some large scale applications. While PEDOT is mainly used in antistatic applications and as a transparent conductive layer {{in the form of}} PEDOT and polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS, mixed form: PEDOT:PSS) dispersions, polyaniline is widely used to make printed circuit boards, in the final finish, to protect copper from corrosion and preventing its solderability. [...] Newer nanostructured forms of conducting polymers provide fresh impetus to this field, with their higher surface area and better dispersability.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the wide}} variety of {{thermoset}} resin formulations (epoxy, vinylester, polyester, etc.), their cure behavior is qualitatively identical. The resin viscosity drops initially upon the application of heat, passes through a region of maximum flow and begins to increase as the chemical reactions increase the average length and the degree of cross-linking between the constituent oligomers. This process continues until a continuous 3-dimensional network of oligomer chains is created - this stage is termed gelation. In terms of <b>processability</b> of the resin this marks an important watershed: before gelation the system is relatively mobile, after it the mobility is very limited, the micro-structure of the resin and the composite material is fixed and severe diffusion limitations to further cure are created. Thus in order to achieve vitrification in the resin, it is usually necessary to increase the process temperature after gelation. Cure monitoring methods give a significant insight to the chemical process and define process actions towards achieving specific quality indices of the cured resin systems.__notoc__ ...|$|E
50|$|Polysilazanes are not vaporizable {{because of}} strong intermolecular forces. Heating polysilazanes results in {{crosslinking}} to form higher molecular weight polymers. At temperatures of 100-300 °C, further crosslinking of the molecules takes place with evolution of hydrogen and ammonia. If the polysilazane contains further functional {{groups such as}} vinyl units, additional reactions can take place. In general, liquid materials will be converted to solids as the temperature increases. At 400-700 °C, the organic groups decompose with the evolution of small hydrocarbon molecules, ammonia and hydrogen. Between 700 and 1200 °C a three-dimensional amorphous network develops containing Si, C and N ("SiCN ceramics") with a density of ca. 2 g/cm3. A further temperature increase can result in crystallization of the amorphous material {{and the formation of}} silicon nitride, silicon carbide and carbon. This so-called pyrolysis of the polysilazanes produces ceramic materials from low-viscosity liquids with very high yield (up to 90%). Due to the organic groups that are often used to give good polymer <b>processability,</b> ceramic yield is normally in the range of 60-80%.|$|E
5000|$|Hybrid {{techniques}} which combine {{an organic}} polymer matrix with highly refractive inorganic nanoparticles {{could result in}} high n values. The factors affecting the refractive index of a high-n nanocomposite include {{the characteristics of the}} polymer matrix, nanoparticles andthe hybrid technology between inorganic and organic components. The refractive index of a nanocomposite can be estimated as , where , [...] and [...] stand for the refractive indices of the nanocomposite, nanoparticle and organic matrix, respectively. [...] and [...] represent the volume fractions of the nanoparticles and organic matrix, respectively. The nanoparticle load is also important in designing HRIP nanocomposites for optical applications, because excessive concentrations increase the optical loss and decrease the <b>processability</b> of the nanocomposites. The choice of nanoparticles is often influenced by their size and surface characteristics. In order to increase optical transparency and reduce Rayleigh scattering of the nanocomposite, the diameter of the nanoparticle should be below 25 nm. Direct mixing of nanoparticles with the polymer matrix often results in the undesirable aggregation of nanoparticles - this is avoided by modifying their surface. The most commonly used nanoparticles for HRIPs include TiO2 (anatase, n=2.45; rutile, n=2.70), ZrO2 (n=2.10), amorphous silicon (n=4.23), PbS (n=4.20) and ZnS (n=2.36). Polyimides have high refractive indexes and thus are often used as the matrix for high-n nanoparticles. The resulting nanocomposites exhibit a tunable refractive index ranging from 1.57 to 1.99.|$|E

The present work describes a new development in LLDPE technology that produces resins with significant improvement in {{mechanical properties}} without sacrificing <b>processability.</b> Detailed blown film results show the performance improvement achieved by the new resins, compared to conventional LLDPEs, and the downgauging potential offered by the property improvement...|$|E
40|$|This study {{discusses}} the Dutch-Indonesian interlanguage using psycholinguistics in the syntactic level. The sentences in the interlanguage are expressed by thirty students with different language proficiency levels and are analyzed {{to test the}} prediction of Pienemann’s <b>processability</b> theory (2005 a, 2005 b, 2005 c, dan 2007). This study proves {{the validity of the}} <b>processability</b> theory. The Dutch learners mastering sentences with the most difficult level of <b>processability</b> also master sentences with easier levels of <b>processability.</b> The results from the learners with the high proficiency support the <b>processability</b> theory more firmly than those from the learners with the lower proficiency. Learners rely on meaning when they are not sure of their grammatical competence. Interlanguage is formed because of the demand on the learners that in a short time they have to express concepts and ideas in their minds but the facilitating divices are still limited, while they have already mastered the first language and possibly other languages...|$|E
40|$|In {{semiconductor}} high-mix fabs, several technology nodes are run on {{the same}} line, using tool types from different generations. In this context, <b>processability</b> is a function defining which products can be pro-cessed on a given machine considering {{the current status of}} both the product and the machine. So in a high-mix context, having an information system that provides reliable information on <b>processability</b> and that can support the evolution of <b>processability</b> rules is fundamental. In this paper, we analyze the key elements for such a system. Based on the example of the implementation of fab constraints at STMicroelectronics ’ Crolles 300 production unit, we illustrate the consequences of the integration of new <b>processability</b> rules and propose flexible and agile UML class diagrams enabling information system to meet evolution requirements. The approach is validated on real fab data, and its impact is discussed. ...|$|E
