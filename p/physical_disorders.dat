25|$|From a {{diagnostic}} standpoint, organic disorders were those believed caused by physical illness affecting the brain (that is, psychiatric disorders secondary to other conditions), while functional disorders were considered disorders of {{the functioning of}} the mind in the absence of <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> (that is, primary psychological or psychiatric disorders). The materialistic or naturalistic (i.e. scientific) view of the mind–body problem holds that mental disorders arise from physical processes; in this view, the distinction between brain and mind, and therefore between organic and functional disease, is an artificial one. Subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional, such as schizophrenia. The DSM-IV-TR avoids the functional/organic distinction, and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses, psychosis due to general medical conditions, and substance-induced psychosis.|$|E

6000|$|We {{can only}} {{add that the}} health in which a man writes may {{possibly}} excuse the dismal quality of what he writes, and that Rousseau was now as always the prey of bodily pain which, as he was conscious, made him distraught. [...] "My sufferings are not very excruciating just now," [...] he wrote on a later occasion, [...] "but they are incessant, and I am not out of pain a single moment day or night, and this quite drives me mad. I feel bitterly my wrong conduct and the baseness of my suspicions; but if anything can excuse me, it is my mournful state, my loneliness," [...] and so on.[31] This prolonged physical anguish, which was made more intense {{towards the end of}} 1761 by the accidental breaking of a surgical instrument,[32] sometimes so nearly wore his fortitude away as to make him think of suicide.[33] In Lord Edward's famous letter on suicide in the New Heloïsa, while denying in forcible terms the right of ending one's days merely to escape from intolerable mental distress, he admits that inasmuch as <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> only grow incessantly worse, violent and incurable bodily pain may be an excuse for a man making away with himself; he ceases to be a human being before dying, and in putting an end to his life he only completes his release from a body that embarrasses him, and contains his soul no longer.[34] The thought was often present to him in this form. Eighteen months later than our last date, the purpose grew very deliberate under an aggravation of his malady, and he seriously looked upon his own case as falling within the conditions of Lord Edward's exception.[35] It is difficult, in the face of outspoken declarations like these, to know what writers can be thinking of when, with respect to the controversy on the manner of Rousseau's death, they pronounce him incapable of such a dereliction of his own most cherished principles as anything like self-destruction would have been.|$|E

40|$|From 2000 onwards Dutch {{governments have}} tried to improve the general 'livability' of neighborhoods, of which {{troublesome}} and potentially threatening social conditions (social <b>disorder)</b> and <b>physical</b> conditions (<b>physical</b> <b>disorder)</b> are one part. A major focus in these plans for improvement is the juxtaposition of 'living' and 'working' in the same neighborhood. The presence of firms and local business ownership is thought to improve the neighborhood. Evidence for this idea is, however, hard to find. Business presence {{may lead to a}} regular flow of people on the street, thereby stimulating normal use and providing 'eyes on the street'. In contrast, empirical studies often find that business presence is related to more social and <b>physical</b> <b>disorder</b> rather than less disorder. Moreover, there is almost no research on individual actions by local entrepreneurs to make the neighborhood safer or cleaner. This dissertation, a collection of five research papers, addresses these issues. It investigates the effect of neighborhood community characteristics and the effect of businesses on a neighborhood’s social and <b>physical</b> <b>disorder.</b> Complementary arguments from social disorganization theory and routine activity theory are combined to derive hypotheses on the effect of business presence and the actions by local business owners on the level of social and <b>physical</b> <b>disorder.</b> A combination of datasets and different statistical analyses (structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear analyses) are used to answer the research questions. Most importantly, this study finds that (a) the presence of businesses is an important predictor of disorder, rivaling traditional explanations (e. g., population turnover); (b) disorder is not only caused by, but also drives population turnover and weakening of social control; (c) local entrepreneurs only differ from (unemployed) residents with regard to their willingness to intervene in disorderly situation...|$|R

50|$|In medicine, a {{disorder}} is a functional abnormality or disturbance. Medical disorders {{can be categorized}} into mental disorders, <b>physical</b> <b>disorders,</b> genetic disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders, and functional disorders. The term disorder is often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms disease or illness, and therefore is a preferred terminology in some circumstances.

However, as scholars have emphasized, it begs to question whether neighborhood disorder have been measured in a reliable way and with adequate tools. The main aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate to what extent virtual systematic social observations (SSO) through Google Street View (GSV) may reliably audit neighborhood <b>physical</b> <b>disorder</b> in comparison to self-reported levels of neighborhood disorder. Further, the study also intends to chart whether virtual SSO through GSV is a valid instrument by testing a fundamental notion of the Broken Windows theory. The study consists of two sets of data, i. e. virtual SSO through GSV of 21 census neighborhoods in the city of Malmö (Sweden) and self-reported data of respondents living in the particular neighborhoods of interest. The correlations between the methodological diverse constructs of neighborhood disorder are subsequently examined, as well as the correlation between virtually observed <b>physical</b> <b>disorder</b> and victimization of property crimes. The results suggests that virtually observed neighborhood <b>physical</b> <b>disorder</b> through GSV is significantly correlated to self-reported neighborhood level of disorder as well as to victimization of property crimes. Virtual SSO through GSV thus appears to be a reliable and somewhat valid alternative towards auditing neighborhood level of disorder, comparable to data gathered through a community survey. Virtual observations through GSV do however struggle with several limitations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{relation}} between {{childhood sexual abuse}} (CSA) and <b>physical</b> health <b>disorders</b> in adulthood, and what factors may serve as mediators, remains poorly understood. Using data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (N= 3, 486), we tested whether CSA was associated with <b>physical</b> health <b>disorders</b> in adult women and if mediated effects via body mass index (BMI), anxiety/depression, alcohol dependence, and smoking were present. Compared to women with no CSA, women who had experienced CSA involving intercourse had {{more than twice the}} odds of being obese, more than 3 times the odds of experiencing mental health disorders, more than 4 times the odds of being alcohol dependent, more than 5 times the odds of being drug dependent, and more than 6 times the odds of attempting suicide. Those experiencing both CSA and child physical abuse (CPA) were on average over 11 kg heavier than those with neither CSA nor CPA. After controlling for demographics, CPA, and childhood bullying, CSA was associated with the majority of <b>physical</b> health <b>disorders</b> studied (typically 50 – 100 % increases in odds). Evidence was found consistent with mediation by BMI (typically accounting for 5 – 20 % increases in odds) and anxiety/depression (typically accounting for 8 – 40 % increases in odds), in a dose-response manner, for the majority of <b>physical</b> health <b>disorders.</b> Bidirectional relations among these mediators and <b>physical</b> health <b>disorders,</b> and residual confounding, may have led to overestimation of mediation through BMI and anxiety/depression and underestimation of mediation through alcohol/smoking. Relations between both CPA and childhood bullying and <b>physical</b> health <b>disorders</b> in adulthood were also found.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{neighborhoods in}} which {{children}} live, play, and eat provide an environmental context that may influence obesity risk and ameliorate or exacerbate health disparities. The current study examines whether neighborhood characteristics predict obesity in a prospective cohort of girls. METHODS: Participants were 174 girls (aged 8 - 10 years at baseline), a subset from the Cohort Study of Young Girls' Nutrition, Environment, and Transitions. Trained observers completed street audits within a 0. 25 -mile radius around each girl's residence. Four scales (food and service retail, recreation, walkability, and <b>physical</b> <b>disorder)</b> were created from 40 observed neighborhood features. BMI was calculated from clinically measured height and weight. Obesity was defined as BMI-for-age ≥ 95 %. Logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations were used to examine neighborhood influences on obesity risk over 4 years of follow-up, controlling for race/ethnicity, pubertal status, and baseline BMI. Fully adjusted models also controlled for household income, parent education, and a census tract measure of neighborhood socioeconomic status. RESULTS: A 1 -SD increase on the food and service retail scale {{was associated with a}} 2. 27 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 42 to 3. 61; P <. 001) increased odds of being obese. A 1 -SD increase in <b>physical</b> <b>disorder</b> was associated with a 2. 41 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 31 to 4. 44; P =. 005) increased odds of being obese. Other neighborhood scales were not associated with risk for obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood food and retail environment and <b>physical</b> <b>disorder</b> around a girl's home predict risk for obesity across the transition from late childhood to adolescence...|$|R
