5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural <b>potential,</b> <b>and</b> none of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E
5|$|Before {{becoming}} a specialist school, Chetham's {{had a good}} reputation for music, and on this basis {{the decision was made}} to become a co-educational music school in 1969. The former Palatine Hotel, which housed offices and shops, was converted into extra teaching space and practice rooms. In 1969, 50 students were admitted based on musical <b>potential</b> <b>and</b> by 1972 this had risen to 150, more than half of the entire school. In 1977 the school changed to its present name. In 1978 the Long Millgate building, the original home of Manchester Grammar School, was purchased to provide additional space.|$|E

Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his <b>potential</b> <b>and</b> knowing the Yankees were looking for Jewish players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined it because he knew his opportunities would be limited by the presence of Gehrig as first baseman. Subsequently, he signed with the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic <b>potential</b> <b>and</b> also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 1942, Soviet forces {{under the}} command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko {{launched}} an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive. After initial promising signs, the offensive was stopped by German counterattacks. Critical errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's <b>potential</b> <b>and</b> overestimated their own newly trained forces, led to a German pincer attack which cut off advancing Soviet troops {{from the rest of the}} front. The operation caused almost 300,000 Soviet casualties compared to just 20,000 for the Germans and their allies.|$|E

5|$|SIM Lite {{measurements}} of Milky Way stars were to yield data to understand four topics: fundamental galactic parameters, the Oort Limit, disk mass <b>potential,</b> <b>and</b> {{mass of the}} Galaxy to large radii. The first, fundamental galactic parameters, was aimed at answering key questions about the size, shape and the rotation rate of the Milky Way. The team hoped to more accurately determine {{the distance from the}} Sun to the galactic center. The second topic, the Oort Limit, would have attempted to determine the mass of the galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the {{electric field}} is the local gradient of the electric potential.

40|$|Spontaneous {{electrical}} activity and internal Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) were measured simultaneously using conventional microelectrodes and fura- 2 fluorescence, respectively, in isolated circular smooth muscle bundles of the guinea-pig gastric antrum. The smooth muscle bundles generated periodic slow potentials with accompanying spike <b>potentials</b> <b>and</b> associated transient increases in [Ca 2 +]i (Ca 2 +-transients). Nifedipine abolished the spike potentials {{but not the}} slow <b>potentials,</b> <b>and</b> reduced the amplitude of associated Ca 2 +-transients. Caffeine, in the absence or presence of ryanodine, reduced resting [Ca 2 +]i levels and abolished the slow <b>potentials</b> <b>and</b> associated Ca 2 +-transients. Depolarization elevated and hyperpolarization reduced resting [Ca 2 +]i levels with associated changes {{in the frequency of}} slow potentials. The amplitude of Ca 2 +-transients changed in a bell-shaped manner with the membrane potential change. Slow <b>potentials</b> <b>and</b> associated Ca 2 +-transients were abolished if [Ca 2 +]i levels were reduced by BAPTA-AM or if the internal Ca 2 + pump was inhibited by cyclopiazonic acid. 2 -Aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2 -APB), a known inhibitor of inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) -mediated Ca 2 + release, also blocked slow <b>potentials</b> <b>and</b> Ca 2 +-transients. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial protonophore, depolarized the membrane, elevated [Ca 2 +]i levels <b>and</b> abolished slow <b>potentials</b> <b>and</b> Ca 2 +-transients. Inhibition of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels by glybenclamide and 5 -hydroxydecanoic acid (5 -HAD) abolished slow <b>potentials</b> <b>and</b> Ca 2 +-transients, without altering the smooth muscle [Ca 2 +]i. It is concluded that in antrum circular muscles, the frequency of slow potentials is correlated with the level of [Ca 2 +]i. The slow potential is coupled to release of Ca 2 + from an internal store, possibly through the activation of IP 3 receptors; this may be initiated by the activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in mitochondria following Ca 2 + handling by mitochondria...|$|R
5|$|The shrub grows amongst {{scrubland}} in seasonally wet lowland {{areas of}} the coastal sandplain between Badgingarra and Serpentine in Western Australia. A little studied species, not much is known of its ecology or conservation biology. Reports do suggest, however, that it is pollinated {{by a variety of}} birds and small mammals. Like many members of series Abietinae, it has not been considered to have much horticultural <b>potential</b> <b>and</b> is rarely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|The year 2005 signalled a {{fresh start}} for Bolt {{in the form of}} a new coach, Glen Mills, and a new {{attitude}} toward athletics. Mills recognised Bolt's <b>potential</b> <b>and</b> aimed to cease what he considered an unprofessional approach to the sport. Bolt began training with Mills in preparation for the upcoming athletics season, partnering with more seasoned sprinters such as Kim Collins and Dwain Chambers. The year began well, and in July, he knocked more than a third of a second off the 200 m CAC Championship record with a run of 20.03 s, then registered his 200 m season's best at London's Crystal Palace, running in 19.99 s.|$|E

D-type soils are scattered throughout the watershed and A-type soils occur in areas of the southern and southeastern parts of the watershed.|$|E
