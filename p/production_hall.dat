25|$|The {{building}} that is commonly referred as the Fagus building {{is the main}} building. It was constructed in 1911 according to Werner’s plan but with the glass facades designed by Gropius and Meyer and then expanded in 1913. The Fagus building is a 40-centimeter high, dark brick base that projects from the facade by 4 centimeter. The entrance with the clock {{is part of the}} 1913 expansion. The interiors of the building, which contained mainly offices, were finished in the mid 20s. The other two big buildings on the site are the <b>production</b> <b>hall</b> and the warehouse. Both were constructed in 1911 and expanded in 1913. The <b>production</b> <b>hall</b> is a one-storey building. It was almost invisible from the railway (north) elevation and acquired a proper facade after the expansion. The warehouse is a four-storey building with few openings. Its design followed closely the original plan by Werner and it is left out from many of the photographs. Apart from them, the site contains various small buildings designed by Gropius and Meyer.Gropius and Meyer were able to enforce only minor changes in the overall layout of the factory complex. Overall, Werner's intended layout for the individual buildings within the complex was carried out; greater uniformity and coherence were achieved, however, through Gropius and Meyer's reductionism in form, material, and color.|$|E
500|$|Although Carey {{had heard}} the hook used in several other songs over the years, she felt her use {{of the sample was}} done in a more {{innovative}} way. [...] "We built the song from there and I wrote the lyrics and the melody and Dave ended up liking it," [...] she continued. After having completed the song, Hall complimented Carey's work ethic and form of writing, calling her a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "very professional." [...] He explained that they incorporated the hook, a melody, and the sample into the song over the course of one night. The song's title was not added until the end of <b>production.</b> <b>Hall</b> said Carey works in a unique fashion, usually developing the song's instrumentals and hook prior to the lyrics and title.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the concentrations of volatile organic compounds found in the air in five <b>production</b> <b>halls</b> at a furniture manufacturing plant. Tests were performed in <b>production</b> <b>halls,</b> where machining operations were performed both on wood and wood-based materials, in shop halls in which surfa-ce-finishing operations were performed, as well as a finished goods warehouse. A Tenax TA synthetic sorbent was used to adsorb compounds found in the air. Volatile substances were analysed by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry and thermal desorption. It was found that the microclimate in the examined <b>production</b> <b>halls</b> varied. Differences were observed not only in the type of compounds detected in the shop halls, but also in their amounts. The analysed air contained a broad spectrum of volatile compounds, mainly alcohols, glycols, aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, esters and terpenes. The total concentration of volatile organic compounds (TVOC) found in the air in the examined <b>production</b> <b>halls</b> varied within a very broad range from 795 to 5113 µg/m 3. The concentrations of volatile organic compounds identified in the <b>production</b> <b>halls</b> were markedly lo-wer than those specified by Polish legal regulations- the Ordinance of the Minister of Labour and Social Policy of 2002 (with later amendments) ...|$|R

Nijburg Products is the production unit for the sales and installation companies. Nijburg Products produces amongst other diffusers with plenum boxes and air ducts. To ensure the growth of Nijburg Products, two extra <b>production</b> <b>halls</b> are bought. The expanding of the number of <b>production</b> <b>halls</b> is seen by Nijburg as the right moment to reorganize the layout of the plant. Therefore, a new layout has been developed. The new layout is divided in four case studies, a general layout for the whole plant and a more detailed layout for three sub departments of this new general layout. A theoretical framework has been developed which shows all issues related to the layout cases, this framework is used in the four case studies and reviewed afterwards. This thesis has resulted in improvements in all four cases and a good reflection of the used theoretical framework. ...|$|R
