Senator Roy Barreras (Partido de la U) declared that the peace process was moving forward, to stages never reached in prior peace processes. On May 26, both sides announced a <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> on the first point, comprehensive rural reform.

The players must decide {{the part of}} the budget that is dedicated to produce any public good. We model the decision process as an alternating offer bargaining game with random proposers. The utilities of the players are assumed separable in any public issue. We show that multiple sophisticated outcomes are (generically) attained when a complete agreement is required for a subset of public projects to be implemented, either if the players bargain globally over the sizes of different public goods or sequentially through <b>partial</b> <b>agreements.</b> However, when public projects are immediately implemented after <b>partial</b> <b>agreements,</b> then uniqueness (which is a necessary condition for efficiency) is generically achieved.

In his view, Tripp made many claims without empirical evidence and neglected lesbianism and female sexuality in general. Lynch argued that Tripp's understanding of sexual relations between men and women, and his account of how tension between the sexes creates erotic excitement, were influenced by biological determinism. Lynch found Tripp's discussion of why societies have increased divisions between the sexes interesting, but also poorly worked out. Lynch accepted Tripp's view that sexual orientation depends on learning, but disagreed with the details of his account, and argued that Tripp's theories are [...] "linked to psychoanalytic assumptions." [...] Lynch accused Tripp of seeking to legitimize homosexuality [...] "by making it bland", criticized Whitmore for defending him, and expressed <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> with Hendin's review.|$|E

40|$|Abstract To date, {{a variety}} of {{automated}} negotiation agents have been created. While each of these agents {{has been shown to}} be effective in negotiating with people in specific environ-ments, they typically lack the natural language processing support required to enable real-world types of interactions. To address this limitation, we present NegoChat-A, an agent that incorporates several significant research contributions. First, we found that simply modify-ing existing agents to include an NLP module is insufficient to create these agents. Instead, agents that support natural language must have strategies that allow for <b>partial</b> <b>agreements</b> and issue-by-issue interactions. Second, we present NegoChat-A’s negotiation algorithm. This algorithm is based on bounded rationality, and specifically anchoring and Aspiration Adaptation Theory (AAT). The agent begins each negotiation interaction by proposing a full offer, which serves as its anchor. Assuming this offer is not accepted, the agent then proceeds to negotiate via <b>partial</b> <b>agreements,</b> proposing the next issue for negotiation based on people’s typical urgency, or order of importance. We present a rigorous evaluation of NegoChat-A, showing its effectiveness in two different negotiation roles...|$|R
50|$|The UN General Assembly {{rejected}} the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, because {{the agreement was}} concluded without participation of UN and PLO and did not comply with the Palestinian right of return, of self-determination and to national independence and sovereignty. December 1978, it declared in Resolution 33/28 A, that agreements were only valid if they are {{within the framework of}} the United Nations and its Charter and its resolutions, include the Palestinian right of return and the right to national independence and sovereignty in Palestine, and concluded with the participation of the PLO. Also the passive attitude of the Security Council was criticised. On 6 December 1979, the UN condemned in Resolution 34/70 all <b>partial</b> <b>agreements</b> and separate treaties that did not meet the Palestinian rights and comprehensive solutions to peace; it condemned Israel's continued occupation and demanded withdrawal from all occupied territories. On 12 December, in Resolution 34/65 B, she rejected more specific parts of the Camp David Accords and similar agreements, which were not in accordance with mentioned requirements. All such <b>partial</b> <b>agreements</b> and separate treaties were strongly condemned. The part of the Camp David accords regarding the Palestinian future and all similar ones were declared invalid.|$|R

On December 15, 2015, a full <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> on victims was announced. Taken as a whole, the agreement creates a Comprehensive System of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition (Sistema Integral de Verdad, Justicia, Reparación y no Repetición). The system would seek to satisfy the rights of all victims of the armed conflict, including victims of the guerrillas, the State and paramilitarism. Access to judicial benefits under the Comprehensive System would be conditioned to contributing to the elucidation of the truth and reparations.|$|E

Sihler and Allen agree that [...] was clear when the sound was doubled as , and dark when it occurred before another consonant or {{at the end of a}} word, but disagree on whether clear or dark l occurred before vowels. Sihler says that [...] was clear before [...] and dark before other vowels, but Allen says that [...] was dark before back vowels in pre-Classical Latin and clear before both front and back vowels in Classical Latin. [...] This represents a <b>partial</b> <b>agreement,</b> however, in that Sihler argues the Classical Latin [...] had three degrees of velarization, with a darker enunciation before consonants than vowels.|$|E

The {{developments}} in Havana were, however, overshadowed by the campaigns for the congressional elections (March 9) and the two-round presidential election (May 25 and June 15). Former President Álvaro Uribe, the leading opponent to the peace process, had founded his own party, the Democratic Centre (Centro Democrático, CD) and led his party's list for Senate in March. The party's Uribe-led list won over 2 million votes and 20 seats, forming a solid opposition bloc in the new legislature, although parties supportive {{of the peace process}} retained majorities in both houses of Congress. The peace process became one of the main issues in the presidential race, with the promise of peace forming the basis of President Santos' reelection campaign while Uribe's Democratic Centre candidate Óscar Iván Zuluaga opposed the peace process. Zuluaga had said that he would suspend the peace negotiations until the FARC agreed to a permanent, verifiable unilateral ceasefire within 8 days, conditions judged to be realistically impossible. Additionally, Zuluaga claimed that there was no armed conflict but rather a 'terrorist threat' and asserted that issues such as agrarian reform and illicit drugs could not be decided with the FARC, [...] "the main drug cartel in the world". Promising instead 'peace without impunity', Zuluaga said he was disposed to reduced jail sentences for those who had committed crimes against humanity but with political eligibility limited only to guerrilla fighters, not commanders.|$|E

That is, once we take up the non-equilibrium approach, the exit opportunity still fulfils its original aim: we achieve a unique solution by introducing the exit opportunity. sequential bargaining, N-person, rationallzability...|$|R

For Lindblom, in fact, it is not relevant {{whether or not you}} share, in general terms, the values of your counterpart, {{as long as you are}} able to bargain on a concrete (planning) decision. What matters is whether your counterpart agrees with a concrete proposal, not why s/he agrees.

Thus, our model features a special form of bargaining delay, in which agreements take place in multiple stages.
