5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other <b>party</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E

5|$|Mari Kiviniemi {{was elected}} {{the new leader}} of the Centre Party in its conference in Lahti on 12 June.

5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the <b>party</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
