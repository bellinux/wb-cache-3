40|$|Legally, butter {{must contain}} at least 80 % fat (all of {{which must be}} pure milkfat) and a maximum of 16 % water. As a {{consequence}} of these legal restrictions, {{there has been a}} reluctance for the dairy industry to blend oils with milkfat since products like this cannot be termed as butter. However, in recent times there has been some interest in the mixing of milkfat and vegetable oils for dairy spreads. An example of this type of product is "Bregott" made from an 80 : 20 milkfat: oil mix (Anon, 1969) manufactured in Sweden and claimed to have superior spreading properties over normal butter. The blending of milkfat and oil for reasons other than improving spreadability has not been extensively researched. It would seem advantageous to incorporate milkfat into cake and <b>pastry</b> <b>margarine</b> to enhance the flavour of the end products, although the high cost of milkfat in some countries may prevent this from becoming commercially feasible. In New Zealand, milkfat is relatively cheap and {{it may be possible to}} produce a cake or <b>pastry</b> <b>margarine</b> containing a significant amount of milkfat at a competitive price. This type of product could capture a segment of the commercial baking industry which is at present monopolised...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use enzyme interesterification to produce two hard stocks which were based on hard stocks used in the manufacture of margarine and pastry fats. Both of these two hard stocks produced need to be fast crystallizers; one with a low melting point for spreadable margarine whiles the other with a higher melting point for pastry fats. Commercial hard stocks were provided by Bakels Edible oil (BEO) Ltd. The study was divided into three stages. In the first stage, three commercial lipase enzymes supplied by Novozymes, including Novozyme 435, Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme TL IM, were used to interesterify tallow stearin, palm stearin and fully hardened coconut oil mixed in different ratios. The most promising fat blend with the lipase enzyme was selected for optimisation trials in stage two of the study. In stage two, the amount of lipase enzyme was investigated along with the time required to process these fats in order to optimise the interesterification method as both enzymes and production time are cost factors associated with the successful application of this hard stock. The commercial lipase enzymes are the key to the interesterification process and are expensive hence in stage three of this study, the reusability of the enzymes was looked into in order to determine the maximum number of uses that can take place for one dose of enzyme during batch processing. The resulting interesterified fats at the end of each stage were tested for physical properties such as melting point, solid fat content, rate of crystallization, and change in specific heat during crystallization and chemical composition of triglyceride content. The best result for spreadable margarine was a blend of palm stearin and fully hardened coconut oil at 50 %: 50 % and interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme TL IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C. The best processing method for <b>pastry</b> <b>margarine</b> was blend of tallow stearin and fully hardened coconut oil at 70 %: 30 % interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme RM IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C. Both of these interesterified hardstocks were also fast crystallisers as determined using differential scanning colorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance instrumentation. Each batch of enzyme was able to be reused up to seven times if washed with acetone and deionized water...|$|E
40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of commercially available European bakery margarines (cream margarines, cake margarines [CM] and puff <b>pastry</b> <b>margarines</b> [PPM]) containing and devoid of {{trans fatty acids}} (TFAs) were investigated. Studied physical properties were the solid fat content (SFC), dropping points (DPs), polymorphism, texture (hardness), plasticity and the melting profile by differential scanning calorimetry. Experimental results confirm that physical {{properties of}} the margarines corresponded with their application area. For example, SFC and DPs of PPM were higher than cream margarines and CM; they were also harder at 15 C. Moreover, all the investigated physical properties were affected by the suppression of TFA in bakery margarines. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This study has shown that margarines present different physical properties {{with respect to their}} purposed application but also highlight changes that appear due to the absence of trans-fatty acids in the formulations. These changes can really affect the bakery abilities and will, finally, influence the quality of the bakery products. Peer reviewe...|$|R
