5000|$|In the 1970s Garlock, Inc. {{allegedly}} infringed Gore's {{patents and}} was sued by Gore in the Federal District Court of Ohio. The District Court held Gore's product and process patents to be invalid after a [...] "bitterly contested case" [...] that [...] "involved {{over two years}} of discovery, five weeks of trial, the testimony of 35 witnesses (19 live, 16 by deposition), and over 300 exhibits" [...] (quoting the Federal Circuit). On appeal, however, the Federal Circuit disagreed in the famous case of Gore v. Garlock, reversing the lower court's decision on the ground, as well as others, that Cropper forfeited any superior claim to the invention by virtue of having concealed the process for making ePTFE from the public. As a public patent had not been filed, the new form of the material could not be legally recognised. Gore was thereby established as the legal inventor of ePTFE. Following the Gore v. Garlock decision, Gore sued Bard, Inc. for allegedly infringing its patent by making ePTFE vascular grafts. Bard promptly settled and agreed to exit the market. Gore next sued IMPRA, Inc., a smaller maker of ePTFE vascular grafts, in the federal district court in Arizona. IMPRA had a competing patent application for the ePTFE vascular graft. In a nearly decade-long patent/antitrust battle (1984-1993), IMPRA proved that Gore-Tex was identical to prior art disclosed in a Japanese process patent by duplicating the prior art process and through statistical analysis, and also proved that Gore had withheld the best mode for using its patent, and the main claim of Gore's <b>product</b> <b>patent</b> was declared invalid in 1990. (See W.L. Gore & Assoc., Inc. v. IMPRA, Inc., 975 F.2d 858 (Fed Cir 1992)). In 1996, IMPRA was purchased by Bard and Bard was thereby able to reenter the market. After IMPRA's vascular graft patent issued, Bard sued Gore for infringing it. In 2015, Gore was ordered by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to pay Bard $1 billion in damages. (Bard, Inc. v. W.L. Gore & Assoc., No. 14-1114 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 13, 2015)). The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Federal Circuit's decision. (W.L. Gore & Associates Inc. v.

In Japan, narrow patents and promotion of cross-licensing were effective tools to keep drug prices in check while ensuring the {{introduction of}} new drugs. While the global pharmaceutical market surrounding India today differs considerably from that of the 1970 's, the Japanese experience offers a policy option that may profitably be considered by India today. The Indian patent system emphasizes the patentability requirement in contrast to the Japanese patent policy which relied on narrow patents and extensive licensing. R&D by local firms and the development of local products may be promoted more effectively under the Japanese model.
