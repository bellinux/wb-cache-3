40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{is found}} on over 90 % of atopic {{dermatitis}} skin lesions and {{is thought to}} contribute to skin inflammation via the production of potent exotoxins. In contrast, less than 5 % of normal subjects harbor S. aureus. This suggests that an atopic immune response itself {{may play a role}} in preferential binding of S. aureus to the skin. To examine this issue more directly, we analyzed the S. aureus binding characteristics of skin in mice undergoing different T helper type 1 cell versus T helper type 2 cell inflammatory responses using a novel in vitro bacterial binding assay. BALB/C female mice were first sensitized to ovalbumin with alum or ovalbumin with complete Freund's adjuvant to induce T helper type 2 or T helper type 1 responses, respectively. Mice were then challenged intradermally with either saline (control) or ovalbumin. Forty-eight hours later, skin specimens were obtained from the challenge sites, and the number of S. aureus binding to each skin section was quantitated. Bacterial binding was found to be significantly greater at skin sites of BALB/C mice that had been ovalbumin/alum sensitized compared with ovalbumin/complete Freund's adjuvant sensitized (p[*]≤[*] 0. 01). When compared to the ovalbumin sensitized/challenged skin of wild type BALB/C mice or interferon-γ gene knockout mice, interleukin- 4, but not interferon-γ, gene knockout mice had significantly less S. aureus binding at their ovalbumin sensitized/challenged skin sites. Mutant S. aureus strains that lacked either fibronectin- or fibrinogen-binding protein expression showed significantly reduced S. aureus binding compared with the <b>parent</b> <b>wild</b> type <b>strain</b> (p <  0. 005). Moreover, preincubation of the wild type bacteria with fibronectin or fibrinogen, but not collagen, resulted in significantly less skin binding of S. aureus (p <  0. 01). Incubation of skin with interleukin- 4, and less so with interferon-γ, led to more binding of wild type S. aureus but not of an S. aureus mutant deficient in fibronectin binding protein expression. After interleukin- 4 incubation, but not interferon-γ, epidermal immunoreactivity for fibronectin was observed in murine skin explants. These results show that a T helper type 2 inflammatory environment can promote skin binding by S. aureus and that this binding is mediated by fibronectin and fibrinogen...|$|R

One-week-old foals, vaccinated once or twice orally and challenged intra-tracheally 3 weeks later, appeared inconsistently protected against intra-tracheal challenge with virulent R. equi. However, a clear indirect correlation between protection and post-vaccination VapA serum antibody titres >= 5. 0 log(2) was found which facilitated subsequent experiments, to optimize the vaccination schedule, vaccination route and vaccine composition. It was found that rectal vaccination of 5 -month-old foals (in contrast to oral vaccination) induced higher and more consistent protective responses (i. e. VapA serum antibody titres >= 5. 0 log(2)) in a shorter period of time. Therefore this approach was also tested in target-age animals. One-week-old foals vaccinated rectally on two consecutive days (>= 10 (9) CPU per dose) were significantly protected against intra-tracheal challenge 3 weeks later. After administration of 2 x 10 (10) CFU by the oral route or 1 x 10 (12) CFU by the rectal route to one-week-old foals, no vaccine related abnormalities were observed, indicating that the vaccine is safe.

The production was shifted to lycopene in cultures incubated {{in the presence of}} nicotine and in lycopene-rich mutants derived from the <b>wild</b> <b>strains.</b> The highest production levels were achieved in intersexual heterokaryons, which contained mutant nuclei of opposite sex. These contained up to 39 mg of β-carotene or 15 mg of lycopene per g (dry mass) under standard laboratory conditions in which the original <b>wild</b> <b>strains</b> contained about 0. 3 mg of β-carotene per g (dry mass). β-Ionone did not increase the carotene content of these <b>strains.</b> Not all <b>wild</b> <b>strains</b> lent themselves to these improvements, either because they produced few mutants or because they did not increase their carotene production in mated cultures...|$|R
40|$|A {{breeding}} {{analysis of}} a <b>wild</b> <b>strain</b> (Indian Lake 12) of variety 1, Tetrahymena pyriformis, discloses recessive lethal alleles at two independently assorting loci. Conclusions concerning the cytogenetic behavior of this species have been verified through the scoring {{of a large number}} of offspring segregating the lethals. In particular, cytogamy does not occur in these strains with a frequency higher than 2 %. if indeed it occurs at all. The finding of lethal heterozygosity in a <b>wild</b> <b>strain</b> suggests that close inbreeding usually does not take place in nature and supports the conclusion that variety 1 of T. pyriformis is an outbreeding species...|$|R
30|$|Strain {{improvement}} by mutation {{is one of}} {{the best}} methods to increase the ethanol yield and in this case, we were able to obtain two strains capable of producing significantly higher ethanol yields than the <b>wild</b> <b>strains.</b> The mutant strains PSUV 9 and CSEB 7 showed higher ethanol production rates from wheat straw as compared to the <b>wild</b> <b>strains.</b> This research demonstrates the utility of random mutagenesis to generate advantageous strains of P. stipitis and C. shehatae. However, some significant improvements with regard to the two pentose fermenting yeast strains have been reached and these improvements offer new possibilities for further optimization.|$|R
40|$|Electrophoretic karyotypes of two {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a haploid {{laboratory}} <b>strain</b> and a <b>wild</b> <b>strain</b> {{known to be}} at least diploid, have been checked during vegetative growth. The karyotype of the haploid strain was very stable; however, the diploid strain underwent frequent modifications. In most cases the number of bands was reduced, but occasionally we observed one band splitting into two. In one case, chromosomal rearrangements took place between differently sized copies of chromosomes I and VI. We concluded that the chromosome length polymorphism observed among <b>wild</b> <b>strains</b> of S. cerevisiae could be explained partly by chromosomal structure reorganization occurring during mitosis...|$|R
50|$|Some {{studies on}} {{probiotic}} properties of indigenous strains isolated from dadih fermented milk demonstrated to exhibit antimutagenic, acid, and bile tolerance {{as well as}} antipathogenic properties. Natural <b>wild</b> <b>strains</b> isolated from dadih show inhibitory, competitive and displacing properties against pathogens, and they are promising candidates for future probiotics. Viable cells of Lactobacillus plantarum strains from dadih as well as active metabolism play important roles in removing microcystin-LR, cyanobacterial toxin, and natural <b>wild</b> <b>strain</b> of Lactobacillus plantarum from dadih has the highest removal abilities {{as compared to the}} other commercial probiotic strains. This finding offers new and economical tools for decontaminating microcystin containing water.|$|R
