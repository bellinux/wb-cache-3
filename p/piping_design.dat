50|$|Within industry, piping is {{a system}} of pipes used to convey fluids (liquids and gases) from one {{location}} to another. The engineering discipline of <b>piping</b> <b>design</b> studies the efficient transport of fluid.|$|E
50|$|Piping {{sometimes}} {{refers to}} <b>piping</b> <b>design,</b> the detailed specification {{of the physical}} piping layout within a process plant or commercial building. In earlier days, this was sometimes called drafting, technical drawing, engineering drawing, and design, but is today commonly performed by designers that have learned to use automated computer-aided drawing or computer-aided design (CAD) software.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{process piping}} (and {{accompanying}} in-line components) can be manufactured from wood, fiberglass, glass, steel, aluminum, plastic, copper, and concrete. The in-line components, known as fittings, valves, and other devices, typically sense {{and control the}} pressure, flow rate and temperature of the transmitted fluid, and usually {{are included in the}} field of <b>piping</b> <b>design</b> (or piping engineering). Piping systems are documented in piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs). If necessary, pipes can be cleaned by the tube cleaning process.|$|E
50|$|This uniform {{included}} a near-copy of the British four-pocket tunic of the time, in olive green wool cloth or serge, {{with the addition}} of pipings and removable shoulder boards in branch-of-service colour cloth (Red: Infantry and Staff; Bright red-purple: Cavalry; Dark red-burgundy: Artillery; Light Blue: Engineers; Dark Blue: Gendarmerie). Brass-metal buttons were used for the majority of uniforms. The pants were straight with side <b>pipings,</b> <b>designed</b> to cover the ankle lace-boots, but in campaign the majority of soldiers found these cumbersome and used cloth puttees or stuffed them in their boots to hold them tight.

5000|$|MPDS, the MEDUSA Plant Design System (since 2006 MPDS4) is a {{suite of}} plant {{engineering}} applications for 2D/3D layout, design and modelling of process plants, factories or installations. The system's history is {{closely tied to the}} very beginnings of mainstream CAD and the research culture fostered by Cambridge University and the UK government as well as the resulting [...] "Cambridge Phenomenon" [...] MPDS was originally developed for 3D plant design and layout and <b>piping</b> <b>design.</b> Today the software includes modules for 2D/3D factory layout, process and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID), mechanical handling systems design, steel design, ducting (HVAC) design, electrical design and hangers and supports Design.

50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{tend to be}} {{very compact}} and smooth running and so do not require spring suspension. This allows them to have very small shell enclosures which reduces overall cost but also results in smaller free volume. This is a weakness in terms of liquid handling. Their corresponding strength is in the lack of suction valves which moves the most probable point of failure to the drive system which may be made somewhat stronger. Thus the scroll mechanism is itself more tolerant of liquid ingestion {{but at the same time}} is more prone to experience it in operation. The small size and quiet operation of a scroll compressor allow for the unit to be built into high power density computers, like IBM mainframes. Scroll compressors also simplify the <b>piping</b> <b>design,</b> since they require no external connection for the primary coolant.|$|E

50|$|A parts washer can be {{characterized}} by its power density. The power density is calculated by dividing the total horsepower of all the pump systems providing the wash function by the total work volume for that washing function. Typical units are horsepower per cubic foot. The results of this calculation offer a beginning point in comparing various parts washing systems. The power density number is also useful when it is desired {{to achieve the same}} cleaning standard and throughput in a different work volume. Note that the power density calculation {{does not take into account}} the pump system efficiency and assumes that all of the energy delivered to the pump is delivered to the wash load. A more accurate power density would consider the pump system efficiency as efficiencies vary greatly even from an identical pump as the efficiency is highly dependent on the pump operating point, the <b>piping</b> <b>design</b> and the friction losses in the system.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} primary {{factors that affect}} the {{cleaning}} results in an aqueous parts washer. These factors are mechanical energy, temperature, detergent and time. Adjusting {{any one of these}} factors in a cleaning cycle changes the cleaning results. A parts washer with large amounts of mechanical energy and a high temperature delivers shorter cleaning cycles and uses less cleaning detergent. Mechanical energy is provided by the pump drive system. Most aqueous parts washers use an electric motor to drive a centrifugal pump. The mechanical energy delivered to the wash load is what defines the mechanical energy for cleaning and not the horsepower of the pump. Efficient use of the pump motor energy through a well designed centrifugal pump and attention to details of <b>piping</b> <b>design</b> and nozzle types are critical to put the most mechanical energy into the cleaning process. Additionally, one must consider the work volume of the parts washer. In order to achieve similar results, from one size machine to another, the power density must be the same for a given work volume, This factor requires that substantially higher horsepower pumping systems be used as the work volume increases exponentially on larger diameter machines.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} YIT {{can be traced}} back to 1912, when Swedens General Engineering Company (Allmänna Ingeniörsbyrån) {{established}} a subsidiary in Finland, initially to operate in the water supply sector. The Finnish translation of the groups title, Yleinen Insinööritoimisto, is the source of the name YIT. The first project undertaken by the new company was the construction of a water tower in Porvoo. The firms field of operation was gradually broadened over the following decades, but it was not until the 1970s that the company moved beyond the civil engineering sector into construction of buildings (including residential property) and industrial works. In September 1987, Yleinen Insinööritoimisto merged with rival Finnish contractor Perusyhtymä Oy, creating YIT-Yhtymä (YIT Corporation). Since the merger, YITs growth into new sectors has been aided by several acquisitions: in 1995, the <b>piping</b> <b>design</b> and maintenance specialist Oy Huber Ab was acquired, the same year that the companys shares were listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, and the Swedish pipeline installation and maintenance firm Calor AB and its Finnish subsidiary were purchased in 2001. These additions assisted a wider move into the industrial upkeep and maintenance market. Primatel, the network construction and maintenance arm of the telecommunications firm Sonera, was added in 2002, and a year later the building systems concerns of ABB in Russia and the Nordic and Baltic regions were acquired, further increasing YITs presence in the service sector. In 2008 and 2010 YIT has continued expanding its operations into Central Europe.|$|E

50|$|Water is {{not present}} in the piping until the system operates; instead, the piping is filled with air at a {{pressure}} below the water supply pressure. To prevent the larger water supply pressure from prematurely forcing water into the <b>piping,</b> the <b>design</b> of the dry pipe valve (a specialized type of check valve) results in a greater force {{on top of the}} check valve clapper by the use of a larger valve clapper area exposed to the piping air pressure, as compared to the higher water pressure but smaller clapper surface area.|$|R

50|$|Bacteria {{have been}} {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} obstinate in this list to control. Techniques that help in minimizing bacterial colony growth within UPW streams include occasional chemical or steam sanitization (which is common in the pharmaceutical industry), ultrafiltration (found in some pharmaceutical, but mostly semiconductor industries), ozonation and optimization of <b>piping</b> system <b>designs</b> that promote the use of Reynolds Number criteria for minimum flow along with minimization of dead legs. In modern advanced UPW systems positive (higher than zero) bacteria counts are typically observed in the newly constructed facilities. This issue is effectively addressed by sanitization using ozone or hydrogen peroxide. With proper design of the polishing and distribution system no positive bacteria counts are typically detected throughout the life cycle of the UPW system.|$|R
40|$|In general, {{there are}} two methods to pass on design {{information}} in a petrochemical plant design: the manual data key-in method and the file data transfer method. The manual data key-in method is a basic method to pass on data; but this method is time consuming to assign data in one by one fashion. The file data transfer method is a mapping file data from one program to another program under certain specific function and criteria. This paper starts with {{how to use a}} file data transfer method to create a stress analysis model, and then proposes an approach to transfer the stress analysis result to a structural analysis program by using the Pipe Loadings Transfer Program. In a <b>piping</b> <b>design</b> using 3 D plant design software for modeling, the <b>piping</b> <b>design</b> information can be directly transferred to the stress input file by using point vectors to create a stress analysis model.
