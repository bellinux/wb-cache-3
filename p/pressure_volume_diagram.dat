Rather, it was the technological knowledge provided by the indicator what generated a new explanation of the steam engine’s efficiency and functioning...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the later}} books Burgh {{published}} was on the indicator diagram, since the early 20th century named <b>pressure</b> <b>volume</b> <b>diagram</b> or PV diagram. This was the first (and only) book solely devoted to the indicator diagram, its theoretical background, and its applications. This type of diagram was developed late 18th century in the workshop of Boulton and Watt by James Watt and his employee John Southern (1758-1815). It was used to improve the efficiency of engines, and kept a trade secret until the 1830s. In the 1850s William John Macquorn Rankine in 1859/1866 {{was one of the}} first to give a detailed description of the device. According to Miller (2011): A detailed and influential treatment of the indicator within the framework of a newly developing ‘engineering science’ was given by W. J. Macquorn Rankine, in his A Manual of the Steam Engine (1859). Rankine not only reconceptualized the indicator diagram as what he called the ‘diagram of energy’, but also offered a substantial scientific account of how departures of real indicator diagrams from the ideal could be linked to operating characteristics of engines and of the indicator itself.|$|E

40|$|With {{consideration}} of the biomass energy potential, a gamma type Stirling engine with 220 cc swept volume and 580 cc total volume was designed, optimized and manufactured. The engine was tested with helium. Working characteristics of the engine were obtained {{within the range of}} heat source temperature 370 - 410 ˚C and charge pressure 10 bar for biomass resources and heat source temperature 540 - 560 ˚C and range of charge pressure 1 - 12 bar with 1 bar increments at each stage for gases. By using of thermodynamic and heat transfer design methods, the key parameters of the designed Stirling engine like required surfaces for heat transfer were calculated (hot side 307 and the cold side 243 squares of centimeters). For analysis of fluid flow, two-dimensional flow analysis method was performed by the software CFD methods. The principles of thermodynamics as well as Schmidt theory were adapted to use for modeling the engine and then <b>pressure</b> - <b>volume</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the thermodynamic and Schmidt analysis were compared. During the test, the temperature is monitored by thermocouples and the pressure of the working fluid helium is monitored by pressure sensors. Indicated power, friction power and brake power were measured and maximum brake power output was obtained with helium at 550 ˚C heat source temperature and 10 bar charge pressure at 700 rpm as 96. 7 W. Electrical energy produced from biomass sources. Sugarcane bagasse, wood, wheat straw, poplar wood and sawdust as fuel system were selected. Most power be obtained from the sawdust (46 watt) and pruning of trees for wood for low power (21 watts), respectively. Minimum ignition time of the Sawdust (4 min) and the most time flammable wood from pruned trees (10 min) was measured. At maximum power, the internal thermal efficiency of the engine was measured as 16 %. The test results confirm the fact that Stirling engines driven by temperature of biomass gases are able to achieve a valuable output power.

40|$|AbstractEfficient energy {{usage and}} energy {{conservation}} is the today's requirement for all researchers of IC engine. The usual method of producing heat from fuel {{is by the}} process of combustion, which is a chemical reaction between the fuel and oxidant. Thermodynamics is the science that deals with interaction between energy and material systems. In case of I C, engine about one-third of total energy is used as conversion of useful work. Diesel engine is operated at higher compression ratio, so low heat rejection engine is made by applying better ceramic TBC material. The concept of adiabatic engine is used to save the loss of energy and also minimize the exhaust emissions. Further efforts were made by computerized experimental work by using twin cylinder water cool constant speed diesel engine. The self-governed diesel engine combustion chamber components like piston's top surface, engine heads, valves and liners were fully coated with two different better TBC materials like MgZrO 3 and YSZ. In both cases, TBC bond coat NiCAlY are used for better mechanical strength. The diesel combustion cycles analysis were carried and different combustion results displayed like, crank angle verses cylinder pressure, mass fraction, heat release and <b>pressure</b> <b>volume</b> <b>diagram.</b> The result indicates that, better combustion is found in MgZrO 3 type ceramic TBC material diesel engine...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} four manuscripts {{examining the}} respiratory mechanics of normal and stuttering speech. The first study (J. Appl. Physiol. 75 (2) : 696 - 703, 1993) examined lung volume (V scL) during stutterers' relatively fluent speech. We showed that stutterers used the V scL extremes. This suggested that stutterers recruited their respiratory muscles {{in a different}} manner than normals to maintain subglottic pressure (Psg). We therefore investigated respiratory muscle recruitment patterns in normals and stutterers. In the second study, (submitted to J. A. P.), we modified the Campbell <b>pressure</b> <b>volume</b> <b>diagram</b> {{by the addition of}} abdominal pressure (Pab) and by the use of a surrogate relaxation curve. The addition of Pab allowed us to differentiate between diaphragmatic and non diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles and to quantify expiratory muscle recruitment. The surrogate curve provided a good approximation of the true relaxation curve (non significant difference between surrogate and true relaxation curves: P $>$. 10). The third study (submitted to J. A. P.) used the modified diagram to examine respiratory muscle recruitment patterns, instantaneous Psg, voluntary hyperinflation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEPi) during normal and stuttering speech. Stutterers used consistent muscle recruitment patterns and consistent V scL but Psg was not as well controlled as in normals. Because a lack of control of Psg could have an immediate effect on the glottis, particularly at high or low V scL, we measured instantaneous Psg and flow in the final study (to be submitted to J. A. P.) to give us instantaneous glottal resistance. In this study we were able to plot a 'family' of glottal resistances that covered normal speech. This provided a normal envelope of resistances. When stutterers were fluent they remained within both the flow and Psg limits set by the normals' envelope. When they were fluent both Psg and flow extended beyond the normals' envelope. We conclud...|$|E
40|$|Micro Combined Heat and Power {{systems or}} microCHP systems {{generate}} heat and electricity for a home. Stirling engines {{are widely used}} as prime movers in microCHP applications. Stirling engine is an external combustion engine having an enclosed working fluid (as helium) that is alternately compressed and expanded to operate a piston. The displacer shuttles the working fluid between the hot and cold ends. The piston is coupled to a transmission and to an electrical machine to generate power. Conventional Stirling engines are not controllable to a great degree. The piston and displacer {{are connected to the}} same crank and they maintain the same phase difference throughout the cycle. Also the piston and displacer are normally constructed to move in a sinusoidal fashion. The Active Stirling Engine is a new concept introduced in this thesis which has a free displacer. The displacer is driven separately compared to a coupled drive in conventional Stirling engines. The displacer motion can be non-linear with dwell at each ends of the stroke, opening up the possibilities to increase the <b>pressure</b> <b>volume</b> <b>diagram</b> which indicates the work done by the engine. A separately driven displacer also allows introducing phase control and stroke control to improve the controllability of a Stirling engine. This thesis examines the effect of non-linear displacer motion and phase control of the displacer on Stirling engine performance. Simulations are performed in Sage, the leading Stirling engine simulation software, to understand the effect of displacer phase control. A test rig is constructed with the actively controlled displacer connected to a linear machine controlled by a programmable servo. Heat is applied to the test rig though an electric heating coil. The test rig is charged with nitrogen at 20 Bar pressure. The power piston is connected to a rotating electrical machine via the transmission. The rotating electrical machine is used to start the engine and to act as the generator. The test rig is instrumented to determine the linear position of the displacer and piston, angular position of the rotating electrical machine shaft, temperatures, pressures and flow. A LabVIEW™ based data acquisition system is set up to capture data from the test rig. Data is collected at various test cases. The simulation result is compared against post processed data. An efficiency improvement of 15 % is achieved using this method and is demonstrated experimentally. Applications in micro combined heat and power systems utilising the improved efficiency due to non linear motion and controllability due to phase control are explored in this thesis...|$|E
