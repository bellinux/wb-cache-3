60|$|It is, in fact, {{evident that}} when once {{causation}} is admitted {{as a universal}} law, our expectation of events can only be rationally grounded on that law. To a person who recognizes that every event depends on causes, a thing’s having happened once is a reason for expecting it to happen again, only because proving that there exists, or is liable to exist, a cause adequate to produce it.(179) The frequency of the particular event, apart from all surmise respecting its cause, can give rise to no other induction than that per enumerationem simplicem; and the precarious inferences derived from this are superseded, and disappear from the field {{as soon as the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> makes its appearance there.|$|E
60|$|To this question, a {{negative}} answer {{has been given}} by Bergson, in a form which calls in question the general applicability {{of the law of}} causation. He maintains that every event, and more particularly every mental event, embodies so much of the past that it could not possibly have occurred at any earlier time, and is therefore necessarily quite different from all previous and subsequent events. If, for example, I read a certain poem many times, my experience on each occasion is modified by the previous readings, and my emotions are never repeated exactly. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation,</b> according to him, asserts that the same cause, if repeated, will produce the same effect. But owing to memory, he contends, this principle does not apply to mental events. What is apparently the same cause, if repeated, is modified by the mere fact of repetition, and cannot produce the same effect. He infers that every mental event is a genuine novelty, not predictable from the past, because the past contains nothing exactly like it by which we could imagine it. And on this ground he regards the freedom of the will as unassailable.|$|E
60|$|It {{is proper}} to {{consider}} whether the adoption of this theory as a scientific truth, involving as it does {{a change in the}} conception hitherto entertained of the most general physical agencies, requires any modification in the view I have taken of Causation as a law of nature. As it appears to me, none whatever. The manifestations which the theory regards as modes of motion, are as much distinct and separate phenomena when referred to a single force, as when attributed to several. Whether the phenomenon is called a transformation of force or the generation of one, it has its own set or sets of antecedents, with which it is connected by invariable and unconditional sequence; and that set, or those sets, of antecedents are its cause. The relation of the Conservation theory to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Causation</b> is discussed in much detail, and very instructively, by Professor Bain, in the second volume of his Logic. The chief practical conclusion drawn by him, bearing on Causation, is, that we must distinguish in the assemblage of conditions which constitutes the Cause of a phenomenon, two elements: one, the presence of a force; the other, the collocation or position of objects which is required in order that the force may undergo the particular transmutation which constitutes the phenomenon. Now, it might always have been said with acknowledged correctness, that a force and a collocation were both of them necessary to produce any phenomenon. The law of causation is, that change can only be produced by change. Along with any number of stationary antecedents, which are collocations, there must be at least one changing antecedent, which is a force. To produce a bonfire, there must not only be fuel, and air, and a spark, which are collocations, but chemical action between the air and the materials, which is a force. To grind corn, there must be a certain collocation of the parts composing a mill, relatively to one another and to the corn; but there must also be the gravitation of water, or the motion of wind, to supply a force. But as the force in these cases was regarded as a property of the objects in which it is embodied, it seemed tautology to say that there must be the collocation and the force. As the collocation must be a collocation of objects possessing the force-giving property, the collocation, so understood, included the force.|$|E

40|$|Market-share {{liability}} {{has been}} one of the most controversial doctrines in tort law, with a strong plurality of courts rejecting the doctrine on the ground that it radically departs from the fundamental <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation.</b> Courts that have adopted this liability rule, though, believe they are adhering to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation.</b> In the first case to adopt market-share liability, the California Supreme Court claimed that the liability rule is grounded upon an extension of alternative liability, a doctrine that has been accepted by virtually all jurisdictions. The court never adequately explained how alternative liability can be modified to yield market-share liability, and the only explanation provided by torts scholars involves redefining the tort right to permit compensation for tortious risk, conditional upon the occurrence of injury, rather than for the injury itself. However, courts do not conceptualize the tort right in these terms, for otherwise the doctrine of market-share liability would be uncontroversial. As this Article shows, market-share liability can be derived from alternative liability in a manner that neither redefines the tort right nor departs from the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation.</b> Alternative liability permits the plaintiff to prove causation against the group of defendants. This characterization of the causal rule has been recognized by some torts scholars, but has never been justified. The Article shows that evidential grouping is a defensible principle implicit in numerous cases involving analogous causal problems, including the asbestos cases. Evidential grouping not only explains the doctrine of alternative liability, it shows how a modification of that liability rule yields market-share liability largely for reasons given by the California Supreme Court. This conceptualization of alternative liability and market-share liability also explains the otherwise puzzling liability rule adopted by courts in the asbestos cases. Due to this doctrinal unity, the widespread acceptance of alternative liability should make market-share liability more widely acceptable...|$|E

40|$|Competition law damages {{actions are}} often characterised by the {{uncertainty}} of the causal connection between the infringement and the harm. The anticompetitive damage consists in a pure economic loss caused by a market distortion. Here, the complexity of the market structures, combined with the interdependence of individuals’ assets, fuel this causal uncertainty. The recently adopted Damages Directive, in line with the decisions of the Court of Justice of the EU, established a regime based on the compensatory principle, consequently giving central importance to the definition and to the assessment of the causal connection between the infringement of competition law and the harm suffered.

40|$|The issue <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> is {{fundamental}} to every constitutional tort action. Money damages are not recoverable unless the defendant is found to have caused the plaintiff to be deprived of a constitutional right and that deprivation {{is the cause of}} some harm. In several recent decisions the Supreme Court has seized upon the language <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> as a means of restricting constitutional tort liability. In Monell v. Department of Social Services, for example, the Court based its rejection of respondeat superior on the implicit meaning of the term 2 ̆ 2 causes. 2 ̆ 2 The concept <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> in a constitutional tort context thus requires a connection between the defendant and the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury more substantial than defendant 2 ̆ 7 s employment of the offending actor. Despite its central place in the law of constitutional torts, the question <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> has attracted little critical analysis. Courts and commentators have tended to focus on the more clearly substantive aspects of the litigation. When the issue <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> is directly addressed, the analysis seldom goes beyond a superficial and sometimes inaccurate recital of common law 2 ̆ 2 rules 2 ̆ 2 of proximate cause. The courts have followed the orthodox common-law cause in fact and proximate cause models in discussing the issue <b>of</b> <b>causation.</b> In this Article it is argued that the particular policies underlying constitutional tort actions are different in some respects from those deemed important in a common-law setting. On the one hand, the Court explains that rules governing constitutional tort actions should serve to deter future misconduct, vindicate the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional rights, and compensate the plaintiff for the resulting harm. This set of policies closely corresponds to those that influence common-law causation issues. It differs only in that the source of the underlying right is the Constitution. Constitutional torts are thought to be potentially more harmful than their common-law counterparts because they are committed with the imprimatur of state authority. A person 2 ̆ 2 may bar the door against an unwelcome private intruder [...] [but] [t]he mere invocation of [governmental] power by a [...] . law enforcement official will normally render futile any attempt to resist an unlawful entry or arrest. 2 ̆ 2 As the Constitution stands as the final barrier between governmental power and individual liberty, deterring constitutional violations is an especially valued goal. There is, however, a competing set of values that frequently is not openly acknowledged. The Court has exhibited a policy preference to avoid what it perceives to be an excessive burdening of governmental conduct, both financially and otherwise. The perceived burdens of constitutional tort litigation may reflect the values underlying the concept of federalism. Constitutional torts necessarily affect the interplay between federal power and state prerogatives, and the Court is reluctant to displace traditional prerogatives of state sovereignty. An expansion of constitutional tort liability also poses the danger of imposing rigid uniform standards by which the day-to-day behavior of state and local officials would be measured. The resulting loss of flexibility and increased centralization of power are conditions thought by some to threaten the preservation of individual liberties. Furthermore, there may be contexts in which the Court does not want to subject governments to the same constitutional restrictions protecting individual liberties as when they act as regulators of the general public. The Court may be willing to tolerate governmental conduct directed at a governmental employee that it would not if directed at the public at large. Collectively these concerns reflect policy considerations largely absent from common-law torts. This Article discusses the interplay between these competing sets of policies and the influence they have on judicial resolution <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> issues. To the extent that these values are irreconcilable, <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> developed in the constitutional tort context reflect pragmatic compromises rather than a consistent application <b>of</b> settled <b>principles.</b> Courts have given effect to the policy of not overly burdening governmental conduct while clinging to familiar common-law terminology. By purporting to apply well-settled <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation,</b> courts have produced opinions that mask the reasoning behind the result and, in some instances, provide misleading guidance for resolving future cases. In Part I it is argued that uniform <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> are necessary in constitutional tort cases to ensure that the scope of substantive constitutional rights does not vary from state to state. In Part II it is first analyzed how the Supreme Court has developed an approach to cause in fact that deviates from prevailing <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> common law. This variation best can be explained by a policy of avoiding excessive burdening of governmental conduct. This is followed by an analysis of the judicial treatment of proximate cause issues of the liability for the unforeseeable consequences and intervening causes. In this section it is illustrated how judicial articulation <b>of</b> constitutional tort <b>causation</b> issues in terms of common-law maxims often disguises the underlying policy considerations. Part III addresses a particular causation issue unique to constitutional torts: when does a government or supervisor cause an employee or subordinate to deprive the plaintiff of constitutional rights?
