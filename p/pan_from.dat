500|$|Andy Gill {{was less}} {{enthusiastic}} in The Independent, {{believing that the}} band's songs had taken on [...] "raging emotions" [...] lacking on their debut and making Coexist a worthy but occasionally [...] "uneasy listening". New York Times journalist Jon Caramanica wrote that the record suffers from a difficult second half on what is otherwise [...] "as insular and micro as ambitious pop music can be ... a wonderful experiment {{in the power of}} absence." [...] Arnold <b>Pan</b> <b>from</b> PopMatters was more critical, calling it monotonous and [...] "an exercise in delayed gratification", while Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times panned the lyrics as [...] "one-dimensional planes floating through the group's oft-glorious 3-D spaces".|$|E
500|$|... "Dream Scene" [...] is a {{combination}} of segments that Harrison edited together. Along with [...] "Ski-ing", it is the only track on the album that combines Indian and Western music. The song consists of three distinct pieces, the first of which is a meditative section featuring phase-shifted instrumentation such as tabla tarang, harp (swarmandal) and sitar, and singing. The music is delivered via backwards-played tape loops as the vocals <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> {{one side to the other}} across the stereo image. The other two pieces include a section comprising Barham's piano and flutes, followed by a trumpet solo, harmonica interspersed with a police siren, and more backwards tape loops. The song fades out with a slowed-down spoken voice over the sound of church bells. Leng notes that [...] "Dream Scene" [...] was recorded several months before Lennon's experimental sound collage [...] "Revolution 9", released on the double album The Beatles.|$|E

500|$|A 20th-century {{modification}} of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired Ferrybridge [...] "C" [...] power station. Starting in 1967, Cawoods Hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans, which were rigidly connected, and pushed by a tug when loaded. The trains were filled with coal using canalside chutes at the colliery and pushed to the power station, where a hoist lifted each <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt. Nine tugs and 35 pans were employed, with each pan holding around 170 tonnes. By the time the final load left Astley colliery in December 2002, 43 million tonnes had been delivered to Ferrybridge in this way. Experiments were made with trains of four pans, which allowed copper pipes to be carried {{on top of the}} coal for delivery to Goole, but this was short-lived. Coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the St Aidan's opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from Kellingley colliery was found to have levels of sulphur content high above the acceptable limit. During 2008, three of the trains were used on the River Don, to transport 250,000 tonnes of limestone from a quarry at Cadeby to Hexthorpe.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have focused}} on the {{parallels}} between E.T.'s life and Elliott, who is [...] "alienated" [...] by the loss of his father. A.O. Scott of [...] The New York Times wrote that while E.T. [...] "is the more obvious and desperate foundling", Elliott [...] "suffers in his own way from the want of a home". E.T. is the first and last letter of Elliott's name. At the film's heart is the theme of growing up. Critic Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of Peter <b>Pan</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of a Lost Boy (Elliott): E.T. cannot survive physically on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in Neverland; government scientists take the place of Neverland's pirates. Vincent Canby of The New York Times similarly observed that the film [...] "freely recycles elements from [...] Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz". Some critics have suggested that Spielberg's portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief. According to A.O. Scott, [...] "The suburban milieu, with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food, could have come out of a Raymond Carver story." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon.com wrote, [...] "Spielberg's movies, despite the way they're often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic Karal Ann Marling called 'the marks of hard use'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moving mirrors are {{faster than}} moving head fixtures. However moving heads are {{visually}} {{more interesting and}} have a far larger range of movement. The movement from mirror lights tends to be rectilinear, because the center of movement for both axes is usually in the same place, while one axis of a moving head luminaire describes a circle (usually called [...] "pan") and the other (the [...] "tilt") changes {{the diameter of the}} circular movement. In early luminaires a pseudo rotating gobo effect could be achieved by moving the tilt in line with the other axis and then moving the <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> end stop to end stop.|$|E

Robert Carlyle owned the character in a way he never has before. His flourishes and 'dearies' didn't seem out of place and he even played with them a bit." [...] Ratcliffe also positively received Peter Pan's introduction, saying [...] "I appreciate how they've flipped Peter <b>Pan</b> <b>from</b> a lighthearted boy to a master manipulator with questionable intentions.

The tendency increased until he instinctively put aside the <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> his lap and half rose. But even that slight exertion brought on an accession of coughing. He put his handkerchief to his lips, partly to keep the sound from disturbing {{the women in the}} kitchen, partly because of a certain significant taste in his mouth which he unpleasantly remembered. When he removed the handkerchief it was, as he expected, spotted with blood. He turned quickly and re-entered the house softly, regaining the bedroom without attracting attention.

6000|$|The {{sound of}} drum, and {{the array of}} men in arms, {{indicated}} a hostile determination. Pitcairn halted his men within a short distance of the church, and ordered them to prime and load. They then advanced at double quick time. The major, riding forward, waved his sword, and ordered the rebels, as he termed them, to disperse. Other of the officers echoed his words as they advanced: [...] "Disperse, ye villains! Lay down your arms, ye rebels, and disperse!" [...] The orders were disregarded. A scene of confusion ensued, with firing on both sides; which party commenced it, has {{been a matter of}} dispute. Pitcairn always maintained that, finding the militia would not disperse, he turned to order his men to draw out, and surround them, when he saw a flash in the <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> the gun of a countryman posted behind a wall, and almost instantly the report of two or three muskets.

We rushed in, and found the woman in a tousled frenzy belabouring a youngster with an enamelled pan. The lad was rolled up like a young hedgehog—the woman held him by the foot, and like a flail came the hollow utensil thudding on his shoulders and back. He lay in the firelight and howled, while scattered in various groups, with the leaping firelight twinkling over their tears and their open mouths, were the other children, crying too. The mother {{was in a state}} of hysteria; her hair streamed over her face, and her eyes were fixed in a stare of overwrought irritation. Up and down went her long arm like a windmill sail. I ran and held it. When she could hit no more, the woman dropped the <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> her nerveless hand, and staggered, trembling, to the squab. She looked desperately weary and fordone—she clasped and unclasped her hands continually. Emily hushed the children, while Lettie hushed the mother, holding her hard, cracked hands as she swayed to and fro. Gradually the mother became still, and sat staring in front of her; then aimlessly she began to finger the jewels on Lettie's finger.|$|E
60|$|One day in December Daylight {{filled a}} <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> bed rock {{on his own}} claim and carried it into his cabin. Here a fire burned and enabled him to keep water unfrozen in a canvas tank. He squatted over the tank and began to wash. Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan. As he {{imparted}} to it a circular movement, the lighter, coarser particles washed out over the edge. At times he combed the surface with his fingers, raking out handfuls of gravel. The contents of the pan diminished. As it drew near to the bottom, {{for the purpose of}} fleeting and tentative examination, he gave the pan a sudden sloshing movement, emptying it of water. And the whole bottom showed as if covered with butter. Thus the yellow gold flashed up as the muddy water was flirted away. It was gold--gold-dust, coarse gold, nuggets, large nuggets. He was all alone. He set the pan down for a moment and thought long thoughts. Then he finished the washing, and weighed the result in his scales. At the rate of sixteen dollars to the ounce, the pan had contained seven hundred and odd dollars. It was beyond anything that even he had dreamed. His fondest anticipation's had gone no farther than twenty or thirty thousand dollars to a claim; but here were claims worth half a million each at the least, even if they were spotted.|$|E
