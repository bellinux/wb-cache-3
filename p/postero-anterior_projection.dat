40|$|Introduction. More than 60 % of wrist {{injuries}} {{are associated with}} scaphoid bone fractures in young active people. Scaphoid fracture difficult to diagnose on initial radiography due to unique and complex structures of scaphoid bone, its overlapping position between other carpals bone and still no general consensus about how and which radiographic view should be taken for better expose. This let scaphoid fracture into potential complication such as non-union, delayed union, decrease of wrist joint motion, osteoarthritis of radiocarpal joint and avascular necrosis. Materials and Methods. Serial initial projection of radiograph was investigated to get the better view of scaphoid bone. <b>Postero-anterior</b> <b>projection</b> within wrist joint in extension 10 °, 15 °, and 20 ° with maximum ulnar deviation using wrist joint frame was found making the scaphoid clearer. The database was compared to get the ideal view of scaphoid. Extension and ulnar deviation were performed due to flexed position of scaphoid anatomically in neutral wrist joint position. Results. Good exposure of scaphoid is got from performing radiographic examination of wrist joint 10 ° extended with maximum ulnar deviation position, {{in a total of}} 60 right and left wrist joint samples of young active men and women. Conclusions. Ten degrees extension with ulnar deviation wrist joint position can be proposed to be one of standard scaphoid view on plain radiography. It is useful to assess suspicious or occult scaphoid fracture, besides neutral posteroanterior, lateral and oblique view...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that due to their air content, {{it was not possible to}} examine the lungs using ultrasound. However, notwithstanding the wealth of literature produced over the last ten years has shown the considerable potential of ultrasound in diagnosing pulmonary disease, pulmonary ultrasound is still a little known and rarely used technique. Chest radiography has long been and still largely remains the diagnostic method of choice in lung disease. However, it is well known that, especially in emergency situations, radiological imaging is unsatisfactory as regards the standard required, with consequent further difficulties in interpreting the clinical situation. Chest x-rays performed in emergency departments frequently involve non-cooperative and/or bed-ridden patients. It is not always possible to obtain a lateral projection and the <b>postero-anterior</b> <b>projection</b> is performed in orthostatic conditions. In addition to these limits deriving from pictures obtained in non-optimal conditions, there are also intrinsic limits, such as an opaque hemithorax cannot always be precisely attributed to parenchymal or pleural pathology and widespread expansion of the interstitial space may mean many things, from pulmonary stasis to the great variety of interstitial diseases. Pulmonary CT is considered a diagnostic gold standard and yet it entails the transportation of patients that are often instable, exposure to high doses of ionising radiation (the equivalent of 100 - 200 chest x-rays), high costs and risks connected to iodate agents. Pulmonary ultrasound would appear promising especially in emergency medicine, as particularly in such contexts the immediate availability of diagnostic means, the simplicity of execution and interpretation of the images are all important...|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{commonly}} {{identified by}} chest radiography include pneumonia, pneumothorax, interstitial lung disease, heart failure, bone fracture and hiatal hernia. Typically an erect <b>postero-anterior</b> (PA) <b>projection</b> {{is the preferred}} projection.|$|R
2500|$|Required {{projections}} {{can vary}} by country and hospital, typically an erect <b>postero-anterior</b> (PA) <b>projection</b> is first preference, {{if this is}} not possible then an antero-posterior view will be taken. Further imaging depends on local protocols which is dependent on the hospital protocols, the availability of other imaging modalities and the preference of the image interpreter. In the UK, the standard chest radiography protocol is to take an erect posteroanterior view only, and a lateral one only on request by a radiologist [...] In the US, chest radiography includes a PA and Lateral with the patient standing or sitting up. Special projections include an AP in cases where the image needs to be obtained stat and with a portable device, particularly when a patient cannot be safely positioned upright. Lateral decubitus may be used for visualization of air-fluid levels if an upright image cannot be obtained. Anteroposterior (AP) Axial Lordotic projects the clavicles above the lung fields, allowing better visualization of the apices (which is extremely useful when looking for evidence of primary tuberculosis) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{intended}} {{to evaluate and}} compare radiation doses collected from a sample of 69 patients in two hospitals where chest radiography is carried out using different methods of digital image acquisition, direct and indirect, in <b>postero-anterior</b> (PA) <b>projection.</b> For the two hospitals, entrance skin doses (ESD) and effective dose (E) were measured using PCXMC software for posterior comparison with each other, {{as well as with}} international references. For Hospital A, with direct digital acquisition, average ESD was 0, 089 mGy and average E was 0, 013 mSv. For Hospital B, with indirect digital acquisition, average ESD was 0, 151 mGy and average E was 0, 030 mSv. In both hospitals, average doses did not exceed the limits recommended by law (0, 3 mGy). In the chest X-ray, in PA projection, the local DRLs calculated were 0. 107 mGy, in Hospital A and 0. 164 mGy, in Hospital B. In chest PA radiography, the utilization of a direct acquisition system implies a dose decrease of 41 %, in agreement with the available references that point to dose reductions of around 50 % between the direct and indirect acquisition systems...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{identify}} tube angulations in invasive cardiology, which promise minimal radiation exposure {{to patients and}} operators. BackgroundRadiation exposure in invasive cardiology is high. MethodsWe mapped the fluoroscopic dose-area product per second (DAP/s), applied to an anthropomorphic Alderson-Rando phantom and, in absence of radiation protection devices, the mean personal dose in the operator's position in 10 ° steps from the 100 ° right anterior oblique (RAO) to the 100 ° left anterior oblique (LAO) projection, {{as well as for}} all geometrically feasible craniocaudal tube angulations. ResultsFor our specific setting conditions RAO 20 °/ 0 ° tube angulation generated the lowest DAP/s and operator's personal dose. The mean patient DAP/s and operator personal dose for all <b>postero-anterior</b> (PA) <b>projections,</b> cranialized and caudalized together, rose significantly: 3. 7 and 10. 6 times the PA 0 ° baseline values toward LAO 100 ° and 3. 7 and 2. 4 times toward RAO 100 °, respectively. Patient and operator values for all PA projections, angulated to the right and left, increased ∼ 2. 5 times toward 30 ° craniocaudal angulations. Caudal PA 0 °/ 30 °− angulation instead of caudal LAO 60 °/ 20 °− angulation for the left coronary main stem and cranial PA 0 °/ 30 °+ view in place of cranial LAO 60 °/ 20 °+ view for the left anterior descending coronary artery bifurcation enable 2. 6 -fold dose reductions to the patient and eight- and five-fold dose reductions to the operator, respectively. ConclusionsThe PA views and RAO views ≥ 40 °, heretofore unconventional in clinical routine, should be favored over steep LAO projections ≥ 40 ° whenever possible. Tube angulations that are radiation intensive to the patient exponentially increasethe operator's radiation risk...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess the {{accuracy}} of linear measurements on three-dimensional (3 D) surface-rendered images generated from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in comparison with two-dimensional (2 D) slices and 2 D lateral and <b>postero-anterior</b> (PA) cephalometric <b>projections,</b> and to investigate the influence of patient head position in the scanner on measurement accuracy. Eight dry human skulls were scanned twice using NewTom 3 G CBCT in an ideal and a rotated position and the resulting datasets were used to create 3 D surface-rendered images, 2 D tomographic slices, and 2 D lateral and PA projections. Ten linear distances were defined for cephalometric measurements. The physical and radiographic measurements were repeated twice by three independent observers and were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance (P = 0. 05). The radiographic measurements were also compared between the ideal and the rotated scan positions. The radiographic measurements of the 3 D images were closer to the physical measurements than the 2 D slices and 2 D projection images. No statistically significant difference was found between the ideal and the rotated scan measurements for the 3 D images and the 2 D tomographic slices. A statistically significant difference (P < 0. 001) was observed between the ideal and rotated scan positions for the 2 D projection images. The findings indicate that measurements based on 3 D CBCT surface images are accurate and that small variations in the patient's head position do not influence measurement accuracy...|$|R
