Research from other world regions shows that the childhood health consequences of divorce vary across different contexts. Specifically, we hypothesize that the childhood disadvantages associated with divorce are more severe in regions of sub-Saharan Africa where divorce is rare, and less so where divorce is a more common family experience. Using Demographic and Health Survey data from 290 subnational regions within 31 sub-Saharan African countries, multilevel models document the previously shown link between having a divorced mother and child morbidity and mortality. The study results further demonstrate that the childhood health disadvantage is accentuated in subnational African regions where fewer women are divorced and muted in areas where more women are divorced. The findings demonstrate that the broader context can powerfully moderate childhood health inequalities traditionally thought of as operating at the family or individual level...|$|E
40|$|The membrane-bound {{complement}} regulators decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD 55), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD 46), and CD 59 are broadly expressed {{proteins that}} act together to protect host tissues from autologous complement. Comparison of expression profiles of these proteins between normal and pathological tissues could reveal a {{mechanism by which}} tumor cells evade complement-mediated killing. Expression of the regulators was therefore examined in the normal human uterine cervix, in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN; n = 23), and in cervical squamous carcinomas (n = 6). DAF and MCP were reciprocally expressed in normal ectocervical epithelium. MCP was confined predominantly to the basal and parabasal layers with more extensive expression in metaplastic squamous epithelium. An apparent expansion in MCP expression was observed in more severe premalignant lesions whereas cervical carcinoma were uniformly MCP positive. By contrast, DAF expression appeared unaltered in premalignant lesions and variable in carcinomas. However, increased DAF was observed in stromal cells directly adjacent to infiltrating tumor cells. A low molecular weight DAF product was detected in tumors, and <b>preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>this</b> may be derived from stromal cells.

40|$|SummaryWith {{the goal}} in mind to define how interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) {{contributes}} to acute intestinal inflammation, {{we have used a}} mouse model of ileitis induced by oral infection with Toxoplasma gondii. We observed that a crosstalk between IL- 15 and interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) promoted intestinal recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, where these cells participated in parasite control but also in tissue damage. A stromal source of IL- 15 controlled the development of lamina propria NKp 46 +NK 1. 1 + cells, whereas IL- 18 produced during T.  gondii infection stimulated their production of the chemokine CCL 3. In turn, CCL 3 attracted inflammatory monocytes via their chemokine receptor CCR 1, which was indispensable for their recruitment into the inflamed gut. Collectively, these results identify the IL- 15 -dependent subset of intestinal NKp 46 + cells as an important source of CCL 3, which can amplify intestinal inflammation via the recruitment of CCR 1 + inflammatory monocytes. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that <b>this</b> pathway might operate in Crohn's disease...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Around {{the time}} of birth, male rats express higher levels of {{progesterone}} receptors in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) than female rats, suggesting that the MPN may be differentially sensitive to maternal hormones in developing males and females. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that <b>this</b> sex difference depends on the activation of estrogen receptors around birth. To test whether estrogen receptor alpha (ER�) is involved, we compared progesterone receptor immunoreactivity (PRir) in the brains {{of male and female}} neonatal mice that lacked a functional ER � gene or were wild type for the disrupted gene. We demonstrate that males express much higher levels of PRir in the MPN and the ventromedial nucleus of the neonatal mouse brain than females, and that PRir expression is dependent on the expression of ER � in these regions. In contrast, PRir levels in neocortex are not altered by ER� gene disruption.

It was characterized with respect to its sorptive active. Living, heat-killed, permeabilized, and unreconstituted lyophilized cells were all capable of binding uranium.

The rate of uranium adsorption increased following permeabilization of the outer and/or cytoplasmic membrane by organic solvents such as acetone. P. aeruginosa CSU biomass was significantly more sorptive toward uranium than certain novel, patented biosorbents derived from algal or fungal biomass sources. P. aeruginosa CSU biomass was also competitive with commercial cation-exchange resins, particularly in the presence of dissolved transition metals.

These links were also examined by gender. Results: Among adults in the community, major depression was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of allergy (odds ratio [OR], 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 14 – 1. 98). Higher levels of neuroticism were also significantly associated with increased likelihood of allergy (OR, 1. 22; 95 % CI, 1. 04 – 1. 43). Among women, major depression was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of allergy (OR, 1. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 15 – 2. 41), and this relationship persisted after adjusting for demographic characteristics and neuroticism. Among men, there was no significant relationship between allergy and depression, yet neuroticism was related to allergy (OR, 1. 42; 95 % CI, 1. 42 – 1. 82), which persisted after adjustment for depression.

40|$|Effects of {{antioxidant}} vitamins on hypoxia-induced erythropoietin production. An {{important role}} in O 2 sensing has been assigned to microsomal and membrane-bound b-type cytochromes which generate regulatory reactive O 2 species (ROS). Recently, ROS {{have been shown to}} suppress the in vitro synthesis of erythropoietin (Epo). We investigated the potential of the antioxidant vitamins A, E and C to enhance renal and hepatic Epo production. Renal effects were studied in isolated serum-free perfused rat kidneys. In control experiments without antioxidant vitamins, Epo secretion amounted to 441 ± 23 mU/g kidney (mean ± SEM, N = 5) during the three hour period of hypoxic perfusion (arterial pO 2 35 mm Hg). Epo secretion significantly increased to 674 ± 92 mU/g kidney (N = 7) when vitamins A (0. 5 µg/ml), E (0. 5 µg/ml) and C (10 µg/ml) in combination were added to the perfusion medium. The effects of the single vitamins were studied in Epo-producing hepatoma cell cultures (lines HepG 2 and Hep 3 B). Vitamin A induced a dose-dependent increase (half-maximal stimulation at 0. 2 µg/ml) in the production of immunore-active Epo during 24 hours of incubation (such as 680 ± 51 U Epo/g cell protein in HepG 2 cultures with 3 µg/ml retinol acetate compared to 261 ± 15 U/g in untreated controls; N = 4). In contrast, vitamin E (tested from 0. 05 to 500 µg/ml) and vitamin C (tested from 2 to 200 µg/ml) did not increase Epo production in hepatoma cell cultures. Thus, while vitamins E and C may have the potential to protect cells from oxidative damage, vitamin A exerts a specific stimulation of Epo production. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that <b>this</b> effect of vitamin A involves increased mRNA levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α...|$|R

In the present investigation, which focused on further delineating the effects of amyloid deposition on hippocampal neurochemistry, decreases in serotonin neurotransmitter levels (- 25 %) were discovered to be present at 18 months in APP+/PS 1 + mice, while norepinephrine was reduced in the hippocampus of 12 (- 30 %) and 18 month-old (- 45 %) APP+/PS 1 + double mutants. In addition, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were investigated since changes in BDNF are reported to occur in AD, and BDNF has been shown to have trophic effects on serotonin and norepinephrine neurons. In doubly, but not singly mutant mice, hippocampal BDNF levels were increased at 12 (+ 70 %) and 18 months (+ 170 %). Furthermore, in a different model of serotonergic and noradrenergic degeneration, BDNF protein levels were similarly increased in response to depletions in hippocampal serotonin and norepinephrine caused by the chemical neurotoxin 1 -methyl- 4 -(2 ’-aminophenyl) - 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (2 ’-NH 2 -MPTP). These findings show that early amyloid deposition in mice expressing mutant human APP and PS- 1 is associated with a progressive loss of serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus later in life.

Using in situ hybridisation I show that ssp 4 transcripts are expressed in the gut, head and central nervous system during embryogenesis. An antibody that recognises the Ssp 4 C-terminus reveals expression throughout the embryonic development of the gut and nervous system, and in a discrete population of cells in the head. I have investigated the effects of two independent P-element induced mutant alleles of ssp 4 and show that mutant flies die in late embryonic or early larval stages. Disruptions to the locus do not seem to affect the nervous system but mutants were found to have aberrant head involution. I present <b>preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> that <b>suggests</b> <b>this</b> defect {{may be the result of}} reduced apoptosis in the embryo. Head involution is a complex process, dependent upon co-ordinated changes to cell shape and the movement of groups of cells from different origins. As Ssp 4 is a multi-domain cytoskeletal protein that is required for embryonic development, it may play a role in processes that are common to these morphogenetic events.

40|$|Waveform (output least squares) {{inversion}} of seismic reflection data can reconstruct remarkably detailed models of subsurface structure, and {{take into account}} essentially any physics of seismic wave propagation that can be modeled. However the waveform inversion objective has many spurious local minima, hence convergence of descent methods (mandatory because of problem size) to useful Earth models requires accurate initial estimates of long-scale velocity structure. Migration velocity analysis, on the other hand, {{is based on the}} Born approximation but is capable of correcting substantially erroneous initial velocities. Appropriate choice of objective (differential semblance) turns migration velocity analysis into an optimization problem, for which Newton-like methods exhibit little tendency to stagnate at nonglobal minima. The extended modeling concept links these two apparently unrelated approaches to estimation of Earth structure: from this point of view, migration velocity analysis is a solution method for the linearized (single scattering, Born) waveform inversion problem. Extended modeling also provides a basis for a nonlinear generalization of migration velocity analysis. <b>Preliminary</b> numerical <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that <b>this</b> new approach to nonlinear waveform inversion may combine the global convergence of velocity analysis with the physical fidelity of least squares.

40|$|Our {{research}} {{resulted in}} several discoveries which contributed {{to understanding the}} origin and operation of life. (1) Most importantly, we discovered a new pathway of prebiotic amino acid synthesis in which formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde (formose reaction substrates) react with ammonia to give alanine and homoserine {{in the presence of}} thiol catalysts. The thiol-dependent synthesis of amino acids undoubtedly occurs via amino acid thioester intermediates capable of forming peptides. This 'one-pot' reaction system operates under mild aqueous conditions, and like modern amino acid biosynthesis, uses sugar intermediates which are converted to amino acids by energy-yielding redox disproportionation. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that <b>this</b> type of process can be "evolved" by a serial transfer methods that lead to enrichment of autocatalytic molecules. (2) We established that prebiotic peptide polymers can be made by condensation of amino acid thioesters (homocysteine thiolactone and S-(N-beta-orotidyl- diaminopropionic acid) ethanethiol), and that prebiotic polydisulfide polymers can be generated by oxidation of dithiols with iron(III) in minerals. (3) In our analysis of metabolism we discovered the primary energy source of biosynthesis [...] chemical energy made available by the redox disproportionation of substrate carbon groups. We concluded that the energy and reactivity of sugars make them the optimal substrate for the origin and operation of terrestrial (or extraterrestrial) life. (4) Since {{it is likely that the}} use of optimal sugar substrates in biosynthesis sets the average oxidation number of functional biocarbon throughout the Universe near 0. 0 (the reduction level of formaldehyde), we proposed that a line(s) in the microwave spectrum of formaldehyde could be rationally selected as a frequency for interstellar communication that symbolizes life. (5) Finally, in preparation for the analysis of Martian meteorite samples, we upgraded our HPLC system to one femtomole sensitivity, and developed a new electrophoretic method of sample preparation for HPLC analysis of the meteoritic amino acids. In a sample of the KT boundary layer from Sussex Wyoming, we found about 300 picomoles per gram of meteoritic alpha-aminoisobutyric acid per gram of KT layer...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{dependence on}} psychoactive {{drugs such as}} nicotine and amphetamine is a national public health problem. The main goal of the research in this dissertation was to explore an alternative model of subjective drug effects. Briefly, a conditional stimulus (CS) is followed by brief access to sucrose solution in a drug state (i. e., feature); no programmed outcome follows this CS in a no-drug (i. e., saline) state. As {{a result of this}} training, we expected the CS to evoke anticipatory sucrose seeking (i. e., goal tracking), but only in the drug state. ^ At least three drugs (0. 4 mg/kg nicotine, 1 mg/kg amphetamine, and 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide) serve as signals for <b>this</b> CS-sucrose relation. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggested</b> that <b>this</b> drug-state specific CR was not the result of dissociative drug effects (i. e., state-dependent learning). Moreover, changing the pharmacological properties of the drug state by substituting other doses or compounds attenuated conditional responding. Thus, rats acquired a CR that was specific to the pharmacological effects of the drug feature. ^ Notably, the drug feature perfectly predicts the sucrose outcome. Arguably, both the drug feature and CS may be associated with sucrose such that summation of excitatory conditioning of these two stimuli could also produce a drug-state specific CR. To test this possibility, each drug feature was repeatedly presented alone after training (i. e., extinction). This manipulation had no effect on performance of the drug-state specific CR. Thus, the drug state appears to modulate conditional responding independent of any excitatory association with sucrose. ^ Non-pharmacological stimuli that set the occasion for one CS-outcome relation can also set the occasion for responding to a CS with which it has never been presented. The last set of experiments in this dissertation established that rats could acquire drug-state specific goal tracking with two drugs and two target conditional stimuli. Moreover, when these concurrent discriminations were established, the drug features displayed transitive properties. Importantly, these transitive properties were not the result of non-specific or generalized conditional responding. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how words are grouped according to their grammatical categories during language acquisition. Over the past 20. years a general consensus has developed that distributional and phonological cues are important cues that language learners utilize in the grammatical categorization process (e. g., Kelly, 1992; Redington, Chater, & Finch, 1998). The combination ofthese cues was investigated with artificial language learning experiments, which combined two categories of. phonologically coherent words with co-occurring distributional cues, and corpus analysis techniques. Experiments I to 4 indicated that both phonological and distribution cues are necessary for the categorization of high and low frequency words. Additionally, these experiments indicated that distributional information alone was sufficient to categorize high frequency words, but that phonological cues were necessary for low frequency words. It was also found that succeeding bigram distribution cues induced more grammatical categorization than the preceding bigram cues. This is explained by the Rescorla-' (1972) model of associative learning; associations were stronger between the category words and succeeding cues as a single succeeding cue followed all category words. Associations were weaker with preceding cues as numerous category words followed the preceding cues. Experiments 5, 6 and 7 also found that the effectiveD ss of the distributional cues was influenced by prior linguistic experience, resulting in higher learning with distributional cues which were phonologically consistent with distributional cues found in the participants' native language (English). This thesis also investigated the debate as to what type of distributional cue is most useful in the categorization process, with some researchers advocating trigram cues (Mintz, 2002) while others advocate bigram cues (Monaghan & Christiansen, 2004; Valian & Coulson, 1988). The results of a corpus analysis and two experiments provided evidence that trigram cues (aXb) are very effective at categorization, but <b>preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that <b>this</b> categorization may simply be due to the combined influence of the beginning and ending bigrams (aX and Xb). Overall, this thesis indicates that phonological and distributional cues are key to grammatical categorization, which occurs through associative learning principles; grammatical categorization progresses. faster with succeeding cues; and bigram distribution cues may be the initial source of distributional information in the grammatical categorization process. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Humans {{possess an}} {{extraordinary}} {{capacity to make}} reaching movements in a constantly changing physical environment. The studies in this thesis used a combination of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation) and robotics to explore {{the role of the}} primary motor cortex (Ml) in the preparation and execution of both "overlearnt" stereotypical and novel (motor adaptation) reaching tasks. Methods In each study, healthy adults made planar reaching movements on a robotic manipulandum from a central target to 1 - 8 peripheral targets. The robot was programmed to either allow unimpeded movement (chapters 3 - 4) or to apply a force field perturbation (chapters 5 - 7). Corticospinal drive to specific upper limb muscles was assessed by measuring transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in selected upper limb muscles at a series of time points before and during the reaching movements (Chapters 3 - 6). In chapter 7, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied over the Ml during motor adaptation to determine if there was a causal relationship between Ml function and motor adaptation. Main findings In chapter 3, both corticospinal excitability and voluntary EMG had a similar pattern of directional "tuning" in selected upper limb muscles. Furthermore, temporal analysis of MEPs in chapter 4 showed that increases in corticospinal and intracortical excitability occur just before the onset of voluntary muscle activity, which suggests that changes in Ml output may drive muscle activity in a feedforward manner during upper limb reaching. Chapters 5 and 6 revealed that after a single session of motor adaptation there were direction specific changes in corticospinal excitability and a release of intracortical inhibition that were associated with changes in voluntary EMG in the same muscles. These findings suggest that the Ml may also {{play an important role in}} driving feedforward muscle control during newly learnt dynamics. In chapter 7, anodal tDCS applied during motor adaptation was shown not to influence reaching error during the adaptation phase, but did induce increased error during deadaptation. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggested</b> that <b>this</b> may be due to enhanced internal model formation rather than a disruption to the deadaptation process per se. <b>This</b> latter finding <b>suggests</b> that the Ml may also play a contributory role in internal model formation in response to a changing physical environment...|$|R
