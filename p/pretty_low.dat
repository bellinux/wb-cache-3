500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed <b>pretty</b> <b>low</b> on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is <b>pretty</b> <b>low</b> on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E
2500|$|CM Punk, in a 2011 {{interview}} with GQ, briefly touched {{on the subject}} of the Benoit murder/suicide. He described it as [...] "a <b>pretty...</b> <b>low</b> point in everyone's life. A lot of people don't like to talk about it. It still blows my mind." [...] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during an interview session with WWE Superstars including Punk, he was asked if WWE was trying to erase Benoit from history. Punk responded that while Benoit is in the history books and that cannot be changed, it does not make any sense for WWE to promote him, due to the horrific nature of the crimes he committed.|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head negatively. And he was appalled. He thought to himself: Who can he be? Some miserable, silly youth without a penny. Or perhaps some scoundrel? Without making any {{expressive}} movement he wrung his loosely-clasped hands till the joints cracked. He looked at her. She was <b>pretty.</b> Some <b>low</b> scoundrel who will cast her off. Some plausible vagabond... "You couldn't wait--eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|Most {{of us thought}} Henery Walker's fortune {{was as good as}} made, but Bob <b>Pretty,</b> a nasty, <b>low</b> {{poaching}} chap {{that has}} done wot he could to give Claybury a bad name, turned up his nose at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "There aint nuthin' to be done," [...] he said, {{after we}} had worked at the thing for a while, [...] "but to jist wait here till the tide turns. It's <b>pretty</b> near dead <b>low</b> now, an' you'll float off {{in an hour or}} two." ...|$|R
2500|$|Vice Admiral William P. Mack {{recalled}} {{the antics of}} the diminutive vice chief: [...] "He would grab three-star officers by the lapels, literally shake them, and say, 'Why don't you do so and so or such and such?' They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting <b>pretty</b> <b>low.</b> As I told Admiral Burke, {{it was just a}} matter of time before someone was going to slug him. You can't operate like that. Admiral Felt wasn't big enough to defend himself. I said that one of these days he's going to come at someone who's going to wipe up the corridor with him, regardless of how many stars he has." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{founding}} {{leader of}} the group, David Chemla was born in Tunisia and raised in France. He was a former IDF officer {{who served in the}} Yom Kippur War in the Paratroopers Brigade. He left for France in 1977 after 10 years in Israel. He is chairman of Peace Now in France. He said the group seeks to support Israel's long-term future because [...] "as friends, as Jews, we {{want to tell you that}} you are going down a wrong path. I think our initiative is actually helping Israel's image in Europe. It is a <b>pretty</b> <b>low</b> image over here these days, because of what happened in Gaza, mainly, and it is commonly believed in Europe that Israel is the provocative, negative side of the conflict—the one that is blocking the peace process." [...] He claimed that [...] "We’re not saying that only Israel is responsible for the problem. As Jews tied to Israel, we speak to the Israelis. So this is a call to the Israelis, but of course [...] have a lot of the responsibility for the continuation of the conflict." [...] He affirmed, on behalf of the membership that [...] "our connection to the state of Israel is part of our identity," [...] but in Europe [...] "Israel is seen as responsible for all the problems [...]" [...] Chemla added that the group's was not a movement as such after the first petition but hoped to become one.|$|E

6000|$|MISS LUCY GALBRAITH: [...] "Oh, I can't ride backwards. I'll stay here, please. Thank you." [...] The porter {{places her}} {{things in a}} chair by a window, across the car from the {{sleeping}} gentleman, and she throws herself wearily into the next seat, wheels round in it, and lifting her veil gazes absently out at the landscape. Her face, which is very <b>pretty,</b> with a <b>low</b> forehead shadowed by thick blond hair, shows the traces of tears. She makes search in her pocket for her handkerchief, which she presses to her eyes. The conductor, lingering a moment, goes out.|$|R
60|$|As {{we walked}} on, Mr. Garthwaite's manner altered. He became unusually silent and thoughtful. The mention of Miss Welwyn's name had evidently called up some {{recollections}} {{which were not}} in harmony with his every-day mood. Feeling that {{to talk to him}} on any indifferent subject would be only to interrupt his thoughts to no purpose, I walked by his side in perfect silence, looking out already with some curiosity and impatience for a first view of Glenwith Grange. We stopped at last close by an old church, standing on the outskirts of a <b>pretty</b> village. The <b>low</b> wall of the churchyard was bounded on one side by a plantation, and was joined by a park paling, in which I noticed a small wicket-gate. Mr. Garthwaite opened it, and led me along a shrubbery path, which conducted us circuitously to the dwelling-house.|$|R
5000|$|The ovate, {{conical shell}} is smooth andof a uniform ashy white color. The spire is {{composed}} of eight whorls. The upper ones are slightly plaited, the <b>lowest</b> <b>pretty</b> large, marked with more or less straight, longitudinal lines, approximate, and of a color a little deeper and reddish. The base of the shell is ornamented with six or seven furrows. The ovate aperture is, white, fawn-colored within. The thick outer lip is arcuated towards the base, elevated exteriorly into a thick, very prominent margin. Within it is striated throughout its whole length. The left lip is thick, and partially covering the columella, which is adorned with guttules one half of its length. The first of these guttules, which is uppermost, is much more marked than the others. At {{the base of the}} columella is found a very prominent fold, terminated by a guttule formed like a flattened point.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, {{sorry to}} say. But I haven't mingled much. Been layin' <b>pretty</b> <b>low,</b> {{because the fact}} is I think I've struck a rich claim. An' it's made me cautious." ...|$|E
30|$|In 2009, Russian {{universities}} and research institutes {{have received the}} right to contribute intellectual property in the authorized capital of the company {{without the consent of}} the founder (usually Ministry of Education) and, consequently, to create spin-offs {{as a result of the}} adoption of the Federal Law No. 217 -FZ of 02.08. 2009. However, informal cooperation between scientists of universities (research organizations) and companies, often carried out with the support of the university administration, and before passing the law was <b>pretty</b> intense. The <b>low</b> level of wages in technical universities, the need to keep staff, resource constraints, and stringent business environment contributed to a mutual interest in cooperation. In spite of the fact that spin-offs received a number of benefits (tax breaks, the ability to get space for rent from the university without competition, benefits to pay social security contributions), some experts believe that the vast majority of spin-offs are not viable, created exclusively for grants and conducting transactions for the purchase of low-cost equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Gaskarth {{said the}} band {{did not realize}} what the album's theme was until halfway into the album. Gaskarth said [...] "a good chunk" [...] of the album dealt with the band's time with Interscope Records and, [...] "the other ... more {{important}} theme" [...] of the album was [...] "self discovery and confidence. It's about being sure that you're not sure, and being OK with that". In addition, Gaskarth said their experience with Interscope Records [...] "catapulted us into this new mind-set... We were refocused to redefine All Time <b>Low</b> <b>pretty</b> heavily. It was almost like closing one book and starting another of where the band came from." [...] Unlike Nothing Personal and Dirty Work {{where a lot of}} the material was co-written with various people, all of the songs on Don't Panic were written by Gaskarth with additional writing by Green. Gaskarth said that this approach [...] "felt like it was the right time for us to flex our own muscle, and to show people what we’re capable of on our own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{jumped at}} the offer, and took you, and I will say Warbles has been {{as good as his}} word. It wasn't long before I was turned out of my lodging for being too drunk and noisy for the house, and it wasn't {{more than a couple of}} years before I got <b>pretty</b> nigh as <b>low</b> as this. I had got to know a good many queer ones when I was in the public line, and I chanced to drop across one of them, and when I met him one day he told me he could put me into an easy way of earning money if I liked, but it was risky. I said I did not care for that, and since then I have always been on that lay. For a bit I did very well; I used to dress up as a tidy servant, and go shopping, and many a week I would get rid of three or four pounds' worth of the stuff; but in course, as I grew older and lost my figure and the drink told on me, it got more difficult. People looked at the money more sharply, and I got three months for it twice. I was allus careful, and never took more than one piece out with me at a time, so that I got off several times till they began to know me. You {{remember}} the last time I was in--I told you about it, and since then you have been doing it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Say!" [...] he cried. [...] "It's run down. That horse {{has broken}} every record, sure. The sun is <b>pretty</b> <b>low,</b> now that I come {{to look at}} it. Well, there's {{something}} here I don't understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even to {{know that}} much would have been {{something}} to go by," [...] he ventured at last. [...] "I couldn't let you sit there with the sun getting <b>pretty</b> <b>low</b> and a long night before us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he explained, [...] "there was a reason.

Well, how much is it! What's the figure you and she have settled on?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{went for}} the pebble stones, while Mary looked about for a {{suitable}} place for making the experiments.
