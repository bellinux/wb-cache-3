One of the recurring questions is whether classification is mainly {{based on the}} "inherent structure of biological reality" or on cultural, especially utilitarian needs. So far, studies about ethnobotanical classification have mainly been done in indigenous societies. Comparable data from industrialized countries are scarce. In this paper, folkbotanical classification data from the Napf region in central Switzerland is analysed and cross-culturally compared. METHODS: Structured and semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 60 adults and children chosen by random sampling.

Microcyclosporella is represented by a single species, M. mali, and is presently known from Germany and Slovenia. Microcyclosporella is Pseudocercosporella-like in morphology, but genetically and morphologically distinct from Pseudocercosporella s. str., for which an epitype is designated based on a fresh collection of P. bakeri from Laos.

40|$|Abstract Phoradendron is a New World genus of chlorophyllous hemiparasite {{plants with}} the {{distribution}} {{extending from the}} United States to Argentina, including the West Indies. The names given to the fruits within the Visceae are variable and include a viscous berry or pseudoberry bearing a single seed lacking the testa.

During the fruit development the structure of the mesocarp undergoes intense activity of cell division, and it differentiates onto two new mesocarpic regions: the parenchyma and the viscid layer. In its maturity, the seed is ategmic, presenting the embryo entirely embedded within a chlorophyllous endosperm. The occurrence of chlorophyll in the endosperm may be associated to absence of integuments on the seed, which allows the light to reach the seminal tissues throughout the somewhat transparent pericarp. In addition, the <b>Pomaceous</b> <b>fruit,</b> "viscidio" type is proposed as an alternative classification for Phoradendron fruits...|$|E
50|$|Alongside {{domestic}} farms, {{there were}} in Gumbsweiler, as in almost all Glan villages, mills, each of which developed differently. The gristmill in Gumbsweiler has stood in three different places, ﬁrst as the Kolbenmühle down from the Heckenacker (a rural area), then nearer the village {{on the other side}} of the Glan, and then right near the village at the bridge. This is one of the very few of these mills that are still running today. It runs as a heritage mill, but also does business. Automation and efﬁcient production have greatly changed the mill. It is today driven by a turbine to raise its capacity. There was another mill called the Schrammenmühle, which stood about 1.5 km upstream from the village. This mill was mentioned as early as 1580, but was likely much older than that. It was where Friedrich W. Weber came from, and he compiled a few prime works about the Palatinate’s mills. In the end, this mill only ran as an oilmill. It was shut down for good in 1954. Two smaller mills stood for a time on the Grundbach. They were run in the early 19th century during French Revolutionary and Napoleonic times as coöperatives in which some 15 families held shares in each. Through the Second World War, the agricultural structure prevailed, and farming was everybody’s main livelihood. Each family had a few small plots of land for growing grain and potatoes. Fruitgrowing, too, played a great role, for <b>pomaceous</b> <b>fruits</b> were pressed and stone fruits were made into jam. The regional ofﬁce (Bezirksamt) in Kusel registered in 1905 for Gumbsweiler twelve named farms that were run as primary income earners, ﬁfteen craftsmen and businessmen, two grocery shops, two painters and two innkeepers. Income at the craft businesses was very small, and therefore even the craftsmen had to work the land, albeit as a secondary occupation. Of great importance to feeding the villagers was stockbreeding. Every house had a stable, usually an outbuilding. In 1904, Gumbsweiler counted 20 horses, 35 head of cattle, 138 pigs and 41 goats. In times of war and neediness, livestock and small-animal keeping grew so greatly that greenery had to be gathered from the woods as stable straw. As cattle farming dwindled, the number of sheep rose. Cattle at ﬁrst were raised as part of dairy farming, but more and more they came to be raised for beef. During the 20th century, many Gumbsweiler villagers had to earn their livelihoods as workers. They worked at the hard-rock quarries in the dale, at the coal pits in the Saarland, at the Baumholder troop drilling ground or later, after having completed the requisite training, at the Opel works in Kaiserslautern. The village grew into a residential community for both blue- and white-collar workers who must commute to work elsewhere each day. The younger generation is moving to the cities and industrial centres. Still doing business in the village are a bakery that also sells groceries, a stonemasonry and gravestone business and an inn.|$|R

40|$|Cysteine {{biosynthesis}} {{plays an}} important role in plants for sulfur assimilation. Cysteine regulates the detoxification of cyanide that is a respiratory inhibitor generated mainly during ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants. Cyanide detoxification occurs by the ß-substitution of the sulfhydryl of cysteine with cyanide catalyzed into β-cyanoalanine by the ß-cyanoalanine synthase (β-CAS) enzyme in the mitochondria. In plants and bacteria two enzymes catalyze the synthesis of cysteine; serine acetyltransferase (SAT) transfer acetyl- CoA to serine, generating oacetylserine (OAS) which further combines with sulfide ion to form cysteine, the latter reaction is catalyzed by O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (OASS). SAT and OASS associate to form cysteine synthase complex (CSC). The isoforms of SAT and OASS have been found in the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria of several dicotyledonous plants. The function of cysteine synthesis at various sites and its transport within the compartments of the cell is ambiguous. Two type of dicot plant material, wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis thaliana and pear fruits that are distinct in nature, family and origin were selected for this research. Pears are <b>pomaceous</b> <b>fruits</b> that produce a large amount of ethylene during fruit ripening. The selection of fruit material was based on its ethylene measurements. WT Arabidopsis was grown on MS medium and 15 - 20 days old rosettes were used for the experimental purpose. The mitochondria from both types of plants were isolated and purified using continuous percoll gradient. It was used for respirometry, liquid scintillation counting, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) assays. The analysis of quality of mitochondria was based on respiratory control ratio, coupling, ADP: O ratio and cytochrome C oxidase latency test. According to oxygraph assays, cyanide inhibits the respiration process, but the application of L-cysteine as low as 5 μM in pear and 10 μM L-cysteine in Arabidopsis mitochondria can protect the rate of respiration and assist in cyanide detoxification. 2. 5 μM cystine also shows the similar effect as tested for pear mitochondria. Cyanide concentration required for total inhibition of respiration range between 10 μM to 100 μM. Amino-oxyacetic acid assay suggested that β-cyanoalanine synthase signals the mitochondrial transport of cysteine and cystine. Dithiothreitol (DTT) reduction and Nethylmaleimide (NEM) assay inferred that cysteine is a preferred substrate for cyanide detoxification. Respirometry analysis shows that L-glutamic acid competes with both cysteine and cystine, and aspartic acid interferes with transportation of cystine more than that of cysteine. The specific inhibitors of Xag transport system (AβH, i. e., aspartic-β-hydroxamate) and Xc system (quisqualic acid, S- 4 -Carboxyphenylglycine (CPG)) inhibit the cysteine and cystine transport in pears. These inhibitors were further tested in liquid scintillation counting by using Lcysteine S^ 35 radioisotope and LC-MS/MS experiments by estimating β-cyanoalanine synthesis. The inhibitory effect of chemical inhibitors on cysteine import was found partial for pear and minimal in Arabidopsis mitochondria. But the results obtained from glutamic acid competition in respiratory experiments correspond well with the competitive assays carried out for liquid scintillation counting and LC-MS/MS. This analysis supports the hypothesis that the cysteine is imported into the mitochondria and competes with glutamic acid while transport. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

50|$|The oldest {{document}} on hand in {{the municipality}} itself is the chronicle mentioned above, which seems to begin in 1877, continuing with one interruption until 1912. It can be assumed that the chronicle was written by the village schoolteachers through the {{time when it was}} being kept. Municipal council’s first protocol confirmed on 6 September 1888 Martin Heinrich’s accession as reeve after having been elected on 1 August 1888. Mayor of Stromberg Hoßeus introduced the hitherto acting reeve into office in accordance with a decree from district chairman Agricola. “Decreed” councillors were Sturm, Piroth, Leinberger, Höning and Kruger. The council was then made up of the six Meistbeerbte (roughly “greatest heirs”). The most important issue cropped up as early as the second sessional protocol of 30 January 1889. in which municipal council refused to follow the “Decree of the Royal Government at Koblenz of 12 January 1872”, which required the village to hire a night watchman. The grounds for this decision were that the village’s safety would not be compromised and that its financial circumstances would not allow it to afford the 45 ℳ that this would have taken from the yearly budget. This seems understandable when one considers that in 1888, the municipality’s yearly budget amounted to 3,539.19 ℳ. The populace earned its livelihood almost exclusively from agriculture. The grain and fruit harvests formed the regular, if low, income, dependent as they were on the weather’s vagaries and freedom from agricultural pests. In times of drought, according to the relevant decisions from municipal council, some livestock had to be slaughtered and leaves were used instead of straw and grass as fodder, all of which was supplied from the Rother Wald (forest) beyond Warmsroth. Fruitgrowing seems to have played no unimportant role. In 1886 - a “good” year - 3,772 Zentner (a Zentner was roughly equivalent to 50 kg) of <b>pomaceous</b> and stone <b>fruits</b> were harvested by the 38 families living in Roth, by their own figures. This was reckoned to be worth 18,879 ℳ and more than 80% of the harvest was sold. The chronicler believed that these figures may have been understated “since the inhabitants, {{on the assumption that the}} yield might be used for taxation purposes, would rather declare less than more.” Years in which there was no fruit harvest saw the villagers’ income shrink noticeably. Today it is enough to take one look at the municipal area to see that the fruit harvest no longer plays any role. The extensive woodlands fell victim to agricultural machinery in the time following the Second World War. Scenes of the 18 members of the Roth Fruitgrowing and Gardening Club (founded in 1912) maintaining displays of no fewer than 27 varieties of apple for a whole week in a room at the Kasper Inn (owner: Adam Kasper) and even having local school groups come in to visit are no longer imaginable nowadays. Only hefty tax increases allowed the municipal budget to be balanced. The rental income from municipal land - in 1877 it was 328 ℳ - was low, and prices for tanbark were steadily sinking. Since Roth’s forests were made up of trees that supplied tanbark to the tanning industry, this downturn in the market was keenly felt in the village. For the chronicler in 1896 it was a gleam of hope that many younger villagers were working at the mines in Waldalgesheim and Weiler, and that thus a “nicer earning” was coming into the village. Then, too, the concept of farms being run as a secondary occupation had subtly begun to work its way into the economic landscape, and was already having positive effects.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Saskatoon berry (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.) is a {{promising}} fruit species originating from North America. Among pomaceous fruits, saskatoon berries are a valuable {{source of chemical}} compounds with an antioxidant effect. Materials and methods. The total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and their correlation associated with the total antioxidant capacity of fruit of five particular cultivars were ascertained. Reactive oxygen species (specifically nitric oxide, superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical) and antioxidant activity in the liver lipid system of their methanolic extracts were also assessed. Results and discusssion. In saskatoon berry cultivars the total contents of phenolic compounds ranged from (2. 52 to 3. 82) g gallic acid Eq. kg(- 1) of fresh mass, while the values of total antioxidant capacity were observed to be from (4. 17 to 5. 29) g of ascorbic acid Eq. kg(- 1) of fresh mass. High correlation coefficients between phenolics as well as flavonoids and antioxidant capacity were calculated (r(2) = 0. 8921 and r(2) = 0. 9901, respectively). Nitric oxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and antioxidant activity in the liver lipid system of saskatoon berry fruit methanolic extracts (10 %) were provided for the first time. In the case of nitric oxide, the inhibitions were 21. 08 - 27. 52 %; as regards superoxide anion, they were 25. 14 - 30. 73 %; concerning hydroxyl radical, 18. 25 - 21. 18 %, and in respect of antioxidant activity in the liver lipid system, 7. 90 - 8. 38 %. These inhibitions are stronger than, e. g., in apples which {{are the most important}} species of <b>pomaceous</b> <b>fruit</b> worldwide. Conclusions. Saskatoon berry fruit could be a suitable supplement for modern human nutrition. Furthermore, our work contributes to the popularisation of this pomaceous species, with the focus on its potential in relation to high antioxidant strength...|$|E
