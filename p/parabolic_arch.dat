5|$|Shortly after, Gaudí {{received}} an important new commission from Güell: {{the construction of}} his family house, in the Carrer Nou de la Rambla in Barcelona. The Palau Güell (1886–1888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions {{such as those in}} Carrer Montcada. Gaudí designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan Oñós. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaudí used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here. He designed the interior of the palace with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire {{in the form of a}} lantern tower, which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron weather vane.|$|E

25|$|The <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with church architecture since at least the 1880s. German architect Dominikus Bohm (1880-1955) exploited the possibilities of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> in several 1920s church designs, demonstrating that the kind of atmosphere commonly associated with Gothic architecture could be obtained with a minimum of historical allusion. Though it remained an uncommon architectural form in the early 20th century, it featured in several Modernist churches, most notably the Church of St Francis of Assisi (completed 1943) in Pampulha, Brazil, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Constructed from cast in-situ concrete, the nave of the church was a free-standing parabolic vault. Highly controversial at the time, Niemeyer's bold design was extremely influential among architects around the world (including Australia), with photographs and plans of the church published in architectural journals.|$|E

25|$|The {{church is}} {{rectangular}} in plan with an entrance foyer in the north-west corner, {{linked to a}} brick and concrete bell tower by a covered walkway. The main elevation {{of the church is}} asymmetrical, with the end walls of the wings flanking the central arch being constructed of different materials. The concrete <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> is in-filled with a timber framed glazed wall, with a reinforced concrete cross forming the central spine and a raised brick garden bed running along the base. A series of horizontal ridges on {{the outer edge of the}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> are remnants of the original roof cladding system. To the side of the arch is the end wall of the eastern aisle, which features small, cross-shaped openings in the brickwork, in-filled with glass. A plaque commemorating the laying of the foundation stone is located here. The entrance foyer on the western side is fully glazed with timber framing and a low brick garden bed along the north side.|$|E

25|$|The {{length of}} the church is divided into bays by the exposed <b>parabolic</b> <b>arches.</b> A {{scaled-down}} arch within the arch closest to the sanctuary provides the framework for a lower arched ceiling, lined with plasterboard. The gap between the inner and outer arches is glazed with frosted glass. The lower ceiling stops short of touching the southern sanctuary wall, allowing views of the main roof structure. Throughout the nave, the underside of the parabolic roof is lined with timber, while the tops of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>arches</b> are concealed from view by a high, plasterboard-clad cove.|$|R

2500|$|The 16th Street Bridge, {{also known}} as the Piney Branch Bridge, is an {{automobile}} and pedestrian bridge that carries 16th Street NW over Piney Branch and Piney Branch Parkway in Washington, D.C. It was the first <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> bridge in the United States. Construction on the first span began in 1905 as part of the northward extension of 16th Street, and was finished in 1907 but was never opened to traffic. The second span began construction in 1909 and was completed in 1910. [...] The bridge was renovated in 1990, and again beginning in October 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The set's {{public address}} (PA) system was {{initially}} designed by Fisher who proposed a monophonic system with speakers mounted {{on top of}} two large antler-like structures {{in front of the}} video screen. [...] While discussing the structure to support the centralized PA system, Williams recalled a statement Bono made on the Zoo TV Tour about having a [...] "secret fantasy to play a show underneath a set of gigantic golden arches". [...] So the design was changed to feature a 100-foot (30-m) <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> supporting the PA {{in the center of the}} stage. [...] To further develop the concept, Fisher drew a version of the concert stage transformed into a supermarket, which later appeared in the Pop album artwork.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{the roads}} serve as {{connectors}} {{to some of}} Washington's architecture {{on both sides of}} Rock Creek Park. For example, the Tiger Bridge {{can be seen from the}} Piney Branch Parkway, which is walking distance to Klingle Road and a connector for Mount Pleasant and the adjacent neighborhoods of Crestwood and Rock Creek East. The Bridge appears as a solid arch. This Sixteenth Street Bridge was built in two stages between 1907 and 1910 and was the first <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> bridge built in the United States. The topside of the bridge on Sixteenth Street incorporates simple neoclassical balusters and dramatic tigers, sculptured by noted animalier Alexander P. Proctor, which flank each end of the bridge and lend the bridge its popular name, [...] "Tiger Bridge." ...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{example of}} an early Gothic arch in Europe is in Sicily in the Greek fortifications of Gela.The semicircular arch was {{followed}} in Europe by the pointed Gothic arch or ogive, whose centreline more closely follows the forces of compression and which is therefore stronger. The semicircular arch can be flattened to make an elliptical arch, as in the Ponte Santa Trinita. Both the <b>parabolic</b> and catenary <b>arches</b> are now known to be the theoretically strongest forms. <b>Parabolic</b> <b>arches</b> were introduced in construction by the Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí, who admired the structural system of the Gothic style, but for the buttresses, which he termed [...] "architectural crutches". The catenary and <b>parabolic</b> <b>arches</b> carry all horizontal thrust to the foundation and so do not need additional elements. The first examples of the pointed arch in the European architecture are in Sicily and {{date back to the}} Arab-Norman period.|$|R

Douglas. The abutments and substructure of the bridge are of reinforced concrete; the arch itself is not reinforced with steel. The interior of the bridge is hollow. Square vertical interior columns [...] in length on each side support the road deck. A latticework of horizontal square beams, each [...] in size, intersect the columns and are set perpendicular to one another. This system of columns and beams compress the arch and keep it stable as well push outward against the walls. The bridge's abutments are hollow. The abutments are stabilized by soil pressing against them from the outside, and the system of beams and columns on the interior of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Hadid {{described}} her Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London as [...] "inspired by the fluid geometry {{of water in}} movement." [...] The building covers three swimming pools, and seats 17,500 spectators at the two main pools. The roof, made of steel and aluminium and covered with wood on the inside, rests on just three supports; [...] {{it is in the}} form of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>arch</b> which dips in the centre, with the two pools at either end. The seats are placed in bays beside the curving and outward-leaning walls of glass. At £269 million, the complex cost three times the original estimate, owing principally to the complexity of the roof. This was the subject of much comment when it was constructed, and it was the first 2012 Olympic building begun but the last to be finished. It was praised by architecture critics. [...] Rowan Moore of The Guardian said that the roof [...] "floats and undulates" [...] and called the centre [...] "The Olympics' most majestic space." ...|$|E
