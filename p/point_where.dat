30|$|When signals overlap {{significantly}} in the time–frequency domain, the time–frequency detection of Section “Weak-sparseness-based time–frequency detection for source recovery (multisource selection)” is now inappropriate. Indeed, the statistical procedure of Section “Weak-sparseness-based time–frequency detection for source recovery (multisource selection)” is aimed at detecting time–frequency <b>points</b> <b>where</b> signal sources are present, whatever the number of these sources, whereas it is now required to discriminate <b>points</b> <b>where</b> one single source is present from <b>points</b> <b>where</b> multiple sources occur. We assume that in case of different sources present at time–frequency point (t,f), they are uncorrelated and incoherently combined. The resulting energy at (t,f) is thus supposed to be smaller than the energy attained at the time–frequency <b>points</b> <b>where</b> one single source is present only.|$|R

Since standard Gaussian fields are shift-invariant, we can consider a fixed value of the orientation, say the vertical. <b>Points</b> <b>where</b> _ℓ exhibits this orientation are <b>points</b> <b>where</b> Re(_ℓ) vanishes; so let us define _ℓ = Re(_ℓ) and look for its zeroes on the given great circle.|$|R
