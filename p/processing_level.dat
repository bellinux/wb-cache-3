40|$|INTRODUCTION Psycholinguistic {{research}} into language production [...] -the process of translating thoughts into speech [...] -has long {{been associated with}} connectionist models. Spreading activation models of lexical access in production represent {{some of the earliest}} applications of connectionist ideas to psycholinguistic data (e. g., Dell & Reich, 1977; Harley, 1984; MacKay, 1982; Stemberger, 1985). These models combined representations from linguistics with interactive activation principles and sought to explain speech errors, particularly errors resulting from multiple causes or <b>processing</b> <b>levels.</b> For example, "Lizst's second Hungarian restaurant " instead of "rhapsody " involves mistakenly using a word that is associatively, syntactically, and phonologically related to the intended word. Activation that spreads interactively among <b>processing</b> <b>levels</b> seems to be a natural way to account for these kinds of slips. Direct all correspondence to: Ga...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the speech to speech translation system INTARC, {{developed during the}} first phase of the Verbmobil project. The general design goals of the INTARC system architecture were time synchronous processing as well as incrementality and interactivity as a means to achieve a higher degree of robustness and scalability. Interactivity means that in addition to the bottom-up (in terms of <b>processing</b> <b>levels)</b> data flow the ability to process top-down restrictions considering the same signal segment for all <b>processing</b> <b>levels.</b> The construction of INTARC 2. 0, which has been operational since fall 1996, followed an engineering approach focussing on the integration of symbolic (linguistic) and stochastic (recognition) techniques which led to a generalization of the concept of a ``one pass'' beam search.

50|$|Originally {{introduced}} by embedded {{systems such as}} the Cell Broadband Engine, sharing system memory directly between multiple system actors makes heterogeneous computing more mainstream. Heterogeneous computing itself refers to systems that contain multiple processing units central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or any type of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The system architecture allows any accelerator, for instance a graphics processor, to operate at the same <b>processing</b> <b>level</b> as the system's CPU.|$|E
50|$|These {{assumptions}} lead to {{an architecture}} that supports three levels of processing. At the lowest level, is bottom-up, parallel, and automatic processing. The next level is the deliberative level, where knowledge from the first level is used to propose, select, and apply a single action. These two levels implement fast, skilled behavior, and roughly correspond to Kahnemanâ€™s System 1 <b>processing</b> <b>level.</b> More complex behavior arises automatically when knowledge is incomplete or uncertain, through a third level of processing using substates, roughly corresponding to System 2.|$|E
5000|$|Key hurdles {{currently}} {{preventing the}} commercial application of many NEMS devices include low-yields and high device quality variability.

The focus is currently shifting from experimental work towards practical applications and device structures that will implement and profit from such novel devices.

40|$|Decision quality under {{uncertainty}} {{is a problem}} that has been addressed by many researchers. But most of the works dedicated to this problem assume that there is a single quality measure to computation based on the status of an n-tuple of criteria. However, in most of real-world applications the quality is multicriteria where each criterion captures a dimension of value in the solution. In this paper, we present a decision maker that manipulates the quality as a vector of criteria where the improvement of each criterion is in charge of a progressive processing agent that uses its hierarchy of <b>processing</b> <b>levels</b> {{to improve the quality of}} this criterion incrementally. We discuss the problem of optimizing the decision of sequencing <b>processing</b> <b>levels</b> of agents by transforming it to an MDP. We also present the strategy to be adopted when considering the criteria preferences.

5000|$|Above, {{a single}} <b>processing</b> <b>level</b> in a {{hierarchical}} NMF system was described. At {{each level of}} hierarchy there are input signals from lower levels, models, similarity measures (L), emotions, which are defined as changes in similarity, and actions; actions include adaptation, behavior satisfying the knowledge instinct - maximization of similarity. An input to each level {{is a set of}} signals X(n), or in neural terminology, an input field of neuronal activations. The result of signal processing at a given level are activated models, or concepts m recognized in the input signals n; these models along with the corresponding instinctual signals and emotions may activate behavioral models and generate behavior at this level.|$|E

5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} of repetition suppression, {{a reduction in}} neural activity when stimuli are repeated, is thought to depend on processing overlaps between repeated items and is {{generally considered to be}} the neural correlate of repetition priming. As such it has been used extensively in research investigating the nature of representations across various levels of the visual processing hierarchy. [...] In doing so researchers have found that repetition suppression appears to occur on multiple processing levels; dependent on the stimuli being processed and the <b>processing</b> <b>level</b> at which the experimental manipulation is directed; with reductions in neural activity to repeated stimuli occurring in regions involved with the initial processing of those features. [...] However, care must be taken in interpreting the results of these studies as the relationship between repetition suppression and repetition priming has not been definitively established.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} cope with the above {{described}} problems in the care-providing robot FRIEND the special vision system ROVIS (RObust machine VIsion for Service robotics) [...] was developed. The structure of ROVIS is depicted in Fig. 5. There are two main ROVIS components: hardware and object recognition and reconstruction chain. The connection between ROVIS and the overall robot control system is represented by the World Model where ROVIS stores the processed visual information. At the initialization phase of ROVIS the extrinsic camera parameters needed for 3D object reconstruction and the transformation between stereo camera and manipulator which is necessary for vision based object manipulation are calculated by the Camera Calibration module. The object recognition and reconstruction chain consists of robust algorithms for object recognition and 3D reconstruction for the purpose of reliable manipulation motion planning and grasping in unstructured environments and variable illumination conditions. Therefore, an accuracy of 5mm for the estimated 3D pose is necessary which enforces very good and precise algorithms. In ROVIS, robustness must be understood as the capability to the system to adapt to varying operational conditions and is realized through the inclusion feedback mechanisms at the image <b>processing</b> <b>level</b> and also between different hardware and software components of the vision system. A core part of the system is the automatic, closed-loop calculation of an image Region of Interest (ROI) on which vision methods are applied. By using a ROI the performance of object recognition and 3D reconstruction can be improved since the scene complexity is reduced.|$|E

Results showed that single test trial recalled more words than repeated test trial in immediate final free-recall test, participants in deep processing performed better than those in shallow processing in both immediate and delayed retention. However, the dominance of single test trial and deep processing did not happen in delayed retention. Additional study trials did not further enhance the delayed retention of words encoded in deep processing, but did enhance the delayed retention of words encoded in shallow processing...|$|E
