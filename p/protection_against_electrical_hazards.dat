As it has been concerned during several years, transmission, subtransmission and distribution lines are of high level of importance to power delivery and reliability. <b>Protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>hazards</b> and incidents is subject to long studies. In this study, protection of power lines from theory to hardware implementation is elaborated. Induction motors in various applications constitute half of power system loads. Thereby, protection of induction motors is studied theoretically and implemented on hardware. ???SEL (Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories) ??? incorporation is a famous and reputed brand in protection systems. The company provides comprehensive support and products to protect most of power system elements.

The present signal conditioning circuits provide at least one level of subject <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> shock <b>hazard</b> but {{at a level of}} 100 micro-A (for voltages of up to 200 V). However, it is necessary to provide catastrophic fault tolerance protection for the astronauts and to provide protection at a current level of less that 100 micro-A. For this study, protection at the 10 micro-A level was sought. This is the generally accepted value below which no possibility of microshock exists. Only the possibility of macroshock exists {{in the case of the}} signal conditioners. However, this extra amount of protection is desirable.

However, harmonic components in ground fault current may influence the tripping sensitivity of RCDs, and the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> shock may not be effective.

40|$|Transformerless {{inverters}} {{technology in}} photovoltaic systems offers many advantages, {{but there are}} some safety issues due to the solar panel parasitic capacitance. The parasitic capacitance value depends on many factors such as PV panels and frame structure, surface of the cells, distance between the cells, module frame, weather conditions (e. g., humidity) and the amount of dust covering the PV panel. Harsh climate like the one in the Central Queensland region is characterized by high temperature, high relative humidity. Due to the region’s high dew point, high humidity and heavy rain during the wet season, the water condensed over the PV array surface will affect the stray capacitance significantly and consequently, the system leakage current. Human safety in PV system is a key issue, which must be addressed when this technology is applied. <b>Protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> shock is essential while deploying such systems to avoid injury or loss of life. Furthermore, PV insulation varies with meteorological conditions such as, temperatures, humidity.

40|$|Purpose - A {{saturated}} {{iron core}} superconducting fault current limiter (SISFCL) {{has an important}} role to play in the present-day power system, providing effective <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> faults and thus ensuring an uninterrupted supply of electricity to the consumers. Previous mathematical models developed to describe the SISFCL use a simple flux density-magnetic field intensity curve representing the ferromagnetic core. As the magnetic state of the core affects the efficient working of the device, this paper aims to present a novel approach in the mathematical modeling of the device with the inclusion of hysteresis. Design/methodology/approach - The Jiles-Atherton's hysteresis model is utilized to develop the mathematical model of the limiter. The model is numerically solved using MATLAB. To support the validity of model, finite element model (FEM) with similar specifications was simulated. Findings - Response of the limiter based on the developed mathematical model is in close agreement with the FEM simulations. To illustrate the effect of the hysteresis, the responses are compared by using three different hysteresis characteristics. Harmonic analysis is performed and comparison is carried out utilizing fast Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform. It is observed that the core with narrower hysteresis characteristic not only produces a better current suppression but also creates a higher voltage drop across the DC source. It also injects more harmonics in the system under fault condition. Originality/value - Inclusion of hysteresis in the mathematical model presents a more realistic approach in the transient analysis of the device. The paper provides an essential insight into the effect of the core hysteresis characteristic on the device performance. © 2016 Emerald Publishing Limited. Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people.

Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings.

By 1935 nearly all new systems were electrically shockproof. Two important developments that facilitated this transition were {{the introduction of the}} Coolidge hot cathode tube in 1913 and the development of flexible shielded high-voltage cable a few years before 1930. The first replaced the erratic gas tube that required more or less continuous surveillance, frequent tube exchanges and thus easy access. The Coolidge tube was more reliable and high-voltage and tube current could be adjusted independently. Ironically, it was also these latter characteristics and the higher loadability which had led to more dangerous systems. Later, the reliability of the Coolidge tube allowed its placement in a well-shielded housing, giving <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> radiation and <b>electrical</b> shock.
