40|$|Abstract. <b>Coordinated</b> <b>action</b> <b>for</b> {{a team of}} robots is a {{challenging}} problem, es-pecially in dynamic, unpredictable environments. In the context of robot soccer, a complex domain with teams of robots in an adversarial setting, {{there is a great}} deal of uncertainty in the opponent’s behavior and capabilities. We introduce the concept of a play as a team plan, which combines both reactive principles, which are the focus of traditional approaches <b>for</b> <b>coordinating</b> <b>actions,</b> and deliberative principles. We introduce the concept of a playbook as a method for seamlessly combining multiple team plans. The playbook provides a set of alternative team behaviors which form the basis for our third contribution of play adaptation. We describe how these concepts were concretely implemented in the CMDragons robot soccer team. We also show empirical results indicating the importance of adaptation in adversarial or other unpredictable environments. ...|$|R

Not only do our controllers guarantee zero phase error in steady state under arbitrary frequency heterogeneity, but they also require little knowledge of the oscillator nonlinearities and network topology. Furthermore, we provide a global convergence analysis, in the absence of noise and propagation delay, for the resulting nonlinear system whose phase vector evolves on the n-torus.

In this system, RecA protein formed recombination intermediates that were processed by the actions of the RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC proteins. RuvAB was found to promote branch migration, to dissociate the RecA filament, and to modulate the orientation of cleavage of Holliday junction resolution by RuvC. Monoclonal antibodies directed against RuvA, RuvB, or RuvC inhibited resolution in the reconstituted system. Specific protein–protein interactions between the branch migration motor (RuvB) and the resolvase (RuvC) were also observed. These results provide evidence <b>for</b> <b>coordinated</b> <b>action</b> during the late stages of recombination, possibly involving the assembly of a RuvABC branch migration/resolution complex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Coordination is a {{key problem}} in massively multi-agent systems. As {{applications}} execute on distributed computer systems, coordination mechanisms must scalably bridge the network distance between where decisions are made {{and where they are}} to be enforced. Our work on the CyberOrgs model 1 addresses this challenge by encapsulating distributed multi-agent computations along with computational and communication resources they require (for carrying out the application’s functions as well as <b>for</b> <b>coordinating</b> <b>actions</b> of the agents) plus purchasing power represented by an amount of eCash for acquiring additional resources. Resources are de�ned in time and space, and are owned by cyberorgs. Resource ownership changes as a result of trade between cyberorgs. Ownership of resources coupled with an effective and scalable control structure creates a predictable resource environment for multi-agent systems and their coordination mechanisms to execute in. Particularly, the coordination mechanism can reason about the possibility of successful <b>coordinated</b> <b>action</b> based on predictable communication and processing delays. This paper presents our experience with hierarchical coordination of distributed processor resource for a system of cyberorgs internally distributed across a number of physical nodes. We demonstrate that encapsulation of network resources creates a scalable opportunity for reasoning about distributed <b>coordinated</b> <b>action</b> to support decision making. Experimental results show that the CyberOrgs based resource-aware approach scalably increases opportunities <b>for</b> successful <b>coordinated</b> distributed <b>actions</b> involving up to 1500 agents (in much larger systems) by reducing the delay in determining their feasibility, as well as helps avoid attempts of infeasible actions. ...|$|R
