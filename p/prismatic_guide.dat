40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{optimization}} of PKMs specifically developed for applications in the MEMS area. Specifically, the mechanism here considered was at first studied {{in collaboration with the}} S. A. M. M. Lab (Space Automation and Manufacturing Mechanisms Laboratory) of the University of Florida and consists of a mobile platform supported by 3 legs, symmetrically positioned around it. Each kinematic chain is P-R-S: the platform is connected to the legs by spherical joints; each leg is then linked to a rack, which slides on a <b>prismatic</b> <b>guide</b> fixed at the base plate, by revolute joints. For the rack actuation the use of the motion devices prototyped and designed by SNL (Sandia National Lab) was adopted. The mechanism is conceived in poly-Si, using surface micromachining techniques and can be competitively applied in the optical transmission field, thanks to the better performance and the positioning accuracy achievable through the sophisticated motion device and the PK architecture. The structure has been analyzed at kinematic and dynamic levels, and then its structural behavior was considered too. In particular, a kinematics optimization was performed, in order to obtain an optimal design in terms of number of DoFs, positioning accuracy and footprint. Analyses results highlighted the advantages of using a simpler variant and the initial architecture configuration has been modified substituting the S-joints with universal joints. Specifically, linking together two couples of revolute joints with orthogonal axes by a L-shape plate, a new configuration of μ−universal joint was designed. The legs have been then rearranged in order to optimise the mobility of the mechanism with respect to its stiffness. Simulations were also performed in the combined multi-body and FEM environments to evaluate stresses in the links and to minimize structural compliances. After a brief introduction to the technological area of MEMS, the potentialities of PKMs applications in the micro world are presented. Successively, the main mechanical design limitations due to manufacturing constraints are discussed and the minimal set of requirements for the feasibility of complex μ-devices is identified. In Sect. 4, the μ−PKM under consideration is described and the variant of the initial architecture proposed, while Sect. 5 provides with the FEM design of critical components. Finally, conclusions are drawn. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to provide an {{analytical}} method based on experimental measurements {{in order to obtain}} the prismatic film deformation for different curvatures of Hollow Cylindrical <b>Prismatic</b> Light <b>Guides</b> (CPLG). To conform cylindrical guides is necessary bend the film to guide the light, changes induced by curving the film give rise to deformation shifts. Light losses affected by deformation has been experimentally evaluated and numerically analyzed. The effect of deformation in prism angle is specially increased for CPLG of curvatures higher than 20 m- 1. An experimental method for accurate transmittance measurements related to bending is presented...|$|R
40|$|Hollow, cylindrical, <b>prismatic</b> light <b>guides</b> (CPLGs) are optical {{components}} that, using total {{internal reflection}} (TIR), are able to transmit high-diameter light beams in daylight and artificial lighting applications without relevant losses. It is necessary to study the prism defects of their surfaces to quantify the behavior of these optical components. In this Letter, we analyze a CPLG made of a transparent dielectric material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the topographic optical profilometry by absorption in fluids (TOPAF) imaging technique are conducted {{to determine if there}} are defects in the corners of the prisms. A model for light guide transmittance that is dependent on prism defects is proposed. Finally, a simulation and an experimental study are carried out to check the validity of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{of light}} through a 90 degrees elbow in a hollow light guide is an {{important}} step in the development of natural lighting applications. In this paper we present a new design that has more than 260 % higher efficiency in flux transfer than a standard bending system for hollow and aluminum light guides. The clue of this new system is to minimize the light angle at the output of the elbow, in such way {{that it is possible to}} guide light at higher distances because of the fewer reflections in the light guide. The system works properly for <b>prismatic</b> light <b>guides</b> but is also suitable for aluminum guides where the reduction of reflections permit the use of cheaper aluminum or the increase in length maintaining flux transfer. Also this reduction of reflections in aluminum light guide derives in less change of chromatic coordinates...|$|R
40|$|Daylighting must be {{considered}} as the greenest way to illuminate any space {{and one of the}} most important architectural design challenges and opportunities. Human life is strongly influenced by natural lighting, and nowadays we have to add to this factor the importance of energy conservation and pollution reduction objectives. The development of hollow light guides offers people the advantages of natural lighting and the benefits of reduced energy consumption systems, providing changes in architectural form of spaces where sunlight does not have direct access. Hollow Cylindrical <b>Prismatic</b> Light <b>Guides</b> (CPLGs) are transparent optical components able to transmit high diameter light beams in daylight buildings applications without relevant losses. The goal of this paper is to show a novel lighting design based on hollow prismatic light pipes, which let daylight to be introduced inside of buildings. An improved mathematical modelling to predict light transmission efficiency based on realistic software simulations and experimental models is presented...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{a mathematical model}} of the beam adapted for use in general-purpose software systems to analyze dynamic characteristics. The elastic properties of the beam tension, bending and torsion are taken into account. Such a model significantly expands the functional capabilities of the complexes. The mathematical model of the beam designed for the finite element method is taken as a basis. Then its adaptation is carried out {{taking into account the}} beam joint to the arbitrary points of a rigid solid, thereby having a model suitable to analyze objects with lumped parameters. Beam parameters are the material parameters, the geometric characteristics, and the coordinates of joint points to the solids. The paper describes in detail the algorithm of computations performed at each step of numerical integration of the systems of ordinary differential equations, and presents an equivalent diagram of the mathematical model of the beam. Mathematical models of elastic rail <b>guides,</b> cylindrical and <b>prismatic,</b> derived from the mathematical model of the beam are more functional compared to the models based on the kinematic equations. The <b>prismatic</b> rail <b>guide</b> (V-guide), unlike the beam, does not counteract the translational motion of solids along it, i. e. only works in torsion and bending, and a deforming part of the rail guide length is variable. The cylindrical rail guide works in bending only. These differences can be easily implemented by modifying the equations of the mathematical model of the beam. Using these models allows us to connect solids by two or more rail guides, and it does not lead to the degeneration of the Jacobi matrix (unlike models based on kinematic equations). The models are implemented in PA 8 and PA 9 software and methodological support complexes for analysis of dynamic objects developed at the Department of CAD in Bauman MSTU. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrical <b>prismatic</b> hollow light <b>guides</b> {{are able}} to {{transmit}} daylight properly into the spaces of a building in which natural light has a difficult access. Transmission through the guide depends on the optical characteristics of the material, {{the shape of the}} guide and the fidelity of the geometry in prisms structure. It is important to analyse the micro-structure prism imperfections of the surfaces such as the existence of a curved area on peaks prism which modify the behaviour of the prism film; these imperfections, change the optical path and therefore the rays are directed to other directions instead of undergoing total internal reflections. In this paper, several cylindrical guides made of transparent dielectric material characterized with an absorption factor have been developed. A numerical analysis has been carried out by software tools to analyse the flux distribution in the light guidance system comparing its efficiency by optical analysis in different simulations. These simulations include high reproductively prism related to the light pipe’s material and optical properties including a study of the impact of imperfect geometry which is necessary to allow rigorous comparisons with the experimental simulations. The simulated results have been compared with experimental data obtained through real scale analysis. The experimental measurements have revealed effectiveness of 66. 7 % in the aspect ratio of 30...|$|R
