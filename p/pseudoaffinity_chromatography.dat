40|$|Pea (Pisum sativum L.) chloroplastic phosphoriboisomerase (EC 5. 3. 1. 6) can be {{purified}} to apparent homogeneity in {{less than}} 2 days time with a 53 % yield. Important steps in the purification include heat treatment and <b>pseudoaffinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> on Red H- 3 BN Sepharose. The purified isomerase has a subunit molecular mass of 26. 4 kD. The N-terminal sequence has been determined through 34 residues. pH optima are 7. 8 (ribose- 5 -phosphate) and 7. 7 (ribulose- 5 -phosphate); Km values are 0. 9 millimolar (ribose- 5 -phosphate) and 0. 6 millimolar (ribulose- 5 -phosphate). The enzyme is inhibited by erythrose- 4 -phosphate, sedoheptulosebisphosphate, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate, and 3 -phosphoglycerate at concentrations close {{to those found in}} photosynthesizing chloroplasts. Countercurrent phase partitioning experiments indicate that the pea chloroplastic phosphoriboisomerase interacts physically with phosphoribulokinase...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStructural {{genomics}} is a {{new approach}} in functional assignment of proteins identified via whole-genome sequencing programs. Its rationale is that nonhomologous proteins performing similar or related biological functions might have similar tertiary structure. We used dye <b>pseudoaffinity</b> <b>chromatography,</b> two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry to identify two novel Escherichia coli nucleotide-binding proteins, YnaF and YajQ. YnaF exhibited significant sequence identity with MJ 0577, an ATP-binding protein from a hyperthermophile (Methanococcus jannaschii), and with UspA, a protein from Haemophilus influenzae that belongs to the Universal Stress Protein family. YnaF conserves the ATP-binding site and the dimeric structure observed in the crystal of MJ 0577. The protein YajQ, present in many bacterial genomes, is missing in eukaryotes. In the absence of significant similarities of YajQ to any solved structure, we determined its structural and ligand-binding properties by NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry. We demonstrate that YajQ is composed of two domains, each centered on a beta-sheet, that are connected by two helical segments. NMR studies, corroborated with local sequence conservation among YajQ homologs in various bacteria, indicate {{that one of the}} beta-sheets is mostly involved in biological activity...|$|E
