40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with <b>patch</b> {{angioplasty}} produces greater results {{than with}} primary closure; however, there remains uncertainty on the optimal <b>patch</b> material in CEA. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) {{was performed to}} evaluate the effect of angioplasty using venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material, and Dacron <b>patch</b> versus polytetrafluoroethelene (PTFE) <b>patch</b> material during CEA. METHODS: A multiple electronic health database screening was performed including the Cochrane library, Pubmed, Ovid, EMBASE and Google Scholar on all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before November 2012 that compared the outcomes of patients undergoing CEA with venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch.</b> RCTs were included if they compared carotid <b>patch</b> angioplasty with autologus venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material, or compared one type of synthetic <b>patch</b> with another. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs were identified. Ten trials, involving 1946 CEAs, compared venous <b>patch</b> with synthetic <b>patch</b> materials. Two trials, involving 400 CEAs in 380 patients, compared Dacron <b>patch</b> with PTFE <b>patch.</b> The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE <b>patch</b> was significantly longer than with venous <b>patch</b> (P 0. 05). One RCT of 95 CEAs in 92 patients compared bovine pericardium with Dacron <b>patch,</b> and demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in intraoperative suture line bleeding with bovine pericardium compared with Dacron <b>patch</b> (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE <b>patch</b> was longer than with venous <b>patch</b> or Dacron <b>patch.</b> The overall perioperative and long-term mortality rate, stroke rate, restenosis, and operative time were similar when using venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material or Dacron <b>patch</b> versus PTFE <b>patch</b> material during CEA.

The field study shows that nature favors D. biarmipes males with <b>patch.</b> Although males without <b>patch</b> mated, males with <b>patch</b> have higher mating success suggesting the role of wing <b>patch</b> during courtship. Further, among mating males, males with <b>patch</b> had longer wings than males without <b>patch.</b> During courtship, males with <b>patch</b> oriented and mated faster; performed courtship acts such as tapping, scissoring, vibration, licking and twist dance more times than males without <b>patch</b> in both competitive and non-competitive situations.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Patching</b> and {{transition}} <b>patching</b> are two techniques proposed to build efficient video-on-demand (VoD) systems. <b>Patching</b> works by allowing a client to playback video {{data from a}} <b>patching</b> stream while caching video data from another multicast video stream for later playback. The <b>patching</b> stream can be released once video playback reaches {{the point where the}} cached data begins, and playback continues via the cache and the shared multicast channel {{for the rest of the}} session. Transition <b>patching</b> takes this <b>patching</b> technique one step further by allowing a new client to cache video data not only from a full-length multicast channel, but also from a nearby in-progress <b>patching</b> channel as well to further reduce resource consumption. This study further generalizes these <b>patching</b> techniques into a recursive <b>patching</b> scheme where a new client can cache video data recursively from multiple <b>patching</b> streams to further reduce resource consumption. This recursive <b>patching</b> scheme unifies the existing <b>patching</b> schemes as special cases. Simulation results show that it can achieve significant reductions (e. g. 60 %~ 80 %) in startup latency at the same load and with the same system resources. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We have {{designed}} two <b>patch</b> antennas namely rectangular and circular (FEKO {{is used as}} simulation tool).

Rectangular <b>patch</b> antenna resonates at 2. 44 GHz for multiwalled CNT and 2. 46 GHz for Carbon and Graphene <b>patch</b> antennas. Simulations results are obtained and compared to analyse the performance of rectangular <b>patch</b> antenna when different <b>patch</b> materials are used. Similar procedure is repeated for Circular <b>Patch</b> Antenna and also for freq 5. 8 GHz. By analyzing all the simulated results, it is concluded that Graphene <b>patch</b> antennas show overall excellent performance (by virtue of having higher electrical conductivity) as compared to SWCNT, MWCNT and Copper <b>patch</b> antennas. Copper <b>patch</b> antennas also have good simulated results and performance is slightly less good as compared to Graphene. The reason is that Graphene has slightly higher conductivity than Copper...|$|R
