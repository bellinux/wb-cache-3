Failure to engage the public early in the process can derail implementation of effective solutions to traffic problems. Transportation professionals must focus on communicating with the public using traditional tools such as surveys, handouts and <b>public</b> <b>information</b> mmtings where computer graphics and video tape are presented. However, in today’s era of budget cuts and downsizing, funds are not always readily available to implement an effective public involvement program. This paper presents {{a case study of}} an effective public involvement program in Mtilson, Wisconsin for a four lane undivided collector street which serves adjacent neighborhoods and is also a major route to the downtown area. High traffic volumes, speeding and absence of gaps for pedestrians and vehicles are prevalent along the corridor.

The main result of this paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for welfare to increase with <b>public</b> <b>information.</b> Using it, we show that costs of information acquisition are linear if and only if welfare necessarily increases with <b>public</b> <b>information.</b> Thus, welfare can decrease with <b>public</b> <b>information</b> for any strictly convex costs.
