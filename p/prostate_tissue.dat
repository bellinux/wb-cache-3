25|$|PSA {{levels are}} {{monitored}} periodically (e.g., every 6–36 months) after treatment {{for prostate cancer}} - more frequently in patients with high-risk disease, less frequently in patients with lower-risk disease. If surgical therapy (i.e., radical prostatectomy) is successful at removing all <b>prostate</b> <b>tissue</b> (and prostate cancer), PSA becomes undetectable within a few weeks. A subsequent rise in PSA level above 0.2nbsp&ng/mL L is generally regarded as evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy; less commonly, it may simply indicate residual benign <b>prostate</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that estrogen may play a role in the cause of BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the <b>prostate</b> <b>tissue</b> rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself. In canine in vivo studies castration, which significantly reduced androgen levels but left estrogen levels unchanged, caused significant atrophy of the prostate. Studies looking for a correlation between prostatic hyperplasia and serum estrogen levels in humans have generally shown none.|$|E
25|$|HIFU for {{prostate}} cancer utilizes ultrasound to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the <b>prostate</b> <b>tissue,</b> thus destroying the cancerous cells. In essence, ultrasonic waves are focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer, with minimal risks of affecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at {{the focal point of}} the sound waves can exceed 100 °C (212 °F). However, many studies of HIFU were performed by manufacturers of HIFU devices, or members of manufacturers' advisory panels.|$|E
40|$|Cytogenetic and {{molecular}} {{studies have suggested}} that deletion or rearrangement of sequences that map to the short arm of chromosome 8 may be permissive for tumorigenesis in several organ systems, and in human prostate tumors in particular. In this study, we hypothesized that genes deleted for one copy and localized to the 8 p chromosomal region may be transcriptionally down-regulated or ablated in affected human <b>prostate</b> tumor <b>tissues.</b> To test this hypothesis, we used cDNA microarray analysis to determine the transcriptional profiles for 259 transcribed sequences mapping to the 8 p chromosomal region for seven human prostate tumor xenografts, completely characterized for numerical and structural alterations on chromosome 8, and five normal human <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues.</b> These experiments identified 33 genes differentially expressed between normal and malignant <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues,</b> the majority of which (28 / 33, 85 %) were transcriptionally down-regulated in malignant compared to normal human <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues.</b> These findings, that haploinsufficiency and transcriptional down-regulation for genes mapping to 8 p are largely coincident in human prostate tumors, should provide a powerful tool for the identification of tumor-suppressor genes associated with human prostate cancer initiation and progression. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

25|$|The surgery {{most often}} used in such cases is called {{transurethral}} resection of the prostate (TURP or TUR). In TURP, an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove <b>prostate</b> <b>tissue</b> that is pressing against {{the upper part of}} the urethra and restricting the flow of urine. TURP results in the removal of mostly transitional zone tissue in a patient with BPH. Older men often have corpora amylacea (amyloid), dense accumulations of calcified proteinaceous material, in the ducts of their prostates. The corpora amylacea may obstruct the lumens of the prostatic ducts, and may underlie some cases of BPH.|$|E
25|$|After a {{prostate}} biopsy, a pathologist {{looks at}} the samples under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the grade of the tumor. The grade tells how much the tumor tissue differs from normal <b>prostate</b> <b>tissue</b> and suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The Gleason system is used to grade prostate tumors from 2 to 10, where a Gleason score of 10 indicates the most abnormalities. The pathologist assigns a number from 1 to 5 for the most common pattern observed under the microscope, then does {{the same for the}} second-most-common pattern. The sum of these two numbers is the Gleason score. The Whitmore-Jewett stage is another method sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{classified}} as an adenocarcinoma, or glandular cancer, that begins when normal semen-secreting prostate gland cells mutate into cancer cells. The region of prostate gland where the adenocarcinoma is most common is the peripheral zone. Initially, small clumps of cancer cells remain confined to otherwise normal prostate glands, a condition known as carcinoma in situ or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Although {{there is no proof}} that PIN is a cancer precursor, it is closely associated with cancer. Over time, these cancer cells begin to multiply and spread to the surrounding <b>prostate</b> <b>tissue</b> (the stroma) forming a tumor. Eventually, the tumor may grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the seminal vesicles or the rectum, or the tumor cells may develop the ability to travel in the bloodstream and lymphatic system. Prostate cancer is considered a malignant tumor because it is a mass of cells that can invade other parts of the body. This invasion of other organs is called metastasis. Prostate cancer most commonly metastasizes to the bones, lymph nodes, and may invade rectum, bladder and lower ureters after local progression. The route of metastasis to bone is thought to be venous as the prostatic venous plexus draining the prostate connects with the vertebral veins.|$|E

Genome hypermethylation has been proposed as a critical mechanism in human malignancies. However, whole-genome quantification of DNA methylation of human malignancies has rarely been investigated, and the significance of the genome distribution of CpG methylation is unclear. We performed whole-genome methylation sequencing to investigate the methylation profiles of 13 prostate samples: 5 prostate cancers, 4 matched benign <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> adjacent to tumor, and 4 age-matched organ-donor <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues.</b> Alterations of methylation patterns occurred in prostate cancer and in benign <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> adjacent to tumor, in comparison with age-matched organ-donor prostates. More than 95 % alterations of genome methylation occurred in sequences outside CpG islands. Only a small fraction of the methylated CpG islands had any effect on RNA expression. Both intragene and promoter CpG island methylations negatively affected gene expression. However, suppressions of RNA expression did not correlate with levels of CpG island methylation, suggesting that CpG island methylation alone might not be sufficient to shut down gene expression. Motif analysis revealed a consensus sequence containing Sp 1 binding motif significantly enriched in the effective CpG islands...|$|R

Our {{study was designed to}} assess global methylation levels of histone 4 lysine 20 (H 4 K 20 me 1 - 3) at different stages of prostate cancer (PCA) carcinogenesis. Methods Global H 4 K 20 methylation levels were evaluated using a tissue microarray in patients with clinically localized PCA (n = 113), non-malignant prostate disease (n = 27), metastatic hormone-naive PCA (mPCA, n = 30) and castration-resistant PCA (CRPC, n = 34). Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess global levels of H 4 K 20 methylation levels. Results Similar proportions of the normal, PCA, and mPCA <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> showed strong H 4 K 20 me 3 staining. CRPC tissue analysis showed the weakest immunostaining levels of H 4 K 20 me 1 and H 4 K 20 me 2, compared to other <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues.</b> H 4 K 20 me 2 methylation levels indicated significant differences in examined tissues except for normal <b>prostate</b> versus PCA <b>tissue.</b> H 4 K 20 me 1 differentiates CRPC from other <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues.</b> H 4 K 20 me 1 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastases, and H 4 K 20 me 2 showed a significant correlation with the Gleason score.

40|$|Manipulations {{capable of}} {{breaking}} host tolerance to induce tissue-specific T cell-mediated inflammation are of central importance to tumor immunotherapy and {{our understanding of}} autoimmunity.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{inflammation}} {{has been}} suggested to favour prostate cancer (PCA) development. Interleukins (IL) represent essential inflammation mediators. IL- 2, IL- 7, IL- 15 and IL- 21, sharing a common receptor γ chain (c-γ), control T lymphocyte homeostasis and proliferation and play major roles in regulating cancer-immune system interactions. We evaluated local IL- 2, IL- 7, IL- 15 and IL- 21 gene expression in <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> from patients with early stage PCA or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As control, we used IL- 6 gene, encoding an IL involved in PCA progression. IL- 6, IL- 7 and IL- 15 titres were also measured in patients' sera. Methods Eighty patients with BPH and 79 with early (1 to 2 c) stage PCA were enrolled. Gene expression in <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Serum IL concentrations and acute phase protein titres were evaluated by ELISA. Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and χ 2 tests were used to compare IL gene expression and serum titers {{in the two groups}} of patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the possibility to distinguish sera from different groups of patients based on IL titers. Results IL- 2 and IL- 21 gene expression was comparably detectable, with low frequency and at low extents, in PCA and BPH tissues.

40|$|Background: Treatment with buceng {{combination}} of Eurycoma longifolia Jack and Pimpinella alpine Molk {{has been proven}} to increase testosterone level, decrease apoptosis and caspase 3 expression. Bcl 2 is an antiapoptotic protein found in cytoplasm which inhibits cells apoptosis. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of buceng on Bcl 2 expression on penile and <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> of the rats. Methods: In this experimental study, 24 male Sprague Dawley rats of 90 days old, weighing ± 300 grams, were randomly assigned into four groups. Group A, normal rats. Group B, castrated rats and treated with buceng 100 mg/day, per oral (Cast-Bcg); Group C, castrated rats and treated with 2 ml of water as placebo against buceng (Cast-Plac). Group D, castrated rats, treated with mesterolone 6. 75 mg/day, per oral, as exogenous testosterone (Cast-Mest). All rats were treated for 30 days. Manova {{test was used to}} analyze the different expression of Bcl 2 among groups with significance level at p ≤ 0. 05. Results: Castration was associated with significant decrease of Bcl 2 expression in the penile and <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> (53. 0 and 50. 9 %, respectively) compared to normal rats (82. 6 and 84. 2 %, respectively, p < 0. 001). Treatment with mesterolone reversed Bcl 2 expression (77. 1 and 78. 1 %) to a near normal level. The same level of Bcl 2 expression was also observed with buceng treatment (73. 8 and 78. 2 %).

40|$|Background: Cannabinoid {{receptor}} subtype 1 (CB 1) has {{a relationship}} to the proliferation of various cells including malignant tumoral cells. We investigated and compared the expression of CB 1 in benign and malignant human <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> and in benign and malignant human prostate cell lines, {{as well as its}} function for the proliferation of human pros tate cancer cells. Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to compare its expressions in human <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues</b> (normal, benign hyperplasia, and cancer) and prostate cell lines (3 normal and 3 malignant). For localization of CB 1, immunofluorescent staining with rabbit anti-CB 1 polyclonal antibodies and tetramethyl isothiocyanate (TRITC) -labeled swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO) were used under fluorescence microscope. To further analyze whether cell death was induced by anandamide (non-selective agonist for CB 1 /CB 2) via a receptor dependent mechanism, the viability of DU 145 cells, which is known as androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell, was measured using MTT assay. Results: CB 1 mRNA was found to be expressed in the all 3 human <b>prostate</b> <b>tissues,</b> however, CB 1 protein was expressed in BPH and low grade malignant PC tissues, but not in high grade malignant PC tissues. CB 1 as for cell lines, the expression of CB 1 was low in malignant cell lines except for DU 145. Anandamide elicited cell death, which was significantly inhibited by AM 251 (selective antagonist for CB 1), indicating that cell death induced by anan damide in DU 145 cells was mediated by CB 1. Anandamide time-dependently elicits up-regulation of CB 1 in DU 145 cells. Conclusions: CB 1 may be an inhibitory regulator of androgen-insensitive human prostate cancer epithelial cell growth. </p...|$|R
