40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the work of}} an investigation of the effects of solder reflow process on the reliability of anisotropic conductive film (ACF) interconnection for flip-chip on flex (FCOF) applications. Experiments as well as computer modeling methods have been used. The results show that the contact resistance of ACF interconnections increases after the reflow and the magnitude of the increase is strongly correlated to the <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperature. In fact, nearly 40 percent of the joints are open when the <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperature is 260 °C, while there is no opening when the peak temperature is 210 °C. It is believed that the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the polymer particle and the adhesive matrix is the main cause of this contact degradation. To understand this phenomenon better, a three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element (FE) model of an ACF joint has been analyzed in order to predict the stress distribution in the conductive particles, adhesive matrix and metal pads during the reflow process. The stress level at the interface between the particle and its surrounding materials is significant and it is the highest at the interface between the particle and the adhesive matrix...|$|E

Due to European lead-free legislation which has been implemented since July 2006, electronic packaging industries have to switch to use in the lead-free soldering technology. This change has posed a number of challenges in terms of development of lead-free solders and compatible substrates. An increase of at least 20 - 50 degrees in the reflow temperature is a concern and substantial research is required to investigate a sustainable design of flexible circuit boards as carrier substrates. This paper investigates a number of design variables such as copper conductor width, type of substrate materials, effect of insulating materials, etc. Computer modeling has been used to investigate thermo-mechanical behavior, and reliability, of flexible substrates after they have been subjected to a lead- free solder processing.

40|$|Recently, the {{soldering}} of lead-free components with SnPb paste, or lead-free backward compatibility, {{is becoming}} a hot topic. One of the major challenges in backward compatibility assembly {{is the development of}} a right reflow profile for the soldering of SnAgCu Ball Grid Array (BGA) /Chip Scale Package (CSP) components with SnPb paste. If the SnAgCu reflow profile is used, the reflow temperature may be too high for other SnPb components in the same board during assembly according to the component rating per IPC/JEDEC J-STD- 020 C. In addition, the flux in SnPb solder paste may not function properly in such a high reflow temperature. On the other hand, if the SnPb reflow profile is used, SnAgCu solder ball may only partially melt. The incomplete mixing of the solder paste with the BGA/CSP ball raises serious reliability concern. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} the minimum <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> temperature that is able to achieve complete mixing of SnPb paste with leadfree components. This paper presents a method to estimate the liquidus temperature of mixed compositions when SnAgCu BGA/CSP components are soldered with SnPb paste. The liquidus temperature is the minimum <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> temperature able to achieve complete mixing of SnPb paste with lead-free components. It will be shown that the liquidus temperature depends on the Pb ratio in the mixed composition and the liquidus temperature is below 217 °C, which is the liquidus temperature of SnAg 3. OCuO. 5 solder. The liquidus temperatures of several experimental studies in literature are estimated and it is found that the estimated temperatures are consistent with experimental results. A user interface is designed using Visual Basic for Application in the Microsoft Excel environment to facilitate the estimation of the liquidus temperature. It is expected that the estimation of the mixed compositions liquidus temperature will be able to guide process engineers to develop a right reflow profile in backward compatibility assembly...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to establish an isolated, retrogradely perfused mouse heart preparation for the simultaneous measurement of left ventricular haemodynamics and of coronary flow (CF). Methods: Heart rate was controlled by right atrial pacing (480 beats min(- 1)) and heart temperature was kept constant. Accurate flow values of Results: The CF and maximum systolic pressure were well maintained over a 2 -h perfusion period, both showing a 10 % decline per hour. Sodium-nitroprusside (endothelium-independent) and adenosine (endothelium-dependent) increased CF relatively modest (30 - 50 % above baseline values). Short-term no-flow ischaemia caused a transient 40 - 50 % increase in CF on reperfusion. <b>Peak</b> <b>reflow</b> occurred approximately 15 s after start of reperfusion and flow returned to baseline during the following 1 - 2 min.

40|$|The recent {{push for}} lead free {{products}} is resulting in {{significant changes in}} packaging materials. Manufacturers of electronic equipment are requiring materials that consistently withstand <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperatures of 240 ?C to 260 °C. Reflow soldering at these ext reme temperatures, especially after extended moisture exposure, introduces several challenges that must be solved to produce reliable products. Plastic packages use various organic compounds for molding and die attach that have formulations consisting of an epoxy resin, filler particles and other additives. The epoxy resin in equilibrium with the ambient atmosphere absorbs {{a small percentage of}} moisture, which turns into saturated steam during the printed circuit board reflow process. The extreme pressure from the steam and the drop in flexural strength of the mold comp ound and die attach materials can result in catastrophic failures of the packages. Typical failure modes of packages include encapsulant cracking, substrate cracking, severe package deformation, and delamination of one or more material interfaces. The problem is further exacerbated by the use of very large dies, which are typical of Altera devices. In this paper, we will discuss some of the modifications necessary to meet product reliability and usability requirements for lead free products.

40|$|Lead-free {{soldering}} {{technology is}} still in its infancy with technical and cost issues posing major challenges for the industry. It is expected that soldering in a nitrogen atmosphere might overcome some of the technical barriers and provide soldered products comparable to those using conventional lead-containing materials processed in air. But quantitative data regarding the soldering behaviour of lead-free solders under various atmospheres are sparse. As part of an ongoing study on the effects of inerting on the solderability of lead-free alloys an examination has been made of the solderability, as measured in a wetting balance, of three common board finishes using a 95. 5 / 3. 8 / 0. 7 SnAgCu solder. The board finishes used were ENIG, HASL, immersion silver and a copper OSP. To simulate typical lead-free soldering cycles the samples were subjected to multiple temperature cycles in a convection reflow oven before solderability testing using a Multicore MUST II tester. A <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperature of 250 °C and an R flux was used for the ENIG and Ag finishes. The OSP finish performed poorly under these conditions and OSP testing was done using a 235 °C peak temperature and a 0. 5 % activated R flux. During testing the atmospheres were controlled at levels of oxygen of 21 % (air), 10, 000, 1000 and 100 ppm. Although inerting improved the solderability of all three finishes, there were differences between the individual alloys. Aging by multiple reflow cycles adversely affected the solderability of all finishes but the effects were less for ENIG than the other finishes...|$|E

A general purpose finite element software was used to develop a two-dimensional plane strain model of the composite material. FE simulation of transient moisture absorption was performed to predict the distribution of wetness fraction in the material after pre-conditioning at an 85 °C/ 85 %RH environment for 15 days. FE simulation of transient moisture desorption was carried out at the <b>peak</b> solder <b>reflow</b> temperature of 215 °C to predict new distribution of wetness fraction in the material.

The moisture concentration in the area close to the FR 4 -copper interface below the longer copper trace increases during the solder reflow. The magnitude of the vapor pressure in 70 % of the FR 4 and near the FR 4 -copper interface below the lower copper trace is closed to the saturation pressure of water vapor at 215 °C.

The thermal induced shear stress in the flex substrate during the lead-free reflow process was studied and the effect of the design changes including the track thickness, flex thickness, and copper width were studied. For both types of flexes, the one of most important variables for minimizing damage to the substrate is the height of the copper tracks. The height of flex and the width of copper track show less impact. Beside of the geometry effects, the increase in <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> temperature can also result in {{a significant increase in the}} interfacial stress between the copper track and flex.

40|$|The melting {{temperatures}} of most lead-free solder alloys are somewhat {{higher than that}} of eutectic Sn/Pb solder, and many of the alloys tend to wet typical contact pads less readily. This tends to narrow down the fluxing and mass reflow process windows for assembly onto typical organic substrates and may enhance requirements on placement accuracy. Flip chip assembly here poses some unique challenges. The small dimensions provide for particular sensitivities to wetting and solder joint collapse, and underfilling does not reduce the demands on the intermetallic bond strength. Rather, the need to underfill lead to additional concerns in terms of underfill process control and reliability. Relatively little can here be learned from work on regular SMT components, BGAs or CSPs. The present paper addresses the effects of reflow profile, pad metallurgy, and amount of flux on the assembly of flip chips with lead-free solder bumps onto organic substrates. Special attention was paid to the 85. 9 Sn/ 3. 1 Ag/ 10 In/ 1. 0 Cu alloy, which has a relatively low melting point of 197 oC. Good wetting and a robust collapse could, however, not be achieved with flip chip relevant no-clean fluxes developed for eutectic Sn/Pb, even with <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperatures approaching 250 oC. In fact, both 95. 5 Sn/ 3. 5 Ag/ 1. 0 Cu and 95 Sn/ 5 Sb were seen to perform much better at such temperatures.

Although PBGA packages have many advantages such as {{a larger number of}} I/Os, robust assembly process, and better thermal / electrical performance, their board level reliability is still a major concern. This is because their solder joints have a relatively short stand-off height especially for the Chip Scale Package (CSP). It is a global trend to replace today's harmful lead-containing solders with lead-free solders in future electronic products. Although there are various lead-free solder systems available in the industry, people are still unsure over the selection of lead-free solders {{due to the lack of}} reliability data. When implementing such a large change in a material system, the effect on the reliability is always the first concern, especially at the board level. The implementation of the lead-free solders is a challenging process. It involves lots of study of process control and reliability for the board level interconnects. This brings out the value of the current study on the experimental evaluation of board level solder joint reliability of plastic ball grid array assemblies with eutectic lead-tin and lead-free solders. Four different reliability tests, namely the accelerated temperature cycling test, three point bending test, random vibration test, and the mechanical drop test were performed to evaluate the reliability of the lead-free board level solder joint. Five DOE testing programs including four lead-free systems with different combinations of solder materials and <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperatures together with one conventional lead-tin eutectic were arranged for the PBGA samples. In the present study, it is found that the selected lead-free solder candidates had better performances than the eutectic lead-tin solder when subjected to the thermal fatigue load. However, the four lead-free solder systems had poorer performances than the eutectic lead-tin solder when subjected to the mechanical loads. The effect of solder joint size on board level reliability was found in CSP samples. The failure mechanisms of various lead-free solders subjected to different kinds of loading were studied. The failure modes were inspected. The locations that are critical to solder joint reliability were identified.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to understand the failure modes and mechanisms of adhesive materials used to flip-chip bond a silicon die onto a polyimide substrate. The bonding material investigated in {{this research}} is called Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF). This is a promising interconnection material and has gained extensive interest in the electronics packaging industry. Both the experimental and finite element analysis (FEA) methods were used in order to investigate the behaviour of the ACF materials when subjected to certain manufacturing and environmental testing conditions. The manufacturing condition investigated was a subsequent solder reflow process on an ACF flip-chip bonded device. The environmental testing condition investigated was the moisture test. For the manufacturing condition, both experimental and modelling results demonstrate the impact of a subsequent reflow process on the behaviour of the ACF joint. Typical failures observed after this process were cracks at the pad/particle interface. This failure mode was more sever with a higher <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperature. This was also found using FEA where high tensile stresses were predicted in these regions. FEA modelling was also used to help identify the mechanisms leading to these failures. This is primarily due to the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) miss-match in the materials and the elastic/plastic deformation behaviour of the conductive particle. Important design variables that can minimise these failures are the Young’s Modulus and CTE of the adhesive and the height of the hump on the die. For the environmental testing condition, an autoclave test at 121 °C, 100 %RH and pressure of 2 atm was used. More than 85 % of the ACF joints failed during the first 24 hours of testing. The failure mode observed was cracking along the interface between the adhesive and substrate and pad. A macro-micro modelling approach was used to help identify the mechanisms leading to these failures. It was found that most of the damage is caused by moisture diffusion and associated swelling. Important design variables that will help minimise this mode of failure are: Coefficient of Moisture Expansion (CME) and Young’s Modulus of the adhesive and the height of the bump on the die.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>reflow</b> time, <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> temperature, thermal shock and thermal aging on the intermetallic compound (IMC) thickness for Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) soldered joints. Design/methodology/approach – A four-factor factorial design with three replications is selected in the experiment. The input variables are the peak temperature, the duration of time above solder liquidus temperature (TAL), solder alloy and thermal shock. The peak temperature has three levels, 12, 22 and 32 °C above solder liquidus temperatures (or 230, 240 and 250 °C for SAC 305 and 195, 205, and 215 °C for SnPb). The TAL has two levels, 30 and 90 s. The thermally shocked test vehicles are subjected to air-to-air thermal shock conditioning from - 40 to 125 °C with 30 min dwell times (or 1 h/cycle) for 500 cycles. Samples both from the initial time zero and after thermal shock are cross-sectioned. The IMC thickness is measured using scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analyses are conducted to compare the difference in IMC thickness growth between SAC 305 solder joints and SnPb solder joints, and the difference in IMC thickness growth between after thermal shock and after thermal aging. Findings – The IMC thickness increases with higher <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> temperature and longer time above liquidus. The IMC layer of SAC 305 soldered joints is statistically significantly thicker than that of SnPb soldered joints when <b>reflowed</b> at comparable <b>peak</b> temperatures above liquidus and the same time above liquidus. Thermal conditioning leads to a smoother and thicker IMC layer. Thermal shock contributes to IMC growth merely through high-temperature conditioning. The IMC thickness increases in SAC 305 soldered joints after thermal shock or thermal aging are generally in agreement with prediction models such as that proposed by Hwang. Research limitations/implications – It is still unknown which thickness of IMC layer could result in damage to the solder. Practical implications – The IMC thickness of all samples is below 3 µm for both SnPb and SAC 305 solder joints <b>reflowed</b> at the <b>peak</b> temperature ranging from 12 to 32 °C above liquidus temperature and at times above liquidus ranging from 30 to 90 s. The IMC thickness is below 4 µm after subjecting to air-to-air thermal shock from - 40 to 125 °C with 30 min dwell time for 500 cycles or thermal aging at 125 °C for 250 h. Originality/value – The paper reports experimental results of IMC thickness at different thermal conditions.

40|$|As the {{traditional}} eutectic SnPb solder alloy has been outlawed, the electronic industry has almost completely transitioned to the lead-free solder alloys. The conventional SAC 305 solder alloy used in lead-free electronic assembly {{has a high}} melting and processing temperature with a typical <b>peak</b> <b>reflow</b> temperature of 245 ᵒC which is almost 30 ᵒC higher than traditional eutectic SnPb reflow profile. Some of the drawbacks of this high melting and processing temperatures are yield loss due to component warpage which {{has an impact on}} solder joint formation like bridging, open defects, head on pillow, and other drawbacks which include circuit board degradation, economic and environmental factors, and brittle failure defects in the circuit board like pad cratering. To overcome this, a detailed study has been carried out on low temperature lead-free solder paste that utilizes Bi bearing alloys. Three low temperature lead-free solder pastes, Sn- 58 Bi, Sn- 57 Bi- 1 Ag and Sn- 40 Bi-Cu-Ni with the melting temperatures of 138 ᵒC (which is 45 ᵒC below eutectic SnPb and 79 ᵒC below SAC) were printed on Cu-OSP finish test boards. These pastes were then assembled with SAC 305, Sn 99 CN and Sn 100 C solder spheres. The range of Bi concentrations for various mixtures used in this study was calculated to be in the range of 2 to 4 wt%. The mixtures were reflowed under two different low temperatures reflow profiles; (a) a traditional SnPb profile with a peak temperature 217 ᵒC and (b) a low temperature SnBi profile with a peak temperature 177 ᵒC (recommended by the paste manufacturer). After the assembly process, the mixed solder joints were shear tested to study the failure modes and shear strength at rate of 27. 50 mils/sec. Cross sectioning was performed to evaluate the possible microstructural changes at room temperature and after aging conditions that may have led to the changes in failure mode observed in shear testing. The isothermal aging condition used in the study is 125 ᵒC for 200 hours, which mimics 21 years of field storage at 25 ᵒC degrees using Arrhenius extrapolation for Cu 6 Sn 5 intermetallic formation. Our study suggests that high temperature reflow profile (217 ᵒC peak profile) had better mechanical strength than the low temperature reflow profile (177 ᵒC peak profile). A metallurgical explanation for the improvement is presented in this paper. Thus, this paper describes that by generating a robust reflow assembly process for SnBi solder paste, the shear strength can be increased, cost of manufacturing can be reduced and high temperature assembly process (SAC) issues can be minimized which may improve product yield in production...|$|E

Moisture turning to steam {{is not the}} only vapor released from plastics during solder reflow. With the push towards lead-free and higher reflow temperatures, the identity and the understanding of these volatiles would be of interest so as to improve manufacturing yields. Some of the vapors evolved during eutectic and lead-free solder reflow profiles of mold compounds are identified in this paper. At eutectic <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> temperatures of 220 °C, Epoxy Novolac mold compounds will release gases like carbon dioxide, moisture, methyl alcohol, benzene, isobutyl methyl ketone as the residue solvent, triphenyl phosphine and N,N-dimethyl benzenemethanamine from the catalyst, and sometimes siloxanes from stress releasing agent. Some of the more dominant vapors include triphenyl phosphine(TPP) and triphenyl phosphine oxide(TPPO), water and methyl alcohol. Also, it was found that temperature ramping rates affected the rate of gases released. There was not a substantial difference in the composition of gases released for mold compounds between eutectic solder reflow temperatures and for the higher temperature of 260 °C for lead-free reflow. As expected, much less gas was released if the mold compounds were postmold cured for 4 hours.

Lead has been an indispensable element in solders due to its high ductility, reasonable mechanical strength, low eutectic melting temperature with tin, low surface tension and low cost. Lead-free soldering requirements are an earthquake to the lead infrastructure that has been evolving for several decades. Within the past few years, the relationship among components, alloys and fluxes has already reshuffled. Although the dust has not settled, a picture of this new relationship is emerging. Changes in alloys not only directly impact components and fluxes, but also the relationship between components and fluxes, which in turn impacts the alloys. Alloys vs. Components High temperature stability. Perhaps the biggest impact on components is the requirement of higher thermal stability. With mainstream solder for SMT changing from eutectic SnPb to higher melting temperature systems such as eutectic SnAgCu (217 °C), eutectic SnAg (221 °C) or eutectic SnCu (227 °C), the soldering temperature inevitably has to be raised, with a consequent increase for component thermal stability. As reflected in IPC/JEDEC J-STD- 020 C, with an increase in melting temperature to 217 °C from 183 °C, the thermal stability requirement rises about 20 °C.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper focuses on the effect of reflow process on the contact resistance and reliability of anisotropic conductive film (ACF) interconnection. The contact resistance of ACF interconnection increases after reflow process due to the decrease in contact area of the conducting particles between the mating I/O pads. However, the relationship between the contact resistance and bonding parameters of the ACF interconnection with reflow treatment follows the similar trend to that of the as-bonded (i. e. without reflow) ACF interconnection. The contact resistance increases as the <b>peak</b> temperature of <b>reflow</b> profile increases. Nearly 40 % of the joints were found to be open after reflow with 260 °C peak temperature. During the reflow process, the entrapped (between the chip and substrate) adhesive matrix tries to expand much more than the tiny conductive particles because of the higher coefficient of thermal expansion, the induced thermal stress will try to lift the bump from the pad and decrease the contact area of the conductive path and eventually, leading to a complete loss of electrical contact. In addition, the environmental effect on contact resistance such as high temperature/humidity aging test was also investigated. Compared with the ACF interconnections with Ni/Au bump, higher thermal stress in the Z-direction is accumulated in the ACF interconnections with Au bump during the reflow process owing to the higher bump height, thus greater loss of contact area between the particles and I/O pads leads to an increase of contact resistance and poorer reliability after reflow...|$|R

The use of lead free solders has caused a significant rise in the reflow temperatures of packages and has therefore prompted the need for hightemperature overmold compounds. The high temperature capabilities of several overmold compounds {{that could be used to}} encapsulate laminate based modules were evaluated. Five overmold compounds were subjected to conditions specified for MSL 3 with a <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> temperature of 260 C. Three of the five overmold compounds that provided positive results were subjected to the more aggressive stress test of MSL 2 a at 260 C. Comparison of pre and post stress electrical tests to determine the change in electrical parameters, and comparison of pre and post stress sonoscan images to determine the change in percent delamination were used to judge the performance of the overmold compounds. Failure analysis was also performed on the modules to look for evidence of solder mask delamination and/or solder extrusion...|$|R
40|$|Purpose –The {{purpose of}} this work is to study {{the effect of the}} <b>reflow</b> <b>peak</b> {{temperature}} and time above liquidus on both SnPb and SnAgCu solder joint shear strength. Design/methodology/approach –Nine reflow profiles for Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu and nine reflow profiles for Sn 37 Pb have been developed with three levels of peak temperature (230 °C, 240 °C, and 250 °C for Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu; and 195 °C, 205 °C, and 215 °C for Sn 37 Pb) and three levels of time above solder liquidus temperature (30, 60, and 90 [*]s). The shear force data of four different sizes of chip resistors (1206, 0805, 0603, and 0402) are compared across the different profiles. The shear forces for the resistors were measured after assembly. The fracture interfaces were inspected using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy {{in order to determine the}} failure mode and failure surface morphology. Findings –The results show that the effects of the peak temperature and the time above solder liquidus temperature are not consistent between different component sizes and between Sn 37 Pb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder. The shear force of SnPb solder joints is higher than that of Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder joints because the wetting of SnPb is better than that of SnAgCu. Research limitations/implications –This study finds that fracture occurred partially in the termination metallization and partially in the bulk solder joint. To eliminate the effect of the termination metallization, future research is recommended to conduct the same study on solder joints without component attachment. Practical implications –The shear strength of both SnPb and SnAgCu solder joints is equal to or higher than that of the termination metallization for the components tested. Originality/value – Fracture was observed to occur partially in the termination metallization (Ag layer) and partially in the bulk solder joint. Therefore, it is essential to inspect the fracture interfaces when comparing solder joint shear strength...|$|R
