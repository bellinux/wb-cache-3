25|$|The <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> is an {{essential}} component of Stevens technique. With this stroke, the mallets start in the up position, strike the bars, then return to the up position. The mallets are propelled completely by the wrist, and there is no prep stroke. When changing notes, the <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> is modified so that it starts above the first note and ends above the second note, ready to strike.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} {{striking}} the bars {{is designed for}} accuracy and momentum efficiency, since it attempts to eliminate all wasted motion. The <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> consolidates the preparation for each stroke into {{the recovery of the}} previous stroke.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{the members}} of the J-6 Whirlwind family, the R-760 had larger {{cylinders}} than the R-790. The <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> of 5.5in (14.0cm) was unchanged, but the cylinder bore was expanded to 5.0in (12.7cm) from the R-790's bore of 4.5in (11.4cm). While the R-790 was naturally aspirated, the R-760, like the other J-6 engines, had a gear-driven supercharger to boost its power output.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Otto {{developed}} a gaseous fuel, compressed charge four-stroke cycle, (also {{known as the}} Otto Cycle) engine after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four <b>piston</b> <b>strokes</b> (intake, compression, power, and exhaust). Otto intended that his invention would replace the steam engines predominant in those years, even though his engine was still primitive and inefficient.|$|R
50|$|In 1802, Trevithick {{took out}} a patent for his {{high-pressure}} steam engine. To prove his ideas, he built a stationary engine at the Coalbrookdale Company's works in Shropshire in 1802, forcing water to a measured height to measure the work done. The engine ran at forty <b>piston</b> <b>strokes</b> a minute, with an unprecedented boiler pressure of 145 psi.|$|R
50|$|The {{strength}} of these engines {{is that all}} wheels, including, in some engines, those under the tender, are driven {{so that all the}} weight develops tractive effort. A high ratio of <b>piston</b> <b>strokes</b> to wheel revolutions allowed them to run at partial slip, where a conventional rod engine would spin its drive wheels and burn rails, losing all traction.|$|R
25|$|Another change {{affected}} the stroke, also a technique from the Arab, {{where it had}} been responsible for the engine's failure. A multi-cylinder V engine offers little length for connecting rods. Coatalen's usual solution was to use articulated connecting rods, where one rod runs on the crankshaft journal, but the other acts indirectly, through a journal on the other rod. The difficulty is that this gives a slightly different <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> for each bank, leading to unbalance and possible vibration problems, as for the Arab. Stroke was thus 135mm on one bank and 142mm on the other.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{amount of}} water needed for the dough depends on the final shape of the pasta. Long pastas should have less {{moisture}} content (and therefore less water) so {{they will be able}} to stretch during the extrusion. Short pastas need less moisture content due to rapid cutting. Various dosing systems are used to pump the water to the mixture. The most common ones are piston pumps in which the water flow rate is controlled by adjusting the <b>piston</b> <b>stroke,</b> screw feeder, and gear and lobe pumps where the speed of the rotation determines the water flow. In more advanced systems, electronic devices are used to regulate the water flow.|$|E
500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{compound}} systems and configurations, {{but we can}} define two basic types, according to how HP and LP <b>piston</b> <b>strokes</b> are phased and hence whether the HP exhaust is able to pass directly from HP to LP (Woolf compounds) or whether pressure fluctuation necessitates an intermediate [...] "buffer" [...] space {{in the form of}} a steam chest or pipe known as a receiver (receiver compounds).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} main {{crankshaft}} configurations for this engine: 360°, 180°, and 270°: [...] There are minor {{differences in the}} applications for four stroke and for two stroke engines, largely pertaining to ignition intervals. For example, the 360 twin is the natural configuration for a two-cylinder four-stroke engine, since four <b>piston</b> <b>strokes</b> add up to 720°. What follows below will mostly be concerned with four-stroke engines.|$|R
50|$|A {{four-stroke}} inline-five cannot {{have shared}} piston phases amongst its cylinders without also being uneven firing, because 720 degrees (4 <b>piston</b> <b>strokes)</b> divided by 5 is 144 {{which is not}} a divisor of 360, so it must always have five crankpin phases. In this way, the balance of an inline-five engine is especially and intrinsically linked to its firing order, and vice versa, in that they cannot be chosen separately.|$|R

50|$|Pumps used in {{high-pressure}} chromatography such as HPLC and {{ion chromatography}} are much like small piston metering pumps. For wear resistance and chemical resistance to solvents, etc., typically the pistons {{are made of}} artificial sapphire and the ball check valves have ruby balls and sapphire seats. To produce good chromatograms, it is desirable to have a pumping flow rate as constant as possible. Either a single piston pump with a quick refill is used or a double pump head with coordinated <b>piston</b> <b>strokes</b> is used to provide as constant a pumping rate as possible.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the shaft}} of the four <b>stroke</b> <b>piston</b> in the M4+2 engine always rotates {{twice as fast as}} {{the shaft of}} the two <b>stroke</b> <b>piston,</b> meaning the two stroke part always runs at half speed, both parts work in optimal {{conditions}} regarding fuel consumption at all times.
