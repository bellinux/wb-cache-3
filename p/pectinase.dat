30|$|<b>Pectinases,</b> {{also called}} pectinolytic enzymes, are {{a group of}} enzymes hydrolyzing pectin {{substrates}} in plant cell [1]. <b>Pectinases</b> {{are mainly composed of}} polygalacturonase (E.C. 3.2. 1.15), pectin lyase (E.C. 4.2. 2.10), pectate lyase (E.C. 4.2. 2.2), and pectinesterase (E.C. 3.1. 1.11) [2]. The main function of <b>pectinases</b> is to destroy plant tissue and cell wall structure to allow other depolymerases accession to enhance the productivity [3]. Nowadays, <b>pectinases</b> have been widely used in the fields of food, oils, flavors and pigments extraction, cellulose fibers preparation, coffee and tea fermentations, and oligogalacturonides production [4]. So, it is crucial to screen novel <b>pectinases</b> with remarkable characteristics from native environments [5, 6]. <b>Pectinases</b> are generally produced from bacteria, fungi, and plants; however, most of the commercial <b>pectinases</b> are from fungal sources [7], which optimal pH was between 3.0 and 5.5 [8]. Aspergillus species, especially Aspergillus niger, is most commonly used for commercial <b>pectinases</b> production [8 – 10], followed by Penicillium species [11 – 13]. <b>Pectinases</b> from bacteria are mainly alkaline with the optimal pH over 7.0 and mostly used in pulp and paper processing [14 – 16].

40|$|Abstract: <b>Pectinases</b> {{are one of}} the {{upcoming}} enzymes of fruit and textile industries. These enzymes break down complex polysaccharides of plant tissues into simpler molecules like galacturonic acids. The role of acidic <b>pectinases</b> in bringing down the cloudiness and bitterness of fruit juices is well established. Recently, there have been a good number of reports on the application of alkaline <b>pectinases</b> in the textile industry for the retting and degumming of fiber crops, production of good quality paper, fermentation of coffee and tea, oil extractions and treatment of pectic waste water. This review discusses various types of <b>Pectinases</b> and their applications in the commercial sector...|$|R

It is useful because pectin is the jelly-like matrix which helps cement plant cells together and in which other cell wall components, such as cellulose fibrils, are embedded. Therefore, <b>pectinase</b> enzymes are commonly used in processes involving the degradation of plant materials, such as speeding up the extraction of fruit juice from fruit, including apples and sapota. Pectinases have also been used in wine production since the 1960s. The function of <b>pectinase</b> in brewing is twofold, first it helps break down the plant (typically fruit) material and so helps the extraction of flavours from the mash. Secondly the presence of pectin in finished wine causes a haze or slight cloudiness. <b>Pectinase</b> is used to break this down and so clear the wine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pectinases</b> are a {{group of}} enzymes {{produced}} by bacteria, fungi, higher plants and animals. <b>Pectinases</b> can modify and degrade pectins, a class of heterogeneous and multifunctional polysaccharides present in middle lamellae and primary cell walls of plants. Pectins have been showed to play diverse roles in cell physiology, growth, adhesion and separation. <b>Pectinases</b> are used technically in the processing of fiber production and fruit juice or wine making. We have studied the mechanisms and applications of <b>pectinases,</b> especially in retting, a microbiological process where bast fibers in flax and other bast fiber cultivars are released {{from each other and}} from the woody core. A strong correlation was found between the ability to perform retting and the degradation of sparsely esterified pectin, a substrate of polygalacturonase. This led to the conclusion that polygalacturonase {{plays a key role in}} the enzymatic retting of flax. We purified and characterized an extracellular polygalacturonase produced by Rhizopus oryzae, a very potent retting organism. The purified enzyme which appeared to be the single active component in retting, has non-methylated polygalacturonan as its preferred substrate. Peptide sequences indicate that the enzyme, like another polygalacturonase (EC. 3. 2. 1. 15), belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 28. It contains, however, an N-terminal sequence absent from other fungal <b>pectinases,</b> but present in an enzyme from the phytopathogenic bacterium, Ralstonia solanacearum. Our finding that removal of calcium ions from the plant material by pre-incubation in dilute acid in enzymatic retting could reduce enzyme consumption by several orders of magnitude, improves the economical feasibility of the enzymatic retting process. Comparisons with different acids showed that the action was mainly pH dependent. <b>Pectinases</b> were employed as analytical tools in a study of stored wood discoloration and, together with cellulases, in a mechanical process for making pulp from flax and hemp in paper production...|$|R

All <b>pectinases</b> are classified, based on their function and substrate, in the family of glycoside hydrolase (GH), carbohydrate esterase (CE) or polysaccharide lyase (PL). Pectin degrading enzymes became important for industry due to the ability of clarifying wine and increasing juice production.

40|$|Efficient {{degradation}} of pectin in the rumen {{is necessary for}} plant-based feed utilization. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the diversity, abundance, and functions of <b>pectinases</b> from microorganisms in the sheep rumen. A total of 103 unique fragments of polygalacturonase (PF 00295) and pectate lyase (PF 00544 and PF 09492) genes were retrieved from microbial DNA in the rumen of a Small Tail Han sheep, and 66 % of the sequences of these fragments had low identities (< 65 %) with known sequences. Phylogenetic tree building separated the PF 00295, PF 00544, and PF 09492 sequences into five, three, and three clades, respectively. Cellulolytic and noncellulolytic Butyrivibrio, Prevotella, and Fibrobacter species were the major sources of the <b>pectinases.</b> The two most abundant pectate lyase genes were cloned, and their protein products, expressed in Escherichia coli, were characterized. Both enzymes probably act extracellularly as their nucleotide sequences contained signal sequences, and they had optimal activities at the ruminal physiological temperature and complementary pH-dependent activity profiles.

In addition, the presence of undesirable enzymatic activity in commercial <b>pectinases</b> may be detrimental to aroma because they are responsible for producing unpleasant volatile off flavour. There are many reports of fruit juice clarification by pectin lyases.|$|R
30|$|In literature, {{the optimum}} {{temperature}} of <b>pectinases</b> was mostly within the ranges of 30 – 50  °C. For instance, <b>pectinases</b> from A. niger reported by Kittur et al. showed the maximal activity at 47  °C [17]. Singh and Appu Rao [18] claimed that two endo-polygalacturonases from A. niger could achieve their maximal activities at 43 and 45  °C. A polygalacturonase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from marsh grape fruit pulp possessed the maximal activity at 45  °C [19].

40|$|Dispersed plant-based foods, such as soups, {{sauces and}} smoothies, {{represent}} {{a category of}} ready-to-eat foods which contain one or more fruit and/or vegetable sources. Owing to their convenience next to their perception as natural products, these foods may convince present-day consumers to a higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. In fruits and vegetables, the cell wall polysaccharide pectin is important for tissue structure. Different types of naturally-present pectin-modifying enzymes (i. e., <b>pectinases)</b> affect pectin nanostructure, changing the functional properties (i. e., texture, rheology) of fruit- and vegetable-based products. Among different fruit and vegetable sources, the differences in pectin structure and variation in endogenous <b>pectinases</b> offer opportunities for structuring plant-based foods. Additionally, thermal and high-pressure processing {{can be used as}} techniques for (selective) inactivation of the <b>pectinases.</b> In the context of food products comprising multiple fruit- and/or vegetable sources, this natural or process-modified variety of pectin and <b>pectinases</b> can fully be exploited using split-stream processing. Split-stream processing is a technique in which the individual ingredients, prior to being combined, are individually subjected to a sequence of specific unit operations directed to specific end-product functionalities. The present research work aimed at evaluating the potential of the split-stream processing concept for structuring dispersed plant-based foods consisting of multiple fruit and/or vegetable sources, targeting the individual pre-treatments of each of the raw materials at (selective) inactivation of <b>pectinases.</b> As the first step, the pectin structure was investigated for the selected raw materials (i. e., tomato, carrot and broccoli). Subsequently, the presence as well as the thermal and high-pressure stability of selected <b>pectinases</b> in tomato, carrot and broccoli purées was studied. The <b>pectinases</b> pectinmethylesterase, polygalacturonase, ß-D-galactosidase and alfa-L-arabinofuranosidase were selected. Pectinmethylesterase and polygalacturonase affect linear homogalacturonan, the most abundant pectin subdomain. Pectinmethylesterase demethoxylates homogalacturonan, changing the pectin degree of methoxylation while polygalacturonase depolymerizes homogalacturonan. ß-D-galactosidase and alfa-L-arabinofuranosidase degrade galactose- and arabinose-containing side chain structures of the pectin rhamnogalacturonan I subdomain, respectively. Finally, as a split-stream processing case-study, endogenous tomato <b>pectinases</b> were used to change the consistency of tomato-carrot purées. The pectin structure of tomato was clearly different from the pectin structures of broccoli and carrot. Tomato pectin showed, in comparison, the broadest range in degree of methoxylation, the highest molar mass, the highest overall linearity and the lowest extent of rhamnogalacturonan I branching. Unlike broccoli and carrot, tomato thus contains particularly long, linear pectin. Thermal and high-pressure inactivation data were obtained for pectinmethylesterase, ß-D-galactosidase andalfa-L-arabinofuranosidase in broccoli, carrot and tomato purées, and for polygalacturonase in tomato purée. These inactivation data allowed for the identification of processing conditions resulting in specific enzyme populations. By applying a thermal treatment to tomato purée, pectinmethylesterase and polygalacturonase catalytic activities could be largely maintained while ß-D-galactosidase was completely inactivated and alfa-L-arabinofuranosidase activity was largely reduced. High-pressure treatment of tomato purée allowed for selective inactivation of polygalacturonase, ß-D-galactosidase and alfa-L-arabinofuranosidase, resulting in an endogenous enzyme population exclusively comprising catalytically active pectinmethylesterase. In case of carrot purée, thermal treatment allowed to largely inactivate ß-D-galactosidase and alfa-L-arabinofuranosidase while pectinmethylesterase activity was mainly maintained. High-pressure treatment of carrot and broccoli purées could maintain high levels of pectinmethylesterase activity while reducing the ß-D-galactosidase and alfa-L-arabinofuranosidase activity levels considerably. For the split-stream processing case-study, raw tomatoes were used as source of <b>pectinases</b> while carrots were thermally pre-treated at two different intensities, i. e. blanching and cooking (both inactivating all endogenous <b>pectinases),</b> in order to obtain different levels of thermosolubilized pectin. After mechanical disintegration of tomato and carrot into tomato-carrot purées, stimulation of enzyme action at medium temperature level allowed tomato pectinmethylesterase and polygalacturonase action on both carrot and tomato pectin. Carrot pectin, when present in a purée mix of tomato and blanched carrot, was both solubilized and depolymerized by tomato polygalacturonase while mainly enzymatic depolymerization of the thermosolubilized carrot pectin was observed in the tomato-carrot purée containing cooked carrot. The final serum pectin properties were however similar for both types of tomato-carrot purée. Carrot contributed more to the consistency of the purée mix compared to tomato. Stimulating the catalytic activity of the tomato <b>pectinases</b> resulted in loss of this contribution, leading to a consistency reduction of the purée mix. This liquefaction of purée was larger for the tomato-carrot purée containing blanched instead of cooked carrots. Based on the obtained results, it is suggested that the liquefying effect is related to solubilization and degradation of pectin that is counteracted by a reduction in particle size. In this respect, the purée mix containing cooked carrot showed smaller particle sizes than the purée mix containing blanched carrot. The present work showed the potential of split-stream processing for structuring dispersed plant-based foods composed of multiple fruit and/or vegetable sources by the interaction of pectin and <b>pectinases</b> of selectively pre-processed streams of raw materials.

5000|$|According to Canadian Food and Drug Regulation, {{apple juice}} may contain a Class II preservative, vitamin C, amylase, {{cellulase}} and <b>pectinase.</b> 100ml of apple juice measured at 20°C should also contain {{a limited amount}} of ash between 0.24 gram and 0.60 gram, which contains at least 50 per cent of potassium carbonate. In addition, apple juice should have a specific gravity between 1.041 and 1.065 (20°C/20°C).|$|E
5000|$|The plant cuticle is a {{layer of}} lipid polymer {{impregnated}} with waxes that is present on the outer surfaces of the primary organs of all vascular land plants. It is also present in the sporophyte generation of hornworts, and in both sporophyte and gametophyte generations of mosses [...] The plant cuticle forms a coherent outer covering of the plant that can be isolated intact by treatment of plant tissue with enzymes such as <b>pectinase</b> and cellulase.|$|E
50|$|The {{alkaline}} <b>pectinase</b> {{is inappropriate}} {{for use in}} the food industry due to the acidic pH of fruit juices. However, they have a very high demand in the textile industries. They are used for retting of plant fibers such as ramie, sunn hemp, jute, flax and hemp. The first report on retting of sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) by pectin lyase produced by Aspergillus flavus MTCC 7589 was published in 2008 but this aspect of pectin lyases needs to be extensively investigated further.|$|E
40|$|Background: Efficient {{degradation}} of pectin in the rumen {{is necessary for}} plant-based feed utilization. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the diversity, abundance, and functions of <b>pectinases</b> from microorganisms in the sheep rumen. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 103 unique fragments of polygalacturonase (PF 00295) and pectate lyase (PF 00544 and PF 09492) genes were retrieved from microbial DNA in the rumen of a Small Tail Han sheep, and 66 % of the sequences of these fragments had low identities (, 65 %) with known sequences. Phylogenetic tree building separated the PF 00295, PF 00544, and PF 09492 sequences into five, three, and three clades, respectively. Cellulolytic and noncellulolytic Butyrivibrio, Prevotella, and Fibrobacter species were the major sources of the <b>pectinases.</b> The two most abundant pectate lyase genes were cloned, and their protein products, expressed in Escherichia coli, were characterized. Both enzymes probably act extracellularly as their nucleotide sequences contained signal sequences, and they had optimal activities at the ruminal physiological temperature and complementary pH-dependent activity profiles. Conclusion/Significance: This study reveals the specificity, diversity, and abundance of <b>pectinases</b> in the rumen ecosyste...|$|R
30|$|The {{up to date}} {{review of}} {{literature}} reported {{a vast number of}} microorganisms as PGase producers mainly fungi such as Aspergillus spp, Rhizopus stolonifer, Alternaria mali, Fusarium oxysporum, Neurospora crassa, Penicillium italicum ACIM F- 152 and a little bit form bacteria confined to Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, Ralstonia solanacearum, Bacillus spp and Enterobacter aerogenes NBO 2 (Jayani et al. 2005, 2010; Darah et al. 2013). Microbial <b>pectinase(s)</b> particularly those of fungal origin account for 25 % of the global food and industrial enzymes sales (Demir et al. 2012). Although fungi are considered to be potent <b>pectinases</b> producers, but the drawbacks included in the physicochemical properties of these enzymes greatly limit the utilization of these enzymes on a wide industrial scale (Soares et al. 1999).|$|R
40|$|Jute is a strong, stiff, natural fiber. When {{blended with}} cotton {{it makes a}} sturdy but prickly fabric due to {{protruding}} surface jute fibers. Samples of jute-cotton blended fabric were treated with commercial cellulases, xylanases and <b>pectinases</b> individually and in combination at various concentrations in order to smooth and soften the fabric. Enzyme treatment was carried out at 50 °C {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 M phosphate buffer (PH 7. 0), for 3 h. Enzymatic activities were evaluated by the release of reducing sugars and changes in surface appearance of the fabric. Addition of commercial cellulases alone extensively removed protruding jute and cotton fibers from the fabric, whereas addition of commercial <b>pectinases</b> or xylanases mainly loosened the protruding long jute fiber bundle. Combined treatment of <b>pectinases</b> and xylanases with reduced amounts of cellulases was equally effective as high levels of cellulases in the removal of surface protruding fibers. The amount of reducing sugar released correlated with removal of fibers from the fabric surface. Thus, the fabric surface was smoother in enzyme-treated samples compared to untreated control and treated with mixtures of enzymes were more effective than cellulase alone.
