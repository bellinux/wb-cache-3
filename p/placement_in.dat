5|$|Its {{external}} morphology {{is similar}} to that of Holochilus brasiliensis, and over the course of its complex taxonomic history it has been confused with that species, but other features support its <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> a distinct genus, Lundomys.

5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} paper {{in which they}} {{described}} Lundomys, Voss and Carleton also, for the first time, diagnosed the tribe Oryzomyini in a phylogenetically valid way. Previously, Oryzomyini had been a somewhat loosely defined group defined among others by a long palate {{and the presence of}} a crest known as the mesoloph on the upper molars and mesolophid on the lower molars; this crest is absent or reduced in Holochilus and Lundomys. Voss and Carleton recognized five synapomorphies for the group, all of which are shared by Lundomys; the <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> Oryzomyini of Lundomys and of three other genera—Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys, and Zygodontomys—which also lack complete mesoloph(id)s has been universally supported since.|$|E

Purpose: To examine {{the responses of}} Thai customers toward product <b>placements</b> <b>in</b> Thai sitcoms and measure how product <b>placements</b> <b>in</b> Thai sitcoms have influential effects on Thai consumers’ attitudes. Method: The study is mainly based on quantitative research using experiment and survey methods. Relevant secondary data are also collected. The major framework {{used in the study}} is the Multicomponent Model of Attitude. Conclusion: Product <b>placements</b> <b>in</b> Thai sitcoms have influential effects on the attitudes of Thai consumers depending on the category used in practice and execution style. Implicit product placement seems to be the most suitable and acceptable technique to use in Thai sitcoms since it creates positive effects on Thai consumers’ attitude toward brands and their purchase intention.

The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 2006, quarterback Rhett Bomar and {{offensive}} lineman J.D. Quinn, both sophomores, were dismissed from the team. It {{was reported that}} they violated NCAA regulations regarding receiving extra compensation. It was later determined Bomar received $7,406.88 and Quinn $8,137.17. The loss of these two key players affected the team's <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> many publications' preseason polls {{as well as their}} chances of winning a national championship. The team turned to starting quarterback Paul Thompson (a converted wide receiver in 2005) and backup Joey Halzle to lead the team.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1874 {{as a species}} of Boletus, the fungus has also been classified in the genus Leccinum because of the scabers on the stipe, or in Tylopilus {{because of the color}} of the spore print. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that the lilac-brown bolete was separate from both of these genera, and merited <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> a new genus.

5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's {{view on the}} position of Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis of}} several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from its one feature of a shortened frill. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The eight living pelican {{species were}} {{traditionally}} {{divided into two}} groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage (Australian, Dalmatian, great white, and American white pelicans), and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees (pink-backed, spot-billed and brown pelicans), or on sea rocks (Peruvian pelican). The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans, formerly considered conspecific, are sometimes separated from the others by <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> the subgenus Leptopelicanus but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either.|$|E
5|$|The fossil has {{a number}} of {{features}} that suggest a relation to a group of oryzomyine rodents that includes the South American marsh rat Holochilus, its living relatives Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys, and the extinct Noronhomys and Holochilus primigenus. They share high-crowned (hypsodont) molars and several simplifications of molar morphology, as well as other features that cannot be assessed in Carletonomys, which indicate specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle. It shows the most similarity to Noronhomys and Holochilus, so much so that Pardiñas considered placing it in either of these two genera, but its distinctive morphological features justify <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a <b>placement</b> <b>in</b> the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.

5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain.
