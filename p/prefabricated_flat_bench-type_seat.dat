A BOAC Sunderland made a proving flight to Karachi in the Indian subcontinent in late 1943 to research future civil operations to India. These conversions were designated by Shorts as the Sunderland 3.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, many rural areas of the United States and Canada were served by one-room schools. For those {{students}} who lived beyond practical walking distance from school, transportation was facilitated in the form of the kid hack; at the time, [...] "hack" [...] was a term referring to certain types of horse-drawn carriages. While some kid hacks were essentially repurposed farm wagons, others were purpose-built for transporting people instead of cargo, featuring <b>bench-type</b> <b>seating.</b> As these were horse-drawn vehicles, the entrance door was rear-mounted (in order to avoid startling the horses when loading or unloading passengers). Later, one of the longest-running school bus manufacturers, Wayne Works (later Wayne Corporation), started producing its first school wagons in Indiana in 1886.|$|R
5000|$|The {{previous}} advanced overhead-cam inline-four {{engine was}} now {{not in use}} by any other production car so it {{was replaced by the}} MPJG OHV unit from the Wolseley 10 but with twin SU carburettors, modified camshaft and manifolding. The engine displaced just 1292 cc, with a stroke of 102 mm and a bore of 63.5 mm and power output was 50 hp (40.3 kW) at 4,500 rpm. The four-speed manual gearbox now had synchromesh on the two top ratios and was connected to the engine by a cork-faced clutch running in oil. Unlike the PB, hydraulic brakes were fitted with 9 in drums.Like the PB, most were two-seat open cars with a steel body on an ash frame. A <b>bench-type</b> <b>seat</b> was fitted with storage space behind.|$|R

Now a full six-seater with a <b>bench-type</b> front <b>seat</b> {{it was given}} a wider track and a variable ratio steering unit. The gear lever was now mounted on the steering column. Like Humber's Pullman the headlights were fitted into the wings and running-boards were re-introduced. The transverse-spring independent suspension, first introduced on the Snipe and Pullman in 1935, continued but with 14 leaves instead of eight.|$|R

This also allowed a properly sprung <b>bench-type</b> rear <b>seat</b> to be fitted capable of seating two adults. The front seats were adjustable for position and the passenger side now folded much further forward than on previous models to allow easier access to the rear, although the doors were still felt to be too narrow for easy entry. Controls were similar to the Mark F, but the fuel tap was now moved from beneath the bonnet to under the dash. Doors were now lockable and included wind-up windows.|$|R

5000|$|Gear sticks {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{found between the}} front seats of the vehicle, either on the center console (sometimes even quite far up on the dashboard), the transmission tunnel (errorenously called a console shifter when the floor shifter mechanism is bolted to the transmission tunnel with the center console {{to cover up the}} shifter assembly when used with a rear or front wheel drive vehicle), or directly on the floor. Some vehicles have a column shift where the lever is mounted on the steering column—this arrangement was almost standard practice in American vehicles from about 1939 until relatively recently. It had the added benefit of allowing for a full width <b>bench-type</b> front <b>seat</b> (though some models with bucket seating as an option include it). It has since fallen out of favor, although it can still be found widely on North American-market pick-up trucks, vans, emergency vehicles (both law enforcement and EMS - the column shifter is retained where a floor shifter is unfeasible due to mounting the mobile data terminal and 2-way radio), and [...] "full-size" [...] US sedans such as the Ford Crown Victoria. A dashboard mounted shift was common on certain French models such as the Citroën 2CV and Renault 4.

5000|$|It was {{not until}} 1854 that a halt (Haltestelle) was {{established}} for the municipality of Wutha on the Halle-Bebra railway (Thuringian Railway), which had opened in 1847. It originally had a [...] "house" [...] and an island platform, {{as well as a}} waiting room built by the municipality. In 1873, this building was replaced by an entrance building built by the Thuringian Railway Company (Thüringische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). As a result of the construction of the Wutha-Ruhla railway, the halt was reclassified as a station in 1879/80 and a freight shed and a loading road were built. With the opening of a branch line, which was known as the Rühler Bimmel ("Ruhla jingle"), the station became a Keilbahnhof ("wedge station", that is, it had a platform built between the diverging lines). Following the closure of the Rühler Bimmel on 24 September 1967, the station maintained its operational importance, as an industrial spur ran from it and the Eisenach freight yard had to be relieved of traffic {{as a result of its}} increasing motor car loading operations. To the east of Wutha station there were already at this time the loading ramps of the VEB Petkus Wutha. This plant mainly exported technical facilities for seed cleaning and grain silos to other Communist countries. For this purpose, a roofed goods handling building was built. Further east was the ACZ Wutha agrochemical centre, which was founded in the 1970s, with several feed and fertiliser storage halls. The storage and timber loading yard of the Eisenach state forestry company (Staatlichen Forstbetriebes Eisenach), which had its own loading bridge for long logs, took up even more space. After 1980, intensive preparations took place in the residential areas for the building of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>flats</b> in the Mölmen estate on the outskirts of Wutha-Farnroda and in the Am Stein and Friedrich-Engels-Straße estates in Seebach. The transport of all industrially prefabricated panels took place exclusively via the industrial spur line from Wutha. A central concrete plant was built at Rehhof and supplied with cement, sand and gravel from the Bad Salzungen area. To the east of Rehhof, a lignite-powered heating plant was built for the district heating supply of Wutha and Seebach; this was also supplied by rail. Until the introduction of ticket machines in 1994, Wutha entrance building was used to its full extent. There were office and lounge rooms for rail staff in the building and on the ground floor there was a ticket office, a waiting room and a busy station restaurant. On 6 June 2004, a display of local culture was opened at Eisenacherstraße, near the town hall. It provides detailed information about Wutha station and the Wutha-Ruhla railway on three display boards. Visitors can also inspect original parts and structural remains of the Erbstrom bridge.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a new {{residential}} building in the locality Brno- Lesná. The building plot {{stands in the middle}} of three different urban units. Firstly, Lesna housing estate consisting mainly of eight-floor <b>prefabricated</b> blocks of <b>flats.</b> Secondly, the Divisova colony consisting mainly of low rise houses and two-storey family houses. Lastly, directly linked structure, newly built blocks of flats with terrace north of the building plots. These are seven-story buiding, where the first two floors the garage occupy and the additional five floors are flats. Another important factor affecting the design is the nature of the lot, which slopes to the west, and creates very interesting views of Brno, especially the Spilberk castle and Cathedral Sant Peter and Paul. The design seeks to build on the surrounding buildings and create a transition between the low-rise buildings Divis colony and housing development Lesna and terraced houses. This is achieved by using a gradation of cubic masses from single-storey houses to the five-story residential building. Optimizing of space for each flat or villa house was achieved by rotating the individual, which also ensures the uniqueness of flats and their orientation and views of city centre...|$|R
40|$|Session CS 04 : Building and constructionConfenrence Theme: LCA {{in market}} {{research}} and policy: Harmonisation beyond standardisationIndustrialization {{of the construction}} process being a current trend can considerably reduce the on-site labor intensity and shorten the construction time. Prefabrication of construction components {{is one of the}} most commonly used methods to facilitate the industrialization in the sector. Since the mid- 1980 s, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) has begun to introduce prefabricated concrete components into public housing projects. While the provision of public housing is of paramount importance in Hong Kong as approximately 30 % of the population live in public rental housing (PRH) flats and 20 % reside in home ownership scheme (HOS) <b>flats,</b> <b>prefabricated</b> concrete components can replace some 17 % or 65 % in extremely cases of in-situ concrete casting by volume. Due to high labor cost and a lack of land in Hong Kong, prefabricated concrete units are mostly manufactured in mainland China and transported to the construction sites in Hong Kong. This leads to a more complicated logistic system when compared to the conventional cast-in-situ concrete method. The transportation of heavy prefabricated concrete units can generate pollutants and consequently compound the environmental burden. Nevertheless, using the prefabrication approach can help minimize on-site wastage. In this study, the environmental footprint of prefabricated and cast-in-situ concrete is compared using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. A software program known as the Environmental Modeling of Construction (EMoC) has been developed based upon the concept of LCA. EMoC considers the ‘cradle-to-site’ processes from raw material extraction, manufacturing of components, transportation to on-site construction processes. More importantly, the on-site activities related to prefabricated and cast-in-situ concrete can be evaluated separately. To facilitate comparison, the life cycle inventory of concrete has been collected from a local prefabrication yard and concrete batching plant. The comparison is based on the unit of 1 m 3 of unreinforced prefabricated concrete and the equivalent amount of cast-in-situ concrete. Through this study, it is found that the overall environmental footprint of prefabricated concrete as represented by the endpoint single score is 36 which is indeed much better than the score of 57 for cast-in-situ concrete. While cast-in-situ concrete contributes more to the toxicity, eutrophication, land occupation, and resource depletion than prefabricated concrete, the carbon footprint of prefabricated concrete is only 6 % less than that of cast-in-situ concrete. The analysis reveals that timber formwork is the primary contributor towards a larger environmental footprint of cast-in-situ concrete. The results show that prefabricated concrete can outweigh conventional cast-in-situ concrete from an environmental point of view due to a dramatic saving in the amount of temporary materials...|$|R
