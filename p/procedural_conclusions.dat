40|$|Abstract: Background. Complete esophageal {{stenosis}} {{can occur}} after external beam radiation therapy for malignancies. Treatment for this complication has traditionally involved surgery. Methods. A new technique to reestablish luminal patency is described. This minimally invasive technique involves retro-grade endoscopy {{by means of}} gastrostomy tube tract and punc-ture of the stenotic occlusion followed by stricture dilatation. The procedure is performed under combined endoscopic and laryngoscopic guidance. Results. Five consecutivepatientswho hadcomplete esoph-ageal stenoses develop after radiation therapy for malignant disease underwent retrograde endoscopy by way of gastrostomy tube tracts. Stenoses were punctured under endoscopic and laryngoscopic guidance with guide wires. Strictures were dilated with wire-guided balloons or polyvinyl dilators. Luminal patency was established in all patients using this technique without <b>procedural</b> complications. <b>Conclusions.</b> Endoscopic retrograde puncture and dilata-tion of total esophageal stenoses is safe, effective, and useful to reestablish luminal patency for radiation-induced strictures. This technique should be attempted before more invasive treatments...|$|R

40|$|Background. Direct {{percutaneous}} endoscopic jejunostomy (DPEJ) insertion is {{a useful}} technique for artificial nutritional support in selected patients. However, it is technically difficult and most case series report significant procedural failure rates. Methods. We reviewed our case series of DPEJ insertions, done in a tertiary care referral centre from 2002 to 2008. Patients were selected for DPEJ if they required artificial enteric nutritional support but were unsuitable for endoscopic gastrostomy. Our technique includes selective usage of a long drainage access needle for gut luminal puncture, selective fluoroscopic guidance and selective usage of general anaesthesia. Results. Of 40 consecutive patients undergoing attempted DPEJ insertion, 39 / 40 (97. 5 %) had a successful procedure. Sixteen cases (40 %) required the drainage access needle for completion, nineteen cases (47. 5 %) were done with fluoroscopy, and five cases (12. 5 %) were done under general anaesthesia. There were no <b>procedural</b> complications. <b>Conclusions.</b> This technique led to a high completion rate and low complication rate. With appropriate care and expertise, DPEJ insertion is reliable and safe. Copyright © 2009 G. W. Moran and N. C. Fisher.

40|$|Abstract Background Geographic Information Systems (GIS) {{have been}} used {{in a wide variety of}} {{applications}} to integrate data and explore the spatial relationship of geographic features. Traditionally this has referred to features on the surface of the earth. However, it is possible to apply GIS in medicine, at the scale of the human body, to visualize and analyze anatomic and clinical features. In the present study we used GIS to examine the findings of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), a minimally-invasive procedure to locate and remove both benign and cancerous lesions of the rectum. Our purpose was to determine whether anatomic features of the human rectum and clinical findings at the time of surgery could be rendered in a GIS and spatially analyzed for their relationship to clinical outcomes. Results Maps of rectal topology were developed in two and three dimensions. These maps highlight anatomic features of the rectum and the location of lesions found on TEM. Spatial analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between anatomic location of the lesion and <b>procedural</b> failure. <b>Conclusion</b> This study demonstrates the feasibility of rendering anatomical locations and clinical events in a GIS and its value in clinical research. This allows the visualization and spatial analysis of clinical and pathologic features, increasing our awareness of the relationship between anatomic features and clinical outcomes as well as enhancing our understanding and management of this disease process. </p...|$|R

The control group consisted of 11 male and 23 female hospital staff members with a mean age of 40 years. The experimental group consisted of one female and 33 male brain-damaged patients with a mean age of 49 years. Findings. The procedures were compared on the occurrence of false positives and false negatives. Both procedures yielded no false positives and a small incidence (6 %) of false negatives; both procedures were valid. Sub-tests involving the same variables were then compared.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Dural {{arteriovenous}} fistulas (DAVFs) with cortical venous drainage often present with hemorrhage or neurological deficits and prompt treatment is indicated. Disconnection of the draining vein is considered curative. We present the multimodality treatment results of 35 patients with cranial DAVFs with exclusive cortical venous drainage. Materials and methods Between January 2010 and January 2017, 35 consecutive patients with cranial dural fistulas with exclusive cortical venous drainage were treated. There were 27 men and eight women, mean age 68 years (range 45 - 87). Clinical presentation was hemorrhage in 23 (66 %), pulsatile bruit in two (6 %), seizures in one (3 %) and blurred vision in one (3 %). In eight patients (22 %), the DAVF was an incidental finding. Location of the DAVFs was convexity in 25 (71 %), posterior fossa in eight (23 %) and tentorium in two (6 %). Results Surgery {{was performed in}} four patients with anterior cranial fossa fistulas and in one patient with a tentorial dural fistula. In 30 patients, embolization with Onyx via the arterial route was the primary treatment with complete obliteration in one session in 25 patients.

40|$|Objectives To {{examine whether}} or not spatially-focused {{legitimacy}} policing interventions reduce crime and disorder in the places where they are applied. Methods Building on the NPIA-funded systematic review of legitimacy policinginterventions by Mazerolle et al et al. (2013). Legitimacy in policing: asystematic review. Campbell Systematic Reviews, 1, we conducted a systematic review of published and unpublished literature examining spatially-focused legitimacy policing. Inclusion criteria were that the intervention: (1) was police-led and included at least one element of procedural justice; (2) was focused on micro- or macro-places smaller than a city; (3) reported an outcome of crime or disorder measured at place level; and (4) used an experimental or quasi-experimental design. The review covers the years 1980 – 2012. Results The search yielded 21 documents, which evaluated 33 studies, and reported 86 outcomes of crime and disorder. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, we found that legitimacy policing focused on place reduces the levels of overall crime. Subgroup analysis demonstrated {{a significant reduction in}} measures of both overall and Part 1 crime; however, there was no significant reduction in Part 2 crimes. There was no significant heterogeneity between subgroups when moderator analysis was performed on the specific intervention type, or on a measure of increased police service and level of <b>procedural</b> justice. <b>Conclusions</b> Overall, we find that spatially-focused policing interventions that incorporate a procedurally just dialogue result in a measurable decrease in crime and disorder in the intervention areas. Consistent with the Mazerolle et al. review of legitimacy policing, our review also suggests that the particular vehicle of the intervention at problem places may be less important in promoting crime control than the dialogue established between police and citizens...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of an interactive website aimed at empowerment of disability claimants, prior to the assessment of disability by an insurance physician. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Claimants applying for a work disability pension after being sick-listed for 104  weeks, were randomized into either an intervention group or control group. Participants who were randomized into the intervention group were able to logon to the website www. wiagesprek. nl, which mainly consisted of five interactive modules aimed at increasing knowledge, self-awareness, expectations, self-efficacy, and active participation. Participants from the control group were directed to a ‘sham’ website with commonly available information only. The primary outcome was empowerment. Secondary outcomes included coping, knowledge, claimant satisfaction, perceived justice, and physician satisfaction. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2  days before the disability assessment, as well as 1  day after, 6  weeks, and 4  months after the disability assessment. Results Claimants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n =  123) or a control group (n =  119). The intervention had no significant short- and long-term effects on empowerment, but the intervention increased claimants’ knowledge significantly compared to the control group. Claimant satisfaction with the disability assessment interview and claimant perceived justice on the outcome of the assessment were lower in the intervention group (statistically not significant).

40|$|Purpose Theories of {{procedural}} justice have facilitated {{the development of}} a process-based approach to policing which emphasizes the fairness of {{the manner in which the}} police exercise their discretion. The study examines whether procedurally fair behavior by the police affects two types of citizen behavior during encounters: citizen disrespect toward the police and citizen noncompliance with police requests. Methods This study uses data from systematic social observations of police-citizen encounters to examine procedural justice factors on citizen behavior. Because of the reciprocal nature of police-citizen interactions, an instrumental variable is used in the statistical analysis to help address the causal relationship between police force and citizen disrespect. Results The statistical analyses find limited support for procedural justice factors. Two types {{of procedural}}ly fair behavior by the police, police demeanor and their consideration of citizen voice, are significant in reducing citizen disrespect and noncompliance, respectively. <b>Conclusion</b> <b>Procedural</b> justice factors have limited and inconsistent impacts on the two types of citizen behavior, and future research should address the limitations of this study and evaluate process-based policing with more data from social observations of police-citizen encounters. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare the opinions of superintendents and their perceptions of community attitudes in Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s K- 12 school districts concerning procedural changes designed to conserve energy and to relate selected variables to the assessment values. ^ On the basis of the literature review, a questionnaire was developed. Participants were superintendents in Nebraska school districts who were asked to identify their own attitudes and also to estimate community attitudes toward selected procedural changes. Data were analyzed primarily through crosstabulation procedures. ^ Findings from the literature review suggested that communities objected less to operational changes than school administrators; energy conservation through mid-winter school closing found widest acceptance among administrators. ^ Data from the study indicated that there was little support for the suggested <b>procedural</b> changes. <b>Conclusions</b> from the study were as follows: (1) Superintendents believed that communities were very concerned about energy costs but were reluctant to individually provide transportation for after-school activities. (2) Superintendents from school districts with fewer than 500 students were more inclined to accept the four-day week than superintendents from schools with higher enrollments. (3) Superintendents felt that the community would prefer a seasonal adjustment in the start of the school day rather than other alternatives, whereas the superintendents accorded this calendar option only a fourth place ranking. (4) Superintendents favored the mid-winter closing; their second choice was the calendar with the four- or five-day school week dependent on the season of the year. (5) Superintendents believed that nearly 21 percent of the community or parents supporting after-school activities would be willing to provide after-school transportation in order to conserve energy. (6) Superintendents who agreed that a change in the existing school calendar would lead to a reduction in energy consumption preferred the mid-winter closing; their second choice was the seasonal change in the start of the school day. ...|$|R

Background Whether the benefits of new-generation DES are preserved in women undergoing complex percutaneous revascularization is unknown. Methods We pooled patient-level data from women enrolled in 26 randomized trials of DES. Study population was categorized according to the presence or absence of CPCI, which was defined as the composite of total stent length > 30 mm, ≥ 2 stents implanted, ≥ 2 lesions treated, or bifurcation lesion as target vessel. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization at 3 years of follow-up. Results Of 10, 241 women included in the pooled database, 4, 629 (45 %) underwent CPCI. Compared with non-CPCI, women who underwent CPCI had a higher 3 -year risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 63; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 45 to 1. 83; p < 0. 0001). In women who underwent CPCI, use of new-generation DES was associated with significantly lower 3 -year risk of MACE (adjusted HR: 0. 81; 95 % CI: 0. 68 to 0. 96), target lesion revascularization (adjusted HR: 0. 74; 95 % CI: 0. 57 to 0. 95), and definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) (adjusted HR: 0. 50; 95 % CI: 0. 30 to 0. 83). The benefit of new-generation DES on efficacy and safety outcomes was uniform between CPCI and non-CPCI groups, without evidence of interaction. By landmark analysis, new-generation DES were associated with low rates (≤ 0. 4 %) of very-late ST irrespective of <b>procedural</b> complexity. <b>Conclusions</b> Women undergoing CPCI remain at higher risk of adverse events. The long-term ischemic benefits of new-generation DES platforms are uniform among complex and non-complex percutaneous revascularization procedures in women...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Joint, spinal {{and soft}} tissue {{injections}} are commonly performed by rheumatologists {{in their daily}} practice. Contrary to other procedures, e. g. performed in pediatric care, {{little is known about}} the frequency, the intensity and the management of procedural pain observed in osteo-articular injections in daily practice. Methods This observational, prospective, national study was carried out among a French national representative database of primary rheumatologists to evaluate the prevalence and intensity of pain caused by intra-and peri-articular injections, synovial fluid aspirations, soft tissue injections, and spinal injections. For each physician, data were collected over 1 month, for up to 40 consecutive patients (> 18 -years-old) for whom a synovial fluid aspiration, an intra or peri-articular injection or a spinal injection were carried out during consultations. Statistical analysis was carried out in order to compare patients who had suffered from pain whilst undergoing the procedure to those who had not. Explanatory analyses were conducted by stepwise logistic regression with the characteristics of the patients to explain the existence of pain. Results Data were analysed for 8446 patients (64 % female, mean age 62 ± 14 years) recruited by 240 physicians. The predominant sites injected were the knee (45. 5 %) and spine (19. 1 %). Over 80 % of patients experienced procedural pain which was most common in the small joints (42 %) and spine (32 %) Pain was severe in 5. 3 % of patients, moderate in 26. 6 %, mild in 49. 8 %, and absent in 18. 3 %. Pain was significantly more intense in patients with severe pain linked to their underlying pathology and for procedures performed in small joints. Preventative or post-procedure analgesia was rarely given, only to 5. 7 % and 36. 3 % of patients, respectively. Preventative analgesia was more frequently prescribed in patients with more severe <b>procedural</b> pain. <b>Conclusion</b> Most patients undergoing intra-or peri-articular injections, synovial fluid aspirations and spine injections suffer from procedural pain. Most patients experience usually mild procedural pain and procedural pain management is uncommonly provided by physicians. Specific research and guidelines for the management of procedural pain related to rheumatologic care should be established to improve the quality of care provided by physicians. </p...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Statistics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Scientists often {{encounter}} unobserved {{or missing}} measurements that are typically reported {{as less than}} a fixed detection limit. This especially occurs in the environmental sciences when detection of low exposures are not possible due to limitations of the measuring instrument, and the resulting data are {{often referred to as}} type I and II left censored data. Observations lying below this detection limit are therefore often ignored, or `guessed' because it cannot be measured accurately. However, reliable estimates of the population parameters are nevertheless required to perform statistical analysis. The problem of dealing with values below a detection limit becomes increasingly complex when a large number of observations are present below this limit. Researchers thus have interest in developing statistical robust estimation procedures for dealing with left- or right-censored data sets (SinghandNocerino 2002). The aim of this study focuses on several main components regarding the problems mentioned above. The imputation of censored data below a fixed detection limit are studied, particularly using the maximum likelihood procedure of Cohen(1959), and several variants thereof, in combination with four new variations of the multiple imputation concept found in literature. Furthermore, the focus also falls strongly on estimating the density of the resulting imputed, `complete' data set by applying various kernel density estimators. It should be noted that bandwidth selection issues are not of importance in this study, and will be left for further research. In this study, however, the maximum likelihood estimation method of Cohen (1959) will be compared with several variant methods, to establish which of these maximum likelihood estimation procedures for censored data estimates the population parameters of three chosen Lognormal distribution, the most reliably in terms of well-known discrepancy measures. These methods will be implemented in combination with four new multiple imputation procedures, respectively, to assess which of these nonparametric methods are most effective with imputing the 12 censored values below the detection limit, with regards to the global discrepancy measures mentioned above. Several variations of the Parzen-Rosenblatt kernel density estimate will be fitted to the complete filled-in data sets, obtained from the previous methods, to establish which is the preferred data-driven method to estimate these densities. The primary focus of the current study will therefore be the performance of the four chosen multiple imputation methods, as well as the recommendation of methods and procedural combinations to deal with data {{in the presence of a}} detection limit. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study was performed to compare the various methods and <b>procedural</b> combinations. <b>Conclusions</b> and recommendations regarding the best of these methods and combinations are made based on the study's results.

40|$|Plasma {{simulation}} is {{an important}} example of a high-performance computing application where computer science issues are of great relevance. In a plasma, each particle, electron or ion, interacts with the external fields and with other particles in ways that can be readily and effectively emulated using object-oriented programming. However, the great cost of plasma simulations has traditionally discouraged object-oriented implementations due to their perceived inferior performance compared with classic procedural FORTRAN or C. In the present paper, we revisit this issue. We have developed a Java particle-in-cell code for plasma simulation, called Parsek. The paper considers different choices for the object orientation and tests their performance. We find that coarse-grained object orientation is faster and practically immune from any degradation compared with a standard procedural implementation (with static classes). The loss in performance for a fine-grained object orientation is a factor of about 50 %, which can be almost completely eliminated using advanced Java compilation techniques. The Java code Parsek also provides an interesting realistic application of high-performance computing to compare the performance of Java with FORTRAN. We have {{conducted a series of}} tests considering various Java implementations and various FORTRAN implementations. We have also considered different computer architectures and different Java Virtual Machines and FORTRAN compilers. The conclusion is that with Parsek, object-oriented Java can reach CPU speed performances more or less comparable with <b>procedural</b> FORTRAN. This <b>conclusion</b> is remarkable and it is in agreement with the most recent benchmarks, but is at variance with widely held misconceptions about the alleged slowness of Java.

Two hundred and fifty-two patients (122 CVVH, 159 male; aged 61. 5 ± 13. 9 years) with dialysis-dependent acute renal failure were analysed in a sub-analysis of the prospective randomised controlled clinical trial-CONVINT-comparing IHD and CVVH. Bleeding complications including severity of bleeding and RRT-related blood loss were assessed. We observed that 3. 6 % of patients died related to severe bleeding episodes (between group P= 0. 94). Major all-cause bleeding complications were observed in 23 % IHD versus 26 % of CVVH group patients (P= 0. 95). Under CVVH, the rate of RRT-related blood loss events (57. 4 % versus 30. 4 %, P= 0. 01) and mean total blood volume lost was increased (222. 3 ± 291. 9 versus 112. 5 ± 222. 7 ml per patient, P < 0. 001). Overall, transfusion rates did not differ between the study groups. In patients with sepsis, transfusion rates of all blood products were significantly higher when compared to cardiogenic shock (all P < 0. 01) or other conditions. In <b>conclusion,</b> <b>procedural</b> and non-procedural blood loss may often be observed in critically ill patients on RRT.

40|$|Background: The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH) {{proposes that}} {{individuals}} with primary developmental language impairment (DLI) have a deficient procedural memory, compromising their syntactic abilities. Individuals with DLI may compensate for procedural memory deficits by engaging declarative memory for syntactic tasks. Arguments {{are part of the}} lexicon whereas adjuncts rely on syntactic processing. As a result, individuals with DLI may have unusual difficulty processing adjuncts. Alternatively, processing for adjuncts may be typical for individuals with DLI but show frequency effects, indicating compensatory use of declarative memory. Aims: Our goal was to test the predictions of the PDH by comparing argument and adjunct processing times for adults with and without DLI, and to seek evidence of compensatory use of declarative memory for adjunct processing. We further evaluated group performance on measures of visual procedural and declarative memory. Methods and procedures: Forty-four adults, 21 with DLI, completed a self-paced listening task, a procedural memory task, and a declarative memory task. The self-paced listening task tracked the word-by-word processing time for sentences that included prepositional phrases acting as arguments or adjuncts. We used regression analysis to determine effects of group membership and argument or adjunct status on processing times. Correlation analyses evaluated relationships between argument and adjunct frequency on processing times by group. Results and outcomes: We found no effect of group membership on the processing time for arguments and adjuncts in the self-paced listening task. Argument phrases were processed more easily by both groups. There were frequency effects for adjunct processing for the group with DLI, but not the group with typical language. We did not find the expected frequency effects for argument processing. The group with DLI also performed more poorly in both the procedural and declarative memory tasks. Secondary analyses found that non-verbal intelligence was related to outcomes on the declarative memory but not the <b>procedural</b> memory task. <b>Conclusions</b> and implications: We found mixed evidence on the predictions of the PDH. Adults with DLI may compensate for procedural memory deficits but it is unclear whether this depends on declarative memory or language processing experience. Compensatory processing is an important element of the language profile for adults with DLI. Learning Outcomes: The readers will be able to describe how processing arguments and adjuncts in sentences may depend on different memory systems, and how adults with developmental language impairment may compensate for syntactic processing deficits...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{procedural}} justice {{research has}} {{paid little attention}} to how people react to procedural discrimination (favoring self vs. favoring other), that is, how people react when they and the others are treated with different procedures. To fill this gap in the procedural justice literature and advance our understanding in this area, the current thesis presents an analysis of how reactions to procedural discrimination are qualified by the group membership and intragroup position (ingroup prototypicality and intragroup status) of the parties involved in intragroup and intergroup contexts. Studies 1 and 2 revealed that in an intergroup context, as group members perceive ingroup bias as legitimate, they react more positively when they are favored over an outgroup member than when an outgroup member is favored over them. In particular, because group members perceive the ingroup authority to be more related to them, their reactions to favoring self as opposed to favoring other procedures are stronger when the authority is an ingroup member than when the authority is an outgroup member. Studies 3 to 5 showed that in an intragroup context, peripheral members, who are highly concerned about group acceptance, perceive a high level of illegitimacy and react particularly negatively when a prototypical member is favored over them. On the other hand, prototypical members paired with a prototypical or peripheral member, and peripheral members paired with another peripheral member react similarly to procedural discrimination whether it favors them or the other group member. Studies 6 and 7 also focused on the intragroup context. These studies revealed that when high status group members are favored over a low status member, if they perceive the status difference as legitimate, they perceive relatively high levels of procedural legitimacy and procedural fairness, and report a relatively low level of negative affect. On the other hand, when low status group members are discriminated against in favor of a high status counterpart, they report a relatively high level of negative affect even if they perceive the status difference as legitimate and think that the favoring other procedure is relatively legitimate and fair. Taken together, the current program of studies reveals that depending on group membership or intragroup position, group members may react differently to favoring self as opposed to favoring other procedures. Furthermore, affective reactions to the procedures may not be consistent with cognitive judgments of the procedures. The research also reveals that the influence of group membership and intragroup position on reactions to procedural discrimination can be conceptualized in terms of sensitivity to procedural information (Proposition 1) and perceived procedural legitimacy (Proposition 2), suggesting that the group-value model (Lind & Tyler, 1988) and the social identity perspective (Tajfel & Turner, 1979; Turner, 1985; Turner et al., 1987; for a review, see Hogg, 2005, 2006) can help explain reactions to <b>procedural</b> discrimination. In <b>conclusion,</b> the current thesis makes significant contribution to the procedural justice literature...|$|R
