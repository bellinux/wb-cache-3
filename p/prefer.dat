Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is <b>preferred</b> to B and B is <b>preferred</b> to C, also A is <b>preferred</b> to C.

Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers <b>prefer</b> areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} visual {{preference and}} value for fresh beef steaks differing in marbling level and color, consumers in Chicago and San Francisco (n = 124 per city) evaluated {{two pairs of}} steaks in a retail case. Steaks differing in marbling level (Modest/Moderate vs. Slight) and color (bright, cherry-red vs. dark red) were purchased at retail stores in each city. Consumers selected their <b>preferred</b> steak in each pair, described their selection criteria, and provided the price {{they were willing to}} pay {{for each of the four}} steaks. There was a difference in visual preference in each city, with most consumers <b>preferring</b> (P < 0. 01) low (Slight) over high (Moderate/Modest) marbling; however, more (P < 0. 01) consumers in Chicago (86. 7 %) <b>preferred</b> low marbling than in San Francisco (67. 0 %). Selection criteria were categorized into five groups: marbling, fat, color, appearance, and palatability. Marbling was mentioned by 65. 4 % of consumers who <b>preferred</b> high marbling, whereas 64. 9 % of consumers who <b>preferred</b> low marbling mentioned fat as a selection criterion. Bright, cherry-red color was <b>preferred</b> by a higher (P < 0. 01) percentage of consumers in both Chicago and San Francisco (67. 6 and 76. 5 %, respectively). Color was mentioned both by consumers who <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color (64. 8 %) and those who <b>preferred</b> dark red color (63. 9 %). All preference groups were willing to pay more for their <b>preferred</b> steak (P < 0. 01), but consumers who <b>preferred</b> low marbling were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their <b>preferred</b> steak than consumers who <b>preferred</b> high marbling. Consumers who <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their <b>preferred</b> steak than consumers who <b>preferred</b> dark red color. Consumers who <b>preferred</b> low marbling seemed to desire lean products, and consumers who <b>preferred</b> high marbling seemed to desire products with high eating quality. In this study, consumers were willing to pay more to purchase their <b>preferred</b> product; however, most consumers <b>preferred</b> low marbling and bright, cherry-red color...|$|R
5000|$|Prior <b>preferred</b> stock—Many {{companies}} have different issues of <b>preferred</b> stock outstanding at one time; one issue is usually designated highest-priority. If {{the company has}} only enough money to meet the dividend schedule {{on one of the}} <b>preferred</b> issues, it makes the payments on the prior <b>preferred.</b> Therefore, prior preferreds have less credit risk than other <b>preferred</b> stocks (but usually offers a lower yield).|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>preferred</b> stock on the credit ratings {{assessed}} by professional credit analysts. <b>Preferred</b> stock inherently contains both features of debt and equity financing. Hence, the nature of <b>preferred</b> stock has presented a puzzle {{to the efforts of}} accounting regulators such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board to consistently classify within the existing framework established by financial reporting standards. I find evidence that the association of <b>preferred</b> stock with credit analysts' assessments of credit risk depends on two factors. First, the association of <b>preferred</b> stock with credit ratings varies by the type of <b>preferred</b> stock. <b>Preferred</b> stock that is redeemable is negatively associated with credit ratings, while nonredeemable <b>preferred</b> stock bears no consistent association with credit ratings. Second, the negative association of redeemable <b>preferred</b> stock with credit ratings is sensitive to the firm's financial condition. For those firms in poor financial health, the negative association dissipates. This is in line with <b>preferred</b> stock's inability to drive an insolvent firm into bankruptcy...|$|R
