40|$|Abstract. Copper (Cu) {{wire bonding}} on the <b>pre-plated</b> {{leadframes}} with Ni/Pd/AuAg plating {{has been applied}} extensively in the semiconductor industry for the interconnection of integrated-circuit (IC) packaging due to the lower material cost of Cu and its excellent electrical properties. Furthermore, the Cu wire bonding on the preplated leadframe has advantages, such as the tin whisker prevention and the robust package for automotive application. Nevertheless, a stitch bondability of Cu wire-preplated leadframe is facing several challenges, such as the Cu oxidation, the high hardness of Cu wire and the very thin AuAg plating on the leadframes. This paper discusses the effect of AuAg plating thickness in roughened <b>pre-plated</b> leadframe on the stitch bonding of Cu wires with the leadframe. The stitch bonding integrity was assessed using Dage 4000 shear/pull tool at a key wire bond responses of stitch pull at time zero (T 0). Results show that the stitch pull strength of the Cu-leadframe stitch bonding increases with the increase thickness of AuAg layer. FESEM images of the stitch bonding between the Cu wires and the <b>pre-plated</b> leadframes of different AuAg plating thickness did not show any defect in microstructures, thus it suggests that the bonding property is determined by diffusion mechanism at the Cu wire/AuAg stitch bonding interface. Finally, a brief discussion is provided on the stitch bondability of high performance Au-flashed palladium-coated copper wires on the <b>pre-plated</b> leadframe with different AuAg thickness...|$|E

This phenomenon was identified as creep corrosion and was the motivation for this work. This dissertation advances the state of knowledge on the creep corrosion process and the strategies for mitigation. A range of plastic encapsulated packages with noble metal <b>pre-plated</b> leadframes, from different vendors, with different package attributes, were used in this study. Creep corrosion on the mold compound surface was reproduced in an accelerated manner using mixed flowing gas (MFG) testing in laboratory conditions. Of the three most widely-used industry-standard MFG testing conditions, Telcordia Outdoor was found to be the most effective environment to induce and promote creep corrosion over the mold compound; Battelle Class III environment can also induce the similar effects of creep corrosion on mold compound, but in a limited rate on selective packages; Telcordia Indoor was found to induce no creep corrosion on the mold compound over a 30 day test time. In both Telcordia Outdoor and Battelle Class III environments, packages attributes and applied pre-conditionings were found to have no significant influence on the creep corrosion effect. Creep corrosion over the mold compound showed a dendritic formation. The thickness of the corrosion product layer on the mold compound tended to increase with increased exposure time. Creep corrosion products were electrically conductive and were able to bridge the adjacent leads, thereby causing electrical shorts. The corrosion products were found to consist primarily of copper oxides, copper chlorides, and copper sulfides. No distinct differences in corrosion products composition was observed on the lead versus the mold compound surfaces.

40|$|Measurements are {{presented}} of the thermomechanical coefficient of normal liquid He- 3 confined in a porous plug <b>pre-plated</b> with four monoloyers of He- 4. These non-magnetic monolayers displace the magnetic solid-like He- 3 monolayers that are {{adjacent to the}} pore surfaces when the plug is filled with pure He- 3. In the low temperature limit (T < 10 mK) the coefficient can be described by dP/dT ~ s/ 6 v, where dP is the pressure difference across the plug generated by the temperature difference dT and s and v are the molar entropy and volume. This low temperature limit corresponds to the condition d << l_q, where d is the pore diameter and l_q is the bulk liquid He- 3 quasiparticle mean free path; that is, the quasiparticles are predominantly boundary scattered in the pores. The measured coefficient is half that calculated by Edwards, Culman and He. When compared with this new experimental result for the He- 4 plated porous plug, the earlier result for pure liquid He- 3 is strikingly larger (by up to 30 x at 2 mK). This enhancement {{is reminiscent of the}} giant thermopowers measured in Kondo and other dilute magnetic alloys. It is speculated that the enhanced thermomechanical coefficient for pure liquid He- 3 is due to magnetic scattering of the He- 3 quasiparticles by the two magnetic solid-like He- 3 monolayers adjacent to the pore surfaces.

40|$|A novel wafer level {{packaging}} process for phosphor converted LED {{is presented in}} this paper. The core {{of this process is}} the fabrication of a silicon substrate with cavities for phosphor printing and through-silicon copper pillars for 3 D interconnection. A double-side polished 4 -inch wafer is used as the substrate. In the present process, DRIE is applied to {{the back side of the}} silicon wafer firstly for forming blind vias. The next step is to perform DRIE from the front side to create cavities for LED chip mounting and phosphor printing. Copper is then electroplated to fill the blind vias to form copper pillars. After the copper plating, KOH etching is applied to the front side to further etch the cavities in order to expose the embedded copper pillars. Afterwards, solder is plated on the exposed tips of copper pillars at the bottom of the cavities. Finally, the copper overburden on the back side of the wafer is patterned as the redistribution layer for the next level of interconnection. Subsequent to the fabrication of silicon substrate, blue LEDs are flip-chip mounted on the <b>pre-plated</b> solder bumps in the cavities. Reflow soldering is then conducted to fix the LED chips. Following an epoxy dispensing process, yellow phosphor powder is printed into the cavity for color tuning. The pre-dispensed epoxy is then UV-cured to serve as the phosphor powder binder and the LED chip encapsulant.

40|$|Human muscle-derived {{progenitor}} cells (hMDPCs) offer {{great promise}} for muscle cell-based regenerative medicine; however, prolonged ex-vivo expansion using animal sera {{is necessary to}} acquire sufficient cells for transplantation. Due to {{the risks associated with}} the use of animal sera, the development of a strategy for the ex vivo expansion of hMDPCs is required. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of using platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the ex-vivo expansion of hMDPCs. <b>Pre-plated</b> MDPCs, myoendothelial cells, and pericytes are three populations of hMDPCs that we isolated by the modified pre-plate technique and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), respectively. Pooled allogeneic human PRP was obtained from a local blood bank, and the effect that thrombin-activated PRP-releasate supplemented media had on the ex-vivo expansion of the hMDPCs was tested against FBS supplemented media, both in vitro and in vivo. PRP significantly enhanced short and long-term cell proliferation, with or without FBS supplementation. Antibody-neutralization of PDGF significantly blocked the mitogenic/proliferative effects that PRP had on the hMDPCs. A more stable and sustained expression of markers associated with stemness, and a decreased expression of lineage specific markers was observed in the PRP-expanded cells when compared with the FBS-expanded cells. The in vitro osteogenic, chondrogenic, and myogenic differentiation capacities of the hMDPCs were not altered when expanded in media supplemented with PRP. All populations of hMDPCs that were expanded in PRP supplemented media retained their ability to regenerate myofibers in vivo. Our data demonstrated that PRP promoted the proliferation and maintained the multi-differentiation capacities of the hMDPCs during ex-vivo expansion by maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated state. Moreover, PDGF appears to be a key contributing factor to the beneficial effect that PRP has on the proliferation of hMDPCs. © 2013 Li et al...|$|E
40|$|Au/Pd/Ni <b>pre-plated</b> {{leadframes}} (PPF) {{are high}} performance frames for accommodating high-end electronic packages. Cost and reliability are major concerns in their wide application. The present work, from a materials science point view, deepens {{the understanding of}} PPFs, optimizes the conventional PPFs, develops a novel PPF architecture and models the residual stress relaxation in heteroepitaxial thin films. The wire pull test, the solderability test, and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to characterize the PPFs {{in order to understand}} the relationship between performance and microstructure. We optimized the electroplating profiles and determined the minimum thickness of the Pd layer with the PPF performance satisfying the industry standards. Further increasing the Pd layer thickness beyond the critical thickness will not enhance the performance more, but increase the product cost. With the optimized electroplating profile, the electroplated Au layer is epitaxially deposited on the Pd layer, and so does the Pd layer on the Ni layer. Misfit dislocations and nanotwins are present at the interface between the Pd and Ni layers, which are generated to release the about 10. 4 % misfit strain between the Pd and Ni lattices. This work demonstrates that the electro-deposition technique can electroplate epitaxy-like Pd films on the highly (200) textured Ni films, which are grown on the Cu substrates. A novel technique for impeding Cu out-diffusion in Cu alloy based <b>pre-plated</b> leadframes was developed by electroplating a 3 - 4 nm thick Sn layer on a Cu alloy base prior to electroplating a Ni layer. A 10 - 14 nm thick epitaxy-like and dense (Cu,Ni) 3 Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) layer is automatically formed en route of diffuse reaction, which leads to a drastic reduction in Cu out-diffusion and hence improves significantly the protection of the leadframes against oxidation and corrosion attack. The oxidation behaviours were quantified by Electron Diffraction X-ray (EDX) incorporated in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in the present work, which is a good complementary to the traditional weight gain test by a balance. A diffusion/oxidation model was developed to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient of Cu in the formed IMC nanolayers. The estimated Cu diffusion coefficient in the IMC interlayer is about 1. 6 x 10 - 22 m 2 / s at 250 °C, which is around 7 ~ 11 orders lower than the interdiffusion coefficients for η-Cu 6 Sn 5 and ε-Cu 3 Sn phases at corresponding temperatures. Based on the dislocation theory of twinning, analytical solutions by using the hybrid superposition and Fourier transformation approach were derived for the calculation of various energies involved in the misfit twinning process. For a given epilayer thickness and lattice mismatch strain, the twin formation energy should reach its minimum to determine the twin width and a zero minimum formation energy determines the critical thickness for misfit twinning. The effect of elastic mismatch between the epilayer and the substrate on the critical thickness was studied comprehensively, revealing that an elastically soft epilayer has a large critical thickness. Moreover, a misfit-twin-and-perfect-dislocation predominance chart is constructed to predict the predominant regions of misfit twinning and perfect dislocation in the mismatch strain and the specific twin boundary energy domain. Multiple misfit twins in epilayer/substrate systems were studied by summing up the stress and displacement fields of individual twins. In principle, the energy minimization approach can be applied to multiple misfit twins, although only periodic arrays of parallel and alternating twins were investigated here in detail. The equilibrium twin width and equilibrium twin spacing of a periodic array of twins represent the misfit twin morphology. The theoretical results indicate that the difference in elastic constants between an epilayer and its substrate has great effects on the morphology of equilibrium twins. The theoretical predictions agree with experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Cost {{reduction}} {{is the main}} driver in the recent transition to Cu wire bonding from predominate Au wire bonding. Other cost reduction in packaging comes from new developments in substrates and lead frames, for example, <b>Pre-Plated</b> Frames (PPF) and uPPF for QFP and QFN reduce the plating and material cost. However, 2 nd bonds (stitch bonds) can be more challenging {{on some of the}} new leadframe types due to the rough surface finish and thin plating thickness. Pd-coated Cu (PCC) wire has been recently introduced to improve the wire bonding process with bare CU wire, mainly to improve reliability and enhance the stitch bond process. More fundamental studies are required to understand the influences of bonding parameters and bonding tools to improve stitch bondability. The stitch bond process of 0. 7 mil diameter PCC wire on Au/Ni/Pd-plated quad flat-no lead (QFN) PPF substrate is investigated in this study. Two capillaries with the same geometry but different surface finishes are used to investigate the effect of capillary surface finish on the stitch bond process. The two capillary types are a polished finish type which is commonly used for Au wire bonding, and a granular finish capillary that has a much rougher surface finish. Process window between no stick on lead (NSOL) and short tail is compared. The effect of process parameters including bond force and table scrub amplitude is studied. The process window test results revealed that the granular capillary has larger process window and a lower chance of short tail occurrence. It has been shown that a higher scrub amplitude increases the chance of successful stitch bond formation. To further compare the capillary surface finishes, 3 sets of parameter settings with different bond force and scrub amplitude are tested. For all three parameter sets tested, the granular capillary showed better quality in bond strength. The granular capillary resulted in higher stitch pull strength compared to the polished type. A finite element model (FEM) of the process was developed to better understand the experimental observations. The amount of surface expansion (plastic deformation) of the wire at the wire and substrate interface was extracted from the model and attributed to the degree of adhesion (bonding).
