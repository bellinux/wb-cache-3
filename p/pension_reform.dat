40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> on households' expectations and wealth accumulation decisions. We rely on self-reported expectations to measure perceived social security benefits and {{to a series of}} <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> as a source of exogenous variations in pension wealth. Two parameters are crucial to estimate pension wealth: the age at which workers expect to retire and the ratio of pension benefits to pre-retirement income (the replacement rate). The Survey of Household Income and Wealth, a large representative sample of the Italian population, elicits these expectations from 1989 to 2000, a period spanning intense <b>pension</b> <b>reforms.</b> These reforms had different impact on different cohorts and employment groups, providing a quasi-experimental framework to study the effect of <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> on expectations and household saving. We find substantial offset between private wealth and perceived pension wealth. However, the Italian <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> of the 1990 s had only limited impact on household saving rates, because people have not yet fully adjusted their expectations of future benefitsbusiness groups, financially constrained entry, internal capital markets, multimarket competition...|$|R

25|$|From the {{perspective}} of longer term fiscal sustainability, the long-awaited reform of old-age pensions entered into force in 1999. This entails a far more robust system vis-à-vis adverse demographic and economic trends, which should keep the ratio of total pension disbursements to the aggregate wage bill close to 20% in the decades ahead. Taken together, both fiscal consolidation and <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> have brought public finances back on a sustainable footing. Gross public debt, which jumped from 43% of GDP in 1990 to 78% in 1994, stabilised around {{the middle of the}} 1990s and started to come down again more significantly beginning in 1999.

40|$|After {{presenting}} {{an extensive}} {{overview of the}} reforms undertaken in the EU between 1990 and 2006, The paper assess with a diff-in-diff technique the short-term effects of <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> on the participation rates of individuals aged between 50 and 64 years. The analysis suggests that in the short-term <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> have different effects on the participation rate of men and women. First, reforms tightening the access to early retirement {{have a positive effect}} on female participation, but reduce somewhat male participation rates. Second, the results for non-fundamental reforms are more uncertain. Third, reforms that change the way of financing pensions or the eligibility conditions (what we dubbed fundamental reforms), usually with long phasing-in periods, may have unintended short-run effects on the female participation rate. Thus, our findings point at the importance of designing <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> and strategies to reform social security that reduce the risks of undesired effects on the decision to remain in the labour market.

Cohort effects estimated on the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for for individuals born between 1937 and 1971 vary greatly by region, gender and education and strongly affect lifecycle wage profiles, in particular in East Germany and for people with little education. Using simulated life cycle employment and income profiles, we project gross future pensions across cohorts taking into account changing demographics and recent <b>pension</b> <b>reforms.</b> Simulations show that pension levels for East German men and women will fall dramatically among younger birth cohorts, not only because of policy reforms but due to higher cumulated unemployment.
