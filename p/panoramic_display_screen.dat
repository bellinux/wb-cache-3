40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{we propose}} a tele-operation {{system with a}} super wide field of view (FOV). Our {{teleoperation}} system has an omnidirectional image sensor for capturing a panoramic image and a personal spherical <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> for projecting a wide-angle image. The first original contribution is applying our system to navigating the mobile robot by tele-operation and evaluating efficiency of wide FOV. The second original contribution is a new propose of a super wide FOV. Generally, FOVs of a common display system and a HMD system are restricted and it is unable to see the outer of FOV of these displays. The idea of super wide FOV is that the wide FOV is nonlinearly compressed to display FOV. Therefore, the operator can look behind even if the display is not a <b>panoramic</b> large <b>screen</b> <b>display.</b> Key-Words:- Wide filed of view, Tele-opration, Robot, Navigation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{new class}} of {{low-cost}} teleoperated pan-tilt-zoom robotic video cameras can provide high resolution <b>panoramic</b> <b>displays</b> of remote sites for disaster response, environmental monitoring, and security applications. While the camera is teleoperated, the resulting video is transmitted back and inserted into an evolving <b>panoramic</b> <b>display.</b> Since small errors in camera position can produce large registration errors in the <b>panoramic</b> <b>display,</b> we address the image alignment problem. To quantify alignment error, we introduce a new metric based on motor error and image overlap. We use this metric to develop a fast minimal variance image alignment algorithm. We have implemented the algorithm and describe experiments demonstrating panoramic quality and that optimal alignment can be computed {{as fast as the}} camera can be tele-operated.

40|$|Several beam-combining {{schemes for}} on-axis and {{off-axis}} optical system layout are presented. The on-axis approaches include two crossed plates with dichroic coatings placed at 90 deg, {{with respect to}} each other, and a pentaprism arrangement. The off-axis layout of the cathode ray tubes requires that the images be combined at the <b>display</b> <b>screen.</b> These image-combining approaches are compared for the standard television rates of 525 lines and the high-resolution television at 1200 / 2000 lines under development in Japan. It is concluded that, for the high-performance, high-color fidelity, and high-resolution projection systems, which are expected {{to fit into a}} small volume of space such as a Space Station display or a cockpit <b>panoramic</b> <b>display,</b> a folded configuration with either crossed plates or pentaprism plates will result in an optimum color display...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} i-Cone TM : a new projection-based <b>panoramic</b> <b>display</b> system for virtual environments. The i-Cone TM uses conical screen geometry, {{resulting}} in optimized projector placement {{to create an}} extended workspace for standing participants in afront projection curved <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> with a very large continuous field of view. Improved acoustical properties of the conical screen geometry enable the use of immersive spatial audio. Combined with the excellent visual quality and homogeneity of a curved <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> these properties make the i-Cone TM an attractive display system for immersive virtual environments, suitable for larger audiences. Interaction paradigms and application examples for this new immersive display system are presented...|$|R

40|$|DE 102009041784 A 1 UPAB: 20110405 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{observing a}} set of stereoscopic half-images and producing a stereo image that is reproduced on a <b>display</b> <b>screen.</b> The half-images are reproduced on the screen, so {{that one of the}} half-images is viewed on two lateral and cohesive regions (16) when the other half-image is viewed from a stereo zone (17) that lies between the lateral and cohesive regions. The lateral region is smaller than the cohesive region, and image information of the half-images are enrolled in a lateral direction forced in a sub-pixel of a matrix <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> (10) i. e. liquid crystal <b>display</b> <b>screen.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> for <b>displaying</b> a point of views visible from lateral offset viewing zones comprising a beam splitter grid. USE - Method for displaying image information on an auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> that is utilized for displaying a point of views visible from lateral offset viewing zones (claimed).

40|$|INTRODUCTION The "UT-Cave", {{described}} {{here is the}} simplest example of how a researcher may configure an immersive <b>panoramic</b> <b>display</b> from equipment s/he is likely to already have available. From this example, the reader can generalize to larger UT-Cave's with more screens. The two screen design requires two standard LCD projectors, a PC for each projector and an extra for the operator's console, the game Unreal Tournament (UT) for each PC, a simple network hub, some hardware and the free software "CaveUT". (A "UT-Cave" is any PCbased immersive <b>panoramic</b> <b>display</b> which uses the CaveUT software.) The projection surface can be the clean white corner of a room, or some construction with adjoining screens. CaveUT {{is a set of}} software modifications which allows UT to support a multi-view display with off-axis perspective correction, making an integrated multiscreen display possible. Unreal Tournament is partially open-source and programmable. It supports the authoring of complex virtual world...|$|R
