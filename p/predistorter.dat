40|$|Even though high {{linearity}} {{is crucial}} in modern mobile communications, it is not desirable to use the most linear power amplifier types due to their poor efficiency. Predistortion is a commonly used, fairly simple and robust method for improving linearity of power amplifiers (PA). This thesis will investigate digital RF and baseband PA predistortion methods. A digital RF predistortion system uses an analog predistortion element prior to the power amplifier that is controlled by digital circuitry {{to compensate for the}} PA nonlinearity. One problem with RF <b>predistorter</b> is its sensitivity to delays between the control signals generated by the digital circuitry and the RF signal. This thesis presents a delay compensation method that can be implemented with digital circuitry, thus the delay being much smaller than the previously used analog methods. Another implementation issue that affects the performance of the RF <b>predistorter,</b> are analog envelope detectors that are required for generating the control signals for the digital circuitry. Three commonly used detection methods, power, linear diode and logarithmic detector, are compared. The linear diode detector was shown to be the most versatile. By using a lookup table, the power and logarithmic detectors can be linearized so that their performance comes close to the linear diode, but the biasing is easier. Design of an RF <b>predistorter</b> and the measurement results are presented. The designed RF <b>predistorter</b> was implemented to linearize a class AB PA with 22 dB gain and a 18 kHz 16 QAM signal at 420 MHz. The digital algorithm is implemented with an FPGA. The <b>predistorter</b> was able to achieve 10 dB improvement in the ACP.

30|$|Digital {{predistortion}} is {{an effective}} means {{to compensate for the}} nonlinear effects of a memoryless system. In case of a cellular transmitter, a digital baseband <b>predistorter</b> can mitigate the undesirable nonlinear effects along the signal chain, particularly the nonlinear impairments in the radiofrequency (RF) amplifiers. To be practically feasible, the implementation complexity of the <b>predistorter</b> must be minimized so that it becomes a cost-effective solution for the resource-limited wireless handset. This paper proposes optimizations that facilitate the design of a low-cost high-performance adaptive digital baseband <b>predistorter</b> for memoryless systems.

An optimized low-complexity amplitude approximation and its hardware synthesis results are also studied.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for high speed and {{reliable}} wireless communication increases, {{the importance of having}} a linear transmitter has enhanced. Distortions created by the transmitter, such as power amplifier nonlinearity and I/Q imbalance, diminish the fidelity and limit the performance of wireless systems, if left undealt with. Among the techniques commonly used to mitigate these distortions, digital predistortion has established itself as a suitable candidate that minimizes the hardware overhead and only requires modest additional power in the transmitter architecture. An important pre-requisite for utilizing digital <b>predistorters</b> is developing accurate and low complex behavioral models, which is the main focus of this thesis. After analyzing the importance of modeling and compensating for the distortion created by modulators and power amplifiers in the transmitter architecture, an overview of some commonly used models in the literature is presented. A novel behavioral modeling approach is proposed which is capable of modeling long term memory effects in power amplifiers, and a new dual–input modeling approach for I/Q imbalance compensation is presented that successfully compensates for distortion created by the modulator. Compared with conventional and recently proposed techniques, the approaches presented in this thesis show promising results in modeling transmitters accurately. The important issue of computational complexity in behavioral models is also discussed, and the accuracy/compexity tradeoff of some common behavioral models is analyzed. Once behavioral modeling techniques are established, they are used for digital predistortion of wireless transmitters. Issues such as identification of digital <b>predistorters</b> and adaptation of parameters due to changes in power amplifier behavior are discussed and a new measurement testbed to evaluate the performance in parameter adaptation algorithms is proposed. The methods and techniques proposed in this work provide ways to both mitigate distortion in and evaluate performance of wireless transmitters in terms of accuracy and complexity, and can help contribute to a better service of quality in wireless communication systems...|$|R
30|$|As {{the signal}} {{bandwidth}} gets wider, {{such as in}} WCDMA, mobile WiMAX and 3 GPP LTE and LTE-advanced (up to 100 MHz bandwidth, five component carriers of carrier aggregation), PAs begin to exhibit memory effects. This {{is especially true for}} those high PAs used in wireless base stations. The causes of the memory effects can be attributed to thermal constants of the active devices or components in the biasing network that have frequency-dependent behaviors. As a result, the current output of the PA depends not only on the current input, but also on past input values. In other words, the PA becomes a nonlinear system with memory. For such a PA, memoryless predistortion can achieve only very limited linearization performance. Therefore, digital <b>predistorters</b> must need to have memory structures [7].|$|R
30|$|Here, {{one thing}} that must be {{considered}} is that the compander is implemented as an LUT.

From simulation results, {{it has been observed}} that as compared to uniform spacing the value of error vector magnitude (EVM) improves by about 10 dB when the LUT size was kept as 256. Also it was observed that as the size of L has been increased beyond 256, no much improvement was found in EVM. Also when both uniform spaced and optimal spaced <b>predistorters</b> were implemented using VHDL synthesis, the gate count has shown almost two times reduction in case of optimally spaced compander.|$|R
