25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E
25|$|The early {{efforts at}} news sheets and {{periodicals}} were spotty. Roger L'Estrange produced both The News and City Mercury, {{but neither of}} them was a sustained effort. Henry Muddiman was the first to succeed in a regular news paper with the London Gazette. In 1665, Muddiman produced the Oxford Gazette as a digest of news of the royal court, which was in Oxford to avoid the plague in London. When the court moved back to Whitehall later in the year, the title London Gazette was adopted (and is still in use today). Muddiman had begun as a journalist in the Interregnum and had been the official journalist of the Long Parliament (in the form of The Parliamentary Intelligencer). Although Muddiman's productions are the first regular news accounts, they are still not the first modern newspaper, as the work was sent in manuscript by post to subscribers and was not a <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> for general sale to the public. That had to wait for The Athenian Mercury.|$|E

[...] The sheets, printed by Perkins Bacon, consisted of 240 stamps in 20 rows of 12 columns. One full sheet cost 240 pence or one pound; one row of 12 stamps cost a shilling. As the name suggests, the stamp was printed in black ink. A two penny stamp printed in blue and covering the double-letter rate (up to [...] ) was issued on 8 May 1840.|$|E
50|$|In fact, {{the term}} <b>printing</b> <b>sheet</b> refers {{only to a}} part of the actual <b>printing</b> <b>sheet.</b> This is because stamps are mostly printed in four {{connected}} sheets, to make best use of the stamp paper. At the post office counter, only the four separated <b>printing</b> <b>sheets</b> are sold. Therefore, the sheet of stamps is also called a counter sheet or pane, though improperly called a sheet of stamps.|$|R

Danter <b>printed</b> <b>sheets</b> A through D, while Allde <b>printed</b> <b>sheets</b> E through K. Only Danter, however, is credited on the volume's title page. Bibliographers determined Allde's participation in Romeo and Juliet in part by tracking damaged type used in Allde's E-K sheets and in three books that he printed in the 1597-9 period.|$|R

I eagerly made myself master of this precious document for a trifling consideration, and bore it off as a memento of the place; though I question if, in so doing, I did not carry off with me the whole current literature of Broek.|$|E
60|$|The subject {{indeed is}} a large one, if we reflect upon it, for many people would tell us that journalism is the {{greatest}} invention of our age. If this rich affluent has shared the great fortune of the general torrent, so, on other sides, it touches the fine arts, touches manners, touches morals. All this helps to account for its inexhaustible life; journalism is the criticism of the moment at the moment, and caricature is that criticism at once simplified and intensified by a plastic form.

60|$|Back at his hotel, though {{nearly two}} in the morning, he found the reporters waiting to {{interview}} him. Next morning there were more. And thus, with blare of paper trumpet, was he received by New York. Once more, with beating of toms-toms and wild hullaballoo, his picturesque figure strode across the <b>printed</b> <b>sheet.</b> The King of the Klondike, {{the hero of the}} Arctic, the thirty-million-dollar millionaire of the North, had come to New York. What had he come for? To trim the New Yorkers as he had trimmed the Tonopah crowd in Nevada? Wall Street had best watch out, for the wild man of Klondike had just come to town. Or, perchance, would Wall Street trim him? Wall Street had trimmed many wild men; would this be Burning Daylight's fate? Daylight grinned to himself, and gave out ambiguous interviews. It helped the game, and he grinned again, as he meditated that Wall Street would sure have to go some before it trimmed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "But now {{came the}} real {{difficulty}} of the inquiry. The order of the English letters after E {{is by no means}} well marked, and any preponderance which may be shown in an average of a <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> may be reversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur, but T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at. I therefore waited for fresh material. In my second interview with Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one message, which appeared--since there was no flag--to be a single word. Here are the symbols. Now, in the single word I have already got the two E's coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. It might be 'sever,' or 'lever,' or 'never.' There can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady. Accepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols stand respectively for N, V, and R.|$|E
6000|$|In a <b>Printed</b> <b>Sheet</b> of the assiduous, much-abused, {{and truly}} useful Mr. Chadwick's, {{containing}} queries and responses from far and near as to this great question, 'What {{is the effect}} of education on working-men, in respect of their value as mere workers?' the present Editor, reading with satisfaction a decisive unanimous verdict as to Education, reads with inexpressible interest this special remark, put in by way of marginal incidental note, from a practical manufacturing Quaker, whom, as he is anonymous, we will call Friend Prudence. Prudence keeps a thousand workmen; has striven in all ways to attach them to him; has provided conversational soir√©es; play-grounds, bands of music for the young ones; went even 'the length of buying them a drum:' all which {{has turned out to be}} an excellent investment. For a certain person, marked here by a black stroke, whom we shall name Blank, living over the way,--he also keeps somewhere about a thousand men; but has done none of these things for them, nor any other thing, except due payment of the wages by supply-and-demand. Blank's workers are perpetually getting into mutiny, into broils and coils: every six months, we suppose, Blank has a strike; every one month, every day and every hour, they are fretting and obstructing the shortsighted Blank; pilfering from him, wasting and idling for him, omitting and committing for him.
