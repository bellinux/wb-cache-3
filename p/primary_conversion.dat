The wave induced force is calculated using the boundary element method based on the velocity potential theory. Assuming air to be an ideal gas, the air flow is calculated using an equation of state and the equations of conservation of mass and energy. Boundary integral equations are formulated to calculate the air pressure in the air chambers, the reflection coefficient and the <b>primary</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency of each of the chambers as well as the combined efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method {{in order to}} improve the performance of the <b>primary</b> <b>conversion</b> of wave power take-off. A corresponding wave energy convertor (WEC) is an oscillating water column (OWC) type. The method of the improvement has been proposed and its usefulness has been confirmed in past researches. In the method, projecting walls were attached onto front of inlet-outlet of OWC. The prediction method of hydrodynamic behaviors for the projecting walls installed OWC type WEC is explained in the paper. The boundary element method with the Greenâ€™s function is applied and influence of air pressure and free surface within every an air-chamber was directly taken into consideration in the prediction method based on a linear potential theory. Validity of the prediction method was proved comparing with results of model experiments. Series calculations are performed with the prediction method. Behaviors of air pressure, water elevation and the efficiency of <b>primary</b> <b>conversion</b> of wave power are investigated.

40|$|AbstractObjective: to {{identify}} factors {{that increase the}} risk of conversion to open surgery following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and to assess their outcome. Design analysis of 1871 patients enrolled in the EUROSTAR collaborators registry. Materials and Methods: patient characteristics, anatomic features of the aneurysm, type of endovascular device, institutional experience and the year in which the procedure was performed were related to risk of conversion. Results: forty-nine patients (2. 6 %) required conversion. In 38 patients conversion was performed during the first postoperative month (primary conversions) and in 11 patients during follow-up (secondary conversions). <b>Primary</b> <b>conversion</b> was mostly due to access problems and device migration. Secondary conversions were performed for rupture in six and for a persistent endoleak, with or without aneurysmal growth, in five patients. Patients who were converted were significantly older, had a lower body weight, and had a higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conversion was associated with shorter, wider infrarenal necks and larger aneurysms. The conversion rate was lower when a team had performed more than 30 procedures, and in procedures performed during {{the last two years of}} the study period. The conversion rate was higher with EVT or Talent devices. Patients who required <b>primary</b> <b>conversion</b> had an 18 % mortality rate, compared to 2. 5 % mortality in patients without conversion (p< 0. 01).

Options for promoting forest conservation include payments for environmental services (PES) programmes that provide {{financial incentives to}} local actors, in exchange for reduced forest clearance. The success of voluntary PES (defined in terms of avoided <b>primary</b> forest <b>conversion)</b> is contingent upon behavioural changes in enrolled actors. As both the degree of enrolment and likelihood of sustained behavioural change depend upon how PES compensation structures interact with existing actor economies, local heterogeneity in livelihood strategies may play a strong role in the ultimate success of PES programmes, particularly when compensation is not differentiated with respect to opportunity costs. We examined the influence of livelihood heterogeneity on the potential success of a deforestation-reduction PES with an undifferentiated reward structure. We collected socioeconomic and demographic data at the household and community levels across two large Amazonian extractive reserves where a spatially extensive PES programme (Bolsa Floresta) operates.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{document}} the incidence rate of adverse events after endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) during two successive periods of time. Methods: One hundred ninety patients (175 men, 15 women; mean age, 72 years) underwent endoluminal repair of AAAs in a 5 Â½-year period. Adverse events were documented prospectively for all the patients throughout this interval. An adverse event was defined as any of the following events: a death within 30 days, a conversion to open repair, the need for further intervention (either open or endovascular), the need for hemodialysis, a failure to cure the AAA, and wound complications. The patients were divided into two groupsâ€”those who underwent operation in the initial 3 -year period (group I; n = 75) and those who underwent operation in the subsequent 2 Â½-year period (group II; n = 115). The results were analyzed for total adverse events for both periods of time and for difference in incidence rates within categories of adverse events between the two groups. Results: Eight patients (4. 2 %) died in the perioperative period. The endoluminal repair failed in 17 patients (8. 9 %), which necessitated a <b>primary</b> <b>conversion</b> to open repair at the original operation. In 88 patients, 110 adverse events occurred. There was no significant difference in the incidence rates of adverse events in patients in group I (37 / 75) and group II (51 / 115). Apart from <b>primary</b> <b>conversion</b> (P =. 007), there was no significant difference in the incidence rates of adverse events between group I and group II within the following categories: perioperative (within 30 days) deaths, <b>primary</b> <b>conversion,</b> secondary conversion, supplementary endoluminal repair, intervention for lower limb ischemia, hemodialysis necessitated, failure to cure the AAA as a result of persistent endoleak, and wound complications. Conclusion: Despite improvements in technology and increasing experience, adverse events continue to occur in a relatively high proportion of patients (45 %) who undergo endoluminal repair of AAA. Reporting the incidence rates of adverse events provides a more accurate picture of the morbidity rates of the endoluminal method rather than simply listing the procedures as successes or failures. The similarity in the incidence rates of adverse events in patients in group I and group II suggests that there are inherent risks in the endoluminal method rather than iatrogenic complications that occur during the learning curve with a new technique.

In the first part of the research work, the hydrodynamic performance of OWC wave energy converter has been extensively examined, targeting on a reliable numerical assessment method. In this part of the research work, the application of the air turbine power take-off (PTO) to the OWC device leads to a coupled model of the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of the OWC wave energy converters, in a manner that under the wave excitation, the varying air volume due to the internal water surface motion creates a reciprocating chamber pressure (alternative positive and negative chamber pressure), whilst the chamber pressure, in turn, modifies the motions of the device and the internal water surface. To do this, the thermodynamics of the air chamber is first examined and applied by including the air compressibility in the oscillating water columns for different types of the air turbine PTOs. The developed thermodynamics is then coupled with the hydrodynamics of the OWC wave energy converters. This proposed assessment method is then applied to two generic OWC wave energy converters (one bottom fixed and another floating), and the numerical results are compared to the experimental results.

40|$|Aim:The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse the {{technical}} problems associated with conversion from endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) to open repair and document the outcome in patients with this clinical course. Methods:Between May 1992 and May 1996 endoluminal repair of AAA was undertaken in 113 patients. Forty-eight of these had medical co-morbidities which led to them being rejected for open repair at other medical centres. Conversion from endoluminal to open repair was required in 18 patients. Thirteen of these occurred at the original operation (<b>primary</b> <b>conversion)</b> and five occurred at a later operation (secondary conversion). Seven of the 18 patients undergoing conversion had serious medical co-morbidities. Three different methods of open repair were used. The technique selected was determined by the cause of failure leading to conversion. Standard open AAA repair was used in patients requiring conversion for access problems (n= 2) and balloon malfunction, where the device ended up entirely within the aneurysmal sac (n= 1). Modifications to the standard technique were required in patients in which the endograft was correctly positioned immediately below the renal arteries and/or where part of the endograft was within one or both common iliac arteries (n= 11). Supra-coeliac control was required for patients with aortic rupture (n= 1), renal arteries covered by the endograft (n= 2) and situations where the delivery catheter was trapped within the aorta above a twisted bifurcated graft (n= 1). The mean volume of contrast used was 225 ml and the mean operative time was 5. 25 h in patients undergoing <b>primary</b> <b>conversion.</b> Results:Conversion to open repair was achieved in all 18 patients. Renal impairment requiring dialysis occurred in three patients. There were three perioperative deaths, all of which were procedure-related (17 %), and one late death. All four deaths occurred from among the group of seven patients with preoperative co-morbidities. Conclusions:Converting an endoluminal to an open AAA repair may require modifications to the standard open technique and result in a much higher than generally accepted morbidity and mortality rate. Patients rejected for open repair because of co-morbidities ran the same chance of requiring conversion as those without co-morbidities (15 â€“ 17 %).

On the other hand, {{with the implementation of}} "Natural Forest Protection Project" and "Grain for Green Project", the forests in TRB totally increased by 744. 5 km 2 (4. 00 %) from 1980 to 2000. Meanwhile, the grasslands and the farmlands decreased by 378. 0 km 2 (- 1. 98 %) and 311. 9 km 2 (- 1. 63 %), respectively. Overall, land use changes played a more important role for the streamflow reduction than climate change for SUB 1, SUB 2 and SUB 3, in which the <b>primary</b> <b>conversions</b> were from grassland, farmland and bare land to forests. Conversely, in SUB 4, the influence of climate variability was predominant. The results obtained could be a reference for water resources planning and management under changing environment. 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
