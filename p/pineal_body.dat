5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night.

It differs from the spectrum of synthetic melatonin, which has undergone no previous treatment. Heating of the KBr pellet of the isolated sample of melatonin for 5 min at 110 °C, however, causes the spectrum to change into one which is nearly identical with that of untreated synthetic melatonin. The mass spectra of isolated and synthetic melatonin are identical. Proton magnetic resonance spectra of synthetic melatonin before and after thin-layer chromatography are presented...|$|R

25|$|The pineal gland is {{the only}} midline brain {{structure}} that is unpaired (azygous). It {{takes its name from}} its pine-cone shape.

5000|$|Circadian rhythm {{disruption}} {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} wrong timing of light {{in reference to the}} circadian phase. It can also be affected by too much light, too little light, or incorrect spectral composition of light. This effect is driven by stimulus (or lack of stimulus) to photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina. The [...] "time of day", the circadian phase, is signalled to the <b>pineal</b> gland, the <b>body’s</b> photometer, by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Bright light in the evening or in the early morning shifts the phase of the production of melatonin (see phase response curve). An out-of-sync melatonin rhythm can worsen cardiac arrhythmias and increase oxidized lipids in the ischemic heart. Melatonin also reduces superoxide production and myeloperoxide (an enzyme in neutrophils which produces hypochlorous acid) during ischemia-reperfusion.|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{melatonin}} in the confluens sinuum of anesthetized {{rabbits and}} rats exhibited an episodic release pattern, with pulses superimposed on a basal level. The rhythmicity of pineal melatonin release revealed by our experimental paradigm {{was dependent on}} the blood sampling interval. In rabbits, {{it was found that}} the plasma melatonin level in the confluens sinuum was 7 - 15 times higher than that obtained from the plasma collected at the same time from the peripheral artery where the melatonin level also showed a pulsatile pattern. Diurnal variation in pineal melatonin level in the confluens sinuum was observed only in acutely blinded rabbits and rats. Electrical stimulation of the unilateral cervical sympathetic trunk of rabbits resulted in elevation of the level of plasma melatonin in the confluens sinuum, while the frequency of pulse peaks of plasma melatonin revealed at 4 -min intervals was not affected. Similar results were obtained in rabbits with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic agents. These findings suggest that the release of pineal melatonin into the confluens sinuum is under the regulation of the cervical sympathetic system. The sympathetic influence on pineal melatonin secretion seems to vary with age. Furthermore, age-related fluctuation of systemic blood melatonin appeared to be the results of changes in the rate of <b>pineal</b> melatonin secretion, <b>body</b> growth and ageing. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|The pineal gland, {{also known}} as the <b>pineal</b> <b>body,</b> conarium or {{epiphysis}} cerebri, is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain.

50|$|However, Mosso's manuscripts have {{remained}} largely unknown {{for more than}} a century, and therefore it was the structural radiographic techniques to dominate the field of the imaging of the human brain. Unfortunately, because the brain is almost entirely composed of soft tissue that is not radio-opaque, it remains essentially invisible to ordinary or plain x-ray examination. This is also true of most brain abnormalities, though there are exceptions such as a calcified tumour (e.g.meningioma, craniopharyngioma, some types of glioma); whilst calcification in such normal structures as the <b>pineal</b> <b>body,</b> the choroid plexuses, or large brain arteries may indirectly give important clues to the presence of structural disease in the brain itself.|$|E

The pineal gland in Proteus probably possesses some control over the physiological processes. Behavioral experiments revealed that the skin itself is also sensitive to light.

In intact rats memGreen-RV resulted in green fluorescent labeling in the trigeminal and the superior cervical ganglia, the lateral horn of the spinal cord, the paraventricular and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the perifornical region, the ventrolateral medulla, the locus ceruleus, and the raphe nuclei. In sympathectomized rats the labeling was missing from the brainstem but further existed in the hypothalamus. This observation indicates that the hypothalamic labeling is not mediated by the sympathetic system. One labeled neuron in the <b>pineal</b> <b>body</b> was only observed in 2 / 13 rats.
