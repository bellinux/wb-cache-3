Taking the {{majority}} view of scholars {{in regard to the}} identity of the gems, and including the implication from the Book of Revelation that the Onyx {{at the end of the}} fourth row was a Sardonyx, there are four colours – red, green, yellow, and blue – each represented by a clear gem (red – Carbuncle, green – Heliodor, yellow – Chrysolite, blue – Amethyst), an opaque gem (red – Carnelian/red Jasper, green – green Jasper, yellow – yellow Jasper/yellow Serpentine, blue - Lapis Lazuli), and a striped gem (red – Sardonyx, green – Malachite, yellow – pale golden Agate, blue – sky-blue Agate). The four colours of red, green, yellow, and blue, are the first four colours (apart from black and white) distinguished by languages, and are distinguished in all cultures with at least six colour distinctions (the other two being black and white). These colours roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells. (The retinal ganglia <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> by positioning it within a blue to yellow range, and separately positioning it within a red to green range.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{accelerated}} ageing {{is a test}} method used to simulate the long term effects of heat, oxygen, sunlight, moist etc. over the short period of time. The influences of external parameters are mimicked within the environmental chambers by strictly defined, standard test conditions. Printed products are, as any other material, very susceptible to ageing. This is even more emphasized if they are exposed outdoor. In order to prevent mechanical and chemical damages, products are usually varnished or laminated. In this paper we investigated the influence of {{accelerated ageing}} of offset papers coated with different types of coating, with regard to distinctness of image. Since the distinctness of image describes the deviation of {{the spread of the}} light reflected at the specular angle, it is a better indicator of a product surface quality than specular gloss. As a samples for this study we used papers printed with conventional and hybrid inks and coated with aqueous and UV coatings. Distinctness of image was assessed for primary <b>process</b> <b>colours</b> before and after ageing, where ageing is performed in accordance to ISO 12040 - 1997 and ISO 4892 - 2 : 2006. From the obtained results it was concluded that the accelerated ageing leads to the increase of surface roughness of coated papers and hence to the decrease of distinctness of image. The same trend is found for each of the primary <b>process</b> <b>colours...</b>|$|R

50|$|Anatomical and {{physiological}} studies have {{established that the}} colour centre begins in V1 and sends signals to extrastriate areas V2 and V4 for further processing. V4 in particular {{is an area of}} interest because of the strength of the colour receptive fields in its neurons. V4 was initially identified in macaque monkey visual cortex experiments. Originally, it was proposed that colour was selectively processed in V4. However, this hypothesis was later rejected in favour of another hypothesis which suggested that V4 and other areas around V4 work together to <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> in the form of multiple colour selective regions. After identification of V4 as the colour-selective region in macaque monkeys, scientists began searching for a homologous structure in the human cortex. Using fMRI brain imaging, scientists found three main areas stimulated by colour: V1, an area in the ventral occipital lobe, specifically the lingual gyrus, which was designated as human V4, or hV4, and another area located anteriorly in the fusiform gyrus, designated as V4α.|$|E

40|$|Colour Scheme {{examines}} {{the potential for}} colour {{to be understood as}} a relational and therefore, indeterminate space. The CMYK <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> model is reworked to investigate the idea of colour as an indeterminate space. In proposing that <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> can be understood as a fluid and relational system I draw attention to the unquantifiable and qualitative nature of colour. Colour can be understood as a verb, and as such may be thought of as an active substance. This understanding of colour acknowledges that the mind is a co-contributor in the process of cognition. Colour may be viewed as an indeterminate substance because it exists in relation to its surroundings, and the eye and mind of the perceiver. Colour Scheme consists of three associated and interconnected bodies of work. The first body of work explores the potential for <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> to be understood as a fluid and relational system. The second body of work consists of a series of colour actions that attempt to rework or reframe elements of colour theory. The final project is a reflection on the practice of identifying, naming and marketing the most indeterminate of colures, the colour grey. The understanding that colour can be experienced as a qualitative, relational and indeterminate space recognizes that vision is an open-ended <b>process.</b> <b>Colour</b> is an agent that has the potential to deepen our understanding of ourselves and the world around us...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new filter for impulse noise reduction in colour images which {{is aimed at}} improving the noise reduction capability of the classical vector median filter. The filter is inspired by {{the application of a}} vector marginal median filtering process over a selected group of pixels in each filtering window. This selection, which is based on the vector median, along with the application of the marginal median operation constitutes an adaptive process that leads to a more robust filter design. Also, the proposed method is able to <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> images without introducing colour artifacts. Experimental results show that the images filtered with the proposed method contain less noisy pixels than those obtained through the vector median filter...|$|E

The correlation among the colour channels is {{taken into account in}} the processing and, as a result, a more robust filter able to <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> images without introducing colour artifacts is obtained. Experimental results show that the images filtered with the proposed method contain less noisy pixels than those obtained through the vector median filter.

40|$|Biological vision systems {{process signals}} {{extracted}} by a retina {{that reduces the}} dimensionality of visual information for processing by higher cortical areas. To date researchers in machine vision have not reported computing a biologically inspired artificial retina that can sample visual information without over-sampling the central foveal region or creating discontinuities in the retinal tessellation. We have implemented a spacevariant retina that has a uniform receptive field density in the central foveal region and becomes increasingly sparse in the surrounding periphery. The retina contains isotropic receptive fields and the responses from the retina were processed by machinery motivated by biological cortical circuitry. We introduce a cortical graph that enables us to compute spacevariant cortical filters that can sample irregular image information generated by the retina and thereby extract edge information and <b>process</b> <b>colour</b> opponent information. In this paper we briefly describe the selforganising methodology we used to generate retinal tessellations and detail the construction of visual information processing layers in our architecture. ...|$|E
40|$|Bayer {{colour filter}} arrays (CFA) are {{commonly}} used to obtain digital colour imagery from a single-chip CCD or CMOS camera. Colour information is captured via a regular array of colour filters placed over the image sensor, and the full colour image is reconstructed in a demosaicing <b>process.</b> <b>Colour</b> imagery derived {{in such a way}} is prone to visual artefacts including false colours, poor edge definition and a loss of image and colour sharpness. Such artefacts are suspected of degrading the quality of photogrammetric measurements made from demosaiced images. An approach to demosaicing based on the use of tuneable Gaussian filters is proposed. The new approach is designed to minimise image artefacts and is specifically aimed at improving the quality of photogrammetric measurements made with the demosaiced imagery. Results are given for a specific application of Bayer CFA cameras to underwater stereo length measurement of fish. The results show a reduction in visual artefacts and an improvement in the quality of stereo measurements...|$|E
