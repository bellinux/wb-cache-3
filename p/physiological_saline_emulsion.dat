Blood samples were collected 6, 12 and 24 hours, and 7 and 14 days following vaccination with either live or inactivated Newcastle disease virus, La Sota strain, at 14 days of age, and the abundance of transcripts for each cytokine was assayed by real-time RT-PCR. <b>Physiological</b> <b>saline</b> and vaccine <b>emulsion</b> without viral antigen were administered to control groups for live and inactivated vaccine groups, respectively. The abundance of IFN-γ transcripts was elevated during the early times following vaccination and had reached baseline by the seventh day but the abundance of IFN-α transcripts remained elevated. Transcripts for neither IFN gene were detected in the control birds. The abundance of transcripts for each IFN was not different between the two vaccinated groups at any time. Transcripts for IL- 2 were detected only in spleens from chicken embryos that had been inoculated with the live virus. The results show that cells stimulated to produce IFN-α and IFN-γ enter the circulating blood but those stimulated to produce IL- 2 do not, or in very low number, and the IFN {{responses to}} both vaccines are the same...|$|R

DESIGN AND SETTING: Controlled randomized clinical trial, in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Outpatient Clinic, Hospital São Paulo, and Orthopedics and Traumatology Center of Jundiaí. METHODS: 30 patients were treated using the Ilizarov technique: 15 were instructed to apply 0. 9 % <b>physiological</b> <b>saline</b> dressing on the wire and pin insertions and 15 to apply 0. 9 % <b>physiological</b> <b>saline</b> plus 10 % polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine.
