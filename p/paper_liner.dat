40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} delayed harvested reed canary-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) as a short fibre raw material for the pulp and paper industry. This study examines the following aspects of reed canary-grass: quality, transportation, storage, refining of the raw material by dry fractionation, chemical pulping, bleaching and paper production. The delayed harvesting method of reed canary-grass produces an economically and environmentally sustainable short fibre raw material for the pulp and paper industry. The ash content and fibre properties of reed canary-grass depend on soil type and growing location. The yearly variation in fibre yield and fibre properties is also considerable. There is, however, a potential for minimising quality variations by choosing reed canary-grass varieties suitable to a specific growing location. The leaf and leaf sheath content of reed canary-grass also affects {{the quality of the}} pulp. These quality variations can be eliminated by dry fractionation, a method that removes the unwanted parts of the grass. These unwanted parts {{can be used as a}} valuable bio-fuel raw material. Transport of reed canary grass after fractionation can be improved by briquetting, a method that doubles the transport capacity of reed canary-grass compared to that of birch logs on a fibre basis. High quality short fibre chemical pulp can be produced from reed canary-grass. The whole process from grass production to pulp production has been demonstrated successfully in full scale.

40|$|Abstract. The high {{resolution}} and wide measurement range {{are important for}} the displacement measurement based on the grating moiré fringe at present. 50 lines/mm coarse grating scale is chosen often in order {{to carry out the}} wide range. Therefore, the realization of the {{high resolution}} is a difficult problem for coarse grating scale. The paper proposes a new nanometer subdivision method with CCD based on the disadvantages of previous moiré fringe collection method.

The pixel is the basis unit of CCD; the pixel number decides directly the measurement resolution and precision.

40|$|Abstract: Since 1990 s {{the liner}} {{shipping}} industry has faced {{a period of}} restructuring and consolidation, and been confronted with a continuing increase in container vessel scale. The impact of these changes is noticeable in trade patterns, cargo handling methods and shipping routes, in short 'operations'. After listing factors influencing size, growth in container ship size is explained by economies of scale in deploying larger vessels. In order to quantify economies of scale, this <b>paper</b> uses the <b>liner</b> service cash flow model. A novelty in the model is the inclusion of + 6000 - 20 -foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) vessels and the distinction in costs between single and twin propeller units on ships. The results illustrate that scale economies have been - {{and will continue to}} be - the driving force behind the deployment of larger container vessels. The paper then assesses the link between ship size and operations, given current discussions about the increase in container vessel scale. It is found that (a) ship size and operations are linked; (b) optimal ship size depends on transport segment (deep-sea vs. short-sea shipping, SSS), terminal type (transhipment terminals vs. other terminals), trade lane (East-West vs. North-South trades) and hnology; and (c) a ship optimal for one trade can be suboptimal for another...|$|R

A literature search was carried out for articles published prior to January 2017 in PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, TRIP and ClinicalTrials databases; relevant articles included randomized clinical trials that compared materials used for indirect pulp treatment in primary teeth. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted the data. The effects of each material on the outcome (clinical and radiographic failures) were analyzed using a mixed treatment comparisons meta-analysis. The ranking of treatments according to their probability of being the best choice was also calculated.

It is, however, important to operate the treatment with low concentration of nutrients in the effluent. The effect on the COD reduction from decreased additions of NH 4 -N and PO 4 -P were investigated in three parallel aerobic suspended carrier reactors during treatment at 46 to 48 degreesC of whitewater from a recycled <b>paper</b> mill producing <b>liner</b> and fluting. In the reference reactor, a COD reduction of 89 % was achieved and 45. 6 mg NH 4 -N/(g COD reduced) and 11. 6 mg PO 4 -P/(g COD reduced) was consumed at an organic load around 20 kg COD/(m(3.) d). Reduced additions of NH 4 -N decreased the COD reduction. Addition of 56 % of the consumption of NH 4 -N in the reference reactor resulted in a COD reduction of 80 %. The response from decreased addition of PO 4 -P was different compared to NH 4 -N but it could not be determined if this is due to unsuitable experimental design or a different reaction mechanism. Reducing the addition of PO 4 -P to 26 % of the consumption of PO 4 -P in the reference reactor, decreased the COD reduction to 83 %.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the nature of biomaterial interactions with compromised host tissue sites. Both ocular and dermal tissues can be wounded, following injury, disease or surgery, and consequently require the use of a biomaterial. Clear analogies exist between the cornea/tear film/contact lens and the dermal wound bed/wound fluid/skin adhesive wound dressing. The work described in this thesis builds upon established biochemistry to examine specific aspects of the interaction of biomaterials with compromised ocular and dermal tissue sites, with a particular focus on the role of vitronectin. Vitronectin is a prominent cell adhesion glycoprotein present in both tear fluid and wound fluid, and has a role in the regulation and upregulation of plasmin. The interaction of contact lenses with the cornea was assessed by a novel on-lens cell-based vitronectin assay technique. Vitronectin mapping showed that vitronectin-mediated cell adhesion to contact lens surfaces was due to the contact lens-corneal mechanical interaction rather than deposition out of the tear film. This deposition is associated predominantly with the peripheral region of the posterior contact lens surface. The locus of vitronectin deposition on the contact lens surface, which is affected by material modulus, is potentially an important factor in the generation of plasmin in the posterior tear film. Use of the vitronectin mapping technique on ex vivo bandage contact lenses revealed greater vitronectin-mediated cell adhesion to the contact lens surfaces in comparison to lenses worn in the healthy eye. The results suggest that vitronectin is more readily deposited from the impaired corneal tissue bed than the intact healthy tissue bed. Significantly, subjects with a deficient tear film were found to deposit high vitronectin-mediated cell adhesion levels to the BCL surface, thus highlighting the influence of the contact lens-tissue interaction upon deposition. Biomimetic principles imply that adhesive materials for wound applications, including hydrogels and hydrocolloids, should closely match the surface energy parameters of skin. The surface properties of hydrocolloid adhesives were found to be easily modified by contact with siliconised plastic release <b>liners.</b> In contrast, <b>paper</b> release <b>liners</b> did not significantly affect the adhesive surface properties. In order to characterise such materials in the actual wound environment, which is an extremely challenging task, preliminary considerations for the design of an artificial wound fluid model from an animal serum base were addressed...|$|R
