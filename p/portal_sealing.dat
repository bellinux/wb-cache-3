5000|$|Madelyne Pryor, N'astirh and S'ym plot a demonic invasion, {{starting}} with Manhattan. N'astirh and S'ym manipulate Illyana Rasputin into opening an inter-dimensional portal at the Empire State Building, through which N'astirh's demons invade Manhattan. Kang the Conqueror sends his minion, the Growing Man to attack N'astirh's demon horde. [...] During the invasion, N'astirh coerces Illyana, Meggan, and Madelyne towards their darker sides, Magik having a tie to Limbo, Meggan being an empathic shapeshifter who is swayed by the dark emotions around her (transforming {{her into the}} Goblin Princess), and Madelyne having her psionic powers triggered, transforming her into the Goblin Queen. [...] Illyana eventually closes the <b>portal,</b> <b>sealing</b> the demons in Limbo.|$|E
50|$|Several dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a {{powerful}} ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical {{components of the}} packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the <b>portal,</b> <b>sealing</b> the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the terminase (UL15) is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene {{is also found in}} T4-like bacteriophages suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses. Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.|$|E
5000|$|Travel between Halloweentown and the ordinary, {{historical}} world (which Halloweentown residents call [...] "The Mortal World") is {{only possible}} with magical aid, and only at regulated times (on Halloween), until the <b>portal</b> <b>seals</b> at midnight. In the second film they permanently open the portal between the mortal world and Halloweentown, and {{events of the}} third film breach the gap even more.|$|R
50|$|When Spider-Man is banished to the Dark Dimension by a brainwashed Portal, he is {{attacked}} {{by a group of}} Mindless Ones. To rescue him, Darkhawk and Sleepwalker battle the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and break Sauron's control over Portal so they could retrieve Spider-Man. A gang of Mindless Ones follow Spider-Man through the portal leading back to Earth, but the three heroes beat the monsters back and drive them back through the gateway before <b>Portal</b> <b>seals</b> the way.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the CRIS 2002 Conference in Kassel. [...] 9 pages. [...] Contains: Conference paper (PDF) + presentation. “OntoWeb” is an European Union IST-funded {{thematic}} network for "Ontology-based information exchange for knowledge management and electronic commerce". The corresponding OntoWeb portal constitutes a Web-based research information {{system that is}} driven {{by some of the}} technologies which it reports about. In this paper, we present the core methodology underlying the OntoWeb <b>portal,</b> viz. <b>SEAL</b> (SEmantic <b>portAL).</b> In particular, we describe some of the core challenges that SEAL must meet. Because of the distributed nature of research information, SEAL has been developed as a methodology that integrates heterogeneous information from distributed resources. Because of the complexity of the application domain, SEAL is based on ontologies about research information that greatly contribute to the combined goals of low-effort information integration and user-friendly information presentation. Because of the high quality requirements obliged onto the OntoWeb <b>portal,</b> <b>SEAL</b> has been extended with content management functionality supporting portal editors in their process to rule out undesirable content...|$|R

5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and {{saying that it is}} their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he was the one to close the <b>portal</b> centuries ago, <b>sealing</b> up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing {{that the only way to}} close the portal is to defeat Anise, he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, the <b>portal</b> is <b>sealed,</b> and Illusia is restored.|$|R

When informed of Unicron's destruction, he was infuriated {{to find that the}} universe was out of balance because of a severe lack of evil. Starscream attacked Primus's weakened form, due to the smaller robot stealing a piece of his spark and becoming an even equally huge monster, but was quickly dispatched by his creator. Defeated, Starscream flew off, leaving the Autobots to seal the Black Hole. Once this was accomplished, Galvatron attempted an escape from his fire dimension, but by combining Vector Prime's sword with the Omega Lock, the <b>portal</b> was <b>sealed,</b> and the Autobots returned home in peace.|$|R

50|$|The bunker built beneath 110m of slate rock {{consisted}} of two sections named Ost (East) and West which were separated by a valley and connected by a 60m deep passageway. The eastern section was partitioned again into two independent parts (Ost/West and Ost/Ost) and the western section into three parts (West/West, West/Mitte Centre and West/Ost), each with tunnels parallel to and crossing the main tunnels. All tunnels were concrete-lined and most had two floors, with several exits and emergency escape routes. The main <b>portals</b> were <b>sealed</b> by manoeuvrable steel and concrete gates built by MAN, each weighing 25 tonnes. The bunker housed 897 offices and 936 dormitories and had 25,000 doors in total. It even had an underground hairdresser's salon.|$|R

50|$|Olivier {{felt that}} through the Punisher he had {{gathered}} enough souls to launch {{an attack on the}} rest of Hell, and he caused Frank Castle to despair over the lives he had taken as the Punisher. Castle was driven to suicide by Olivier's demonic servants, and he shot himself. Castle was then immediately resurrected by Gadriel, the guardian angel who had failed in Castle's defense. From his base in New York's Flatiron Building, Olivier sent his minions against Heaven's angels and the dominions of the other Lords of Hell, including Daimon Hellstrom, but was thwarted in his assassination attempt on Hellstrom by the Punisher and Gadriel. Olivier revealed to the Punisher that he was {{responsible for the deaths of}} the Punisher's family. The Punisher fought a reanimated Bruno Costa and the contact of the weapons of Heaven (the Punisher) and Hell (Bruno Costa) caused a dimensional portal to open through which the tentacles of Hell began to reach. The Punisher shot Olivier into the tentacles' embrace, and they immediately tore Olivier to pieces. The <b>portal</b> was <b>sealed</b> by Gadriel sacrificing his life.|$|R
5000|$|The Demon Beast is {{a member}} of The Dark Ones that was sealed along with some of the other Dark Ones in the Netherworld until the Alchemist built a trans-dimensional portal {{connecting}} the Netherworld to Shuggazoom, and Mandarin damaged the Containment Grid keeping it and its fellow Dark Ones in, resulting its release. Forced to ditch his alien date to lure the Beast away from the city, Captain Shuggazoom put it to sleep with the Alchemist's sleep cannon, but was caught in the blast and went to sleep with the Beast as they both fell into a deep gorge below them. 60 years later, Captain Shuggazoom was found and awakened by the Hyperforce when they set the sleep cannon into reverse polarity, but forgot to shut it down due to its one-mile radius, waking the Demon Beast in the process. It then flew back to Shuggazoom City to open a portal to the Netherworld in the sky, but was defeated when Captain Shuggazoom put it back to sleep so that the Hyperforce could blast it into the <b>portal</b> and <b>seal</b> it back up.|$|R

5000|$|Tree of Chance (...) : An old tree located beneath Mullinalap Monastic Settlement. There {{are several}} {{variations}} {{on this story}} with local custom saying that beneath it is a portal to the otherworld e.g. Mag Mell. Oral tradition {{has it that the}} Fear Dubh or dark man (i.e. malevolent spirit) would appear at the site and play a betting game with mortals, if they won their wishes would be granted, if they lost then their souls were his for eternity. The spirit was eventually banished by the Tuatha Dé Danann led by Lugh forcing it into the <b>portal</b> and <b>sealing</b> the entrance by planting a tree on top of it. Lugh was said to declare the area a sanctuary from the spirit and it is believed this is how the locality received the name Termon or Tearmann. It is said the tree is now guarded by the Aos Sí, the descendants of the Tuatha Dé Danann. It was believed that each time the tree dies the entrance can reopen and the Fear Dubh may return to play its game. A local brewery is named after the tree.|$|R

50|$|After {{fighting}} with him, the party finds itself transported back to Easthaven, {{which is now}} in ruins. After freeing the surviving villagers, the local cleric of Tempus, Everard, informs the party that Poquelin is going after Jerrod's Stone, a mystical object housed under the town's temple, which acts as a <b>seal</b> on a <b>portal</b> to the Nine Hells of Baator that was opened during a major battle between the combined might of the barbarian tribes and an army of a powerful mage, and which was sealed shut by the sacrifice of the shaman Jerrod who led the barbarians in the conflict. Gaining entry into the demon's crystal tower that enveloped the temple, the group discover that Poquelin's true intention was to reopen the portal contained within the Stone, allowing him to conquer the North with an army of demons at his command. Although he successfully achieves this, Everard, having shunned the tale of Jerrod's sacrifice until finally understanding what he did, throws himself into the <b>portal</b> and <b>seals</b> it off {{at the cost of}} his life. The party use the time he buys them to fight Poquelin in his turn form as the devil Belhifet, and manage to defeat him, banishing him to the Nine Hells and escaping the tower as it collapses. In time, Easthaven eventually recovers, and the town is reconstructed.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanisms}} by which most double-stranded DNA viruses package and release their genomic DNA are not fully understood. Single particle cryo-electron microscopy and asymmetric 3 D reconstruction reveal {{the organization of the}} complete bacteriophage P 22 virion, including the protein channel through which DNA is first packaged and later ejected. This channel is formed by a dodecamer of <b>portal</b> proteins and <b>sealed</b> by a tail hub consisting of two stacked barrels capped by a protein needle. Six trimeric tailspikes attached around this tail hub are kinked, suggesting a functional hinge that may be used to trigger DNA release. Inside the capsid, the portal's central channel is plugged by densities interpreted as pilot/injection proteins. A short rod-like density near these proteins may be the terminal segment of the dsDNA genome. The coaxially packed DNA genome is encapsidated by the icosahedral shell. This complete structure unifies various biochemical, genetic, and crystallographic data of its components from the past several decades...|$|R
50|$|The many {{influential}} {{features of}} the new façade include the tall, thin statues of Old Testament prophets and kings attached to columns (jamb figures) flanking the portals (destroyed in 1771 but recorded in Montfaucon's drawings). These were also adopted at the cathedrals of Paris and Chartres, constructed a few years later, and became a feature of almost every Gothic portal thereafter. Above the doorways, the central tympanum was carved with Christ in Majesty displaying his wounds with the dead emerging from their tombs below. Scenes from the martyrdom of St Denis were carved above the south (right hand) portal, while above the north portal was a mosaic (lost), even though this was, as Suger put it 'contrary to the modern custom'. Of the original sculpture, very little remains, most {{of what is now}} visible being the result of rather clumsy restoration work in 1839. Some fragments of the original sculptures survive {{in the collection of the}} Musée de Cluny.The <b>portals</b> themselves were <b>sealed</b> by gilded bronze doors, ornamented with scenes from Christ's Passion and clearly recording Suger's patronage with the following inscription; For the glory of the church which nurtured and raised him, Suger strove for the glory of the church, Sharing with you what is yours, oh martyr Denis. He prays that by your prayers he should become a sharer in Paradise. The year when it was consecrated was the one thousand, one hundred and fortieth year of the Word. On the lintel below the great tympanum showing the Last Judgement, beneath a carved figure of the kneeling Abbot, was inscribed the more modest plea;Receive, stern Judge, the prayers of your Suger, Let me be mercifully numbered among your sheep.|$|R
