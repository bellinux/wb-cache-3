5|$|It {{has been}} shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed – the Flat-coated Retriever.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} also <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in Operation Garbo, a three-volume novel {{written by}} Harry Winter, a pseudonym {{for an undisclosed}} number of people. The techno-thriller novel is about a Soviet invasion of Sweden, and while Boden Fortress is not a {{main part of the}} story, one chapter in the first volume briefly mentions Södra Åberget Fort, and two chapters in the second volume are devoted to events at and around the forts, Södra Åberget and Mjösjöberget Forts are mentioned by name while Rödberget Fort is described more in detail.|$|E

5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created {{a distinction between the}} northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as there is little to suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E

It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part,</b> but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E

5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} detection of sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E

5|$|The sea <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in {{the water}} cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest {{of these is the}} Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include the Aral Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift.|$|E
