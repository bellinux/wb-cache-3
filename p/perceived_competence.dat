2500|$|Physical {{appearance}} {{gives us}} clear {{clues as to}} a person's personality without him/her ever having to speak or move. Women tend {{to be better than}} men at judging nonverbal behavior. [...] After viewing pictures of people in a neutral position and in a self-chosen posed position, observers were accurate at judging the target's levels of extraversion, emotional stability, openness, self-esteem, and religiosity. The combined impression of physical characteristics, body posture, facial expression, and clothing choices lets observers form accurate images of a target's personality, so long as the person observed is presenting themselves genuinely. However, there is some conflicting data in this field. Other evidence suggests that people sometimes rely too much on appearance cues over actual information. When provided with descriptive information about a target, participants still rely on physical appearance cues when making judgments about others' personalities and capabilities. Participants struggle to look past physical appearance cues even when they know information contrary to their initial judgment. Physical cues are also used to make judgments about political candidates based on extremely brief exposures to their pictures. <b>Perceived</b> <b>competence</b> level of a candidate measured from first impressions of facial features can directly predict voting results.|$|E
2500|$|Stanford University {{professor}} Shelley Correll {{and colleagues}} (2007) sent {{out more than}} 1,200 fictitious résumés to employers in a large Northeastern city, and found that female applicants with children were {{significantly less likely to}} get hired and if hired would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children. This {{despite the fact that the}} qualification, workplace performances and other relevant characteristics of the fictitious job applicants were held constant and only their parental status varied. Mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including <b>perceived</b> <b>competence</b> and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers. The researchers review results from other studies and argue that the motherhood role exists in tension with the cultural understandings of the [...] "ideal worker" [...] role and this leads evaluators to expect mothers to be less competent and less committed to their job. Fathers do not experience these types of workplace disadvantages as understandings of what it means to be a good father are not seen as incompatible with understandings of what it means to be a good worker.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The Exercise and Self-Esteem Model {{is used as}} a {{theoretical}} framework to describe associations between global self-esteem and physical activity, mediated by <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence.</b> We know little about how these associations develop over time in elementary school children. We examined the change in, and associations between, global self-esteem, <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence,</b> and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in children from kindergarten to grade 4. We also investigated if this change and these associations were different for boys and girls. Design: A prospective longitudinal cohort-sequential design that consisted of two cohorts of children. Method: Children in cohort I were followed from kindergarten to grade 2, and children in cohort II were followed from grade 2 to grade 4. Global self-esteem and <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> were measured with the Self-Perception Profile for Children (SPPC) (n= 292; 148 boys), while MVPA was measured with proxy-reports for physical activity filled in by parents (n= 184; 88 boys). Results: Global self-esteem, <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence,</b> and MVPA remained stable. Global self-esteem was the same in boys and girls, while boys reported higher levels of <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> and were more physically active than girls. The change in global self-esteem was significantly associated with <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> and MVPA in girls, but not in boys. Conclusion: There are few developmental changes in global self-esteem, <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence,</b> and MVPA from kindergarten to grade 4. The change in global self-esteem was associated with <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> and MVPA in girls, but not in boys...|$|R
40|$|Background: Children with {{learning}} disorders often have externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Their <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence</b> often is low. There is much knowledge about learning disorders like dyslexia, {{and their relationship}} to behavior problems, but less is known about the relationship between dyscalculia and behavior problems. Purpose: The main {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the differences between children with dyscalculia and children without dyscalculia, regarding their internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems and their <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence.</b> The relationship between <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence</b> and behaviour problems was also examined. Method: This study included 60 children. The parents and teachers of the children, individually completed a questionnaire to assess the children’s behavior problems. The <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence</b> of the children with dyscalculia and the children without dyscalculia was measured by a self-report questionnaire. Results: The results of this study showed that, compared to children without dyscalculia, children with dyscalculia experienced more internalizing problems. Children with dyscalculia experienced no more externalizing problems, and their <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence</b> was not significantly lower, compared to children without dyscalculia. The <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence</b> had no mediating effect on the behavior problems in children with dyscalculia. Conclusion: The results indicate that there are indeed differences between children with dyscalculia and children without dyscalculia, in terms of internalizing problems. There are no differences in terms of externalizing problems and <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence.</b> The <b>perceived</b> academic <b>competence</b> has no mediating effect on the development of behavior problems in children with dyscalculia...|$|R

Specific areas of interest were perceived confidence in problem-solving and approach rather than avoidance of problems; intergenerational intimacy, intergenerational individuation, and personal authority in the family system as the adolescent relates to parents; and level of depression. Subjects were 256 late adolescents whose parents were still married and living together. Results indicated that <b>perceived</b> family <b>competence</b> had an effect on the dependent variables in the expected directions. Specifically, individuals who scored high on <b>perceived</b> family <b>competence</b> were high on perceived problem-solving confidence, approached problem-solving, were high on intergenerational intimacy, intergenerational individuation, and personal authority in relation to parents, and had less depression than individuals low on <b>perceived</b> family <b>competence.</b> Several sex differences were noted.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore <b>perceived</b> {{physical}} <b>competence</b> and participation in physical activity of children with physical awkwardness. Children with physical awkwardness are those without known neuromuscular problems but who have difficulty in learning and performing motor skills. Participants were 135 children, 31 with physical awkwardness and 104 without any motor deficiency. The age ranged from 5 to 11 years. It was hypothesized that children with physical awkwardness would have lower levels of <b>perceived</b> physical <b>competence</b> and would participate less in physical activity than their nonawkward peers. Finally, a positive relationship between motor performance and <b>perceived</b> physical <b>competence</b> was expected. There were no significant differences found in <b>perceived</b> physical <b>competence</b> between the two groups. However, nonawkward children participated significantly more in community sports and were significantly more active during free play than children with physical awkwardness.

40|$|The {{present study}} used a person-centred {{approach}} {{to examine whether}} different profiles based on actual and <b>perceived</b> motor <b>competence</b> exist in elementary school children. Multilevel regression {{analyses were conducted to}} explore how children with different motor competence-based profiles might differ in their autonomous motivation for sports and global self-worth. Validated questionnaires were administered to 161 children (40 % boys; age= 8. 82 ± 0. 66 years) to assess their <b>perceived</b> motor <b>competence,</b> global self-worth, and motivation for sports. Actual motor competence was measured with the Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder. Cluster analyses identified four motor competence-based profiles: two groups were characterized by corresponding levels of actual and <b>perceived</b> motor <b>competence</b> (i. e., low-low and high-high) and two groups were characterized by divergent levels of actual and <b>perceived</b> motor <b>competence</b> (i. e., high-low and low-high). Children in the low-low and high-low group displayed significantly lower levels of autonomous motivation for sports and lower levels of global self-worth than children in the low-high and high-high group. These findings emphasize that fostering children's <b>perceived</b> motor <b>competence</b> might be crucial to improve their motivation for sports and their global self-worth.

40|$|Background: During {{the last}} years, {{children}} have become less physically active. Promotion {{of physical activity}} is influenced by many determinants; therefore {{it is essential to}} get insight in those determinants and their mutual relationships. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the influence of motor performance, <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> and task values on physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) in healthy school aged-children. Furthermore, we investigate the possible mediating function of <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> on the influence of motor performance on PA and SB. Methods: This study has an explorative cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 282 children (48 % girls) in grades 2 and 4 of elementary school in The Netherlands. PA and SB were measured using an activity diary, motor performance was measured using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children version 2 and <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> and task values were measured using previously validated questionnaires. Results: For both PA and SB in the total group, <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> is significantly and positively influenced by motor performance. There is a significant and negative influence of <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> on SB in the total group. Other influences are not significant. Conclusion: There is a possible complete mediating function of <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence</b> for the influence of motor performance on PA or SB. Implications of key findings: The results of this study show that we should take into account more variables (e. g. motor performance and <b>perceived</b> athletic <b>competence)</b> than only the levels of PA and/or SB in promoting children’s PA and decreasing their level of SB. Possibly, PA and SB should be seen as two different constructs in the promotion of children’s PA.

40|$|Purpose: Motor {{skills are}} {{considered}} a prerequisite to physical activity, yet the relationship may be reciprocal and <b>perceived</b> sports <b>competence</b> might mediate associations. Methods: In 2006 / 2007, 215 adolescents completed motor skill proficiency (Get Skilled Get Active), <b>perceived</b> sport <b>competence</b> (Physical Self-Perception Profile) and physical activity assessments (Adolescent Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire) {{as part of the}} Physical Activity and Skills Study. Using AMOS (Version 7. 0), reciprocal relationships were examined between motor skill (object control and locomotor) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

Results: Mean age was 16. 4 yr (SD = 0. 6), 51. 6 % (111 / 215) were females. A reciprocal relationship between object control and MVPA and a one-way relationship from MVPA to locomotor skill was found. When <b>perceived</b> sports <b>competence</b> was examined as a mediator, the best-fitting model versions explained 16 % (R&sup 2; = 0. 16) MVPA variation, and 30 % object control (R&sup 2; = 0. 30), and 12 % locomotor skill variation (R&sup 2; = 0. 12) (reverse relationship). <b>Perceived</b> sports <b>competence</b> partially mediates the relationship between object control proficiency and physical activity for both directions and fully mediates the relationship between physical activity and locomotor skill; but only when locomotor skill is the outcome.

Through the psychological process of moral disengagement, individuals deactivate negative self sanctions for antisocial behavior (Bandura, 1991). In reducing self sanctions, individuals can engage in antisocial behavior without the experience of negative emotions, such as guilt and shame. Emerging research has advanced the understanding of antecedents of moral disengagement (Boardley 2 ̆ 6 Kavussanu, 2010; Gaines, 2010; Hodge 2 ̆ 6 Lonsdale, 2011). To further expand the knowledge base, the current study was designed to address the relationship of several self-related variables to moral disengagement and antisocial behavior. More specifically, global self-worth, perceived physical, social, and behavioral competence, and guilt, shame, and externalization proneness were investigated as antecedents of moral disengagement and antisocial behavior. Moreover, moral disengagement was investigated as a possible mediator of the associations among the self-related variables and antisocial behavior. ^ Male (n = 137) and female (n = 56) lacrosse players from 12 high schools in Indiana completed self-report measures of global self-worth, perceived physical, social, and behavioral competence, guilt proneness, shame proneness, externalization proneness, moral disengagement and antisocial behavior. Multiple regression analyses revealed that <b>perceived</b> behavioral <b>competence,</b> guilt proneness, and shame proneness negatively predicted and externalization proneness positively predicted moral disengagement. <b>Perceived</b> physical <b>competence,</b> <b>perceived</b> behavioral <b>competence,</b> and guilt proneness negatively predicted antisocial behavior. Moral disengagement at least partially mediated the relationship of <b>perceived</b> behavioral <b>competence,</b> guilt proneness, shame proneness, and externalization proneness with antisocial behavior. Results for global self-worth, <b>perceived</b> social <b>competence,</b> and <b>perceived</b> physical <b>competence</b> provided additional insight into moral disengagement and antisocial behavior in sport. ^ The current study provides empirical support for the importance of the self in sport-related moral disengagement. <b>Perceived</b> behavioral <b>competence</b> and guilt, shame, and externalization proneness explained a meaningful proportion of variance in moral disengagement, suggesting that individual perceptions and emotions are important contributors to athlete moral disengagement. Moreover, the current study extends previous research addressing the link of moral disengagement with antisocial behavior. Taken together, the findings of the current study offer a platform for future research. Future research that targets additional self-related variables, incorporates environment-related constructs, and employs longitudinal and experimental designs will meaningfully extend the knowledge base. As understanding of moral disengagement and antisocial behavior deepens, practitioners can use this knowledge to develop efficacious strategies to decrease moral disengagement and antisocial behavior and to foster positive development through sport participation. ...|$|R
40|$|Children with {{developmental}} coordination disorder (DCD) are {{often referred to}} as clumsy because of their compromised motor coordination.

Children receive a great deal of comparative information on their academic performances, which influence a student's sense of scholastic competence and self-efficacy. The amount of perceived academic self-efficacy has significant impact on academic performance, their willingness to complete academic tasks, and their self-motivation to improve where necessary.
