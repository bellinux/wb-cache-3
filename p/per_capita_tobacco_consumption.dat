40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Background: Tobacco is an {{important}} risk factor, resulting in 6. 3 million deaths annually. Prevalence estimates are often used to quantify the impact of tobacco but do not capture the intensity of smoking. Tobacco consumption estimates often draw on production data at the national level. There are currently no robust estimates of tobacco consumption by age or sex across countries. Methods: Data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, World Health Organization STEPwise approach to Surveillance, and the World Health Survey were combined to estimate prevalence and consumption by age and sex in 103 countries. Survey-based consumption estimates were compared to national production-based consumption estimates from the US Department of Agriculture. Results: For both men and women, consumption increases with age and peaks in ages 45 - 54 before declining in the oldest ages. The peak in consumption is more pronounced in men than in women and men generally have higher consumption levels than women. There is a significant positive relationship between consumption and prevalence that is strongest for males and in younger ages. Production-based national consumption estimates and survey-based national consumption estimates are a fairly good approximation. Conclusions: Using the standard production-based national estimates of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> masks significant trends by age and sex which could be important to direct resource allocation, identify high risk populations, or inform public policy. Consumption estimates can supplement traditional prevalence measures to more thoroughly examine population exposure to tobacco...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that tobacco control funding in California has reduced <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> cigarette consumption and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> healthcare expenditures. This paper refines our earlier model by estimating the effect of California tobacco control funding on current smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption per smoker and the effect of prevalence and consumption on <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> healthcare expenditures. The results are used to calculate new estimates of the effect of the California Tobacco Program. Using state-specific aggregate data, current smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption per smoker are modeled as functions of cumulative California and control states' <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> control funding, cigarette price, and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income. <b>Per</b> <b>capita</b> healthcare expenditures are modeled as a function of prevalence of current smoking, cigarette consumption per smoker, and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income. One additional dollar of cumulative <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> control funding is associated with reduction in current smoking prevalence of 0. 0497 (SE. 00347) percentage points and current smoker cigarette consumption of 1. 39 (SE. 132) packs per smoker per year. Reductions of one percentage point in current smoking prevalence and one pack smoked per smoker are associated with $ 35. 4 (SE $ 9. 85) and $ 3. 14 (SE. 786) reductions in <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> healthcare expenditure, respectively (2010 dollars), using the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) measure of healthcare spending.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} relationship between <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> control expenditures, cigarette consumption, and healthcare expenditures {{in the state of}} Arizona. Arizona's tobacco control program, which was established in 1994, concentrates on youth uptake of smoking and avoids public policy and commentary on the tobacco industry. We use a cointegrating time series analysis using aggregate data on healthcare and tobacco control expenditures, cigarette consumption and prices and other data. We find there is a strong association between <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> healthcare expenditure and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> cigarette consumption. In the long run, a marginal increase in annual cigarette consumption of one pack <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> increases <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> healthcare expenditure by $ 19. 5 (SE $ 5. 45) in Arizona. A cumulative increase of $ 1. 00 in the difference between control state and Arizona <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> control expenditures increases the difference in cigarette consumption by 0. 190 (SE 0. 0780) packs <b>per</b> <b>capita.</b> Between 1996 and 2004, Arizona's tobacco control program was associated with a cumulative reduction in cigarette consumption of 200 million packs (95 % CI 39. 0 million packs, 364 million packs) worth $ 500 million (95 % CI: $ 99 million, $ 896 million) in pre-tax cigarette sales to the tobacco industry. The cumulative healthcare savings was $ 2. 33 billion (95 % CI $ 0. 37 billion, $ 5. 00 billion) and the cumulative reduction in cigarette. Arizona's tobacco control expenditures are associated with reduced cigarette consumption and healthcare expenditures, amounting to about 10 times the cost of the program through 2004. This return on investment, while large, was less than the more aggressive California program, which did not limit its focus to youth and included tobacco industry denomalization messages.

40|$|S AMMENDRAG Antall årlige dødsofre av tobakksrøyking anslås nå til 3 millioner (alle land samlet); i 2025 vil det være 10 millioner, hvis ikke røykemønstret endres. Storstilt global forebyggende innsats har latt vente på seg, vesentlig p. g. a. tobakksindustriens motstand og myndighetenes lunkenhet. Det er påvist virkning av en rekke tiltak, bl. a. reklameforbud, helseadvarsler på pakkene, avgiftsøkninger og røykerestriksjoner. For å skape et effektivt program er det nødvendig med solid faglig ekspertise, sterke pressgrupper, engasjerte byråkrater og handlekraftige politikere. Canada har for tiden det mest avanserte program. Norge lå bra an i 1970 -årene, men sakket noe av i 80 -årene. Tobakksforbruket steg inntil ca. 1975, men er falt senere. Det samme gjelder prosent dagligrøykere blant elever i grunnskolen. Det har vært en nedgang i dagligrøyking blant menn; blant kvinner er det hittil liten endring, unntatt blant de yngste, som har nedgang. Utviklingen i de fattige landene er mest bekymringsfull.

This number will increase to 10 million by year 2025 if today's pattern of smoking continues. Large-scale global preventive action is long in coming, mainly due to resistance of the tobacco industry and a lukewarm attitude on the part of national governments. Various measures, such as a ban on advertising, health warnings on packaging, tax increases and restrictions on smoking, have been shown to work. Prerequisites for an effective programme are highly qualified professional expertise, strong pressure groups, dedicated bureaucrats and energetically involved politicians. Canada has the most advanced programme at present. Norway's efforts compared favourably in the 1970 s, but slowed down in the 1980 s. <b>Per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> increased up to about 1975, but has since declined. The same applies to the percentage of smokers in the lower secondary schools. The prevalence of daily smoking has declined among men; little change has been observed in women, except in the youngest age group, where smoking has decreased. Developments in the poor countries of the world give greatest cause for concern. Norwegian politicians should actively urge the United Nations to adopt an international convention on tobacco control. </span...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • In 2002, 22. 7 % of Nebraskans {{over the}} age of 18 were current smokers, {{accounting}} for approximately 389, 000 smokers. • Since 1995, the prevalence of adult tobacco use in Nebraska has remained about 1 percentage point below the national average, but <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> in Nebraska has been falling more slowly than the Unites States as whole. • The tobacco industry has directly been a major political force in Nebraska through lobbying and campaign contributions. The tobacco industry spent over $ 1, 027, 000 on lobbying from 1997 - 2002. The tobacco industry made direct campaign contributions {{to the members of the}} 2003 - 2004 Nebraska Legislature totaling almost $ 93, 000 over the course of their legislative careers. • Only 20 of the 49 members of the 2003 - 2004 Legislature have never accepted money from the tobacco industry. • The tobacco industry has also worked to increase its political influence in Nebraska by recruiting, often through financial contributions, third-party allies such as the Nebraska Restaurant Association, the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, the Nebraska Retail Grocers Association, the Nebraska Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association, the Nebraska Retail Federation, the Nebraska Association of Tobacco and Candy Distributors and the Nebraska Licensed Beverage Association. • Despite opposition from the tobacco industry and its allies and the lack of a well-established grassroots tobacco control community, Nebraska was an early leader in passing statewide clean indoor air laws. Due largely to the efforts of state Senator Shirley Marsh, the Nebraska Legislature passed its first clean indoor air law in 1974, only one year after Arizona passed the first law in the nation that required smoking restrictions in some public places. • In 1979, the Nebraska Legislature passed the Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act, which was sponsored by state Senator Larry Stoney. The Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act was stronger than similar legislation that was proposed in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts at the same time. The tobacco industry and its allies responded by mobilizing against the implementing rules and regulations for the Act and succeeded in weakened these regulations. • The Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act was not strengthened for 20 years until 1999 when the Legislature passed a bill that required that almost all state buildings and vehicles become smokefree. • From 2000 - 2003, the Legislature also strengthened the Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act by requiring that commercial daycare facilities be smokefree and extending its enforcement provisions to include business owners. 					 • From 1999 - 2004, the Nebraska Legislature has rejected three different attempts by state Senator Nancy Thompson to make restaurants throughout Nebraska smokefree. • Using tobacco settlement money, in 2000, the Nebraska Legislature approved $ 7 million per year for three years to increase funding for a preexisting state tobacco control program, Tobacco Free Nebraska. • Due to pressure from tobacco control advocates, the Nebraska Legislature approved a $ 0. 30 cigarette excise tax increase in 2002, but the Legislature was only willing to pass this increase during a budget crisis and no earmark was provided for tobacco control. • Citing budget concerns in 2003, the Legislature cut funding for Tobacco Free Nebraska from $ 7 million per year to $ 405, 000, despite several different options for continuing funding for tobacco control. • In 2003, the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department led the push to pass Nebraska first comprehensive smokefree workplaces ordinances, but due to pressure from the tobacco industry and its allies, the Lincoln City Council passed a weakened and confusing ordinance that exempted bars and allowed separately ventilated “smoking rooms. ” • Tobacco control advocates have made progress in Nebraska, but they have not yet mobilized the political resources necessary to avoid suffering significant defeats at the hands of the tobacco industry...|$|E
40|$|TOBACCO USE IN CALIFORNIA DETAILED FINDINGS SUMMARIZED BY CHAPTER Chapter 4. ASSESSING PROGRESS TOWARD PROGRAM GOALS 1. Between 1990 and 1993, the {{proportion}} of California children and nonsmoking workers who were protected from ETS exposure increased substantially. 2. Cigarette consumption in California declined by an estimated 13. 7 % following the passage of Proposition 99 and the mandated increase in excise tax on cigarette products. This accelerated decline in consumption lasted approximately 5 months after the imposition of the 25 -cent tax. 3. The introduction of Tobacco Control Program interventions was associated {{with an increase in}} the rate of decline in cigarette consumption. 4. Between 1988 and 1993, we observed a 27 % decrease in <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> and a 28 % decline in smoking prevalence. Based on mUltiple surveys, the best estimate of smoking prevalence in 1993 among California adults is 19. 1 %. 5. Following the passage of Proposition 99, smoking prevalence declined at twice the rate observed before Proposition 99. However, this new rate of decline must be increased by a further 50 % in order to achieve the Program goal of a 75 % reduction in prevalence by 1999. 6. Smoking prevalence among 16 - to 18 -year-old Californians appeared to be increasing sharply following the introduction of the "Joe Camel" tobacco advertising campaign. We were unable to identify a decline in prevalence associated with the imposition of the excise tax. No further increases in adolescent smoking prevalence were observed following the introduction of the Tobacco Control Program. 7. The decline in tobacco consumption and smoking prevalence in California appears to result from increases in successful smoking cessation among adults. 8. Popular support for a further increase in the excise tax on tobacco has grown. In 1993, 60 % of Californians indicated support for an additional increase in the excise tax of at least 50 cents, provided that the money would be used for antitobacco and other health programs. Under these conditions, two thirds of current smokers favored an increase of at least 25 cents in the tobacco tax. Chapter 5. THE IMPACT OF THE ANTITOBACCO MASS MEDIA CAMPAIGN IN CALIFORNIA 1. A period of accelerated decline in per capita cigarette consumption in California began in April 1990, coinciding with the start of the mass media campaign. During a 12 -month period, consumption declined by 12 %. At this time, the media campaign was the only major tobacco control intervention in the field. 2. The proportion of Californians who attempted to quit smoking for more than 1 day increased whenever the mass media campaign was in the field and decreased during the period when the campaign was withdrawn. 3. More than half of California adults and more than two thirds of adolescents recalled seeing the antitobacco mass media campaign. 4. Adults who saw the media campaign were more likely than adults who did not see the campaign to believe that ETS is harmful to nonsmokers, especially to children. 5. Adults who saw the media campaign were more likely than adults who did not see the campaign to ask someone not to smoke. Almost 60 % of smokers reported that they had been asked not to smoke on at least one occasion. 6. Half of Californians had voluntarily made their homes smokefree by 1993. The number of smokers reporting a smokefree home increased substantially between 1992 and 1993. Smokers who had young children in the home were more likely than smokers living without children to report a smokefree home. 7. Smokefree home policies were more likely if adults believed in the danger ofETS to nonsmokers. The spread of smokefree homes in California may be an indirect effect of the media campaign. Chapter 6. TOBACCO MARKETING AND SMOKING IN SCHOOLS AS BARRIERS TOEFFECTIVE ADOLESCENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS 1. Adolescents appear to be the most receptive audience for tobacco advertising. Awareness and liking of cigarette advertisements is higher among adolescents than among adults in California. Liking and awareness of the "Joe Camel" cigarette campaign was highest in the youngest agegroup studied (12 to 14 years). 2. Two thirds of adolescents have a favorite cigarette ad, and one quarter are willing to use products promoting tobacco...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to model lung cancer {{mortality}} {{as a function of}} past exposure to tobacco and to forecast age-sex-specific lung cancer mortality rates. A 3 -factor age-period-cohort (APC) model, in which the period variable is replaced by the product of average tar content and adult <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita,</b> was estimated for the US, UK, Canada and Australia by the maximum likelihood method. Age- and sex-specific <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> was estimated from historical data on smoking prevalence and total <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption.</b> Lung cancer mortality was derived from vital registration records. Future <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption,</b> tar content and the cohort parameter were projected by autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) estimation. The optimal exposure variable was found to be the product of average tar content and adult cigarette consumption <b>per</b> <b>capita,</b> lagged for 2530 years {{for both males and females}} in all 4 countries. The coefficient of the product of average tar content and <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> differs by age and sex. In all models, there was a statistically significant difference in the coefficient of the period variable by sex. In all countries, male age-standardized lung cancer mortality rates peaked in the 1980 s and declined thereafter. Female mortality rates are projected to peak in the first decade of this century. The multiplicative models of age, tobacco exposure and cohort fit the observed data between 1950 and 1999 reasonably well, and time-series models yield plausible past trends of relevant variables. Despite a significant reduction in <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> and average tar content of cigarettes sold over the past few decades, the effect on lung cancer mortality is affected by the time lag between exposure and established disease. As a result, the burden of lung cancer among females is only just reaching, or soon will reach, its peak but has been declining for I to 2 decades in men. Future sex differences in lung cancer mortality are likely to be greater in North America than Australia and the UK due to differences in exposure patterns between the sexes.

40|$|Combustible and {{smokeless}} tobacco use causes adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and multiple {{types of cancer}} (1, 2). Standard approaches for measuring tobacco use include self-reported surveys of use and consumption estimates based on tobacco excise tax data (3, 4). To provide the most recently available <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates in the United States, CDC used federal excise tax data to estimate total and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> consumption during 2000 - 2015 for combustible tobacco (cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, small cigars, and large cigars) and {{smokeless tobacco}} (chewing tobacco and dry snuff). During this period, total combustible <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> decreased 33. 5 %, or 43. 7 % <b>per</b> <b>capita.</b> Although total cigarette consumption decreased 38. 7 %, cigarettes remained {{the most commonly used}} combustible tobacco product. Total noncigarette combustible tobacco (i. e., cigars, roll-your-own, and pipe <b>tobacco)</b> <b>consumption</b> increased 117. 1 %, or 83. 8 % <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> during 2000 - 2015. Total <b>consumption</b> of smokeless <b>tobacco</b> increased 23. 1 %, or 4. 2 % <b>per</b> <b>capita.</b> Notably, total cigarette consumption was 267. 0 billion cigarettes in 2015 compared with 262. 7 billion in 2014. These findings indicate that although cigarette smoking declined overall during 2000 - 2015, and each year from 2000 to 2014, the number of cigarettes consumed in 2015 was higher than in 2014, and the first time annual cigarette consumption was higher than the previous year since 1973.

We assessed the overall ecological associations between mortality and factors amenable to public health. These amenable factors included addictive and nutritional lifestyle, air quality, public health spending, healthcare coverage, and immunizations. Methods We used a pooled cross-sectional, time series analysis with corrected fixed effects regression models in an ecological design involving eighteen member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development during the period 1970 to 1999. Results Alcohol, <b>tobacco,</b> and fat <b>consumption,</b> and sometimes, air pollution {{were significantly associated with}} higher all-cause mortality and premature death. Immunizations, health care coverage, fruit/vegetable and protein consumption, and collective health expenditure had negative effects on mortality and premature death, even after controlling for the elderly, density of practicing physicians, doctor visits and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP. However, <b>tobacco,</b> air pollution, and fruit/vegetable intake were sometimes sensitive to adjustments. Conclusion Mortality and premature deaths could be improved by focusing on factors that are amenable to public health policies.

This study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing the association between POS advertising bans and youths' experimental smoking. Methods: Global Youth Tobacco Surveys from 130 countries during 2007 - 2011 were linked to the WHO “MPOWER” tobacco control policy measures to analyze the association between POS advertising bans (a dichotomous measure of the existence of such bans) and experimental smoking using weighted logistic regressions. All analyses were clustered at the country level and controlled for age, parents' smoking status, GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita,</b> and country-level <b>tobacco</b> control scores in monitoring tobacco use, protecting people from smoke, offering help to quit, warning about the dangers of tobacco, enforcing promotion/advertising bans, and raising taxes on tobacco. Results: The results suggest that a POS advertising ban is significantly associated with reduced experimental smoking among youth (OR = 0. 63, p p p < 0. 001). Conclusions: POS advertising bans are significantly associated with reduced experimental smoking among youth.

The present study applies Ng- Perron test to investigate stationarity, ARDL bounds testing approach to examine {{the existence}} of long run relationship and Granger Causality test for estimating short run, long run and combined short run and long run triangular causality among the variables for the time series data of Pakistan from 1972 - 2009. The present study exposes that there exists long run relationship among real GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita,</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> education expenditures and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> health expenditures in Pakistan. There exists bidirectional relationship between <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> real GDP and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> education expenditures in the short run, whereas <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> health expenditures and real GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> do not granger cause each other in short run in Pakistan. Also, there exits bidirectional granger causality among real GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita,</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> education expenditures and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> health expenditures in long run in Pakistan. The present study also confirms {{the existence of}} joint causality among real GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita,</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> education expenditures and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> health expenditures in both short run and long run in Pakistan.

Also {{the validity of the}} Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis has been tested for these countries. Short-run Granger causality tests show the existence of a unidirectional causality running from the square of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> output to <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> CO 2 emissions and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> non-renewable energy consumption and a unidirectional causality running from <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> real exports to <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> CO 2 emissions. There is an indirect short-run causality running from <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> output to <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> non-renewable energy consumption. In the long-run, the FMOLS and DOLS estimates suggest that <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> non-renewable energy consumption {{have a positive impact on}} <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> CO 2 emissions. The long-run estimates suggest that the square of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP, <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> renewable energy consumption, and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> real exports and imports have a negative impact on <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> CO 2 emissions. Therefore, more trade openness and more use of renewable energy are efficient strategies to combat global warming. ...|$|R

There are wide variations in <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> across age, sex, regions and socio-economic classes. This {{study was conducted to}} understand the wide inequalities in patterns of smoking and smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> across various States of India. Methods: Analysis was conducted on Global Adult Tobacco Survey, India (2009 - 2010) data. Prevalence of both forms of tobacco use and its association with socio-economic determinants was assessed across States and Union Territories of India. Wealth indices were calculated using socio-economic data of the survey. Concentration index of inequality and one way ANOVA assessed economic inequality in <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> and variation of <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> across quintiles. Multiple logistic regression was done for <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> and wealth index adjusting for age, sex, area, education and occupation. Results: Overall prevalence of smoking and smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> was 13. 9 per cent (14. 6, 13. 3) and 25. 8 per cent (26. 6, 25. 0), respectively. Prevalence of current smoking varied from 1. 6 per cent (richest quintile in Odisha) to 42. 2 per cent (poorest quintile in Meghalaya). Prevalence of current smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> varied from 1. 7 per cent (richest quintile in Jammu and Kashmir) to 59. 4 per cent (poorest quintile in Mizoram). Decreasing odds of <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> with increasing wealth was observed in most of the States. Reverse trend of <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> was observed in Nagaland. Significant difference in odds of smoking and smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> with wealth quintiles was observed. Concentration index of inequality was significant for smoking tobacco - 0. 7 (- 0. 62 to- 0. 78) and not significant for smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> - 0. 15 (0. 01 to- 0. 33) Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of our analysis indicate that tobacco control policy and public health interventions need to consider widespread socio-economic inequities in <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> across the States in India...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data of the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study (AGAHLS) were used to study the association between voluntary changes in <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> and changes in biological risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) during 4 - 6 years of follow-up in 165 men and 195 women aged 21 - 36 years. We used multiple linear regression analyses with corrections for age and changes in other lifestyles. RESULTS: In both sexes, we found trends for a reduction in blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body weight, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and {{a rise in the}} ratio between total serum cholesterol (TC) and HDL-C (TC/HDL-C) with increasing <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption.</b> Opposite trends were found with reducing <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption.</b> In women, body weight, WHR, and waist circumference reduced significantly and independently with increasing <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> and increased significantly with decreasing <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption.</b> CONCLUSION: These results suggest that voluntary changes in <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> go together with both healthy and unhealthy changes in biological risk factors for CV...|$|R

Real <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> incomes in Chinese regions did display strong convergence while the <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP did not show either strong convergence or divergence during the first phase of central planning, 1952 - 67. During the Cultural Revolution, 1967 - 78, regional disparities in <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP widened, but the <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income did not show strong convergence or divergence. Not until market-oriented reforms started in 1978 did regional <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> incomes and regional <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP begin to converge sharply simultaneously, a phenomenon which strongly associated with the rise in rural productivity during the period 1978 - 84. However, the story changed somewhat during the second stage of reforms from 1984 to 92. With further deepening of the urban reforms, in particular, when more and more coastal provinces were allowed to integrate themselves with the outside world, the regional <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income inequality widened although the regional <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP maintained the tendency towards convergence.

Information on the <b>tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> status of 6, 618 individuals (52. 1 % males, 47. 9 % females), aged over 15 years, was collected in 1994. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were done. Individuals were categorized as consumers if they consumed tobacco in any form at all, i. e. smoke or chew. The independent variables included various characteristics of individuals and households. Overall, 43. 4 % of the study subjects consumed tobacco. Males were 9. 38 times more likely to consume tobacco than their female counterparts. Individuals with no education were 3. 62 times more likely to consume tobacco than those who had completed six or more years of schooling, and the poor were almost twice as likely to consume tobacco than the rich. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>consumption</b> in both smoke and chewing form has been a part of household consumption in Bangladesh from time immemorial.
