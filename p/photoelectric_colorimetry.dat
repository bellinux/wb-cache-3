Potassium was presioitated by The addition of silver cobaltinitrite solution to serum,The precioitate thus formed was purified by centrifugation and washing,and dissolved in sodium thiosulfate solution,Theresultant solution was treated by choline chloride and potassium ferrocyanide {{to produce a}} emerald green color which was suitable for <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimetry.</b> This procedure was recommended for The routine lablratory work,because it was simple as well as reliable...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{quantity}} {{of people with}} bone pathology causes the urgency of finding the new reconstruction materials. However, their application may experience different side effects that result the rejection reactions. Materials based on hydroxyapatite are {{the most widely used}} in osteoplasty as this material is characterized by its non-toxicity, biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. Hydroxyapatite in its chemical composition is analogous to the mineral constituent of bone, contributing to its regeneration. Aim: The aim is to develop a comprehensive methodology to study the behavior of basalt scales and compositional system “hydroxyapatite + basalt scales” in environments that simulate fluids of living body. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive approach that includes specific preparing of samples and biological environments and complex chemical, photoelectric colorimetric and X-ray studies were applied to evaluate the biochemical stability of the studied material. Calibration curves were prepared during <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimetry</b> to determine the amount of substance. Two methods of sample preparation were used to determine the amount of total iron in the filtrate during the study of biochemical stability of the composition systems “hydroxyapatite + basalt scales” in physiological environments. Results: Based on the multichemical analysis it can be concluded about the physical and chemical stability in interaction of studied basalt scales powders and composite systems “hydroxyapatite + basalt scales” with the blood plasma and Ringer's solution and Ringer-Locke solution that imitate the fluid of a living body...|$|E
