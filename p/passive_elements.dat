25|$|West Village, {{located on}} the University of California campus in Davis, California, was the largest ZNE-planned {{community}} in North America {{at the time of}} its opening in 2014. The development contains student housing for approximately 1,980 UC Davis students as well as leasable office space and community amenities including a community center, pool, gym, restaurant and convenience store. Office spaces in the development are currently leased by energy and transportation-related University programs. The project was a public-private partnership between the university and West Village Community Partnership LLC, led by Carmel Partners of San Francisco, a private developer, who entered into a 60-year ground lease with the university and was responsible for the design, construction, and implementation of the $300 million project, which is intended to be market-rate housing for Davis. This is unique as the developer designed the project to achieve ZNE at no added cost to themselves or to the residents. Designed and modeled to achieve ZNE, the project uses a mixture of <b>passive</b> <b>elements</b> (roof overhangs, well-insulated walls, radiant heat barriers, ducts in insulated spaces, etc.) as well as active approaches (occupancy sensors on lights, high-efficiency appliances and lighting, etc.). Designed to out-perform California's 2008 Title 24 energy codes by 50%, the project produced 87% of the energy it consumed during its first year in operation. The shortcoming in ZNE status is attributed to several factors, including improperly functioning heat pump water heaters, which have since been fixed. Occupant behavior is significantly different than anticipated, with the all-student population using more energy on a per-capita basis than typical inhabitants of single-family homes in the area. One of the primary factors driving increased energy use appears to be the increased miscellaneous electrical loads (MEL, or plug loads) in the form of mini-refrigerators, lights, computers, gaming consoles, televisions, and other electronic equipment. The university continues to work with the developer to identify strategies for achieving ZNE status. These approaches include incentivizing occupant behavior and increasing the site's renewable energy capacity, which is a 4 MW photovoltaic array per the original design. The West Village site is also home to the Honda Smart Home US, a beyond-ZNE single-family home that incorporates cutting-edge technologies in energy management, lighting, construction, and water efficiency.|$|E

[...] There is both excitatory and inhibitory feedback between {{the left and}} right flexor and extensor ventral roots of a given spinal cord segment. [...] There also exists a caudorostral excitability gradient that mediates interlimb coordination between the lumbar and cervical CPGs. [...] This is largely single direction feedback, with the lumbar generators affecting the cervical generators, but not vice versa. [...] This longitudinal feedback occurs both because of direct projections of lumbar neurons to cervical neurons, but also because of intermediate projections throughout the thoracic segments of the spinal cord. [...] These thoracic segments are not simply <b>passive</b> <b>elements</b> in the network, but are rhythmically active with the lumbar generators.|$|E

For example, a memory cell of the 1940s consisted of two triodes and a dozen passive components and ran at frequencies up to 200kHz. A MHz response could be achieved with two pentodes and six diodes per cell. This cell could be replaced by one thyratron with a load resistor and an input capacitor, but the operating frequency of such circuit did not exceed a few kHz.|$|E

Thus, these numerical results corroborate that the monitoring signal and <b>passive</b> <b>element</b> (FBG) do not affect the quality of the downstream signals.

50|$|A Yagi-Uda array uses <b>passive</b> <b>elements</b> {{to greatly}} {{increase}} gain. It is built along a support boom that is {{pointed toward the}} signal, and thus sees no induced signal and does {{not contribute to the}} antenna's operation. The end closer to the source {{is referred to as the}} front. Near the rear is a single active element, typically a half-wave dipole or folded dipole. <b>Passive</b> <b>elements</b> are arranged in front (directors) and behind (reflectors) the active element along the boom. The Yagi has the inherent quality that it becomes increasingly directional, and thus has higher gain, as the number of elements increases. However, this also makes it increasingly sensitive to changes in frequency; if the signal frequency changes, not only does the active element receive less energy directly, but all of the <b>passive</b> <b>elements</b> adding to that signal also decrease their output as well and their signals no longer reach the active element in-phase.|$|E

This additional element is called memristor. It only has any meaning as a time-dependent non-linear element; as a time-independent linear element it reduces to a regular resistor.
