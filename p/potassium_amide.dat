2500|$|Toluene {{derivatives}} with heteroatom-containing substituents in the ortho position undergo site-selective benzylic lithiation in {{the presence}} of organolithium compounds (either alkyllithiums or lithium dialkylamides). Coordination of the Lewis acidic lithium atom to the Lewis basic heteroatom, as well as inductive effects derived from the electronegativity of the heteroatom, encourage selective deprotonation at the benzylic position. Competitive ring metalation (directed ortho-metalation) is an important side reaction, but a judicious choice of base often allows for selective benzylic metalation. Useful heteroatom-containing directing groups include dialkylamines, amides (secondary or tertiary), ketone enolates, carbamates, and sulfonates. Lateral lithiation of alkyl-substituted heterocycles incorporating heteroatom-containing substituents is also possible, although ring lithiation α to the ring heteroatom may compete with lateral lithiation. The products of lateral lithiation react with a variety of electrophiles, including reactive alkyl halides (allylic, benzylic, and primary), carbonyl compounds, silyl and stannyl chlorides, disulfides and diselenides, and others.

The reactions were found to proceed according to S N (AE) -, S N (EA) - and S N (AE a) -mechanisms and/or ring openings. The open-chain compounds formed in the latter process close either to the same (S N (ANRORC) - mechanism) or a new ring system (ring transformation) (ChapterIn this connection we studied reactions of 3 -bromopyridine 1 -oxides with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia and reactions of 4 -X- 6 -methyl-(phenyl) pyrimidine 1 -oxides with liquid ammonia and <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia. It was found that the reaction of 3 -bromopyridine 1 -oxide with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia in the presence of isopropylamine affords 3 -amino- and 3 -(isopropylamino) pyridine 1 -oxide whereas 3 -bromopyridine 1 -oxide remains unchanged in a mixture of liquid ammonia and isopro pylamine alone. These results affirm the previous hypothesis, that the amination of 3 -bromopyridine 1 -oxide with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia proceeds by the S N (EA) -mechanism via 2, 3 -didehydropyridine 1 -oxide (Chapter 2). 3 -Bromo- 6 -methylpyridine 1 -oxide was converted into 4 -amino- (main product), 3 -amino- and 2 -amino- 6 -methylpyridine 1 -oxide by <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia, whereas 3 -bromo- 6 -ethoxypyridine 1 -oxide when treated with the same reagent only yielded 3 -amino- 6 -ethoxypyridine 1 -oxide Thus the methyl group occupying the 6 -position changes the pathway of the amination of 3 -bromopyridine 1 -oxide, whereas the ethoxy group at the C(6) -atom does not. This difference can be explained by assuming that the methyl derivative is partly deprotonated yielding an anionic group which has a strong mesomeric interaction with the N-oxide group leading to a change of the charge distribution in the ring of the substrate. This causes the occurrence of a second reaction pathway, an S N (EA) -mechanism via 3, 4 -didehydro- 6 -methylpyridine 1 -oxide (Chapter 2). The reaction of 3 -bromoquinoline 1 -oxide with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia affords 3 -hydroxy- 4 -[3 -amino- 2 -quinolyl]quinoline 1 -oxide together with 3 - and 4 -aminoquinoline 1 -oxide. These products must be formed via 3, 4 -didehydroquinoline 1 -oxide as an intermediate. That 3 -bromoquinoline 1 -oxide reacts differently from 3 -bromopyridine 1 -oxide is caused by the fused benzogroup which changes the charge distribution in the substrate considerably and enhances the stability of the intermediary 3, 4 -didehydroquinoline 1 -oxide compared to that of 2, 3 -didehydroquinoline 1 -oxide (Chapter 2). The oxidation of 4 -X- 6 -methyl(phenyl) pyrimidines (X=Cl, Br and OC 6 H 5 can theoretically give two isomeric N-oxides (N(1) - and N(3) -oxide). The structure determination of the formed 4 -X- 6 - methyl(phenyl) pyrimidine N-oxides was based on the structure of 4 - chloro- 6 -methyl(phenyl) pyrimidine 1 -oxide which was established by means of PMR spectroscopy on the dechlorinated compound (Chapter 3). The reactions of 4 -chloro- 6 -methyl(phenyl) pyrimidine 1 -oxide with liquid ammonia and with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia yield a compound formed by amino-dechlorination, 4 -amino- 6 -methyl(phenyl) pyrimidine 1 -oxide and a ringtransformation product, 5 -amino- 3 -methyl(phenyl) isoxazole. The results of the reactions of 4 -chloro- 6 -methyl- and 4 -chloro- 6 -phenyl-[l(3) - 15 N]pyrimidine 1 -oxide with liquid ammonia and with pot assium amide in liquid ammonia indicate that an S N (ANRORC) -mechanism is not operative in the conversion to the 4 -amino- 6 -methyl- and 4 -amino- 6 -phenylpyrimidine 1 -oxide respectively. Furthermore it could be established that the dechlorination in liquid ammonia does not take place via a 4, 5 -didehydropyrimidine 1 -oxide as intermediate, but according to an S N (AE) -process. This is {{based on the results of}} the reaction of 4 -chloro- 5 -deutero- 6 -phenylpyrimidine 1 -oxide The amino-dechlorination of the same substrate with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia presumably takes place via the same pathway. This result is supported by studying the reactions of 4 -chloro- 5, 6 -diphenylpyrimidine 1 -oxide in both media. 4 -Amino- 5, 6 -diphenylpyrimidine 1 -oxide as well as 5 -amino- 3, 4 -diphenyl-isoxazole are formed. Since an S N (EA) -mechanism is prohibited because of the presence of a phenylgroup on position 5, this result is good evidence for the occurrence of an S N (AE) -mechanism in the nucleophilic displacement of the halogen atom in the 4 -halogenopyrimidine 1 -oxides (Chapter 4). The results of the reactions of 4 -chloro- 6 -methyl-[l(3) - 15 N]pyrimidine 1 -oxide with liquid ammonia and with pot de in liquid ammonia have established two concurrent pathways for the formation of 5 -amino- 3 -methylisoxazole. The first pathway involves addition of the nucleophile to the C(2) -atom, resulting in an isoxazole compound with the same 15 N-enrichment as present in the substrate. In the second route addition to the C(4) -atom occurs leading to amino-dechlorination, as well as ring transformation to 5 -amino- 3 -methylisoxazole with 15 N enrichment at the ring nitrogen only. 6 -Methyl- 4 -phenoxypyrimidine 1 -oxide forms 5 -amino- 3 -methylisoxazole but no 4 -amino- 6 -methylpyrimidine 1 -oxide in the reaction with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia. In good accordance with these data it has been found that in this reaction the isoxazole formation only takes place via an addition of the amide ion to the C(2) -atom (Chapter 5). Variation of the substituent X of the 4 -X- 6 -methyl(phenyl) pyrimidine 1 -oxides influences the competition between the amination and the ring contraction. The substrates, in which X=Cl, Br and I, yield 4 - aminopyrimidine 1 -oxides, as well as 5 -aminoisoxazoles, in both media. The addition of the amide ion or ammonia to the C(4) -atom is the principal reaction pathway. In the cases where X=OC 6 H 5 and X=SC 6 H 5 the activation by the substituent at the 4 -position must be low, because these substrates only react with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> in liquid ammonia at - 33 °C. The addition of the amide ion at the C(2) -atom is strongly favoured to the addition at the C(4) -atom. 6 -Methyl- 4 -(trimethylammonio) pyrimidine 1 -oxide affords 4 -amino- 6 -methylpyrimidine 1 -oxide as sole product in the reaction with liquid ammonia. The trimethylammonio group, a good leaving group, strongly activates the 4 - position for the direct nucleophilic substitution and prohibits the addition of ammonia at the C(4) -atom (Chapter 6) ...|$|E

The homoleptic calcium phosphinoselenoic amido complex of {{the composition}} [Ca{Ph 2 P(Se) N(Ar) } 2 (THF) 2] (3) can also be obtained through two synthetic routes. In the first route, [Ca{N(SiMe 3) 2 } 2 (THF) 2] is treated with phosphinoselenoic amide [Ph 2 P(Se) NH(Ar) ] (1) at an ambient temperature followed by re-crystallization in an inert atmosphere to give complex 3 of high purity.

When complex 3 is treated with diphenylphosphinic acid in THF, compound 2 is also obtained with a good yield. Both complexes are confirmed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The solid-state structure of complex 2 reveals an eight-membered macrocycle formed by two diphenylphosphinate groups and two calcium ions. In addition, a four-membered calcium metallacycle around each calcium atom is formed by the phosphinoselenoic amido ligand through coordination between the nitrogen and selenium atoms.

The reaction of 1 -H with ((trimethylsilyl) methyl) lithium (neosilyllithium), [LiCH 2 SiMe 3], afforded a three-membered lithium amidophosphine-borane complex with the composition ([η 2 -Ph 2 CHNP(BH 3) Ph 2) Li(THF) 2] (2).

40|$|The isotope {{exchange}} between hydrogen and liquid ammonia {{has been studied}} in the temperature range between - 60 ° and + 25 °C at pressures up to 150 atm in thepresence of various catalysts, in particular supported platinum catalysts. Comparative exchange experiments were carried out with gaseous ammonia at pressures from 25 Torr up to the saturation pressure (8. 7 atm at 20 ° C). (1) Group eight metals catalyze the H/D exchange with liquid ammonia even at temperatures below - 60 °C. The activity decreases in the order: Pt, Pd, Ni, and Fe. (2) For a platinum-carbon catalyst suspended in liquid ammonia the rate of exchange increases proportionally {{to the amount of}} catalysts in the range from 10 to 100 g/liter. (3) Platinum catalysts supported on carbon and on silica gave the same exchange constants per unit weight and resulted in the same activation energy irrespective of the widely different surface areas. (4) The following apparent activation energies were obtained: Pt/C, 10. 0 ± 0. 5; Pt/SiO$_{ 2 }$, 9. 6 ± 0. 6; Pd/C, 11. 3 ± 0. 7; Raney-Ni, 11. 5 ± 0. 8 kcal/mole. (5) Comparative measurements with <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> indicated that this homogeneous catalyst has a considerably higher activity and a lower activation energy (5. 4 ± 0. 6 kcal/mole) than the heterogeneous catalysts. Contrary to exchange on these catalysts transport processes are rate determining in the <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> system under the conditions investigated. (6) While the rate of exchange in liquid ammonia increases proportionally to the hydrogen pressure in the case of <b>potassium</b> <b>amide</b> a dependence on the square root of the hydrogen pressure has been found for the platinum/carbon catalyst. (7) The experimental results support the following mechanism: Isotope exchange occurs between chemisorbed hydrogen atoms and a chemisorbed ammonia molecule, i. e. according to a Langmuir-Bonhoeffer-Hinshelwood mechanism. In principle themechanism is the same in the gas as weil as in the liquid phase. The number of atoms exchanged per unit time is, however, considerably smaller in the liquid, sincea large portion of the surface is blocked up for hydrogen chemisorption by adsorbed ammonia molecules. If any, there is only a very small contribution from an ionicmechanism to the total exchange in liquid ammonia...|$|E
