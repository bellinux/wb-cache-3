5|$|The gibbet {{could be}} {{operated}} by cutting the rope supporting the blade or by <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> pin {{that held the}} rope. If the offender was to be executed for stealing an animal, a cord was fastened to the pin and tied to either the stolen animal {{or one of the}} same species, which was then driven off, withdrawing the pin and allowing the blade to drop.|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} involves {{solving a}} difficult problem by transforming {{it into a}} better known problem for which we have (hopefully) asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal {{is to find a}} reducing algorithm whose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as transform and conquer.|$|E
25|$|European modellers {{have the}} option to convert the {{couplings}} on their rolling stock to the Fleischmann Profi-Coupler system for more reliable operation should they wish to do so, but most N scale rolling stock continues to be manufactured with Rapido couplers - a design which is fairly robust and easy to mold. Modern N scale stock uses a standard NEM socket for couplers which allows different coupling designs to be used by simply <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> old coupler and fitting a new one of a different design. In the United Kingdom, vendors are increasingly shipping both NEM sockets for couplers and buckeye (knuckle) couplers.|$|E
25|$|In Bargello quilting, long {{strips of}} fabric are sewn {{together}} along their long sides. Then {{the first and}} last strip are sewn together, forming a loop. The loop is laid flat on a table, and then cut vertically (in the opposite direction from how the strips were sewn together) to make many narrow loops. The quilter then opens the loops by <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> stitching between two pieces of fabric, making a long, flat strip. Finally, all the strips are sewn together. By opening the loops in between different pieces of fabric (for instance, {{between the first and second}} piece on one loop, then the second and third piece on the next loop), the artist can make the colors of the quilt appear to shift and wave. Slicing the loops very narrowly makes the waving and movement appear sharp and fast; cutting wide loops creates more gentle movement in the quilt.|$|E

25|$|During {{his studies}} on the Gal√°pagos Islands, Charles Darwin {{observed}} 13 species of finches that are closely related and differ most markedly {{in the shape of}} their beaks. The beak of each species is suited to the food available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by natural selection. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches are nuts and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening the nuts and staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found insects to be the best source of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> insects from their tiny hiding places. The finch is also found on the mainland and it is thought that they migrated to the islands and began adapting to their environment through natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Bereft {{of further}} combat {{replacements}} for his hard-pressed Marauder battalions, Stilwell {{felt he had}} no choice but to continue offensive operations with his existing forces, using the Marauders as 'the point of the spear' until they had either achieved all their objectives, or were wiped out. He was also concerned that <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Marauders, the only U.S. ground unit in the campaign, resulted in charges of favoritism, forcing him to evacuate the exhausted Chinese and British Chindit forces as well. When General William Slim, commander of British and Commonwealth forces in Burma, informed Stilwell that his men were exhausted and should be withdrawn, Stilwell rejected the idea, insisting that his subordinate commanders simply did not understand enlisted men and their tendency to magnify physical challenges. Having made his own 'long march' out of Burma under his own power using jungle trails, Stilwell found it difficult to sympathize with those who had been in combat in the jungle for months on end without relief. In retrospect, his statements at the time revealed a lack of understanding of the limitations of lightly equipped unconventional forces when used in conventional roles. Myitkyina and the dispute over evacuation policy precipitated a hurried Army Inspector General investigation, followed by U.S. congressional committee hearings, though no disciplinary measures were taken against General Stilwell for his decisions as overall commander.|$|E

500|$|According to a War Office {{training}} pamphlet dated 29 August 1940, {{the sticky}} bomb {{should be regarded}} as a portable demolition device which can be [...] "quickly and easily applied". It was reckoned to be effective against armour of up to one inch (25mm) thickness and was suitable for use against [...] "baby" [...] tanks, armoured cars and the vulnerable points on medium and heavy tanks. The safest and easiest application was simply to drop it from an upstairs window; otherwise, it could be used in an ambush of mobile tanks moving along a narrow road or in an attack on tanks parked up for the night. The sticky bomb could be either thrown or slapped in place by hand, in the latter case, the advice was to use sufficient force to break the glass thereby creating a greater area of contact resulting in a more effective explosion. Finally, there was also the option of placing the bomb first and then <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> pin at a safe distance by means of a length of string.|$|E
500|$|The United States was {{concerned}} that the conflict might spread {{to other parts of}} the Middle East. President John F. Kennedy rushed off notes to Nasser, Feisal, Hussein and Sallal. His plan was that Nasser's troops should withdraw from Yemen while Saudi Arabia and Jordan halted their aid to the Imam. Nasser agreed to pull out his forces only after Jordan and Saudi Arabia [...] "stop all aggressive operations on the frontiers". Feisal and Hussein rejected Kennedy's plan, since it would involve US recognition of the [...] "rebels". They insisted that the US should withhold recognition of Sallal's Presidency since the Imam might still regain control of Yemen, and that Nasser had no intention of <b>pulling</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> Saudis argued that Nasser wanted their oil fields and was hoping to use Yemen as a springboard for revolt in the rest of the Arabian peninsula.

2500|$|Preparations for the 1947 {{season began}} in early April, when Chief Engineer R.W. ‚ÄúBert‚Äù Kern {{deported}} Portland for Alaska. [...] In April, the boats were still locked in solid ice. [...] Temperatures the previous winter had reached 68 degrees below zero. [...] To free the hulls from the ice, without <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> oakum caulking between the planking, the crews had {{to fill the}} hulls with water, then heat the water by running steam lines through it. [...] The heat generated by the warmed water would gradually melt the ice {{on the outside of}} the hull, without tearing out the oakum. [...] After this, the boats still had to be kept out of the main flow of the river until the May ice jams had passed.|$|E

2500|$|Premiering on ABC in 1959 (and {{moving to}} NBC two years later), the series {{contained}} {{a mix of}} sophisticated and low-brow humor. Thanks to Ward's genial partner Bill Scott (who contributed to the scripts and voiced Bullwinkle and other characters) and their writers, puns were used often and shamelessly: in a [...] "Fractured Fairy Tales" [...] featuring Little Jack Horner, upon <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> plum, Jack announced, [...] "Lord, what foods these morsels be!" [...] Self-referential humor was another trademark: in one episode, the breathless announcer (William Conrad) gave away the villain's plans, prompting the villain to grab the announcer from offscreen, bind and gag him, and deposit him visibly within the scene. The show skewered popular culture, taking on such subjects as advertising, college sports, the Cold War, and TV itself.

2500|$|Later, the Doctor's body regenerates, {{and the new}} Doctor, {{suffering}} amnesia, gathers {{clothes from}} remnants of a recent party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the Eye of Harmony within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an atomic clock to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at [...] the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.|$|E
