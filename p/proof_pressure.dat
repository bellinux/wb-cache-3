50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test {{is a way}} in which pressure vessels such as pipelines, plumbing, gas cylinders, boilers and fuel tanks can be tested for strength and leaks. The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure. Pressure tightness can be tested by shutting off the supply valve and observing whether there is a pressure loss. The location of a leak can be visually identified more easily if the water contains a colorant. Strength is usually tested by measuring permanent deformation of the container. Hydrostatic testing is the most common method employed for testing pipes and pressure vessels. Using this test helps maintain safety standards and durability of a vessel over time. Newly manufactured pieces are initially qualified using the {{hydrostatic test}}. They are then re-qualified at regular intervals using the <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> test which is also called the modified hydrostatic test. Testing of pressure vessels for transport and storage of gases is very important because such containers can explode if they fail under pressure.|$|E
50|$|A {{small arms}} proof round is loaded {{to a higher}} than normal service pressure, {{stressing}} both the gun barrel and breech during firing.

One of the pressure vessels contained a prefabricated flaw which was extended and sharpened by fatigue cycling. It is shown that the flawed vessel had similar characteristics to the fracture specimens, thereby allowing estimates {{to be made of}} its nearness to failure during a proof test. Both the flawed and unflawed pressure vessel survived the <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> and 5 cycles to the working pressure, but it was apparent from the acoustic emission response during the proof cycle and the 5 cycles to the working pressure that the flawed vessel was very near failure.

40|$|The {{operational}} {{pressure range}} is the range {{to which the}} suit can be nominally operated for manned testing. The top end of the nominal operational pressure range is equivalent to 1 / 2 the <b>proof</b> <b>pressure.</b> Structural pressure is 1. 5 times the specified test pressure for any given test. <b>Proof</b> <b>pressure</b> is the maximum unmanned pressure to which the suit was tested by the vendor prior to delivery. The {{maximum allowable working pressure}} (MAWP) is 90 % of the <b>proof</b> <b>pressure.</b> The pressure systems RVs are set to keep components below their MAWPs. If the suit is pressurized over its MAWP, the suit will be taken out of service and an in-depth inspection/review of the suit will be performed before the suit is put back in service. The procedures outlined in this document should be followed as written. However, the suit test engineer (STE) may make redline changes real-time, provided those changes are recorded in the anomaly section of the test data sheet. If technicians supporting suit build-up, check-out, and/or test execution believe that a procedure can be improved, they should notify their lead. If procedures are incorrect to the point of potentially causing hardware damage or affecting safety, bring the problem to the technician lead and/or STE s attention and stop work until a solution (temporary or permanent) is authorized. Certain steps in the procedure are marked with a DV, for Designated Verifier. The Designated Verifier for this procedure is an Advanced Space Suit Technology Development Laboratory technician, not directly involved in performing the procedural steps, who will verify that the step was performed as stated. The steps to be verified by the DV were selected based on {{one or more of the}} following criteria: the step was deemed significant in ensuring the safe performance of the test, the data recorded in the step is of specific interest in monitoring the suit system operation, or the step has a strong influence on the successful completion of test objectives.

40|$|The FAA and NASA have {{recently}} completed independent technical {{evaluations of the}} concept of <b>pressure</b> <b>proof</b> testing the fuselage of commercial transport airplanes. The results of these evaluations are summarized. The objectives of the evaluations were to establish the potential benefit of the <b>pressure</b> <b>proof</b> test, to quantify the most desirable <b>proof</b> test <b>pressure,</b> and to quantify the required proof test interval. The focus of the evaluations was on multiple-site cracks extending from adjacent rivet holes of a typical fuselage longitudinal lap splice joint. The FAA and NASA do not support <b>pressure</b> <b>proof</b> testing the fuselage of aging commercial transport aircraft. The argument against proof testing is as follows: (1) a single proof test does not insure an indefinite life; therefore, the proof test must be repeated at regular intervals; (2) for a proof factor of 1. 33, the required proof test interval must be below 300 flights to account for uncertainties in the evaluation; (3) conducting the proof test at a proof factor of 1. 5 would considerably exceed the fuselage design limit load; therefore, it is not consistent with accepted safe practices; and (4) better safety can be assured by implementing enhanced nondestructive inspection requirements, and adequate reliability can be achieved by an inspection interval several times longer than the proof test interval...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to demonstrate the cost and weight advantages that could be obtained by utilizing the graphite/PMR 15 material system to replace titanium in selected turbofan engine applications. The first component to be selected {{as a basis for}} evaluation was the outer bypass duct of the General Electric F 404 engine. The operating environment of this duct was defined and then an extensive mechanical and physical property test program was conducted using material made by processing techniques which were also established by this program. Based on these properties, design concepts to fabricate a composite version of the duct were established and two complete ducts fabricated. One of these ducts was <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> tested and then run successfully on a factory test engine for over 1900 hours. The second duct was static tested to 210 percent design limit load without failure. An improved design was then developed which utilized integral composite end flanges. A complete duct was fabricated and successfully <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> tested. The net results of this effort showed that a composite version of the outer duct would be 14 percent lighter and 30 percent less expensive that the titanium duct. The other type of structure chosen for investigation was the F 404 fan stator assembly, including the fan stator vanes. It was concluded that it was feasible to utilize composite materials for this type structure but that the requirements imposed by replacing an existing metal design resulted in an inefficient composite design. It was concluded that if composites were to be effectively used in this type structure, the design must be tailored for composite application from the outset...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the emergency relief venting of the liquid helium dewar of the Spacelab 2 infrared telescope experiment {{in the event of}} a massive failure of the dewar guard vacuum. Such a failure, resulting from a major accident, could cause rapid heating and pressurization of the liquid helium in the dewar and lead to relief venting through the emergency relief system. The heat input from an accident is estimated for various fluid conditions in the dewar and the relief process as it takes place through one or both of the emergency relief paths is considered. It is shown that under all reasonable circumstances the dewar will safely relieve itself, and the pressure will not exceed 85 percent of the <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> or 63 percent of the burst pressure...|$|E
40|$|From the beginning, it {{was noted}} that the {{baseline}} drawings for the liquid solar collector exhibited a distinct weakness concerning materials specification where elastomers, plastics, and foam insulation materials were utilized. A relatively small effort by a competent design organization would alleviate this deficiency. Based on results obtained from boilout and stagnation tests on the solar simulator, it was concluded that proof testing of the collector tubes prior to use helps to predict their performance for limited service life. Fracture mechanics data are desirable for predicting extended service life and establishing a minimum <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> level requirement. The temperature capability of this collector system was increased as the design matured and the coating efficiency improved. This higher temperature demands the use of higher temperature materials at critical locations in the collector...|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{standards}} {{related to}} {{arms and ammunition}} are maintained and published by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI), which publishes standard internal pressures of calibers, formerly measured in copper units of pressure and currently in psi based on piezoelectric instrumentation. Official +P pressures are established by the SAAMI for certain cartridges; in general the +P pressure is approximately 10% higher than the standard pressure (see chart below). SAAMI {{does not have a}} +P+ pressure standard, but this indicates a pressure higher than the +P loading. In both cases this is below the <b>pressure</b> of a <b>proof</b> test cartridge. <b>Proof</b> <b>pressures</b> are established by the SAAMI, {{as a percentage of the}} working pressure, so this places an upper bound on the +P+ pressures of 30-40%. By way of comparison, magnum calibers may be loaded to nearly twice the pressure of the rounds from which they were derived. Overpressure rounds are commonly defensive rounds and are loaded by police and others in need of maximum power in a compact firearm. Accordingly, most overpressure rounds are hollow points or other types of expanding ammunition.|$|R

40|$|Two {{configurations}} of radial static seals are developed for high-pressure 773 kg per sq cm cryogenic applications: a U-shaped fluorocarbon seal and a delta-shaped PTFE seal. The U-seal {{is a common}} commercial design consisting of a spring-loaded cup-shaped jacket; the basic principle is that the soft plastic jacket provides the interface between the piston and the bore, the jacket being {{held in place by}} a metal spring. The delta seal is based on the principle that the soft plastic delta cross section furnishes the interface at the metal face and circumferential face of the gland and cylinder. Test results indicate that both the plastic U-seal and the delta seal designs are sufficiently flexible to accommodate assembly in bore or piston grooves. Of these two configurations, the delta seal is found to be superior as it meets all the design requirements for <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> testing the turbopump components of the main engine in the Space Shuttle...|$|E
40|$|As {{engineers}} {{continue to}} prepare the International Space Station (ISS) for in-orbit assembly in the year 2002, ANSYS software has proven instrumental in resolving a structural problem in the project's two primary station modules [...] Nodes 1 and 2. <b>Proof</b> <b>pressure</b> tests performed in May revealed "low temperature, post-yield creep" {{in some of the}} Nodes' gussets, which were designed to reinforce ports for loads from station keeping and reboost motion of the entire space station. An extensive effort was undertaken to characterize the creep behavior of the 2219 -T 851 aluminum forging material from which the gussets were made. Engineers at Sverdrup Technology, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) were responsible for conducting a combined elastic-plastic-creep analysis of the gussets to determine the amount of residual compressive stress which existed in the gussets following the <b>proof</b> <b>pressure</b> tests, and to determine the stress-strain history in the gussets while on-orbit. Boeing, NASA's Space Station prime contractor, supplied the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model geometry and developed the creep equations from the experimental data taken by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Langley Research Center. The goal of this effort was to implement the uniaxial creep equations into a three dimensional finite element program, and to determine analytically whether or not the creep was something that the space station program could live with. The objective was to show analytically that either the creep rate was at an acceptable level, or that the node module had to be modified to lower the stress levels to where creep did not occur. The elastic-plastic-creep analysis was performed using the ANSYS finite element program of ANSYS, Inc. (Houston, PA). The analysis revealed that the gussets encountered a compressive stress of approximately 30, 000 pounds per square inch (psi) when unloaded. This compressive residual stress significantly lowered the maximum tension stress in the gussets which decreased the creep strain rate. The analysis also showed that the gussets would not experience a great deal of creep from future pressure tests if braces or struts proposed by Boeing were installed to redistribute stress away from them. Subsequent analysis of on-orbit station keeping and reboost loads convinced Boeing that the gussets should be removed altogether...|$|E

50|$|Conversion of M4s to the M4A1 {{began in}} 2014, {{the start of}} all U.S. Army forces being {{equipped}} with the automatic variant. Though in service with special forces, combat in Afghanistan showed the need for providing automatic suppression fires during fire and movement for regular soldiers. The 101st Airborne Division began fielding new-built M4A1s in 2012, and the U.S. 1st Infantry Division became the first unit to convert their M4s to M4A1-standard in May 2014. Upgrades included a heavier barrel to better dissipate heat from sustained automatic firing, which also helps the rifles use the M855A1 EPR that has higher <b>proof</b> <b>pressures</b> and puts more strain on barrels. The full-auto trigger group has a more consistent trigger pull, whereas the burst group's pull varies on where the fire control group is set, resulting in more predictable and better accuracy on semi-automatic fire. Another addition is an ambidextrous selector lever for easier use with left-handed shooters. The M4-M4A1 conversion only increases weapon weight from 7.46 lb to 7.74 lb, counting a back-up iron sight, forward pistol grip, empty magazine, and sling. Each carbine upgrade costs $240 per rifle, for a total cost of $120 million for half a million conversions. 300 conversions can be done per day to equip a brigade combat team per week, with all M4A1 conversions {{to be completed by}} 2019.|$|R

40|$|Fill stems for tritium {{reservoirs}} have stringent scratch requirements {{such that}} any indications {{that appear to}} have depth are cause for rework or rejection. A scoping study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of scratches approximately 0. 0015 to 0. 002 inch deep on the fitness for service and bond quality.
