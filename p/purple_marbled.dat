When he falls asleep holding the book, he wakes up in the enchanting Bellezza, a Renaissance Venice-like {{city in the country}} of Talia (which resembles Renaissance Italy), ruled by a beautiful and imperious Duchessa. Here he meets the adventurous Arianna Gasparini and the mysterious Rodolfo Rossi. Rodolfo is a Stravagante, a traveller of a secret order who can move between Lucien's world and Rodolfo's by use of a talisman (an object from the other's world). However, Bellezza for all its beauty also has many dangers, especially for those who become close to the Duchessa.|$|E

60|$|It may {{be worth}} while briefly to give the {{well-known}} history of one class of roses. In 1793 some wild Scotch roses (R. spinosissima) were transplanted into a garden (10/181. Mr. Sabine in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 285.); and one of these bore flowers slightly tinged with red, from which a plant was raised with semi-monstrous flowers, also tinged with red; seedlings from this flower were semi-double, and by continued selection, in about nine or ten years, eight sub-varieties were raised. In the course of less than twenty years these double Scotch roses had so much increased in number and kind, that twenty-six well-marked varieties, classed in eight sections, were described by Mr. Sabine. In 1841 (10/182. 'An Encyclop. of Plants' by J.C. Loudon 1841 page 443.) {{it is said that}} three hundred varieties could be procured in the nursery-gardens near Glasgow; and these are described as blush, crimson, <b>purple,</b> red, <b>marbled,</b> two-coloured, white, and yellow, and as differing much in {{the size and shape of}} the flower.|$|R
