5|$|ZnO is a {{relatively}} soft material with approximate hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale. Its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant III-V semiconductors, such as GaN. The high heat capacity and heat conductivity, low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of ZnO are beneficial for ceramics. ZnO exhibits a very long lived optical <b>phonon</b> E2(low) with a lifetime as high as 133 ps at 10 K.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft <b>phonon</b> mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low <b>phonon</b> scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E

25|$|<b>Phonon</b> is {{the name}} of the {{multimedia}} API in KDE4. <b>Phonon</b> is a different approach to multimedia backends than in previous versions of KDE.
