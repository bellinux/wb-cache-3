40|$|The study {{examined}} the differences in defense, protective reactions, and expression of primary emotions between deaf or <b>partially</b> <b>hearing</b> impaired adolescents and their peers with normal hearing. Participants {{in the two groups}} were assessed by means of The Profile Emotions, The Life Style Index, and Non-verbal Scale of Suffering. Deaf adolescents tended more towards uncontrolled and oppositional behaviour, and had a weaker sense of self-protection and deprivation. Moreover, their defense mechanisms (intellectualization, projection and negation) were more intensively expressed. A higher level of defense mechanisms of intellectualization was observed in hearing adolescents. On the basis of the obtained results and analyses we may conclude that deaf adolescents demonstrated some characteristics of lower level of adjustment: negative emotional responses, lower degree of control (more uncontrolled and oppositional behaviour, weakened sense of self-protection) and several simple, evolutionary more primitive defense mechanisms (excluding intellectualization). Our interpretation also takes into account that adolescents need to develop a new adjustment system as the old one ceased to function...|$|E

However, CI users perform poorly in challenging listening tasks such as speech recognition in noise and music perception, possibly due to {{the small number of}} implanted electrodes and the large current spread of electric stimulation. Although current spread may be reduced using partial tripolar (pTP) stimulation mode, the number of electrodes may not be sufficient to preserve fine spectral details. Here, we propose to introduce current steering and electrode spanning to pTP mode to create additional spectral channels for CI users. Loudness and pitch perception with steered and spanned pTP modes were simulated using a computational model of CI stimulation and were tested in CI users. The excitation pattern of each stimulation mode was also measured at the physical (i. e., intra-cochlear electrical potential distribution), neural (i. e., spatial profile of evoked compound action potential), and perceptual levels (i. e., psychophysical forward masking pattern). Consistent with the model predictions, pitch-ranking results verified the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed stimulation modes in eliciting distinctive pitches for CI users. Pitch increased when the centroid of excitation pattern was shifted basally. When the centroid of excitation pattern did not move, higher pitches were perceived for narrower excitation patterns. These results suggest that in pTP-mode CI processing strategies, current steering and electrode spanning may provide additional spectral channels for better coding of spectral fine structures and for handling the cochlear dead region and defective electrode contact. ...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis forms part of a research project which attempts to generate a visualisation of a speaker's mouth from purely acoustic speech signals. The aim is to provide an aid for <b>partially</b> <b>hearing</b> impaired people in which visual information is presented alongside limited acoustic signals, facilitating easier use of the telephone. The system is essentially a low-level speech recogniser in which phonemic information is extracted from the speech waveform and mapped onto visemes generated on a synthetic facial image. This thesis presents {{a description of a}} major part of this project, that is, the development of an accurate phoneme discriminator which is capable of speaker independent operation, on continuous speech. The recognition process is realised in three stages: a pre-processor to convert the speech into a suitable parametric form; a pattern recogniser to identify the possible phoneme classes and a post-processor to produce the viseme information. The pattern recognition stage uses a self-organising Kohonen network, followed by a Learning Vector Quantiser (LVQ) to further improve the recognition accuracy. The performance of this stage is highly dependent on the choice of pre-processor used at the input to the network and it is the design of the pre-processor stage that forms a significant part of this work. A novel technique known as the pseudo-cepstrum forms the basis of this pre-processor. Extensive investigations have been conducted into the dependence of performance on a range of parameters, both at the pre-processor stage and within the Kohonen classifier. In particular, a performance comparison of several preprocessor techniques, including the pseudo-cepstrum, has been carried out. Factors affecting both the training and operation of the classifier are also described here, with the sensitivity of recognition performance to the input data, being a major issue. Overall recognition accuracies of 80 % have been achieved...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} aspects {{of the development of}} phonological awareness in relation to word reading in children aged between 5 - and 7 -years. The principal aim has been to establish how, for these children, phonological awareness relates to other cognitive factors that might jointly support the development of early reading skills. Data derives from children in their first three years of formal education (aged 5 - to 7 -years) and a group of partially-hearing children aged 7 -years. The children's performance in a measure of categorical speech have been compared with their levels of implicit phonological awareness. The results do not indicate that phonological awareness is significantly associated with children's ability to categorise speech sounds. Following this investigations have been conducted {{to determine the extent to}} which implicit phonological awareness is affected by working memory and lexical knowledge. It emerges that memory is implicated in the phonological awareness tasks, but is not a developmental antecedent. The phonological similarity effect is also studied and not found to relate to age or reading ability in hearing or partially-hearing children. Aspects of the working memory model are discussed in relation to children's performance in tests of word recognition and phonological awareness. In the penultimate chapter children's lexical knowledge (vocabulary) is found to interact with their performance in the measure of memory span. It appears that the development of the awareness of initial phonemes may be facilitated by having limited memory processing space. Overall it was found that lexical knowledge was predictive of phonological awareness. This conclusion was supported by a finding that the partially-hearing children had poorer lexical knowledge than younger hearing children with levels of phonological awareness similar to the partially-hearing children. The findings in that chapter also indicate that phonological awareness and lexical knowledge may make separable contributions to word reading. In the final chapter structural equation modelling of 'Reading' is undertaken in order to establish how phonological awareness, memory span and lexical knowledge together relate to word reading. The findings there confirm the covariance of phonological awareness, memory span and lexical knowledge, but also suggest that, in contrast to other research findings, these factors may not always be clearly related to word reading. The study has also elicited some information about the likely difficulties of <b>partially</b> <b>hearing</b> children who were here not found to have good levels of phonological awareness or lexical knowledge. In the final chapter it is suggested that further work should be undertaken to study partially-hearing children to establish how reading develops in the absence of age-appropriate levels of phonological awareness and lexical knowledge...|$|E

The actuator was designed as a piezoelectric thin-film cantilever. The optical transmission path was realised using an infrared light-emitting diode combined with an active receiver circuit. For a voltage of 1 V, the unloaded actuator presents displacement amplitudes of 1 Âµm up to a stimulus frequency of 25 kHz and forces up to 0. 2 mN. Proportionally larger forces can be achieved by stacking single actuators.

The graduate thesis titled Sociopragmatic skills of <b>hearing,</b> deaf and <b>partially</b> deaf preschool children included in the kindergarten is focused on possible differences in sociopragmatic skills of the hearing and the deaf and partially deaf children. It consists of a theoretical and an empirical part. In the theoretical part, concepts as communication, pragmatics, sociopragmatic skills are presented and the phenomenon of hearing loss is described. Some ways of adjustment for deaf and partially deaf children in the kindergarten are stated. In the empirical part, a survey on sociopragmatic skills in deaf, <b>partially</b> deaf and <b>hearing</b> preschool children included in the kindergarten is presented. The survey was conducted through a questionnaire including the scale of sociopragmatic skills filled out by parents and educators of deaf, <b>partially</b> deaf and <b>hearing</b> children. The sociopragmatic skills in the scale are divided into two subgroups: the skill of assertiveness and the skill of responsiveness. I found that there were differences in sociopragmatic skills between hearing and deaf or partially deaf children. The hearing children had higher scores of their sociopragmatic skills than their deaf or partially deaf counterparts. However, only the differences {{in the development of the}} responsiveness skill were statistically important. In the hearing children, both the assertivness skill and responsiveness skill are present, whereas the responsiveness is well developed, and assertiveness is poorly developed or nascent. In most deaf and partially deaf children, the responsiveness is nascent or well developed, and assertiveness is nascent. Since parents see children in a different environment as educators, there were higher scores in scales filled out by parents than by educators, both for the responsiveness skill as for the assertiveness skill, however, they are statistically unimportant. ...|$|R

However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there is no report on the establishment of a rat deafness model through the combined application of aminoglycosides and loop diuretics. The aim of this study was to use single or combined administration of furosemide and kanamycin sulfate to establish rat models of deafness. The rats received intravenous injections of different doses of furosemide and/or intramuscular injections of kanamycin sulfate. The auditory brainstem response was measured to determine the hearing threshold after drug application. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy were performed to evaluate inner ear morphology. In the group receiving combined administration of furosemide and kanamycin, the auditory brainstem response threshold showed significant elevation 3 days after administration, higher than that produced by furosemide or kanamycin alone. The hair cells showed varying degrees of injury, from the apical turn to the basal turn of the cochlea and from the outer hair cells to the inner hair cells. The spiral ganglion cells maintained a normal morphology during the first week after the hair cells completely disappeared, and then gradually degenerated. After 2 months, the majority of spiral ganglion cells disappeared, but a few remained. These findings demonstrate that the combined administration of furosemide and kanamycin has a synergistic ototoxic effect, and that these drugs can produce hair cell loss and hearing loss in rats.

The files of 67 patients evaluated for sudden hearing loss at Rabin Medical Center from 1989 to 2000 were reviewed. All patients underwent pure tone audiometry, acoustic reflex tests, and auditory brain stem evoked response tests. Hearing evaluation was followed by magnetic resonance imaging scan and, I month later, a second hearing test. Findings were compared between patients with and without evidence of tumor on imaging, and between patients with tumor with and without full recovery. Twenty-four patients (36 %) had a diagnosis of acoustic tumor, of whom 4 (16. 7 %) recovered hearing after I month. All 4 tumors were intracanalicular, Two of these patients had low-tone hearing loss, and 2 had flat curves; 3 had a pathological auditory brain stem evoked response. Of the 43 patients without tumors, 26 (60 %) showed complete resolution of the hearing loss. We conclude that complete recovery of hearing loss does not exclude acoustic tumor, and these patients therefore require full evaluation. The reason for the recovery remains unclear.

40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant is a prosthetic device {{that can provide}} severe-to-profoundly deaf individuals with <b>partially</b> restored <b>hearing.</b> It emulates the function of a normal cochlea through combined functioning of externally situated electronics and an electrode array surgically implanted into the cochlea.

Current speech processing strategies rely on the tonotopicity of the cochlea, i. e. the relation between distance {{from the base of the}} cochlea and the specific frequency that causes the highest amplitude of deflection at the specific point. The phenomenon of the travelling wave on the basilar membrane is thus reduced to its point or points of maximal deflection. In this study, the behaviour along the full length of the basilar membrane will be investigated in the time domain, i. e. the deflection along the whole membrane for any point in time, in order to evaluate the relevance of the travelling wave in coding sound in a {{cochlear implant}} system. The additional information acquired by emulating the motion of the fluid and the basilar membrane in the cochlea, will be transmitted to the recipient in electrical stimulus patterns, to assess whether it provides recipients of cochlear implants with better pitch perception. It will be shown that for the individuals that partook in the experiments, improvement of discrimination around 100 Hz were obtained when compared to current speech coding strategies like the advanced combination encoder (ACE) speech coding strategy in the same recipient.

40|$|Deaf is {{the loss}} of <b>hearing</b> <b>partially</b> or even totally and could happen congenitally or acquired. The purpose of this {{research}} was to find out the information on the caries prevalence, def-t and DMF-T index of Deaf children at the Primary School of Special Education in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah year 2008. This study was a descriptive research with survey technique. All samples, 43 primary students of Primary School of Special Education in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah from kindergarten to primary six. The def-t and DMF-T index standard used the WHO criteria, namely, very low (0. 1 - 1), low (1. 2 - 2. 6), moderate (2. 7 - 4. 4), high (4. 5 - 6. 5), and very high (> 6. 5). The results of this research indicate that the caries prevalence of the Deaf children year 2008 was 95. 3 %. the def-t index was 2. 81 and DMF-T index was 1. 67. The conclusion of this research was that the average def-t index included in moderate criteria and the DMF-T index was low...|$|R
5000|$|On 5 February 2014, it was {{publicly}} {{revealed that}} music attributed to Samuragochi since 1996 {{had actually been}} ghostwritten by Takashi Niigaki, a musician, composer, and part-time lecturer at the Toho Gakuen School of Music in Tokyo. Niigaki also said Samuragochi was not deaf and states that Samuragochi has normal hearing and was posing as a deaf man to generate a mystique around his image as a composer. Niigaki also said that Samuragochi {{did not need to}} use his cane, and that most of his biography printed in album liner notes was fiction. Niigaki went to the press because one of Samuragochi's [...] "compositions" [...] would be used by Japanese figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. On 12 February 2014, Samuragochi released a handwritten statement in which he revealed that he had a Grade 2 physical disability certificate after losing his hearing and to have <b>partially</b> regained his <b>hearing</b> three years previously. He also added that he was [...] "deeply ashamed of living a lie." ...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} (ES) of {{the brain}} has been performed for over 100 years, and although some might {{say it is a}} crude technique for understanding the detailed mechanisms underlying different neural computations, microstimulation has made significant contributions to our knowledge in both basic and clinical research. Recently there has been resurgence in its use in the context of electrotherapy and neural prostheses. For example, ES has made it possible to at least <b>partially</b> restore <b>hearing</b> to deaf patients by delivering pulses via implanted electrodes to different regions of the cochlea. Stimulation of the basal ganglia is remarkably effective in restoring motor function to Parkinsonâ€™s patients, and microstimulation of the geniculostriate visual pathway is regarded by some as a very promising (future) method for making the blind see again. Yet, the methodology still suffers from at least two fundamental problems; (a) we do not always know exactly what is being stimulated when we pass currents through the tissue; and (b) stimulation causes activation in a large number of areas even outside the stimulation site, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the behavioral effects of the stimulated area itself. Microstimulation during fMRI (esfMRI) could provide a unique opportunity to visualize the networks underlying electrostimulation-induced behaviors, to map neuromodulatory systems, or to develop electrotherapy and neural prosthetic devices. Moreover esfMRI is an excellent tool {{for the study of the}} effects of regional synaptic plasticity, e. g. LTP in hippocampus, on cortical connectivity. Last but not least, esfMRI can offer important insights into the functional neurovascular coupling. In my talk, I shall discuss findings from recent and on-going work on signal propagation during electrical stimulation, as well as data related to effective connectivity...|$|R
40|$|In {{difficult}} listening situations, e. g. in {{a cocktail}} party scenario, speech signal that a listener is interested in decoding is often masked by unwanted noise, disrupting bottom-up signalling. A normal hearing (NH) listener is able to withstand {{a reasonable amount of}} such disruption and can still achieve good speech perception. This is possible partially because the information encoded in human speech is redundant at various levels like phonetic, morphemic, sentential, discourse, etc. In addition, NH listeners employ various cognitive mechanisms to reconstruct the lost information from disrupted speech signal. Some of these mechanisms are: application of the knowledge of the speakerâ€™s language and its grammatical conventions, expectation formulated {{on the basis of the}} information collected previously in the discourse, tracking the auditory information within the speech stream, etc. As a result, (i) some loss of information can be tolerated without loss of meaning, and (ii) some information can be reconstructed on the basis of the leftover information. A cochlear implant (CI) is an implantable electronic device that <b>partially</b> reconstructs <b>hearing</b> for individuals with profound or total sensorineural hearing loss. CI users have greater difficulty in understanding speech than NH listeners in challenging listening scenarios where target speech signals are disrupted, e. g. with multiple individuals talking simultaneously or in noisy surroundings. This thesis explores if various factors inherent to the signal, and deficits of hearing impairment and/or characteristic of CI signal transmission may be at least partially responsible for the CI users having reduced ability of understanding speech in difficult listening scenarios. I conclude in the thesis that CI users can effectively use top-down restoration mechanisms but the nature and/or extent of the working of these mechanisms may be different in CI users than in NH listeners due to certain factors that may themselves vary among the CI users...|$|R
