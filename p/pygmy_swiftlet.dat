5000|$|Many have a {{characteristic}} shape, {{with a short}} forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. The flight of some species is characterised by a distinctive [...] "flicking" [...] action quite different from swallows.

5000|$|The Dinadiawan River Protected Landscape is a {{protected}} area covering {{the stretch of}} the Dinadiawan River from its headwaters in the Sierra Madre mountain range to its mouth on the Philippine Sea coast of the village of Dinadiawan in Aurora province, Philippines. The park covers an area of 3371.332 ha and includes its surrounding forested mountains, waterfalls and springs in Dipaculao municipality. It is composed of 2645 ha of forested area, 323 ha of grassland, 151 ha of forested shrubland, 144 ha of cultivated area, and 108 ha of the Dinadiawan River. [...] Its forest cover consists primarily of dipterocarp trees like tanguile, mayapis, white lauan, red lauan and bagtikan. It serves as a habitat of wild fauna such as the Philippine deer, Philippine long-tailed macaque, Philippine warty pig, spotted wood kingfisher and <b>pygmy</b> <b>swiftlet.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{abilities}} of some cave-nesting swiftlets to echolocate {{has traditionally been}} used to separate the genus Aerodramus, which includes echolocating species, from the genus Collocalia, thought to lack echolocation. Here we report the discovery of echolocation in {{a member of the}} latter genus, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>swiftlet</b> Collocalia troglodytes. We also present a well-supported molecular phylogeny for the swiftlets and their relatives based on DNA sequence data from two mitochondrial genes, which we use to reconstruct the evolution of echolocation. Our data provide strong evidence that the swiftlets are a monophyletic group. This monophyly plus the presence of echolocation in C. troglodytes indicate that either (1) echolocation evolved much earlier in the swiftlets than previously thought and has since been lost in most Collocalia taxa, or (2) this ability evolved independently in Aerodramus and Collocalia. Based on our results, echolocation can no longer be considered a useful character for distinguishing these two genera...|$|E
