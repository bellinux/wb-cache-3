5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea grows {{only in the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Geraldton Sandplains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions, inland {{from the}} coast but never east of the Darling Scarp.

5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous <b>populations.</b> <b>In</b> both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern <b>populations,</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E

5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest <b>populations.</b> <b>In</b> addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
