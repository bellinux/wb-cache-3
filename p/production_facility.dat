5|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a <b>production</b> <b>facility</b> at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal {{diffusion}} plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E
5|$|Starting May 1946, the S-50 plant {{buildings}} were utilised, {{not as a}} <b>production</b> <b>facility,</b> but by the United States Army Air Forces' Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project.

NEPA operated until May 1951, when it was superseded by the joint Atomic Energy Commission-United States Air Force Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project. The S-50 plant was disassembled in the late 1940s. Equipment was taken to the K-25 powerhouse area, where it was stored before being salvaged or buried.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern <b>production</b> <b>facility,</b> with multiple farms supplying milk.

On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX <b>production</b> <b>facility.</b> However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.|$|E
