40|$|Through-thickness {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} property of AA 7055 -T 7751 aluminum alloy plate were investigated by using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering(SAXS). The results indicate an inhomogeneous distribution of microstructure through the thickness. The degree of recrystallization decreases gradually from 69 % to 19. 1 %, as deepening from the surface {{to the center of}} the plate. The size of subgrains decreases from 10 μm at the surface to around 2 μm at the center. Strong texture of rolling type is observed near the center but the intensity decreases gradually as nearing the surface and the shear texture becomes the dominant. High density of plate-like η' phases are observed in the alloy, indicating the sufficient precipitation. η' precipitates of this condition are around 3. 7 nm in radius, 1 - 3 nm in thickness and are found coherent with the Al matrix with a coherent strain of 0. 0133, showing a strong strengthening effect. The heterogeneity in grain scale does not influence the distribution and the morphology of precipitates. The yield strength (L direction) varies linearly along the thickness direction of the <b>plate,</b> <b>fitting</b> an equation of σ y =- 38. 7 S + 604. 8 (0 ≤ S ≤ 1). The variation of yield strength is related to the heterogeneity of grain structure...|$|E

Phylogenetic and morphological analyses suggest that Parmales {{is one of the key}} organisms for elucidating the evolutionary origin of Bacillariophyceae (diatoms), the most successful heterokontophyta. The effects of silicon-limitation on growth and morphogenesis of plates were studied using a strain of Triparma laevis NIES- 2565, which was cultured for the first time in artificial sea water. The cells of T. laevis were surrounded by eight plates when grown with sufficient silicon. However, plate formation became incomplete when cells were cultured in a medium containing low silicate (ca. < 10 µM). Cells finally lost almost all plates in a medium containing silicate concentrations lower than ca. 1 µM. However, silicon-limitation did not affect growth rate; cells continued to divide without changing their growth rate, even after all plates were lost. Loss of plates was reversible; when cells without plates were transferred to a medium containing sufficient silicate, regeneration of shield and ventral plates was followed by the formation of girdle and triradiate plates. The results indicate that the response to silicon-limitation of T. laevis is different from that of diatoms, where cell division becomes inhibited under such conditions...|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of the closure valve was to be critical:Along the upper surface of the pipe is a continuous slit or groove about two inches wide. This groove is covered by a valve, extending the whole length of the railway, formed of a strip of leather riveted between iron plates, the top plates being wider than the groove and serving to prevent the external air forcing the leather into the pipe when the vacuum is formed within it; and the lower <b>plates</b> <b>fitting</b> into the groove when the valve is shut, makes up the circle of the pipe, and prevents the air from passing the piston; one edge of this valve is securely held down by iron bars, fastened by screw bolts to a longitudinal rib cast on the pipe, and allows the leather between the plates and the bar {{to act as a}} hinge, similar to a common pump valve; the other edge of the valve falls into a groove which contains a composition of beeswax and tallow: this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it. Over this valve is a protecting cover, which serves to preserve it from snow or rain, formed of thin plates of iron about five feet long hinged with leather, and the end of each plate underlaps the next {{in the direction of the}} piston's motion, thus ensuring the lifting of each in succession.|$|R

40|$|Nitrate {{levels in}} farm ponds are {{determined}} {{with the aid}} of a water sampler that can be operated from the shore The quality of pond water in southern and western Illinois is being determined {{with the aid of}} a new type of water sampler developed in the Department of Agricultural Engineering. Work on the sampler began as part of a study of water supplies in Washington County. This study, which is being conducted through the College of Agriculture Council on Environmental Quality, was initiated in the winter of 1970, after high nitrate levels were found in the county 2 ̆ 7 s water supplies. Both ponds and wells are being sampled to determine their acceptability as sources of water. For accurate tests of pond water, samples must be obtained at various depths and distances from the shore. A boat, however, is bulky and difficult for one person to handle. The new sampler was therefore devised so that an investigator can sample pond water at any depth without ever leaving the shore. How the sampler is made The sampler consists of a telescoping rod manufactured for window- washing units; a float, a sampler head, and a bottle at one end of the rod (Fig. 1); and a T-handle and two operating reels at the other end (Fig. 2). One reel contains the cord to the float; the other, the cord that operates the sampler head. Cord guides are attached to the rod sections. The sampler head (Fig. 1) is made up of three components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The sampler head base is attached to the sampling rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port, which extends into the sample bottle, is attached to the sampler head base. In addition, the base contains an air e cape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle <b>plates</b> <b>fitting</b> different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The stopper plate with stopper is spring-loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. How the sampler works To obtain a sample, the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. 3 a). The bottle and sampler head are floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. 3 b). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. 3 c) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} project was recently initiated which requires that water quality samples {{be taken from}} small ponds and lagoons in west-central Illinois. A method for obtaining these pond water samples was desired that could be handled conveniently by one person and would not require a small boat. The pond water sampler described here was developed to satisfy this need. The sampler developed allows one person to obtain a water sample at any desired depth while remaining on the shore. After assembling the device it may be floated to any position on the pond surface, lowered to the desired depth, and a sample taken. It is then retrieved by following the previous steps in reverse order as illustrated in Fig. 1. Water samples have been obtained {{at a distance of}} 40 ft from the pond shore and at a depth of 16 ft below the pond surface. The pond water sampler consists of a telescoping rod, manufactured for window washing units, with a T-handle and fishing rod reels on one end (Fig. 2); and the sampler head (Fig. 3) and float on the other end. Cords run from the operator end of the sampler to the sampler head and float to allow the operator to control the float and sampler head. The sampler head holds the sample bottle and may be triggered to allow sampling to occur when the operator desires. The sampler (Fig. 3) consists of three separate components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The sampler head base is attached to the telescoping rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port which extends into the sample bottle is attached to the sampler head base. Additionally, the base contains an air escape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle <b>plates</b> <b>fitting</b> different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The stopper plate with stopper is spring loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. To obtain a sample the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. la). The bottle and sampler head is floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. lb). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. lc). When the desired depth is reached, the sampler head cord is pulled and water is allowed to fill the sample bottle (Fig. ld). Pulling the sampler head cord removes the stopper from the water port thus allowing the bottle to fill with water through the water port and extension. The air is allowed to escape through the small air escape port in the sampler head base and is conducted {{a few feet from the}} sampler head through a flexible tube. This reduces the possibility of escaping air changing the oxygen content of the water which is being sampled. The sampler head and bottle are returned to the surface using the float and float cord (Fig. le), and the apparatus is floated back to the shore (Fig. lf) ...|$|R

Therefore, the simultaneous influence of five independent variables on three responses (lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients) is investigated.
