The cutting process has focus on roughing stages. There are enough handbooks to provide recommended cutting parameters and not consider the economic aspects of machining. The cost of machining on these machines is sensitive to the machining variable. The project objectives are to develop Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for CNC turning process and to optimize turning parameters for minimized <b>production</b> cost <b>per</b> <b>unit.</b> Method used for this project is Ant Colony Optimization.
