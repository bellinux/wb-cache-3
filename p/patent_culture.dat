40|$|This paper clariﬁes Japanese <b>patent</b> <b>culture</b> {{from the}} {{viewpoints}} of patent management and international business history. We examine {{the cases of}} Westinghouse Electric and Mitsubishi Electric. Although Westinghouse granted exclusive licenses to Mitsubishi, it controlled its Japanese patents directly through its own patent agent. Therefore, positive inﬂuences of Westinghouse’s international patent management on Mitsubishi were limited. Rather, Mitsubishi developed its patent management comparatively independently. In 1923, Mitsubishi appointed a person {{to be in charge}} of patent affairs exclusively, followed by the formation of a patent section. Since 1935, the patent department began administrating patent applications internally. Mitsubishi accumulated the organizational capability to apply for and administrate a volume of patents in the course of technical tie-ins with Westinghouse. This is the context of the creation of a Japanese <b>patent</b> <b>culture.</b> On the enforcement side, Mitsubishi Electric created a reconciliation system with competitors. Japanese electrical companies did not claim their rights strongly, but instead acted harmoniously toward each other. The reconciliation system consisted mainly of Mitsubishi, Shibaura Works, Hitachi, and Fuji Electric. This represents another feature of Japanese <b>patent</b> <b>culture...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{origins of}} {{contemporary}} exclusion of surgical methods from patenting {{lie in the}} complexities of managing credit claims in operative surgery, recognized in the nineteenth century. While surgical methods were not deemed patentable, surgeons were nevertheless embedded within <b>patent</b> <b>culture.</b> In an atmosphere of heightened awareness {{about the importance of}} ‘inventors’, how surgeons should be recognized and rewarded for their inventions was an important question.

40|$|From {{the late}} nineteenth century onwards there emerged an {{increasingly}} diverse response to escalating patenting activity. Inventors were generally supportive of legislation that made patenting more accessible, while others, especially manufacturers, saw <b>patenting</b> <b>culture</b> as an impediment. The medical profession claimed that patenting represented ‘a barrier to medical treatment’ and was thus detrimental to the nation's health, yet, as I argue, the profession's development of strict codes of conduct forbidding practitioners from patenting resulted in rebellion from some members, who increasingly sought protection for their inventions. Such polarized opinions within the medical trade continue to affect current medical practice today...|$|R

There are good examples of the positive handling of IPR in scientific organisations, but many have not paid enough attention to the matter. The reason might be a lack of expertise or of basic awareness. Further development of the law on HE and NAS has paved the road for ISLs and public-private partnerships, but the current legislative environment offers only limited opportunities for ISLs.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we stress two points. First, {{analysis}} of public patenting should expand their focus from universities to Public Research Organisations (PRO). Second, a multidisciplinary approach {{allows for a}} richer view and interpretation of results. We adopt historical and economic perspectives to address these issues, with data from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the largest PRO in Spain. We distinguish three periods {{in the history of}} CSIC, according to the political context: dictatorship (1939 - 1975), transition to democracy (1976 - 1986) and democracy (1987 -to date). The legal and institutional framework conditioned the evolution of patenting by CSIC along these periods, finally characterised by sustained growth, priority of certain scientific areas and frequent technological cooperation. For the late period, we explore the trends of some other economic inputs of patents and we show that not all of them are coherent with the objective of having more patents. We conclude that the political and normative context may shape the <b>patent</b> <b>culture</b> of PRO like CSIC and that whereas returns to scale are decreasing or constant for university patents, they are increasing for patents applied for by PRO like CSIC. The historical approach guides the definition of homogenous periods and the interpretation of time effects, while the economic approach quantifies some of the relations and puts into question the validity of descriptive rankings, e. g. of scientific areas by number of patents. 1...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{normative}} {{studies on}} the generation of public patents have focused on universities. This paper extends the analysis to public research organisations (PRO). From both a historic and economic standpoint, and via the interpretation of three institutional factors (the change {{in the political and}} legal background, the dominance of certain areas of science over others, and the increase in technological cooperation), the reasons moving the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científi cas (CSIC; the Spanish Research Council) to file patents were examined. The impact of these quantified factors on patenting was examined from 1987 to the present. The institutional framework of bodies such as the CSIC was found to favour a <b>patenting</b> <b>culture.</b> The historical approach adopted defined homogeneous analytical periods and guided the interpretation of the results and their effects over time, while the economic approach allowed some of the relationships seen to be quantifi ed and questioned the validity of merely descriptive classifi cations (e. g., scientific areas according to number of patents).

40|$|SMEs, due {{to their}} unique characteristics, are found to have {{inherent}} capabilities to undertake technological innovations successfully across industries and nations. While there is considerable empirical evidence to throw light on SME innovation contributions {{in the context of}} developed countries, there is hardly any evidence to reveal how innovative SMEs are in rapidly industrializing economies like India. This paper reveals the core findings of two empirical “Innovation Projects” implemented in the previous decade in Bangalore, the globally known high-tech city of India. Indian SMEs are largely incremental innovators, prompted by their customers and involved in product and/or process innovations. But majority carried out innovations with internal efforts only whereas the minority which obtained external support, had better technical strength, indulged in more frequent and both product & process innovations. Such SMEs achieved better innovation performance as well as better economic performance. Some of them internationalized themselves in the process. However such achievements are “an oasis” in the vast Indian SME sector. How to promote (i) innovations, (ii) quality of innovations and (iii) <b>patenting</b> <b>culture</b> among the SMEs is a challenge for Indian Policy Makers. The paper concludes with proposing some policy recommendations in this direction. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} a study on the urge and willingness of Nigerian researchers to patent their inventions. The study focused on Pharmaceutical studies, Food Science and Technology, and Metallurgy and Materials Science in universities. The study revealed that the Nigerian government was the major financier of research activities of the researchers, some of who had generated some inventions/research breakthroughs. The study found that about 95 % of the researchers were willing to patent their inventions, but about 10 % of them had applied for patents. Researchers in pharmaceutical studies were most active in patenting of inventions, followed by those in Food Science and Technology, and least in Metallurgy and Materials Studies. Busy schedules of the researchers, ignorance of procedure of obtaining patents for inventions, waiting time for the grant of patent, and government sponsorship of the researches that generated the inventions, discouraged the researchers from patenting the inventions. The researchers had poor knowledge of patents and did not consult patent documents {{in the course of their}} research activities. The study concluded that inadequate information on patent matters, lack of institutional infrastructure and unfavourable patent ownership structure led to the poor <b>patenting</b> <b>culture</b> among Nigerian researchers. To address the problems, it is recommended that adequate patent education should be mounted in Nigerian institutions. Technology brokerage organisations should also be established in the institutions, while the government is urged to offer part-ownership of patents to researchers and the institutions/institutes, where they are generated. 1...|$|R
40|$|Culture {{is deemed}} to be a crucial basis for {{innovation}} in various respects. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore the relationships between different cultural dimensions introduced by G. Hofstede (2001, Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, insititutions, and organizations across nations, 2 nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and the capability of initiating innovation measured by the number of patent applications using the sample of European countries at the regional level. As a novel approach, instead of using Hofstede's original index scores, the measures for the cultural dimensions are based on the European Social Survey. We have learned that to be successful in patenting, a region should have power distance, uncertainty avoidance, family-related collectivism (as opposed to friend-related and organisation-related collectivism), and lower than average masculinity. In addition, the negative relationships between these cultural dimensions and patenting are stronger when there is a higher <b>patenting</b> intensity. However, <b>culture</b> alone does not serve as a guarantee for a high level of <b>patenting</b> intensity. innovation, <b>culture,</b> Hofstede, Europe,...|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} low-quality {{patents and}} inconsistent decisions prompted Congress {{to enact the}} first major patent reform act in over sixty years and likewise spurred the Supreme Court to take {{a renewed interest in}} substantive patent law. Because little compelling empirical evidence exists as to what features affect the patent office’s granting behavior, policymakers have been trying to fix the patent system without understanding the root causes of its dysfunction. This Article aims to fill at least part of this gap by examining one factor that may affect patent examiners’ grant rates throughout their tenures: the year in which they were hired by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). An examiner may develop a general examination “style” in the critical early stages of her career that persists {{even in the face of}} changes in application quality or <b>patent</b> allowance <b>culture</b> at the agency. To the extent initial hiring environments influence a newly hired examiner’s practice style, variations in such initial conditions suggest examiners of different hiring cohorts may follow distinct, enduring pathways with their examination practices. Consistent with this prediction, we find strong evidence that the year an examiner was hired has a lasting effect on her granting patterns over the course of her career. Moreover, we find that the variation in the granting patterns of different PTO cohorts aligns with observed fluctuations in the initial conditions faced by such cohorts. By documenting the existence of cohort effects and by demonstrating the importance of initial environments in explaining certain long-term outcomes, this analysis holds various implications for patent policy and the administrative state more generally...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{criterion}} in {{the selection}} of microalgae suitable as source of oil for biodiesel should be their actual capacity to produce lipids or, more properly, the fatty acid yield. Performance assessment of ten preselected microalgae under both batch and continuous culture points to the latter approach as the most adequate for evaluating fatty acid productivity. Differences were <b>patent</b> in continuous <b>culture</b> among strains that otherwise had analogous oil accumulation potential under batch culture. Some promising strains under batch culture (like Muriella aurantiaca and Monoraphidium braunii) exhibited, however, values for actual fatty acid productivity lower than 40 mg L- 1 d- 1 in continuous regime. The analysis performed in photochemostat under continuous culture regime revealed the great potential of Chlorococcum olefaciens, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Scenedesmus almeriensis as oil producing microalgae. Fatty acid productivity levels over 90 mg L- 1 d- 1 were recorded for the latter strains under moderate nitrogen limitation, conditions which led to an enrichment in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, a more suitable profile as raw material for biodiesel. The continuous culture methodology employed represents a sound procedure for screening microalgae for biofuel production, providing a reliable evaluation of their fatty acid production capacity, under conditions close to those of outdoor production systemsPeer reviewe...|$|R

Because of the deficiency of common used techniques for the determination of total counts, the total sytox count was developed.

Counting of the coloured cells was carried out by means of epifluorescence microscopy in combination with an adapted digital image analyzing system. The recovery of spiked cells to soil samples reached 80 Þ 40 %. In combination with Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH), the specific activity of cells parallel to the total counts could be determined.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{present a}} {{comparative}} study of orthodox medical practice and patent medicines during the nineteenth century. Paradigm changes in English society following the Industrial Revolution heralded {{the beginning of the}} end to an obsolete science, and of what can be regarded by modern standards as primitive and brutal medical treatment. Histories of the period indicate that premature death was likely to be caused by the early nineteenth- century doctor’s practices, and also was the likely outcome of the choice of the public to purchase and consume various concoctions, known as patent medicines. Two of these medicines, abortifacients to terminate unwanted pregnancy as well as opiate-based concoctions, are featured in this work as causal of much suffering, addiction, and even death. Contemporaneous with the rise of patent medicines, orthodox medical authorities attempted to modernise medical provision through professionalisation. However, throughout the nineteenth century, they were constantly frustrated in this endeavour. Despite attempts to change the competitive market economy for medical services, the dominant section of the profession was plagued by competition from within its own ranks, and from those from beyond the pale of orthodoxy, including the patent medicine industry. Doctors sought to control medicine and to enforce a power structure that placed them, without interference, in authority over other health providers. The provision of health became the object of an intense political struggle, and evidence presented here suggests that medical professionalisation occurred prior to the development a coherent knowledge base, and that social acceptance of orthodox medical practice was characterised by a long period of resistance by the public because of a lack of confidence in the ability of doctors to successfully treat disease and illness. The narrative that unfolds represents a complex series of societal and medical threads that are joined in the history of medicine in Queensland. The development of this British colony, subordinate to the authority of New South Wales, then a separate State in the Commonwealth of Australia, mirrored the political, social and medical activities that occurred throughout the Western world. Queensland represents a micro-scale version of these societal changes, thus allowing a detailed explanation to be presented. Through historical documentation and a detailed analysis of a common form of material <b>culture</b> (<b>patent</b> medicine bottles as represented in the historical and archaeological record), this work provides some understanding of the health concerns and use of medicines by the public during this period, and the manner in which orthodox medical practitioners finally became ascendant early in the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|Technology is the ‘engine of {{economic}} growth’ and technological progress {{is the most}} important factor driving a nation’s sustained economic growth. New technologies assume significant and long term role in this process {{of economic}} development. New technologies can trigger new cycles of economy, provide windows of opportunity for less developed countries {{to catch up with the}} more advanced nations and are important from the wealth creation point of view. However for this to happen, the technology should be able to reach society in the form of new products, processes. Nanotechnology is a new and emerging technology that can play important role to promote India’s economic development. Wide ranges of applications are claimed for nanotechnology and it is considered to be the next big wave of technology after information technology and biotechnology. Government of India has started a mission on nanoscience and nanotechnology in May 2007 with an allocation of ~ 200 million USD for 5 years. However, if one looks at the ‘Nanotechnology’ from the wealth creation point of view, then, research efforts alone in this field, are not sufficient. The research efforts should lead to new products, new processes, and new platforms. Management of technology can assume significant role in this process. It is generally agreed upon that management of nanotechnology is necessary to create economic advantage at the national level. However, the macro level understandings namely, policy at the national level, must result in ground level organization performance. In order to facilitate innovation in the field of NST (Nanoscience and Technology), the process of innovation in this field must be well understood. Infrastructure and management of R&D is a key aspect and entrepreneurship is vital for the development of a new technology. The aim of this study is to do the assessment of nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. Emerging technology assessments for nation building to meet societal objectives is an extremely complex task. Challenge lies in understanding complex R&D requirements and likely innovations at the lab level. Further challenge lies in assessing initiatives of the start-ups, individual entrepreneurs and comparing them with the Government research initiatives. Understanding the resource requirements of different research initiatives in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) will greatly assist in facilitating innovation in this field. Further understanding of human, cultural issues, education and training aspects, technical and market uncertainties faced by nanoscience and nanotechnology research initiatives will be an added advantage for the policy makers to facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST). Review of Literature A critical literature review in the field of Technology Management; Innovation, Technological Innovation; and nanoscience and nanotechnology from a business perspective gave researcher a strong foundation to define nanotechnological innovation and understand the process of nanotechnological innovation. This literature along with the literature on the emergence of a new industry helped identify factors that would facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. While understanding importance of management in developing nanotechnology to realize its benefits, no study has attempted to link the management processes with the innovation output in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Also, there are very few empirical studies in this area. Thus need to empirically determine various management processes that can facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology and their causal relatedness to output measures of innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology is identified as a research gap. Aims, Objectives This study aims at conceptualizing the challenges of developing appropriate framework for assessment of emerging technologies in a particular domain. It further aims to use this framework for assessing nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India and to come up with set of alternatives for policy makers at the national level. The objectives are 1. 	To develop a framework for the assessment of a new technology initiative with a view to enable innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. This further gave rise to two objectives viz, 	a. 	Measure the innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. 	b. 	Identify factors that enable innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. 1 	To use developed framework to assess nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. 2 	To make suggestions for effective institution building and develop interventions for efficient management of nanoscience and technology research and development initiatives. Conceptual Model The conceptual model links two major aspects viz., output of innovation and factors facilitating innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST). This model is used as a tool to assess nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. Output of innovation is measured at three levels, namely, Focused NST initiative -an initiative where with clear goals, deliverables and resources work on NST project has started. Newness of NST initiative -which measures generation of new products, new processes in the field of NST and Dissemination of NST initiative -which measures publications and patents in the field of NST. Factors facilitating innovation include Organization context, presence of Basic resources, Leadership, Strategic research partnerships, Link with venture capitalists, Technology characteristics and Innovation culture. These factors were thought to be positively linked with the output of innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Methodology Based on a critical literature review, a preliminary study entailing in-depth interviews with strategy experts and a pilot study, a structured questionnaire was developed, to measure constructs and variables in the conceptual model. The main study consisted of data collected from 112 researchers from private as well as public organizations engaged in nanoscience and nanotechnology research and development. Results and Discussion The first part of the analysis began with factor analysis. Based on the factor loadings 31 factors were obtained. These factors were considered to be facilitating innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Similarly output of innovation in the field of NST got loaded onto 3 factors, namely Focused NST initiative, Newness of NST initiative and Dissemination of NST initiative. Non-Hierarchical K-means (K = 2) cluster analysis resulted in two useful clusters among respondents; Cluster 1 primarily represented academic institutes whereas, Cluster 2 mainly represented private sector start-ups in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Factors facilitating innovation and output of innovation were compared across two clusters of the organizations. The student’s t-test was used to compare means of factor scores and items under it across two clusters. Based on the statistical significance of the difference between the factor scores across two clusters, conclusions were drawn as to whether the presence of factors facilitating innovation and output of innovation differ across academic institutes and private sector start-up firms. Significant differences were obtained between the two clusters of organizations with respect to availability of finance, technical and industrial experience of the leadership, strategic research partnerships, market uncertainty and link with the venture capitalists. Output of innovation also differed across two types of organizations, wherein, academic institutes were more active in producing “dissemination” output of innovation and private start-up firms are more active in producing “newness” output of innovation. The next stage of analysis dealt with finding out what among these factors actually contribute to innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Multiple linear regression technique was used to for this purpose. Thus, for three levels of innovation output, three regression models are obtained. Industrial experience of the leaders, Finance, Market readiness of the products are some of the factors facilitating ‘Newness’ output of innovation, whereas, Academic experience and Link with the technical communities are some of the factors affecting Dissemination of NST Initiative. The next stage of analysis dealt with simultaneous estimation of dependent variables. Structural equation modeling in the form of path analysis (AMOS software from SPSS) was used for this purpose. This also helped in explaining how different variables (dependent as well as independent) are related to each other. At an aggregate level, causal model could be fitted between factors facilitating innovation and output of innovation in the field of nanoscience and technology. Chi-square, Normed Fit Index (NFI) and Root mean square error analysis (RMSEA) were the measures used to accept the model. Path analysis also helped to find significant covariances among the independent variables. Concomitant with the quantitative approach of data analysis, qualitative approach using case study was also used to assess nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives in India. Case study was conducted in two different types of organizations; a premier academic institution and a private start-up firm. Case study revealed that private sector organizations indeed struggle to raise finance. However, high entrepreneurial attitude motivates these young engineers. In case of academic institutions it was noted that in an academic environment there is no real motivation for commercialization or taking research to the market. Performance and rewards for faculty depend to a large extent on publications and to a very small extent on <b>patents.</b> <b>Culture</b> of industrial R&D is not very strong in India and not many companies are willing to experiment. Major conclusions of the study Major conclusions of the study pointed out differences between academic institutes and private start-up firms with respect to availability of the resources, leadership of the people, strategic research partnerships. It also pointed out differences in the types of output of innovation produced by these two firms. Causal analysis in the form of regression and path analysis pointed out factors actually contributing to innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Case study analyzed qualitatively challenges faced by researchers from academic institutes and private start-up firms. Major Suggestions to organizations From the data analyzed in the study, it can be seen that private sector firms in India are facing the problem of raising finance as compared with academic institutions. Similarly, analysis of the data shows, significantly less Industry – Government interactions as compared with Academic institutions – Government interactions. Understanding the importance of private industries in developing applications of new technologies, Government needs to come out with appropriate practices to build a good “ecosystem” for nanotechnology innovation. At the national level, efforts are undertaken by the Government to increase and encourage research initiatives in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Substantial investment can be made in developing technology managers and also build technology entrepreneurs who would commercialize the products and build new products from the new technology. Thus, formation of start-up firms can be encouraged. This will absorb the manpower trained by academic research institutes and will enhance technical and market experience among researchers which was noted as a important factor for enhancing ‘newness’ output of innovation. Detailed analysis of various programs initiated by Government of India does show presence of various mechanisms to promote private sector initiatives in field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. However, present study shows that the private sector is finding it difficult to raise finance through various Government schemes. Academic sector is the major beneficiary of Government funding however, the research results stop at publications in these organizations. Private sector is able to bring new products, new processes, however, struggles to raise finance. Thus private sector start-ups could be funded with Government funding mechanisms. These mechanisms can be made less cumbersome for the start-up firms. Academic sector on the other hand should be encouraged by way of incentives for generation of new products. Considering importance of strategic research partnerships, institutional mechanisms could be put into place which will enhance Government – Industry and Industry-Academia research interaction. Contribution of the study The main contribution of this study includes, a conceptual model involving resource based view of innovation. The conceptual model is further used for measuring output of innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) at three levels, namely newness of NST initiative, dissemination of NST initiative and having a focused NST research initiative. Factors which may promote and facilitate innovation in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) are also measured. Comparison is made across different types of organizations to see availability of these enabling factors in Indian nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives. Using regression analysis and path analysis, factors which actually contribute to innovation in the field of NST are identified. The main implication of the study is towards a better policy formulation in strengthening human resources, organizational capability, increasing funding for research and enhancing academic – industry interaction for better innovative performance. Limitations of the study The present study does not include all the types of organizations in the technology environment, this includes, namely nanoscience and nanotechnology R&D initiatives in large sized organizations and Government research organizations like Defense research and Development Organization (DRDO), Indian Space research Organization (ISRO). These organizations were contacted for data collection for this study, however they denied permission. Directions for future research Present study involved cross section of researchers engaged in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Future studies can be longitudinal that can track changes in leadership, organizational structure and organizational processes. This study provides a conceptual model that can be used for the assessment of other new technologies in India e. g. defence or manufacturing related technologies...|$|R
