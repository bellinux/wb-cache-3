40|$|By {{identifying}} the success factors of a programme on <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> potato selection, {{this article analyses}} the role of research in agricultural innovation. The <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> selection programme developed an approach {{to improve the quality}} of seed potatoes by ware potato growers, complementary to specialized seed production systems now widely promoted in sub-Saharan Africa. With more weight being placed on innovation rather than on research outcome, the role of research has been widened and research has assumed responsibility for developing and piloting effective training through partnership with extension. Researchers effectively contributed to innovation because they were given and took the liberty of pursuing a ‘bright idea’. The case discussed in this article points out that innovation can emerge from old technology within existing institutional environments, and can be surprisingly simple as long as researchers have room to manoeuvre and opportunity to engage in partnerships with practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Finding {{occurrences of}} {{specific}} grammatical constructions in running text {{is a central}} issue to constructionist approaches to linguistics and language processing. Of special concern are partially schematic constructions that cannot be distinguished from unrelated constructions by surface form alone. In order to detect instances of such complex constructions we consider using features that are intended to capture semantic restrictions of particular construction elements. We address this task as an information retrieval (IR) problem, and describe a simple interactive architecture for searching for constructions. The retrieval system is guided by the user who provides it {{with a number of}} <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> examples (occurrences of the construction) and tailors a ranking function based on a combination of lexical semantic similarity features (lexicon-based or distributional). The system was evaluated using standard IR metrics on a new benchmark for construction retrieval in Swedish, and we observed that a lexical-semantic re-ranker can give significant improvement over a lemma-based baseline, but must be tailored for the construction at hand. The search system is effective even with a small number of <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> examples, which proves the feasibility of our approach from a user perspective...|$|R

This work aims to investigate the major operating parameters of FD such as coolant temperature, freezing duration, supercooling, <b>seeding,</b> <b>agitation,</b> crystallizer material and subsequent washing procedure on ice production and water quality. It {{was found that the}} optimal freezing duration per batch was 1 h for an iron crystallizer and 1. 5 h for a glass crystallizer. The optimal coolant temperature should be around − 8 °C. The optimal amount of washing water to clean the raw ice was about 50 wt% of the raw ice. Over 50 wt% of the feed could be recovered as raw ice within 1 h, which means an overall ice recovery rate of higher than 25 % (of the original seawater), considering the consumption of washing water. Both artificial and real seawater were tested under the optimized conditions. The total dissolved solid in the product ice was around 300 ppm, which met the World Health Organization (WHO) potable water salinity standard of 500 ppm. Therefore, the process parameters optimized in this study can be directly used for the freeze desalination of seawater...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this research, given a corpus {{containing}} blog posts {{written in}} Hebrew and two seed sentiment lists, we analyze {{the positive and}} negative sentences included in the corpus, and special groups of words that are associated with the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>seed</b> words. We discovered many new negative words (around half of the top 50 words) but only one positive word. Among the top words that are associated with the <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> words, we discovered various first-person and third-person pronouns. Intensifiers were found for both the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>seed</b> words. Most of the corpus’ sentences are neutral. For the rest, the rate of positive sentences is above 80 %. The sentiment scores of the top words that are associated with the positive words are significantly higher than those of the top words that are associated with the negative words. Our conclusions are as follows. Positive sentences more “refer to” the authors themselves (first-person pronouns and related words) and are also more general, e. g., more related to other people (third-person pronouns), while negative sentences are much more concentrated on negative things and therefore contain many new negative words. Israeli bloggers tend to use intensifiers in order to emphasize or even exaggerate their sentiment opinions (both positive and negative). These bloggers not only write much more positive sentences than negative sentences, but also write much longer positive sentences than negative sentences...|$|R

40|$|In Kenya, seed potato {{quality is}} often a major yield {{constraint}} in potato production as smallholder farmers use farm-saved seed without proper management of seed-borne pests and diseases.

Positive selection gave an average yield increase in farmer-managed trials of 34 %, corresponding to a 284 -€ increase in profit per hectare at an additional production cost of only 6 €/ha. Positive selection {{can be an important}} alternative and complementary technology to regular seed replacement, especially in the context of imperfect rural economies characterized by high risks of production and insecure markets.

40|$|Intraoperative {{dosimetry}} in prostate brachytherapy requires localization of the implanted radioactive seeds. A tomosynthesis-based seed reconstruction {{method is}} proposed. A three-dimensional volume is reconstructed from Gaussian-blurred projection images and candidate seed locations are computed from the reconstructed volume. A false <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> removal process, formulated as an optimal coverage problem, iteratively removes “ghost ” seeds that {{are created by}} tomosynthesis reconstruction. In an effort to minimize pose errors that are common in conventional C-arms, initial pose parameter estimates are iteratively corrected by using the detected candidate seeds as fiducials, which automatically “focuses ” the collected images and improves successive reconstructed volumes. Simulation results imply that the implanted seed locations can be estimated with a detection rate of ≥ 97. 9 % and ≥ 99. 3 % from three and four images, respectively, when the C-arm is calibrated and the pose of the C-arm is known.

40|$|Abstract. Lymph nodes {{routinely}} need to {{be considered}} in clinical practice in all kinds of oncological examinations. Automatic detection of lymph nodes from chest CT data is however challenging because of low contrast and clutter. Sliding window detectors using traditional fea-tures easily get confused by similar structures like muscles and vessels. It recently has been proposed to combine segmentation and detection to improve the detection performance. Features extracted from a segmenta-tion that is initialized with a detection candidate can be used to train a classifier that decides whether the detection is a true or false positive. In this paper, the graph cuts method is adapted to the problem of lymph nodes segmentation. We propose a setting that requires only a single <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> {{and at the same time}} solves the small cut problem of graph cuts. Furthermore, we propose a feature set that is extracted from the candidate segmentation. A classifier is trained on this feature set and used to reject false alarms. Cross validation on 54 CT datasets showed that the proposed system reaches a detection rate of 60. 9 % with only 6. 1 false alarms per volume image, which is better than the current state of the art of mediastinal lymph node detection. ...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} of direct copper precipitation from a loaded chelating extractant using hydrogen in an autoclave (pressure hydrogen stripping) was studied. In its simplest form, {{the reaction is}} given by{CuL(, 2) }(,org) + H(, 2) (g) ( [...] ->) 2 {HL}(,org) + Cu(s). Kelex 100 (Sherex Chemical Co. - commercial solvent extraction reagent), an alkylated derivative of 8 -hydroxyquinoline {{was used as the}} basis of the present investigation and represents HL in the above equation. Two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study the chemical and thermal response of the extractant at high temperature and hydrogen pressures and (b) those which describe the chemistry and kinetics of hydrogen stripping. The extractant was found to exhibit excellent chemical stability up to 573 K (300 (DEGREES) C) and 2. 76 MPa (400 psi) hydrogen in the absence of copper. Its chemical stability was somewhat reduced when loaded with copper. In the latter case, some limited hydrogenation of the quinoline nucleus of the extractant and some of the impurities present (furoquinolines) was observed. The chemical stability of the extractant was found to be enhanced when at least 0. 52 M of a long-chain alcohol (decanol) was added to the organic solvent (0. 4 M Kelex/kerosene). A slow thermal dissociation of the copper chelate was found to take place within the experimental temperature range studied (443 to 488 K). This resulted in copper precipitation and organic regeneration. Copper in a powder form was found to precipitate rapidly from loaded Kelex 100 /decanol/kerosene solvents by reaction with hydrogen at pressures between 0. 52 and 4. 00 MPa (75 and 580 psi) and temperatures from 443 to 488 K (170 to 215 (DEGREES) C). The overall process has heterogeneous characteristics. Nuclei are provided through slow thermal dissociation of the copper chelate. The freshly produced metallic copper, acting autocatalytically accelerates the precipitation kinetics. Reduction of the Cu(II) chelate to Cu(I) complex appears to be the rate controlling step. In addition to temperature and pressure, the effects of <b>seeding,</b> <b>agitation,</b> copper concentration, ligand concentration and copper chelate age were investigated. Some physical and chemical properties of the copper powder product were also determined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the 1990 s {{numerous}} winter {{orographic cloud}} seeding experiments were conducted over Utah’s Wasatch Plateau. Several previously published case studies suc-cessfully documented the physical response in clouds and precipitation to ground-based seeding with silver iodide and liquid propane. A previously unpublished case study that shows additional evidence of <b>positive</b> <b>seeding</b> effects is presented here. Careful docu-mentation of seeding plume transport and dispersion coupled with aircraft and ground-based measurements {{within and outside}} the seeding plume are used to verify the steps in the conceptual model for orographic cloud seeding. It is shown that seeding produced significant increases in ice crystal concentrations (well above 10 times the natural back-ground at aircraft level) and strong indications of increased precipitation at the surface (> 3 times the precipitation rate measured outside the seeding plume). Compared to other Utah results, the most unique aspect of this case study was the apparent detection of the seeding effect in the data from the project Ka-band radar. The radar seeding signa-ture documented the areal extent and duration of the seeding effect {{in a way that was}} not previously possible using the more intermittent aircraft measurements and the lower spa-tial resolution precipitation data.

40|$|Abstract A {{randomized}} {{experiment to}} test propane cloud seeding effectiveness {{was conducted on}} the Utah's Wasatch Plateau during the 2003 / 04 winter. Propane dispensers were operated at a previously used high altitude site well up the windward slope. The primary target precipitation gauge was 4. 3 km downwind, on top the plateau, where earlier plume tracking demonstrated routine targeting with seeding site winds from the southwest quadrant. Gauges were maintained upwind and downwind of the primary target, along the expected plume trajectory, but no more than 6. 5 km downwind of the propane dispensers because of targeting uncertainties. A well-correlated crosswind control gauge provided the covariate used in all statistical testing. The experiment was completely automated with 2 hr experimental periods declared when a specified icing rate was exceeded at the seeding site. Each period contained a pair of experimental units, one seeded and one placebo, with treatment by random decision. Three different statistical tests were applied. Statistically significant seeding-caused precipitation increases were strongly suggested by the exploratory experiment for the entire population of 98 experimental units, for a partition of 69 units with wind directions expected to result in successful targeting, and for the same wind directions but excluding highest natural snowfalls. Intriguing but inconclusive suggestions of possible <b>positive</b> <b>seeding</b> effects resulted when supercooled liquid water (icing) was detected, with warmer temperatures and for lighter wind speeds.

40|$|Twenty-five winter type {{rapeseed}} varieties introduced {{from diverse}} {{sources of the}} world were studied for variability, heritability, genetic advance, correlation and path analysis of seed yield and yield components. Significant differences among genotypes {{for most of the}} traits indicated that there is sufficient variability available to have an effective selection. Genotypic and phenotypic variances were highest for pods/plant followed by plant height, whereas the maximum genotypic and phenotypic coefficients of variability were found in seed yield/plant and pods/plant, respectively. Broad sense heritability estimates ranged from very low to high. Maximum heritability of 0. 903 was obtained for days to maturity followed by flower duration (0. 662), seed weight (0. 548) and seed yield (0. 477). High heritability for flower duration, seed weight and seed yield coupled with high genetic advance indicated that these traits could be improved through mass selection. Positive and significant correlation was found between seed yield and harvest index, seed weight and flower duration. Significant and <b>positive</b> correlation of <b>seed</b> weight with harvest index, flower duration and seed yield indicated that improvement in seed weight will give higher harvest index ultimately resulting high seed yield.

40|$|SummaryFor optimal survival, various {{environmental}} and endogenous factors should be monitored {{to determine the}} appropriate timing for seed germination. Light is a major environmental factor affecting seed germination, which is perceived by phytochromes. The light-dependent activation of phytochrome B (PHYB) modulates abscisic acid and gibberellic acid signaling and metabolism. Thus far, several negative regulators of seed germination that act when PHYB is inactive have been reported. However, neither <b>positive</b> regulators of <b>seed</b> germination downstream of PHYB nor a direct mechanism for regulation of the hormone levels has been elucidated. Here, we show that the histone arginine demethylases, JMJ 20 and JMJ 22, act redundantly as <b>positive</b> regulators of <b>seed</b> germination. When PHYB is inactive, JMJ 20 /JMJ 22 are directly repressed by the zinc-finger protein SOMNUS. However, upon PHYB activation, JMJ 20 /JMJ 22 are derepressed, resulting in increased gibberellic acid levels through the removal of repressive histone arginine methylations at GA 3 ox 1 /GA 3 ox 2, which in turn promotes seed germination...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores some of {{the many}} roles music, as a healing and nurturing art, plays in support of health and wellness. The fundamental question is how does music nurture, revive, animate, and inspire us to lead healthier and richer lives? Historical and modern sources, ranging from ancient philosophical works to reports of laboratory-based investigations, suggests that music is a remarkably positive and therapeutic element in the development of happier, healthier individuals, and well-adjusted societies. This study is the outcome of three deeply personal impulses: a) the experience of one who has personally benefited from music as a healing balm; b) the performer's desire to better understand the positive reactions, both emotional and physical, of audiences to specific musical selections and genres; and c) growing evidence that society is weakened and dulled (nor can foot feel, being shod) by the loss of the collective experience of live music due to the proliferation of digital technologies that facilitate access to a complexity of recorded music choices. There is compelling scientific documentation that experience listening to and creating live music when very young is especially beneficial. If the <b>positive</b> <b>seeds</b> of music are not planted in youth, the continued disintegration of the long-standing cultural musical institutions that serve a vital role in maintaining the social fabric is threatened. The dissertation documents the authors own response to the diminution of opportunities for participation in live music: the establishment of Euterpe, a non-profit charitable organization that presents live interactive classical and jazz performance programs for children in the public school system.

Little is known about i) the extent of transgene introgression into locally recycled seed, ii) what short and long-term ecological and socioeconomic impacts such mixing of seeds might have, iii) how the farmers perceive GM crops, and iv) to what degree approval conditions are followed and controlled. This study conducted in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, aims primarily at addressing the first of these issues. We analysed for transgenes in 796 individual maize plants (leaves) and 20 seed batches collected in a village where GM insect resistant maize was previously promoted and grown as part of an governmental agricultural development program over a seven year period (2001 - 2008). Additionally, we surveyed the varieties of maize grown and the farmers' practices of recycling and sharing of seed in the same community (26 farmers were interviewed). Recycling and sharing of seeds were common in the community and may contribute to spread and persistence of transgenes in maize on a local or regional level. By analysing DNA we found that the commonly used transgene promoter p 35 s occurred in one of the 796 leaf samples (0. 0013 %) and in five of the 20 seed samples (25 %). Three of the 20 seed samples (15 %) included herbicide tolerant maize (NK 603) intentionally grown by the farmers from seed bought from local seed retailers or acquired through a currently running agricultural development program. The two remaining <b>positive</b> <b>seed</b> samples (10 %) included genes for insect resistance (from MON 810). In both cases the farmers were unaware of the transgenes present.

[...] The results of this experiment are inconclusive, however, because a test was used with an opiate cutoff level of 300ng/mL instead of the current SAMHSA recommended cutoff level used in the NIDA 5 test, which was raised from 300ng/mL to 2,000ng/mL in 1998 in order to avoid such false <b>positives</b> from poppy <b>seeds.</b>|$|R
30|$|There is a {{significant}} positive impact of cultivated land on seed sold volume in the market but its effect on market participation is not significant {{as in the case}} of the age of HHH. One ha increase in cultivated land leads to an increase of the seed volume sold by 6 %. Irrigation also showed {{a significant}} <b>positive</b> impact on <b>seed</b> volume sold which would be increased by 4.2 % with an increase in the irrigated land by 1 %. These findings are also consistent with those of Azam et al. (2012).|$|R
40|$|Abstract- 50 pigeonpea genotypes were {{evaluated}} {{to study the}} nature and magnitude of relationship of important agronomic traits with seed yield along with their direct and indirect effects. Days to maturity, number of primary branches per plant, number of pods per plant, and harvest index had significant <b>positive</b> association with <b>seed</b> yield, also showed direct positive effect in determining yield in pigeonpea. Hence due emphasis {{should be given to}} number of pods per plant, number of primary branches and harvest index for improvement of seed yield in pigeonpea...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of sowing dates {{carried out on}} 5 April, 20 April, 5 May and 20 May as well as nitrogen-fertilizer applied in 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha - 1 dosages were studied on the growth, seed yield and seed swelling factor of isabgol (Plantago ovata). The best time for sowing of isabgol in this region was 5 May and the suitable amount of nitrogen was 100 kg ha - 1. The stepwise multiple regression analysis verified that the seed yield among other characters studied showed a significant <b>positive</b> effect on <b>seed</b> swelling...|$|R
