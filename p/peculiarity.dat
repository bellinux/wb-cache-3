The táltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical <b>peculiarity.</b> They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from {{compounds}} where, among others, plantain, coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well.

Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of, among others, stamp duty on clothes (clothes could not be sold privately and had to have official stamp), Taraku or levy on items of food, and Port and customs duties. Columbuthurai, which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at Poonakari with its boat services, {{was one of the}} chief port, and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of Pachilaippalai. Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna to be sold to foreign buyers. They were shipped abroad from a bay called Urukathurai, which is now called Kayts—a shortened form of Portuguese Caes dos elephantess (Bay of Elephants). Perhaps a <b>peculiarity</b> of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical <b>peculiarity,</b> such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E

40|$|In A- {{and late}} B-type stars, strong {{magnetic}} fields are always associated with Ap and Bp chemical <b>peculiarities.</b> However, {{it is not}} clear at what point in a star's evolution those <b>peculiarities</b> develop. Strong magnetic fields have been observed in pre-main sequence A and B stars (Herbig Ae and Be stars), and these objects have been proposed to be the progenitors of Ap and Bp stars. However, the photospheric chemical abundances of these magnetic Herbig stars have not been studied carefully, and furthermore the chemical abundances of 'normal' non-magnetic Herbig stars remain poorly characterized. To investigate this issue, we have studied the photospheric compositions of 23 Herbig stars, four of which have confirmed magnetic fields. Surprisingly, we found that half the non-magnetic stars in our sample show lambda Bootis chemical <b>peculiarities</b> to varying degrees. For the stars with detected magnetic fields, we find one chemically normal star, one star with lambda Boo <b>peculiarities,</b> one star displaying weak Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities,</b> and one somewhat more evolved star with somewhat stronger Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities.</b> These results suggests that Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities</b> are preceded by magnetic fields, and that these <b>peculiarities</b> develop over the pre-main sequence lives of A and B stars. The incidence of lambda Boo stars we find is much higher than that seen on the main sequence. We argue that a selective accretion model for the formation of lambda Boo <b>peculiarities</b> is a natural explanation for this remarkably large incidence.

5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some <b>peculiarity</b> connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E
5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) is the work of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The Baroque Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its <b>peculiarity</b> lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{escalated}} when Baldwin deprived {{the monks}} {{of some of}} the revenues of their monastic estates. After that, Baldwin proposed to establish a church dedicated to Becket in Canterbury itself, staffed by secular rather than monastic clergy. The monks of the cathedral chapter saw this proposed foundation as the first step in an attempt to change the see of Canterbury from a monastic cathedral chapter, a <b>peculiarity</b> of the English Church, to the more normal pattern of secular clergy. It is not clear if Baldwin himself intended such a plan, but the other bishops supported the effort, as contemporary writers made clear. Baldwin sought the advice of Hugh, the Bishop of Lincoln, who advised Baldwin to abandon the plan as it would only cause distress to all parties. The controversy was long and involved and, at one point, the monks were imprisoned within their own buildings {{for a year and a}} half, from January 1188 to August 1189. This led to the suspension of the liturgy in the cathedral. Eventually all the prominent ecclesiastics and monastic houses of Europe were forced into choosing sides in the dispute. In October 1189, in an attempt to gain control, Baldwin appointed Roger Norreys as the chapter's prior, an appointment widely acknowledged by contemporaries as putting a useless individual into the office. His plan for financing the church involved soliciting contributions from donors by promising a one-third reduction in penances for annual donations.|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{many other}} industries, {{construction}} is {{a specific type of}} project industry with certain pe- culiarities influencing the characteristics of constructed products, ways of production, and the indus- try itself. Previously three major <b>peculiarities</b> of production in construction have been discussed, i. e. site production (i. e. organising the production around the product dependent on outdoor conditions), temporary production organisation (e. g. fragmented supply chain), and one-of-a kind product (e. g. de- sign-to-order project-based production). Many times, particularly within the realms of lean construc- tion, the basic hypothesis has been that these <b>peculiarities</b> lead to variability and thus to waste, and low performance levels in terms of productivity and value delivery to clients. Inversely, lean construction should be aimed at the banning of waste, thus reduction of variability, and thus the reduction or even resolution of <b>peculiarities.</b> In this paper, the <b>peculiarities</b> of production in construction are discussed and whether they always cause problems, whether they are always leading to waste, and whether they always can and need to be reduced or resolved. Some examples of solutions resolving or reducing certain <b>peculiarities</b> are given, such as modular housing, pre-engineered buildings and off-site production. Based on the examples, the effects and costs of reduction and resolution of <b>peculiarities</b> are discussed. To conclude it is discussed whether construction must and can always be improved by resolving the <b>peculiarities,</b> and at what cost. It is concluded that <b>peculiarities</b> should be resolved when they are not needed. However, before to decide to do so, the additional costs or even the potential value loss that may be caused by <b>peculiarities</b> must always be related to the whole life costs and value of the object built, and the extra costs and efforts for resolving the <b>peculiarities.</b> Finally, issues for future research are given...|$|R

40|$|On {{the main}} sequence, roughly 10 - 20 % of A- and B-type stars display {{a wide range}} of {{chemical}} <b>peculiarities</b> in their photospheres. It is unknown when during stellar evolution these chemical <b>peculiarities</b> develop, and the mechanisms for the formation of some <b>peculiarities</b> are Dot fully understood. In order to provide strong observational constraints, this thesis investigates chemical abundances in Herbig Ae and Be (HAeBe) stars, which are pre-main sequence progenitors of A and B stars. A detailed abundance analysis was performed for 20 HAeBe stars, and 1 dusty young star, using high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The abundance analysis proceeded by directly fitting synthetic spectra to observations, determining effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence, and projected rotational velocity self-consistently with chemical abundances. The synthetic spectra were computed with the program ZEEMAN, which was developed further, optimising it for nonmagnetic spectrum synthesis, adding an automatic fitting routine, and parallelising the program. Eleven of the stars are found to display 'Boots chemical <b>peculiarities,</b> one star shows weak Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities,</b> and the remaining 9 stars are found to be chemically normal. The star with weak Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities</b> has a confirmed magnetic field detection in the literature, as do one],. Boo star and one chemically normal star. The other stars have been searched for magnetic fields, but have no confirmed detections. I argue that the large incidence of Boo chemical <b>peculiarities</b> among HAeSe stars provides strong evidence in favour of a selective accretion hypothesis for the formation of A Boo <b>peculiarities.</b> Among the magnetic stars, it appears that Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities</b> can form on the pre-main sequence but, unlike the main sequence, there' are also chemically normal magnetic HAeBe stars.

To investigate this issue, in this paper we study the photospheric compositions of a sample of Herbig Ae and Be stars, which are considered to be the pre-main sequence progenitors of A and B stars. We have performed a detailed abundance analysis of 20 Herbig stars (three of which have confirmed magnetic fields), and one dusty young star. We have found that half the stars in our sample show lambda Boo chemical <b>peculiarities</b> to varying degrees, only one star shows weak Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities,</b> and all the remaining stars are chemically normal. The incidence of lambda Boo chemical <b>peculiarities</b> we find in Herbig stars is much higher than what is seen on the main sequence. We argue that a selective accretion model for lambda Boo star formation is a natural explanation for the remarkably large number of lambda Boo stars in our sample. We also find that the magnetic Herbig stars do not exhibit a range of chemical compositions remarkably different from the normal stars: one magnetic star displays lambda Boo chemical <b>peculiarities</b> (HD 101412), one displays weak Ap/Bp <b>peculiarities</b> (V 380 Ori A), and one (HD 190073) is chemically normal. This is completely different from what is seen on the main sequence, where all magnetic A and cool B stars show Ap/Bp chemical <b>peculiarities,</b> and {{this is consistent with the}} idea that the magnetic field precedes the formation of the chemical <b>peculiarities</b> typical of Ap and Bp stars.
