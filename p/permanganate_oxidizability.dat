40|$|In pursuance of {{previous}} studies water samples were taken in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during the 12 th, 14 th and 15 th cruises of RV Mikhail Lomonosov in 1962 - 1964 to determine total and particulate organic carbon and <b>permanganate</b> <b>oxidizability.</b> Preliminary processing of the water samples {{was carried out in}} the normal manner in the on-board laboratory immediately after they had been taken: destruction of bicarbonates and carbonates by precise addition of acid (by alkalinity) and evaporation to dryness at 50 - 60 Â°C. It is quite probable that the corresponding volatile fraction of organic matter is lost under these conditions. In discussion it was demonstrated that it may now be assumed that the carbon of the volatile fraction averages approximately 15 % of total carbon, i. e., 15 % of the sum of organic carbon of the volatile and nonvolatile fractions. Oxidizability was determined in all samples in the on-board laboratory...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to study the influence of anthropogenic burden on the catchment areas of the rivers in Vologda Region and to establish the dependence of the chemical composition of water on pollution sources in the rivers of the Verkhnyaya Sukhona basin. In the catchment areas hydro chemical samples were taken, population density was calculated {{as well as the}} automated and visual interpretation of the main elements of the landscape was carried out. At that, forests, populated areas, farmlands and other territories changed by economic activities were identified. An increase in the pollutants concentration in the catchment areas on drawing near the regional center was detected. The development of the catchment areas varies depending on the landscape pattern and on the proximity to the city of Vologda. The population density and the relative area of settlements and farmlands increase while approaching to the city, {{at the same time the}} ratio of forests decreases. The positive correlation dependence between the phosphate content and the relative size of farmlands was shown. The main source of pollutants in the catchment areas of the Verkhnyaya Sukhona basin is the presence of settlements and high population density. Under such conditions, high concentration of sodium, chlorine, nitrogen-containing compounds as well as <b>permanganate</b> <b>oxidizability</b> are observed in water...|$|E
