The 1,250 BRT Bedan, built in Clyde and also launched in 1972, was owned by J & A Gardner & Co. Ltd. of Glasgow. On February 23, 1982, the ship was at anchor off Derry, awaiting the tide to <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is no {{trail to}} Sulphide Creek Falls. The closest trail is the Baker River Trail, which {{parallels}} the Baker River (which Sulphide Creek flows into). The trail crosses Sulphide Creek at the confluence.

She participated in the fierce engagement at Fort Hindman, or Arkansas Post, 11 January as part of the division of light-draft gunboats under the overall command of Lieutenant Commander Watson Smith. As army forces launched the assault, Glide and the other gunboats helped to silence the powerful batteries. She passed the fort under heavy fire and <b>proceeded</b> <b>upstream</b> to cut off possible escape routes for the garrison.|$|R

The Hallie Rifles returned the fire. The shooting continued for ten to fifteen minutes. One stray bullet pierced the supply pipe between the vessel's boiler and engine, thus cutting off its power, and the boat drifted downriver, out of gun range, and lodged on the southern (western) shore. The boat's captain, a pilot, and one rifleman were killed; the other pilot and three or four riflemen were wounded. One source stated that the Brooks regiment suffered one man killed and three wounded; another report was that five men were killed and [...] "quite a number" [...] wounded." ...|$|E
50|$|Sometime {{during the}} mid-nineteenth century, the {{increasing}} number of inhabitants who were joined by Christian immigrants from other places transferred to a new settlement in the present site of Colorado. By this time, The Spanish government was already sending missionaries to all parts of the island and the group that went up the Kalinawan River reached the settlement of Colorado, a name derived from the word Colorado meaning colored, because of the white spotted arms of Domingo Mondoy, the brave settler who dared to face the newcomers. <b>Proceeding</b> <b>upstream,</b> the missionaries reached Celopan and seeing a native inside a hut, the floor of which was just one meter above the water, they asked him what the place was called. Thinking that the Spaniards were referring to the hut, he answered Habongan. Thus, Celopan was renamed Habongan which later became Jabonga.|$|E
40|$|The {{migration}} permeability of weirs for fishes {{is considered}} one of the strategic revitalisation measures which can significantly contribute to the restoration and stabilisation of fish biodiversity. It is inevitable to define priorities for the preparation and realisation of successive steps in this respect. In principle, the migration permeability should be renewed systematically, starting from the lowest lying migration barriers and <b>proceeding</b> <b>upstream.</b> Highest priority should be given to measures and constructions that are vital in renewing the occurrence and dispersion of native and mostly protected and rare species (Zingel zingel, Z. streber, Pelecus cultratus, Gymnocephalus schraetser, G. baloni, among others). High priority should be given to fish ladders which permit reproduction migrations (Chondrostoma nasus, Leuciscus idus, Lota lota, Vimba vimba, etc.), in which this is an important part of biology, and the condition of restoring stability of their populations...|$|E

40|$|Spawning occurs {{from late}} May into July but mainly in a 3 -wk period from late May to mid-late June and ends {{progressively}} later <b>proceeding</b> <b>upstream.</b> Light intensity seemed to regulate when spawning began each day. Fish selected shallow riffle areas in preference to pool habitat for spawning. Except {{for the most}} grossly polluted tidal water, spawning and nursery areas now extend throughout fresh water of the main Delaware and into the East and West branches. The most important spawning grounds and nurseries are now located from Port Jervis, N. Y., to Hancock, N. Y., and extend into the lower East Branch; this has probably been the case since 1910 - 1920. There has been a fundamental upstream shift in the chief spawning grounds and nurseries since {{the decline of the}} Delaware River shad runs, because these historically extended downstream from about Delaware Water Gap, Pa., and included tidal water. Reasons for this shift suggest intrastream homing. Only a small proportion of the historical nursery now contributes to production. Nursery and spawning areas now contribute to production of adults in proportion to their distance from Philadelphia, Pa. The extent of the spawning and nursery area since about 1910 - 20 has probably expanded and contracted around a core area in the upper Delaware near Hancock. Future prospects of Delaware River shad depend upon water quality in the tidal area and the proposed Tocks Island dam. Extirpation of the remnant runs is a distinct possibility...|$|E

In their raids around Cow Creek, the Nez Perce killed five men and stole or destroyed at least 85 tons of military supplies. [...] However, although they gained a cornucopia of supplies, they had lost a day of travel and Brown proposed that the delay might have been decisive in allowing the US Army to catch up.|$|R
50|$|In 1598 some Dutch {{employed}} by the Greenland Company wintered in the Bay. Eleven years later, the Dutch East India Company financed English navigator Henry Hudson {{in his attempt to}} search for the Northwest Passage. During this attempt, Henry Hudson decided to sail his ship up the river that would later be named after him. As he continued up the river, its width expanded, into Haverstraw Bay, leading him to believe he had successfully reached the Northwest Passage. He docked his ship on the western shore of Haverstraw Bay and claimed the territory as the first Dutch settlement in North America. He also <b>proceeded</b> <b>upstream</b> as far as present-day Troy before concluding that no such strait existed there.|$|R
50|$|The embassy {{departed}} Macao on 23 June. It {{stopped in}} Zhoushan, where Staunton went ashore {{to meet with}} the military governor of Dinghai. The emperor had sent instructions to every port in China to provide pilots to guide the British visitors, and the governor did so. However, Chinese officials had not anticipated that the British intended to sail the high seas rather than hopping from port to port in shallow waters along the coast, as was typical of Chinese vessels. They expressed surprise at the size and speed of the British ships. Anticipating that these vessels with their deep hulls {{would not be able to}} <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream</b> past Tianjin, they hired boats to carry the mission and its cargo to the capital.|$|R
50|$|The {{navigation}} {{left the}} Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal immediately opposite Baswich Salt Works. A roving bridge carried the canal towpath over the channel, which headed north. A small aqueduct carried {{it over a}} drainage ditch, and into the lock. At normal river levels, {{the fall of the}} lock was about 6.5 ft. The course turned to the north-west, to join the River Sow, with the towpath on the south bank. Most traffic turned left, to <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream,</b> but boats could also reach St Thomas flour mill a little way downstream, although this was not advisable when the river was in flood. Immediately after the junction, the River Penk joined the Sow, and a footbridge carried the towpath over the confluence.|$|R
50|$|Service to Corvallis {{required}} a sufficient level {{of water in}} the river. As of December 4, 1912, with recent rainfall the river was 4 feet above low water level, considered, by M.P.

40|$|Within {{a limited}} range of {{incident}} laser-beam intensities, laser drilling of a sapphire wafer initiates {{on the surface of}} the wafer where the laser beam exits and <b>proceeds</b> <b>upstream</b> in the laser beam to the surface where the laser beam enters the wafer. This reverse laser drilling is the result of the constructive interference between the laser beam and its reflected component on the exit face of the wafer. Constructive interference occurs only at the exit face of the sapphire wafer because the internally reflected laser beam suffers no phase change there. A model describing reverse laser drilling predicts the ranges of incident laser-beam intensity where no drilling, reverse laser drilling, and forward laser drilling can be expected in various materials. The application of reverse laser drilling in fabricating feed-through conductors in silicon-on-sapphire wafers for a massively parallel processer is described...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{mechanisms}} of failure of levees is a phenomenon called ??piping,?? which generally begins {{with the formation of}} a sand boil at the leeward side of the levee, and has been frequently observed to <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream</b> along the base of the levee through a slit formation. The issue of most important concern is to estimate the critical head that could promote the occurrence of piping. Considering the flow through porous media and coupling it with Bernoulli?s equation and a critical tractive stress condition, a model is developed for the critical head. Using appropriate transformations, the proposed model takes on a form which supports Bligh?s empirical findings. Another model based on critical velocity is also developed to estimate the critical head. The functional form of these two models is evaluated using the critical head versus porosity data from a number of laboratory studies conducted in the Netherlands. These models were found to perform better than did Terzaghi?s model...|$|R

50|$|Gasoline-powered AC electrofishing units {{consisting}} of two hand-held electrodes {{can be used for}} fish capture. The units typically have one of the two electrodes fitted with a 4-mm mesh/nylon net to enable the operator to capture fish, which is usually done in an upstream manner. Sites sampled should be divided into 100 m sections that have block nets placed at the upper and lower ends of the site to restrict immigration and emigration. A stationary seine (4.6 m wide and 1.2 m tall) can be used in conjunction with the electroshocking technique when kept downstream of the individual(s) shocking. A typical sampling crew consists of four people: two seine holders, an electroshocking operator, and a person either kicking into the seine or assisting with the seine in strong flow. When searching for P. sciera, snorkelers, who should never be in the water while electrofishing is underway, begin at the downstream end of the site and slowly <b>proceeded</b> <b>upstream</b> in a random zig-zag direction to observe as much area as possible in expansive shoals, riffles, and runs.|$|R

On August 27 he attempted to board large numbers of his soldiers onto the China Navigation Company steamer Wanhsien, which was anchored at the city of that name, now Wanzhou. The captain of nearby gunboat HMS Cockchafer went aboard and persuaded the Chinese officers involved to disembark with their troops.

Bienville went on to found the settlement of Mobile, Alabama in 1702 as the first capital of French Louisiana. In 1703 French settlers in Mobile established the first organised Mardi Gras celebration tradition in what was to become the United States. The first informal mystic society, or krewe, was formed in Mobile in 1711, the Boeuf Gras Society. By 1720, Biloxi had been made capital of Louisiana.
