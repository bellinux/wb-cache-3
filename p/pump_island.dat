50|$|Beam's Shell Service Station and Office, {{also known}} as C. Grier Beam Truck Museum, is a {{historic}} service station located at 117 N. Mountain St. in Cherryville, Gaston County, North Carolina. It was built about 1930 by the Shell Oil Company, and is a one-story, rectangular Mission/spanish Revival style building. Associated with the service station are the original <b>pump</b> <b>island</b> and gasoline pumps.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{longtime}} owner Pauline Armstrong, who (as Pauline Roberts) {{had purchased}} the properties in 1963 and operated the motel until her demise forty years later, the 5.34-acre [...] "Wagon Wheel Motel Historic District" [...] {{was added to}} the US National Register of Historic Places. The designation includes the original 1936 stone café and gas station buildings (the original café building at that time was a souvenir shop), all three original stone motel buildings, plus one concrete block motel building and the frame mixed-use building added circa-1950. The listing also included two historic signs (the neon [...] "Wagon Wheel Motel" [...] and [...] "office" [...] signage) and a concrete gas <b>pump</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The boys of Juan Direction got {{together}} in 2012 as Island Media Asia, which originally posted tutorial and documentary-style, and travel videos on YouTube. [...] Their style {{is described as}} a vlogumentary, a mix of vlogging and a documentary, where they have sold buko juice, taho, and balut to name a few, as well as showering with a water <b>pump.</b> <b>Island</b> Media Asia served as a platform to propel them into the television market, and while they still continue to do videos online, JD is sort of an extension of what they did previously, so leaping to another medium was not a difficult transition. While IMA features 7 members and with JD having only 5 of those members, the other 2 (Matthew Edwards and Keys Cosido) do have a recurring role, whether they will become permanently part of the cast will become more apparent as the series progresses.|$|E
50|$|The service station, {{built in}} 1938, {{consists}} of two buildings. The main one has a 33 ft girder-supported canopy over gas <b>pump</b> <b>islands.</b> It has a stepped brick parapet above the canopy. As of 2004, it hosted a store area and a leased post office; the latter space was formerly the Kenna Bank & Trust Company and still includes a bank vault with a Mosler Safe Co. safe.|$|R
50|$|As all {{petroleum}} {{extracted from}} California state lands {{is subject to}} a royalty, Greka has paid the state about $143,000 {{for oil and gas}} <b>pumped</b> from Rincon <b>Island</b> {{during the first half of}} 2007.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel {{receives}} flows {{that might}} otherwise reach the river. Instead, the CSO tunnel transports them to the Swan <b>Island</b> <b>Pump</b> Station. Portland's 1930s sewer design combined street and surface runoff with sewage in a common system that was overwhelmed during heavy precipitation. The original system handled overflows by sending excess flow into the river.|$|R

40|$|We studied {{customer}} exposure during refueling {{by collecting}} air samples from customers' breathing zone. The measurements {{were carried out}} during 4 days in summer 1996 at two Finnish self-service gasoline stations with "stage I" vapor recovery systems. The 95 -RON (research octane number) gasoline contained approximately 2. 7 % methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), approximately 8. 5 % tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), approximately 3. 2 % C 6 alkyl methyl ethers (C 6 AMEs), and 0. 75 % benzene. The individual exposure concentrations showed a wide log-normal distribution, with low exposures being the most frequent. In over 90 % of the samples, the concentration of MTBE was higher (range < 0. 02 - 51 mg/m 3) than that of TAME. The MTBE values were well below the short-term (15 min) threshold limits set for occupational exposure (250 - 360 mg/m 3). At station A, the geometric mean concentrations in individual samples were 3. 9 mg/m 3 MTBE and 2. 2 mg/m 3 TAME. The corresponding values at station B were 2. 4 and 1. 7 mg/m 3, respectively. The average refueling (sampling) time was 63 sec at station A and 74 sec at station B. No statistically significant difference was observed in customer exposures between the two service stations. The overall geometric means (n = 167) for an adjusted 1 -min refueling time were 3. 3 mg/m 3 MTBE and 1. 9 mg/m 3 TAME. Each day an integrated breathing zone sample was also collected, corresponding to an arithmetic mean of 20 - 21 refuelings. The overall arithmetic mean concentrations in the integrated samples (n = 8) were 0. 90 mg/m 3 for benzene and 0. 56 mg/m 3 for C 6 AMEs calculated as a group. Mean MTBE concentrations in ambient air (a stationary point {{in the middle of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>island)</b> were 0. 16 mg/m 3 for station A and 0. 07 mg/m 3 for station B. The mean ambient concentrations of TAME, C 6 AMEs, and benzene were 0. 031 mg/m 3, approximately 0. 005 mg/m 3, and approximately 0. 01 mg/m 3, respectively, at both stations. The mean wind speed was 1. 4 m/sec and mean air temperature was 21 degreesC. Of the gasoline refueled during the study, 75 % was 95 grade and 25 % was 98 / 99 grade, with an oxygenate (MTBE) content of 12. 2 %...|$|E

50|$|January 2008: Ground {{was broken}} for the Consolidated Rental Car Service Facility located on 22 acre {{east of the}} airport. This {{facility}} will have offices for five rental car companies and rental car service facilities with hydraulic lifts, automated car washes, gas <b>pumps</b> and vacuum <b>islands</b> and a consolidated fuel farm for aviation and unleaded gasoline. A cargo facility and new offices for airport maintenance will be built {{to the east of}} the terminal.|$|R
50|$|The East Side tunnel was {{the largest}} sewer {{construction}} project ever undertaken by the City of Portland. A contractor, Kiewit-Bilfinger Berger (KBB), used a tunnel boring machine that was 300 ft long and had a cutting head that was 25 ft in diameter. In addition to the tunnel and the pipe, the project involved building seven access shafts, connecting pipelines, and the Portsmouth Forcemain, which carries sewage from the Swan <b>Island</b> <b>Pump</b> Station to the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant.|$|R
50|$|The dredged {{material}} was transported by barge and hydraulically <b>pumped</b> to the <b>island</b> site {{to make the}} dikes. Tests were performed by the Corps of Engineers {{to determine how to}} maintain the island and not allow it to dissipate into the bay. A triangular shape was designed and floating tire breakwaters were used to protect the island from erosion due to wave action. Marsh plants were used to develop an established root system to assist with long term integrity of the island. This was a state-of-the-art technique which has been widely studied, found to be effective and is now used nationwide.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 July 2011, {{during the}} attack on the island of Utøya, he saved lives by departing the pier at Utvika (when he heard shots being fired at Utøya) with his motor boat (for 6 people, model [...] "Pioner 15"), and {{throwing}} life vests to fleeing swimmers while heading for Utøya, and picking up refugees of the massacre. (He came within 20-30 meters of the shore of the island, after having seen the killer {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>island's</b> <b>pump</b> house.) He loaded up his boat 5 times, before police requested him to stop what he was doing. By then he had pulled 20-25 people from the water.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{different}} types of fuel have specially sized of nozzles to prevent accidentally filling a tank with an incompatible fuel. The nozzle on diesel pumps {{is supposed to be}} larger so that it cannot fit into the filler pipe on a vehicle tank designed for gasoline. However, the larger diameter diesel nozzles are not an actual requirement, and many diesel <b>pumps</b> at auto <b>islands</b> have been fitted with standard gasoline nozzles. Also, the nozzle for leaded gasoline is wider than for unleaded, and the fill pipe on vehicles designed for unleaded-only was made narrower to prevent [...] "mis-fueling". Some diesel fuel tanks are designed to prevent wrong type of nozzle to be used.|$|R
50|$|The Corner Store and Office, {{also known}} as the Frogmore Emporium, Macdonald, Wilkins, and Company Store and Mark D. Batchelder Office, is a {{historic}} general store, residence and, eventually, office building located on Saint Helena Island near Frogmore, Beaufort County, South Carolina. Primarily built as a house, it was built about 1877, and is a two-story, wood frame building with a gable roof. It features a two-story wraparound porch. The adjacent one-story house was built about 1905. The store sold provisions to the islanders, most of whom were African American, and became one of the major centers of commercial and social activity on St. Helena. The home and businesses in the building were owned by Cameron Thomas and his relatives for most of the 20th century. The family lived in the back and upstairs portion of the house, while the front included a general store and liquor store, with the small house added on used as a residence for relatives. The store also had the only gas <b>pump</b> on the <b>island</b> for many years.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Fraser {{started to}} play the {{clarinet}} {{at the age of}} 12. Around this time he met Ronald [...] "Nambo" [...] Robinson and Junior [...] "Chico" [...] Chinn at a youthclub in Jones Town and the three boys would eventually form a brass section. Fraser took up saxophone at the age of 15. The trio became the foremost horn section in Jamaica in the 1980s. In 1977 he joined Lloyd Parks' We The People Band, backing Dennis Brown on several of his recordings for Joe Gibbs. Fraser's first album, 1978's Black Horn Man, was produced by Gibbs. This was followed in 1979 by Pure Horns and Double Dynamite, and in 1980 by Revolutionary Sounds for producer Donovan Germain. Fraser provided horns for Sly & Robbie in the 1980s, both on record and on tour. Fraser appeared at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash, performing an instrumental version of the recently deceased Bob Marley's [...] "Redemption Song", which led to the 1984 album <b>Pumping</b> Air on <b>Island</b> Records' Mango label. Fraser went on to record two albums of Marley covers, Dean Plays Bob and Dean Plays Bob volume II.|$|R
40|$|Island {{biogeography}} {{has greatly}} contributed {{to our understanding}} of the processes determining species' distributions. Previous research has focused on the effects of island geography (i. e., island area, elevation, and isolation) and current climate as drivers of island species richness and endemism. Here, we evaluate the potential additional effects of historical climate on breeding land bird richness and endemism in Wallacea and the West Indies. Furthermore, on the basis of species distributions, we identify island biogeographical network roles and examine their association with geography, current and historical climate, and bird richness/endemism. We found that island geography, especially island area but also isolation and elevation, largely explained the variation in island species richness and endemism. Current and historical climate only added marginally {{to our understanding of}} the distribution of species on islands, and this was idiosyncratic to each archipelago. In the West Indies, endemic richness was slightly reduced on islands with historically unstable climates; weak support for the opposite was found in Wallacea. In both archipelagos, large islands with many endemics and situated far from other large islands had high importance for the linkage within modules, indicating that these islands potentially act as speciation <b>pumps</b> and source <b>islands</b> for surrounding smaller islands within the module and, thus, define the biogeographical modules. Large islands situated far from the mainland and/or with a high number of nonendemics acted as links between modules. Additionally, in Wallacea, but not in the West Indies, climatically unstable islands tended to interlink biogeographical modules. The weak and idiosyncratic effect of historical climate on island richness, endemism, and network roles indicates that historical climate had little effects on extinction-immigration dynamics. This is in contrast to the strong effect of historical climate observed on the mainland, possibly because surrounding oceans buffer against strong climate oscillations and because geography is a strong determinant of island richness, endemism and network roles. We evaluate the potential additional effects of historical climate on native breeding land bird species richness, endemism and island network roles in Wallacea and the West Indies. We find that island geography, especially island area but also isolation and elevation, largely explained the variation in island species richness and endemism, and that island network roles are tightly linked to geography and endemism.
