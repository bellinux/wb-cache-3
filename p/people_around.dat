5|$|Balzac {{concerned}} himself overwhelmingly {{with the}} darker essence {{of human nature}} and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies.

5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael.

5|$|Four Native American {{cultures}} {{are known to}} have lived in the area during the last 10,000years. The first known group, the Nevares Spring People, were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000years ago (7000BC) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000years ago (3000BC) the Mesquite Flat People displaced the Nevares Spring <b>People.</b> <b>Around</b> 2,000years ago the Saratoga Spring People moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
