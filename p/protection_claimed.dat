"Limitation {{proceedings}} {{would enable}} patentees to narrow down the protection conferred by a patent post-grant {{by means of}} a simple, quick and inexpensive administrative procedure. For example, {{it may be necessary to}} limit a granted patent if, because of prior art which was not known during the examination proceedings or prior national rights not taken into account in these proceedings, the extent of the protection conferred is too great. Using the limitation procedure, patent proprietors may themselves reduce the extent of the <b>protection</b> <b>claimed</b> in a manner which is binding, and thus generally preclude disputes over the validity of a patent. Postgrant limitation is also in the public interest, because it limits the <b>protection</b> <b>claimed</b> by the patentee with effect for the general public.

40|$|Innovating firms {{choose to}} patent their {{innovations}} when patenting allows {{the appropriation of}} more rents than do other forms of intellectual property protection (e. g., trade secrecy). The level of innovation rents that can be captured by the patent is mainly determined by the breadth of patent protection. Thus, once the decision to patent has been made, the innovator needs to make another important decision, namely, how broad of a patent protection to claim. While the innovator's decision to patent the innovation or {{to keep it a}} secret has been examined in the literature (Horstmann et al. 1985, Waterson 1990), there is no formal framework of analysis of the innovator's patent breadth choice. Instead, the traditional assumption in the economic literature is that the innovator has an incentive to claim 'as much as possible'. The effectiveness of this strategy in maximizing the rents that can be appropriated by the patentee is questionable, however. A patent that is too broad increases the likelihood of both infringement and patent validity challenges by competitors and/or third parties (Merges and Nelson 1990). Consequently, broad patent protection may reduce the effective patent life and thus the innovation rents that can be captured with the patent, since patents are often revoked during infringement trials and patent validity challenges (Merges and Nelson 1990, Barton 2000). This concern is especially critical given the increase in patent litigation during the last decade, particularly in the field of biotechnology, and {{the increase in the number}} of patents that are invalidated after being challenged. While the broadest possible patent may not be optimal, neither is a very narrow patent, since narrow patents make it easier for rivals to enter the patentee's market and may not allow the patentee to capture enough returns to cover her R&D costs. The purpose of this paper is to theoretically examine the patenting behavior of innovators that have generated patentable process innovations and have decided to seek patent protection. In specific, the paper determines the privately optimal patent breadth for process innovations when the innovator faces the probability of a direct patent validity challenge by a third party and potential entry in her market by competitors that provide technologically equivalent processes. The paper also examines the affect of patent breadth on the competitors' incentive to generate a competing process (i. e., on the competitors' R&D spending), on the competitors' probability of success in the R&D process (i. e., the patentee's ability to deter entry) and on the timing that success is realized by competitors (i. e., the pace of future innovations). The innovating firm's patent breadth decision is determined in a sequential game between an incumbent innovator who decides on the breadth of patent <b>protection</b> <b>claimed</b> and potential entrants who, having observed whether the patent was challenged or not, decide on whether to generate competing processes and how much to spend on R&D. The game is solved by backwards induction. Results show that the optimal patent breadth depends on the affect of new entry on the incumbent's profits, the incumbent's legal costs incurred when the patent is challenged and on whether the incumbent operates under a short term or a long term horizon. A key result of the paper is that, even when a patent breadth that deters entry exists, it might not be profit maximizing for the incumbent to choose this patent breadth to deter entry. As well, claiming the maximum breadth of patent protection is never an optimal strategy for the incumbent patentee in this model. The analysis shows that the nature of the instantaneous probability of success is a critical factor in determining the optimal patent breadth as well as the affect of patent breadth on the rivals' R&D spending, the probability of success by rivals and the timing that success occurs.

40|$|Imagine {{that you}} work for the Department of Transportation for the state. You are fifty-five years old and {{have been working for}} the Department for over twenty years. One day, you walk into work and your {{supervisor}} says, 2 Ì 2 You 2 Ì 7 re fired: you are too old. 2 Ì 2 Undoubtedly, your employer violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). As mandated by the ADEA, you file a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Commission investigates and grants you the authority to file a civil suit in federal court. In court, the judge informs you that the ADEA is not applicable against the states. You petition the court to amend your complaint, you now wish to assert a Â§ 1983 claim against your supervisor in his official capacity for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court denies your claim based on circuit precedent: the ADEA is the exclusive remedy for age discrimination in employment. Until 2012, every circuit to consider the issue concluded that the ADEA precludes a Â§ 1983 equal protection remedy. In 1989, in Zombro v. Baltimore City Police Department, the Fourth Circuit held that the ADEA precludes constitution-based Â§ 1983 age-discrimination claims. Incorrectly, the court applied a preclusion analysis reserved for statute-based Â§ 1983 claims. Since that time, most circuits have relied on the Fourth Circuit 2 Ì 7 s problematic analysis and holding, those decisions have effectively eliminated a federal remedy for state employees suffering from age discrimination in employment. The dependence on Zombro suggests that courts do not understand the applicable preclusion analysis. In 2012, the Seventh Circuit in Levin v. Madigan became the first circuit to hold that the ADEA does not preclude Â§ 1983 equal <b>protection</b> <b>claims.</b> Although the Seventh Circuit applied an improper analysis, it is the only circuit to engage in a comparative evaluation of the rights offered under the ADEA to the rights offered under Â§ 1983 equal <b>protection</b> <b>claims.</b> The Seventh Circuit 2 Ì 7 s decision diminishes the precedential value of Zombro and its progeny. Based on Supreme Court precedent, this Comment demonstrates that no circuit court has applied the proper preclusion analysis to the ADEA 2 Ì 7 s preclusion of Â§ 1983 equal <b>protection</b> <b>claims.</b> As such, it proposes the proper standard for determining the preclusion of constitution-based Â§ 1983 claims. Finally, this Comment applies its proposed test to the ADEA and Â§ 1983. By expanding on the Seventh Circuit 2 Ì 7 s comparative evaluation, this Comment concludes that the ADEA does not preclude Â§ 1983 equal <b>protection</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R
