25|$|On 14 September 1983, {{a pair of}} Turkish Air Force F-100F Super Sabre {{fighter jets}} of 182 Filo “Atmaca” {{penetrated}} Iraqi airspace. A Mirage F-1EQ of the Iraqi Air Force intercepted the flight and fired a Super 530F-1 missile at them. One of the Turkish fighter jets (s/n 56-3903) was shot down and crashed in Zakho valley near the Turkish-Iraqi border. The plane's pilots reportedly survived the crash and were returned to Turkey. The incident was not made public by either side, although some details surfaced in later years. The incident was revealed in 2012 by Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz, {{in response to a}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>question</b> by Republican People’s Party (CHP) MP Metin Lütfi Baydar {{in the aftermath of the}} downing of a Turkish F-4 Phantom II in Syria, in 2012.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> is {{the most}} popular and visible tool {{in the hands of the}} Opposition as a means to make {{government}} accountable. Their main purpose is to seek information or press for action. Contemporary parliamentary literature from the UK, Canada, and Australia, however, suggests that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> have lost their effectiveness. The literature points out that Question Time in parliaments has become a battle ground between Ruling and Opposition parties in their fight to gain maximum political advantage. In this context, the effectiveness of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> in the Indian state legislatures has not been investigated. The aim of this study, therefore, is to analyse the use, purpose and effectiveness of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> in the State Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh (India) to explore differences, if any, between Ruling and Opposition parties.

25|$|The planned date of {{commissioning}} {{has been}} postponed several times. Thus, in July 1997, the commissioning {{of the new}} line was still expected in 2004. In December 2006, the Federal Government and Deutsche Bahn AG announced that the new line would be completed in 2016. In May 2006, the opening year was given as 2020 in {{a response to a}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>question</b> from the Green Party, although the Federal Minister of Transport Wolfgang Tiefensee indicated {{at the opening of the}} Nürnberg-Ingolstadt high-speed line, that the line would be opened in 2016/2017. At the end of 2007 the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that the line would not be completed until 2041. Later, it became known that 2041 had been used in a meeting of the board of directors to refer to the completion date of the upgraded line between Fürth and Ebensfeld. The new line is still planned to be completed by 2017 at the latest. Commissioning is now scheduled for the timetable change on 8December 2017. According to information from mid-2015, this date is tight, but it can be kept. €29million were provided for the new line from the KonjunkturpaketI ("stimulus package I"). In December 2006, a parliamentary support group was founded called Vollendung des Verkehrsprojektes Deutsche Einheit Nr.8 ("Completion of German Unity transport project No. 8"), comprising over twenty Bundestag deputies. The parliamentarians were keen to accelerate the completion of the line. In April 2007, Transport Minister Tiefensee confirmed with the support group that the line would be completied by 2016, but in May 2008 the parliamentarians announced 2017 as the completion date in a press release.|$|E

On 21 July 1964, Douglas-Home replied to a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>question</b> by saying [...] "Both the present High Commissioner and his predecessor have assured us {{that they were not}} aware that the person in question (Tony Boyle) was involved in any way". The following day (22 July 1964), Douglas-Home sent a memorandum to the Foreign Secretary Rab Butler, in which he [...] "decreed that the United Kingdom should 'make life intolerable' for Nasser, 'with money and arms', and that this 'should be deniable if possible'." [...] The result was that a secret Joint Action Committee was created to handle British policy on Yemen. The British support continued until 1965, when the Kingdom decided to abandon its Aden Colony.|$|E

A more detailed analysis shows that in Spain, the newspaper that {{is close to the}} government is ignored by the opposition as a source for <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions,</b> while this newspaper also ignores the attention the opposition pays to negative economic developments in its <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions.</b> In the Netherlands, we do not find any differences across newspapers.

This paper presents an initial investigation into the use of automated text classiﬁcation techniques to categorise <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> from 1922 up to 2008 as national or local. The approach uses a bag of words representation, standard feature reduction methods and an SVM classiﬁer.

It is not therefore our policy to supply arms to the Royalists in the Yemen, and the Yemen Government have not requested these or other forms of aid." [...] To a further question (by George Wigg), Douglas-Home said that [...] "at no time in the last eighteen months have British arms been supplied to the Imam's Government". Hart-Davis notes that this [...] "may have been strictly true; but ... a great many weapons of non-British provenance had been spirited into the Yemen through Jim Johnson's machinations." ...|$|E

There are two types of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions,</b> ‘questions without notice’ and ‘questions on notice’. Questions without notice are asked and answered orally during ‘Question Time’. Questions on notice are asked in writing and the relevant minister provides the answer in writing. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> provide a mechanism to seek the accountability of the executive on the floor of the House and barely ‘any aspect of the executive department’s powers and activities can be shielded from questions’ (Crick 1964 : 237).

40|$|This article {{examines}} the behavior of Greek political parties before, as well as during, the recent austerity period. Drawing on coalition oversight and blame avoidance literature, it argues that the unpopularity of austerity governments leads to extreme levels of dissent within the coalition. I operationalize this ‘intra-coalition opposition’ behavior using <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions,</b> a legislative institution {{that has not been}} studied in the context of coalition politics. The analysis demonstrates that junior members in unpopular austerity governments increase their use of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> to a degree that matches or even exceeds the formal opposition. However, intra-coalition dissent is conditional on the type of unpopular government policies, and on the ideology of coalition members. Specifically, using a new method of text analysis, I show that while the socialist Panhellenic Socialist Movement uses its <b>parliamentary</b> <b>questions</b> to avoid or minimize the blame associated with austerity policies, the conservative New Democracy does not, because left-leaning parties are electorally vulnerable to austerity measures. The results have implications for studying dissent in coalition politics in general, and the politics of austerity in particular...|$|R
