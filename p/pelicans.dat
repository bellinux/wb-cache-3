5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 <b>pelicans</b> were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 <b>pelicans,</b> including 7500 American white <b>pelicans,</b> perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown <b>pelicans</b> and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|Adult <b>pelicans</b> rely on visual {{displays}} and behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult <b>pelicans</b> grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|After the 2012–13 season, the Hornets renamed {{themselves}} the <b>Pelicans.</b> Davis donated $65,000 toward {{the construction of}} a basketball court at his alma mater, Perspectives.

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, <b>pelicans</b> are highly {{susceptible}} to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown <b>pelicans</b> had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown <b>pelicans</b> had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World <b>pelicans</b> formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown <b>pelicans,</b> and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that <b>pelicans</b> evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E
5|$|Great white <b>pelicans</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} swallowing city pigeons in St. James's Park in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive <b>pelicans</b> that live in a semi-urban environment and are in constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white <b>pelicans.</b> Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including Cape gannet chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp gulls, greater crested terns and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly {{willing to take a}} wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls. Brown <b>pelicans</b> have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian <b>pelicans</b> in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels and grey gulls. Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown and Peruvian <b>pelicans.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pelican</b> Pete {{is located}} in {{downtown}} <b>Pelican</b> Rapids, {{at the base of}} the <b>Pelican</b> Rapids (or Mill Ponds) dam. It can be seen from the Highway 59 bridge, near the <b>Pelican</b> Rapids Chamber of Commerce. The city of <b>Pelican</b> Rapids is located on the <b>Pelican</b> River, in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, and was named for the rapids which existed before the creation of the Mill Ponds dam.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pelican</b> Rapids was platted in 1872, {{and named}} for the rapids on the <b>Pelican</b> River. A post office has been in {{operation}} at <b>Pelican</b> Rapids since 1872. <b>Pelican</b> Rapids was incorporated in 1882.|$|R

5|$|In 1989, Ellis {{served as}} player/coach for the St. Petersburg <b>Pelicans</b> of the Senior Professional Baseball Association and went 0–2 with a 1.76 ERA and seven saves {{as a part}} of the team's bullpen. In 1990, he allowed no earned runs and {{recorded}} two saves for the <b>Pelicans</b> before the league folded. He continued to play in the Los Angeles Veterans League.|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>pelicans</b> {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica. They {{primarily}} inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45° South (Australian <b>pelicans</b> in Tasmania) and 60° North (American white <b>pelicans</b> in western Canada). Birds of inland and coastal waters, they are absent from polar regions, the deep ocean, oceanic islands (except the Galapagos), and inland South America, {{as well as}} from the eastern coast of South America from the mouth of the Amazon River southwards. Subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as New Zealand's South Island, although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from Australia (much as is the case today).|$|E

50|$|The brown <b>pelican</b> {{is part of}} the clade that {{includes}} the Peruvian <b>pelican</b> (P. thagus) and the American white <b>pelican</b> (P. erythrorhynchos). The Peruvian <b>pelican,</b> previously treated as a subspecies of the brown <b>pelican,</b> is now considered a separate species. This is {{on the basis of its}} much greater size (approximately double the weight of the brown <b>pelican),</b> differences in bill colors and plumage, and a lack of hybridization between the forms despite a sizable area of range overlap.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pelican</b> Lake is a lake {{located about}} seven {{miles north of}} <b>Pelican</b> Rapids, in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, United States. <b>Pelican</b> Lake is now a highly {{developed}} lake with its major uses being predominantly recreation, but its fishing is also excellent. The lake was recently discovered to be infested with zebra mussels, which threatens not only <b>Pelican</b> Lake, but all lakes connected by the <b>Pelican</b> River.|$|R
50|$|The brown <b>pelican</b> {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} from the American white <b>pelican,</b> by its non-white plumage, smaller size, and habit of diving for fish from the air, as opposed to co-operative fishing from the surface. Along with the Peruvian <b>pelican,</b> {{it is the only}} true marine <b>pelican</b> species.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pelicans</b> {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white <b>pelicans</b> were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white <b>pelicans</b> in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pelicans</b> have {{featured}} {{extensively in}} heraldry, generally using the Christian {{symbolism of the}} pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent. Heraldic images featuring a pelican vulning refers to a pelican injuring herself, while a pelican in her piety refers to a female <b>pelicans</b> feeding her young with her own blood.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pelicans</b> have mainly light-coloured plumage, the {{exceptions}} being the brown and Peruvian <b>pelicans.</b> The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. The throat pouch of the Californian subspecies {{of the brown}} pelican turns bright red, and fades to yellow after the eggs are laid, while the throat pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue. The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs. The plumage of immature <b>pelicans</b> is darker than that of adults. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days, then developing a covering of white or grey down.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pelican</b> Lake is an unincorporated {{community}} {{located in}} Oneida County, Wisconsin, United States. <b>Pelican</b> Lake {{is located on}} the eastern shore of <b>Pelican</b> Lake and is served by U.S. Route 45, in the town of Schoepke. <b>Pelican</b> Lake has a post office with ZIP code 54463.|$|R

5|$|The eight living pelican {{species were}} {{traditionally}} {{divided into two}} groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage (Australian, Dalmatian, great white, and American white <b>pelicans),</b> and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees (pink-backed, spot-billed and brown <b>pelicans),</b> or on sea rocks (Peruvian pelican). The largely marine brown and Peruvian <b>pelicans,</b> formerly considered conspecific, are sometimes separated from the others by placement in the subgenus Leptopelicanus but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either.|$|E
5|$|Of the 69 animals freed {{after being}} cleaned and nursed back to health, 10 were adult Brown <b>pelicans</b> that were {{released}} at Goleta Beach after spending {{three weeks in}} San Pedro {{with a team of}} scientists from the Oiled Wildlife Care Network that is administered by the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. In September 2015, SeaWorld San Diego released the last three sea lions affected by the oil spill at Border Field State Park. Scientists will monitor the movements of some of the sea lions and at least five of the <b>pelicans</b> with satellite transmitters.|$|E
