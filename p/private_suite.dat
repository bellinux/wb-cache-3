5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner. It {{takes the form of}} a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge. The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a <b>private</b> <b>suite.</b> The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.|$|E

25|$|Much {{controversy}} surrounded Selig and {{his involvement}} in Bonds' all-time home run record chase.

Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the San Diego Padres, sitting in Padres owner John Moores' <b>private</b> <b>suite.</b> When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep {{his hands in his pockets}} and have a look of disdain on his face.
