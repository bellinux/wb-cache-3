Satisfying regulatory requirements will obviously take longer if the business lacks information or is unable to follow up promptly.

25|$|For example, if E is a vector bundle over X, {{then there}} is a bundle E* over X, called the dual bundle, whose fiber at x ∈ X is the dual vector space (Ex)*. Formally E* can be defined as the set of pairs (x, φ), where x ∈ X and φ ∈ (E'x)*. The dual bundle is locally trivial because the dual space of the inverse of a local trivialization of E is a local trivialization of E*: the key <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the {{operation}} of taking the dual vector space is functorial.|$|E
25|$|Generalizing from static {{electricity}} to electromagnetism, {{we have a}} second potential, the magnetic vector potential A, which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto V, one can add a function that takes on different values {{at different points in}} space and time. If A is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same E and B fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials V and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement {{of the nature of the}} gauge transformation. The relevant <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore Maxwell's equations are still satisfied.|$|E

2500|$|Scale and pitch: The {{standard}} pitch has varied widely over history, {{and this}} has affected how flutes are made. Although the standard concert pitch today is A4=440Hz, many manufacturers optimize the tone hole size/spacings for a higher pitch options such as A4=442Hz or A4=444Hz. (As noted above, adjustments to the pitch of one note, usually the A4 fingering, {{can be made by}} moving the headjoint {{in and out of the}} headjoint tenon, but the <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the mechanical relationship of A4 to all other pitches is set when the tone holes are cut. However, small deviations from the objective 'mechanical' pitch (which is related to acoustic impedance of a given fingering) can be made on the fly by embouchure adjustments.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lauda {{aircraft}} was traveling {{at a high}} speed when the thrust reversers deployed, causing the pilots to lose control of the aircraft. James R.

A thrust reverser deploying in flight {{might not have been}} survivable, anyway. But a thorough test would have informed the FAA and Boeing that thrust reversers deploying in midair was such a dangerous occurrence that Boeing needed to install a positive lock that would prevent such an event." [...] As a result of their findings during the investigation process of Lauda Flight 004, additional safety features such as mechanical positive locks were mandated to prevent thrust reverser deployment in flight.|$|E

An OSCE spokesman said that [...] "the key <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that it's not the OSCE's role to pass judgment, or point the finger. It's to listen to all sides, and to recommend and seek ways to avoid similar incidents and tensions in the future.

Given this daunting paradigm, the genuine enthusiasm for America shown by our 21 Muslim guests was a heartening sign. They seemed impressed with the depth of our national commitment to human freedom and individual opportunity, and the stability of our institutions, both governmental and private. Several declared that exposure to America had reinforced their determination to work for social change in their own countries. Two Pakistani women, both law students, said they planned to devote their lives to fighting for broader women's rights at home. One young man said it was his ambition to become his country's prime minister.|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{the belief}} we extend to such {{narratives}} is entirely conditioned by {{our knowledge of}} the personal character of the performers.

As a matter of fact, it was a priory, and shared the fate of most priories--that is, the Tudor gentleman with the plumes simply stole it by brute force and turned it into his own private house; he did worse things, as you shall hear. But the <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that this is how the trick works, and the trick works in the same way in {{the other part of the}} tale. The name of this district is printed Holinwall in all the best maps produced by the scholars; and they allude lightly, not without a smile, to the fact that it was pronounced Holiwell by the most ignorant and old-fashioned of the poor. But it is spelled wrong and pronounced right." ...|$|E

Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought! No one--not even L'Etoile--disputes the murder committed on the body found. The marks of violence are too obvious. It is our reasoner's object merely to show that this body is not Marie's. He wishes to prove that Marie is not assassinated--not that the corpse was not. Yet his observation proves only the latter <b>point.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in, would not have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown in by murderers. This is all which is proved, if any thing is. The question of identity is not even approached, and L'Etoile has been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before. 'We are perfectly convinced,' it says, 'that the body found {{was that of a}} murdered female.' ...|$|E
