40|$|<b>Operational</b> <b>protocols</b> are a {{valuable}} means for quality control. However, developing <b>operational</b> <b>protocols</b> {{is a highly}} complex and costly task. We present an integrated approach involving both intelligent data analysis and knowledge acquisition from experts that supports the development of <b>operational</b> <b>protocols.</b> The aim is to ensure high quality standards for the protocol through empirical validation during the development, as well as lower development cost {{through the use of}} machine learning and statistical techniques. We demonstrate our approach of integrating expert knowledge with data driven techniques based on our effort to develop an <b>operational</b> <b>protocol</b> for the hemodynamic system. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{for the preservation}} of audio documents, the <b>operational</b> <b>protocol</b> that acts as the methodology, and an original open source software system that supports and automatizes several tasks along the process. The methodology is presented {{in the light of the}} ethical debate that has been challenging the international archival community for the last thirty years. The <b>operational</b> <b>protocol</b> reflects the methodological principles adopted by the authors, and its effectiveness is based on the results obtained in recent research projects involving some of the finest audio archives in Europe. Some recommendations are given for the rerecording process, aimed at minimizing the information loss and at quantifying the unintentional alterations introduced by the technical equipment. Finally, the paper introduces an original software system that guides and supports the preservation staff along the process, reducing the processing timing, automatizing tasks, minimizing errors, and using information hiding strategies to ease the cognitive load. Currently the software system is in use in several international archives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In highly {{regulated}} environments, where a set {{of norms}} defines accepted behaviour, protocols provide a way to reduce complexity by giving direct, step by step guidelines for behaviour, {{as long as the}} protocols comply with the norms. In this work we propose a formal framework to design a protocol from a normative specification. In {{order to be able to}} connect (descriptive) norms with (<b>operational)</b> <b>protocols,</b> an intermediate level is created by the use of landmarks. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Medicine {{administration}} {{is a major}} role played by registered nurses. Medicines are prescribed by the physician and dispensed by the pharmacist but responsibility for meticulous administration rests with the registered nurse. It becomes even more important when drugs are to be administered to children. Drug administration via Intramuscular (IM), Intradermal (ID) and Subcutaneous route is a complex process. Errors are associated with medicine administration. Aim: The objective {{of this study was}} to develop Standard <b>Operational</b> <b>Protocol</b> (SOP) for IM, ID and Subcutaneous drug administration and checklist to assess the implementation of the developed SOP. Materials and Methods: A methodological research design adapted to carry out the present study to develop standard <b>operational</b> <b>protocol</b> for IM, ID and subcutaneous drug administration for children, admitted in Advanced Paediatric Centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. The study included 58 bedside nurses and 90 observations of medicine administration procedure. Results: The Content Validity Index (CVI) was prepared to assess the validity of content (items) of SOPs and checklists. Over all Cronbach's-alpha values was calculated to assess the internal consistency of Items in SOPs and checklists. CVI of SOP and checklists were 98. 51...|$|R
