5000|$|A pallet {{inverter}} or <b>pile</b> <b>turner</b> is {{a machine}} {{that is used to}} turn over pallets whilst still loaded with products. The reasons for needing to turn over a pallet are varied, but one main reason is the need to replace a broken or inappropriate pallet without unstacking the whole load. Sometimes a manufacturer simply needs to turn their products to stop their contents settling. In some industries, it is necessary to transfer goods from one type of pallet to another [...] - [...] for example, when plastic pallets are used for on-site storage and wooden pallets are used for shipping. Pallet inverters can be built into production lines or be used as a stand-alone product. The term pallet inverter is also used to cover machines that turn the palletised load through 90 degrees only.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last days}} of the {{campaign}} saw one Liberal blunder <b>piled</b> on another. <b>Turner</b> continued to speak of [...] "make work programs" [...] and made other gaffes that caused voters to see him as a relic from the past. Turner rehired much of Trudeau's staff during the final weeks in an attempt to turn the tide, but this did nothing to reverse the Liberals' sliding poll numbers. Trudeau himself did not campaign for Turner, instead only showing up to support Liberal candidates.|$|R
2500|$|The {{last days}} of the {{campaign}} saw one Liberal blunder <b>piled</b> upon another. <b>Turner</b> continued to make gaffes that caused voters to see him as incompetent and a relic from the past. [...] On September 4, the Liberals were swept from power in a Tory landslide. The Liberals were cut down to 40 seats, the fewest in the party's history until 2011, against 211 for the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals had fallen to 17 seats in Quebec, all but four in and around Montreal. [...] Eleven members of Turner's cabinet were defeated. At the time, it was the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party in the federal parliament.|$|R
