I submit the propriety of applying the income of a part, if not of the whole, of this fund to the education in the Japanese language of a number of young men to be under obligations to serve the Government for a specified time as interpreters at the legation and the consulates in Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the same time be educated in our own vernacular, and mutual benefits would result to both Governments. The importance of having our own citizens, competent and familiar with the language of Japan, to act as interpreters and in other capacities connected with the legation and the consulates in that country can not readily be overestimated.|$|E

During this time, he lived at the Seleucid court, where he acted as military advisor to Antiochus III the Great in his war against Rome.

50|$|In <b>the</b> margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conference <b>of</b> Peking, Joostens {{was also}} active in other cases. In {{cooperation}} with Henri Ketels, the consul in Tientsin, Joostens succeeded {{to claim a}} Belgian concession in Tientsin. Despite <b>the</b> failed development <b>of</b> this concession {{because of a lack}} of interest from Belgian investors, it still is very remarkable that Joostens succeeded to obtain this percel despite <b>the</b> criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other powers. Besides from this territorial achievement, Joostens also kept playing his role in <b>the</b> cases <b>of</b> finances and more specifically <b>the</b> <b>indemnities.</b> Even after <b>the</b> signature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boxer Protocol, <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>indemnities</b> was still an unsolved problem and in this context Joostens tried to convince his government not to found a Belgian bank. In Joostens' opinion <b>the</b> Chinese <b>indemnities</b> for Belgium could also be payed to a foreign bank and subsequently be transferred to an already existing Belgian bank in Europe. Nevertheless, the Belgian government did found a Sino-Belgian Bank. A third important aspect of Joostens' diplomacy in China aimed at protecting the Belgian missionaries. Although the Belgian missionaries officially were French citizens as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Protectorate in China, Joostens repeatedly defended <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missionaries <b>of</b> Belgian origin. He checked reports of attacks on Belgian manned missions and urged the Chinese government to repel <b>the</b> attacks <b>of</b> what used to be Boxer rebels. Finally Joostens also acted as a spokesman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian imperial lobby. Both in China and Belgium, he promoted several times the Belgian project. On several occasions Joostens highlighted for example <b>the</b> prospects <b>of</b> an investment in China and tried to convince investors and ordinary people to come to China and work in Belgian companies or invest in them. Despite <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> Joostens and other Belgian officials the Belgian presence would never be able to match <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-war era. The Boxer Rebellion had showed that an investment in China could be risky and from 1901 onwards <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> Belgian investors further diminished.|$|R

6000|$|I {{return to}} another of Mr. Douglas's excuses for <b>the</b> {{expenditures}} <b>of</b> 1838, at <b>the</b> same time announcing the pleasing intelligence {{that this is}} the last one. He says that ten millions of that year's expenditure was a contingent appropriation, to prosecute an anticipated war with Great Britain on the Maine boundary question. Few words will settle this. First, that the ten millions appropriated was not made till 1839, and consequently could not have been expended in 1838; second, although it was appropriated, it has never been expended at all. Those who heard Mr. Douglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me. [...] "Now he's got me," [...] thought I. But when {{he went on to say}} that five millions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expenditure <b>of</b> 1838 were <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>indemnities,</b> which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had been for the post-office, which I knew to be untrue; that ten millions had been for the Maine boundary war, which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to go unexposed,--I readily consented that, on <b>the</b> score both <b>of</b> veracity and sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were <b>the</b> more deserving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's contempt.|$|R

The aim is to find similarities and dissimilarities between life insurance and family takaful vis-à-vis the issues based on Maqasid al-Shariah. It is found that both the traditional law and the Shariah assert that creditors have priority over the life policy and family takaful benefits even if the beneficiaries will get nothing from it. Again, under both systems, it is submitted that although ‘Indemnity’ and ‘No claim benefits’ are paid but the Shariah does not allow forfeiture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>indemnity</b> because <b>of</b> lack of utmost good faith (uberimae fidei) or discontinuing <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premiums/contributions by the policyholder or participant.
