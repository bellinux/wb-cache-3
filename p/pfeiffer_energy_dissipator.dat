40|$|Movable weirs {{have been}} {{developed}} to address the weaknesses of conventional fixed weirs. However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of movable weirs are designed using the criteria of fixed weirs in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare hydraulic jumps and downstream flow characteristics according to different weir types, and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, <b>energy</b> <b>dissipators</b> were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different installation locations and heights. As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated hydraulic jumps similar to those of fixed weirs, their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall hydraulic jumps. In <b>energy</b> <b>dissipator</b> installation, installation heights were found to be sensitive to energy dissipation. The most effective <b>energy</b> <b>dissipator</b> height was 10 % of the downstream free surface water depth in this experiment.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>dissipators</b> are a {{convenient}} option for earthquake–resistant retrofitting of buildings; when a construction incorporating these systems is shaken {{by a strong}} ground motion, the devices absorb most of the damaging part of the input energy, thus protecting the main structure. Although <b>energy</b> <b>dissipators</b> have repeatedly proven their capacity to reduce the seismic response, {{one of the most}} controversial issues is their seismic efficiency under near–fault inputs. For this reason, this paper presents a numerical study about the seismic performance under near–source excitations of a structure retrofitted with hysteretic and with viscous devices. The considered structure is a symmetric 4 –story steel moment–resisting unbraced frame. This structure was tested at the E–defense laboratory (Japan) under a near–fault ground motion recorded in Takatori during the Kobe earthquake (16 / 01 / 1995); this input caused the collapse of the frame. In the paper the main characteristics of the frames are presented, the design of the <b>energy</b> <b>dissipators</b> is described, and the response of the frame with/without dissipators is shown.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the biomechanics {{of the human}} middle ear, {{that part of the}} auditory system which converts sound pressure waves in air to fluid pressure waves in the cochlea. The middle ear's mechanism is analysed in four papers, three main and one supporting; in the main papers the middle ear is treated as a multi-particle, multi-rigid body ensemble possessing a variable number of degrees of freedom depending upon the case being investigated. It is confirmed, using the standard representation of a single fused incudo-malleal block, that the middle ear's motion is linear, but when this fused block restriction is lifted nonlinearity is present which significantly affects the mechanism's behaviour. In view of the linearity of the chain under the fused block conditions, the explanatory veracity of the conventionally accepted `fixed axis hypothesis' of ossicular motion is examined and found to be wanting as a realistic description of the chain's physical movement. The nonlinear behaviour of the ossicular chain centres around the action of the incudo-malleal joint. This joint is shown to have preferential planes of operation, principally the pitch or longitudinal plane and in general to act as an efficient <b>energy</b> <b>dissipator</b> at high driving pressures and low frequencies.
