500|$|Mayberry has won {{medals at}} IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup {{events and the}} Paralympic Games. [...] He made his Australian {{national}} team debut in 2005 at the European Cup Finals, {{and went on to}} represent Australia the following year at the 2006 Torino Games where he failed to medal in the four men's standing events he competed in. He finished 33rd in the downhill, 21st in the Giant Slalom, 19th in the Slalom and did not finish in the Super G. Mayberry attributed his poor performance at the 2006 Games to his prosthetic legs, which [...] "just didn't feel right during the speed events in Italy." [...] Following those Games, he worked with <b>prosthetist</b> Peter Farrand to develop new legs that would address the problems in Italy. Continuing to ski following the 2006 Games, he earned a gold medal at a World Cup event in 2007 in Slalom, and earned a bronze medal in slalom event at a 2008 World Cup competition.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{is based on}} the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. However, there are {{numerous}} differences, ranging from extra subplots to rearrangements and modifications of elements from the source material. The biggest change is the lead-up to and revelation of the identity of the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", called the [...] "Tamiami Butcher" [...] in the novel. In the novel, Dexter is led to believe that he might be the one committing the murders, due to a series of strange dreams that connect him to the murder. The final clue is a blurry photo, taken from surveillance footage, of a man who resembles Dexter at a crime scene. After the [...] "Tamiami Killer" [...] kidnaps Deborah, Dexter finds and confronts him. It is subsequently revealed that the killer is actually Dexter's nearly identical long-lost brother, Brian, who, like Dexter, witnessed their mother's brutal murder. Dexter is followed by Detective LaGuerta, who is slain by Brian. Debra finds out her brother is a killer and Dexter helps Brian to escape. In the television series, Brian is introduced under the fake name Rudy, a <b>prosthetist</b> who becomes Debra's boyfriend. Dexter hesitantly kills Brian instead of letting him escape, Debra does not discover her brother's secret, and LaGuerta is not present at all in the confrontation. In the novel, Dexter and his brother are nearly identical, whereas the actors playing the two characters are distinct from each other in their looks.|$|E

40|$|Background Most of {{functional}} {{issues associated with}} socket experienced by individuals with lower limb amputation can be overcome by surgical implantation of osseointegrated fixation enabling bone-anchored prosthesis (BAP). Governmental organizations are facing challenges in adjusting procedures to accommodate the emergence of BAP. Aim This study shares the knowledge gained and innovations developed by the Queensland Artificial Limb Service (QALS), an Australian State government organization, while implementing a procedure for fair and equitable provision of care with BAP. Method The three innovations presented here emerged from a 3 -year project of research following typical phases of action research led by QALS’ management team and researchers who consulted key stakeholders (e. g., 18 Queensland-based consumers, 3 <b>prosthetists,</b> 2 multidisciplinary clinical teams). - Innovation 1 : Policy for provision of BAP The study indicated that: - The provision of BAP can be achieved relying on 7 processes involving fixed expenses during the treatment and 5 processes regulating ongoing prosthetic care expenses. - Prosthetic care required 22 hours of labor corresponding to 3, 300 per patient during rehabilitation. <b>Prosthetists</b> spend 64...|$|R
40|$|While over 1. 5 million {{individuals}} {{are living with}} limb loss in the United States (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008), only 10 % of these individuals have a loss that affects an upper limb.  Coincident with the relatively low incidence of upper limb loss, {{is a shortage of}} the community-based prosthetic rehabilitation experts that can help prosthetic users to more fully integrate their devices into their daily routines.  This article describes how expert <b>prosthetists</b> and occupational therapists at Touch Bionics, a manufacturer of advanced upper limb prosthetic devices, employ Voice over the Internet Protocol (VoIP) videoconferencing software telehealth technologies to engage in remote consultation with users of prosthetic devices and/or their local practitioners. The Touch Bionics staff provide follow-up expertise to local <b>prosthetists,</b> occupational therapists, and other health professionals. Contrasted with prior telephone-based consultations, the video-enabled approach provides enhanced capabilities to benefit persons with upper limb loss.  Currently, the opportunities for Touch Bionics occupational therapists to fully engage in patient-based services delivered through telehealth technologies are significantly reduced by their need to obtain and maintain professional licenses in multiple states. </p...|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{students}} of certain biological sciences, paramedics, <b>prosthetists</b> and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.|$|R
