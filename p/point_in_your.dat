500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{speaks of}} a love that never dies. According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life and {{somebody}} comes in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature {{magazine}} {{found the}} [...] "seductive" [...] throbbing {{beat of the}} track [...] "completely at ease with Jared's risqué lyrics". Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life where you're ready {{to let go of}} the past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E
500|$|In a video review, Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone {{described}} it as [...] "extravagant, scintillating", further praising the dance moves. He concluded that the ending was in a classic [...] "it-was-all-a-dream fashion" [...] when the scenes cut back to the beginning. Melinda Newman, writing for HitFix {{described it}} as NSFW, highly stylized and a reclaim of the singer's sexuality. Whitney Phanuef of the same website praised the clip as the best on Beyoncé, further highlighting its [...] "unforgettable song/video combination" [...] accompanied with eroticism and Beyoncé's post-child sexuality. Melissa Locker, writing for Time stated that the singer went [...] "properly XXX" [...] for the [...] "hot" [...] clip and added {{that it would make}} viewers think differently about the word [...] "peaches". Edwin Ortiz of Complex felt that during the various wardrobe changes, each outfit was better than the previous. Ashley Lee from The Hollywood Reporter classified the visual as [...] "ornate" [...] and opined that Beyoncé portrayed an aristocrat daydreaming about affection. Similarly, Michael Zelenko of The Fader described her character as an aristocrat [...] "in desperate need of physical attention" [...] and noted similarities with the film True Lies in the strip scene. John Boone from E! Online praised the overall sexiness of the video and the singer's look in various scenes. Hailing the video [...] "steamy", Dan Reilly of Spin noted the variety of revealing outfits worn by Beyoncé and concluded [...] "here's no nudity, but the video certainly comes close". Writing on behalf of Vanity Fair, Michelle Collins stated in her review, [...] "If you're a fan of gorgeously choreographed burlesque routines, as well as women in their thirties who defy the logic of cellulite, 'Partition' is a good starting off <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> journey through Beyoncé's 'Beyoncé.'" [...] Alice Newbold of The Daily Telegraph hailed the explicit nature of the video stating how it showed Beyoncé as [...] "one sassy lady on a mission to show she's back in the game".|$|E

2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album. Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track. I just remember feeling like that at a point in my life. I know {{there are so many people}} out there that go through that dark time and I felt like it could speak to a lot of people." ...|$|E

Then, I was ignorant from whence you came, and now, I know not whither you are, going. It is not, perhaps, a very favourable <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> horoscope, that every thing connected with you is a secret. But as I shall always think with kindness on him whom I have known so long, so when you remember the old man, you ought not to forget that he has done his duty to you, to the extent of his means and power, and taught you that noble profession, by means of which, wherever your lot casts you, you may always gain your bread, and alleviate at the same time, the distresses of your fellow creatures."

I must begin by testifying that you yourself took no interest whatever in the introduction, and in the most proper spirit displayed a single-minded ambition to get back to play, and this I thought an excellent and admirable <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> character. You were also (I use the past tense, with a view to the time when you shall read, rather than to that when I am writing) a very pretty boy, and (to my European views) startlingly self-possessed. My time of observation was so limited that you must pardon me if I can say no more: what else I marked, what restlessness of foot and hand, what graceful clumsiness, what experimental designs upon the furniture, was but the common inheritance of human youth. But you may perhaps like to know that the lean flushed man in bed, who interested you so little, {{was in a state of}} mind extremely mingled and unpleasant: harassed with work which he thought he was not doing well, troubled with difficulties to which you will in time succeed, and yet looking forward to no less a matter than a voyage to the South Seas and the visitation of savage and desert islands. -Your father's friend, ...|$|E

60|$|You may easily believe I am {{not at all}} {{surprised}} at what you tell me, since it is but a confirmation of my own conjecture that I sent you last week, and made you my reproaches upon it at a venture. It looks exceeding strange, yet, I {{believe it to be}} a great truth, that, in order to carry a <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> house, the two following circumstances are of great advantage; first, to have an ill cause; and, secondly, to be a minority. For both these circumstances are extremely apt to unite men, to make them assiduous in their attendance, watchful of opportunities, zealous for gaining over proselytes, and often successful; which is not to be wondered at, when favour and interest are on the side of their opinion. Whereas, on the contrary, a majority with a good cause are negligent and supine. They think it sufficient to declare themselves upon occasion in favour of their party, but, sailing against the tide of favour and preferment, they are easily scattered and driven back. In short, they want a common principle to cement, and motive to spirit them; For the bare acting upon a principle from the dictates of a good conscience, or prospect of serving the public, will not go very far under the present dispositions of mankind. This was amply verified last sessions of Parliament, upon occasion of the money bill, the merits of which I shall not pretend to examine. 'Tis enough that, upon the first news of its transmission hither, in the form it afterwards appeared, the members, upon discourse with their friends, seemed unanimous against it, I mean those of both parties, except a few, who were looked upon as persons ready to go any lengths prescribed them by the court. Yet with only a week's canvassing among a very few hands, the bill passed after a full debate, by a very great majority; yet, I believe, you will hardly attempt persuading me, or anybody else, that one man in ten, of those who changed their language, were moved by reasons any way affecting the merits of the cause, but merely through hope, fear, indolence, or good manners. Nay, I have been assured from good hands, that there was still a number sufficient to make a majority against the bill, if they had not apprehended the other side to be secure, and therefore thought it imprudence, by declaring themselves, to disoblige the government to no purpose.|$|E
