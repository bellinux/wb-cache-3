5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E

5|$|Most {{planning}} {{focused on}} the first phase, which {{was seen as the}} most critical. This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a graving dock capable of taking battleships at Pearl Harbor between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy had no such base east of Malta. In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific in case of a war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while Sydney was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location.|$|E
5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> deflagration flame front is born, powered by carbon fusion.

5|$|Throughout November25, Sandra {{dramatically}} strengthened as deep convection blossomed {{around a}} tightening and clearing eye. The system achieved hurricane status by 06:00UTC and major hurricane status—Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—by 00:00UTC on November26. Prominent outflow became established atop the cyclone and further aided the intensification. Throughout the strengthening <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> mid- to upper-level trough near {{the west coast of}} North America created a weakness in the subtropical ridge, prompting Sandra to turn north around {{the western edge of the}} high. Sandra reached its peak intensity as a high-end Category4 hurricane around 06:00UTC on November26 with maximum sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a barometric pressure of 934mbar (hPa; 27.58inHg). By this time, the hurricane's eye shrunk to less than 6mi (10km) in diameter. Within hours, however, increasing wind shear began to impact the circulation and caused convection to become asymmetric. Concurrently, the system started a turn northeast toward mainland Mexico as it rounded the ridge.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic Oscillation, {{also known}} as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric {{circulation}} variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the westerly wind belt that circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the westerly wind belt affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative <b>phase.</b> <b>A</b> positive phase is when the westerly wind belt is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger westerly winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less frontal and orographic precipitation resulting from reduced westerly wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the westerly wind belt is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal <b>phase.</b> <b>A</b> significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E
