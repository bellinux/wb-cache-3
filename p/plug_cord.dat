50|$|Hubots {{are usually}} {{programmed}} to recognise and obey their owner and can learn skills {{and pick up}} knowledge through observation of humans. Hubots have begun to replace human workers in many industries, especially {{in the performance of}} repetitive tasks. Though they are designed to closely resemble humans, hubots are usually easy for humans to recognise as they have bright flawless skin, glossy hair and unnaturally bright (usually very blue or very green) eyes. All Hubots also have a USB-like port, in either {{the back of the neck}} or in their lower back, which is used for programming and data. The button to activate or de-power a hubot is located under the left armpit, as is a standard wall <b>plug</b> <b>cord</b> for recharging purposes. Hubots require only electricity to survive and must recharge regularly, during which they enter a sleep-like state. Hubot skin feels similar to human skin and is kept at normal human body temperature, but beneath the skin are metal components and a blue fluid/lubricant known as HubFluid.|$|E

50|$|Two years later, fellow {{engineer}} Walt Lehnert joined Allison, {{and together}} they diversified the company's product line to include amplifiers and transformers for the broadcast industry. By 1942, the company had designed a sophisticated audio system for the University of Minnesota, and the resulting jacks, <b>plugs,</b> patch <b>cords</b> and jackfields became the cornerstones for ADC's later entry into telecommunications.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plugs</b> {{and power}} <b>cords</b> have a rated voltage (V) and rated current (A) {{assigned}} {{to them by}} the manufacturer, and these values are required to be marked on the plug. For a plug, the values are normally those specified in the relevant standard sheet. The international preferred rating for household plugs and sockets is either 130 V or 250 V; these are the values for normal use, and at which they are tested. (<b>Plugs</b> and power <b>cords</b> are also required to be tested at higher voltage for a brief period of 1 minute to test their electrical strength in case of fault conditions.) The NEMA 1-15 U.S. 2 pin (Type A) and NEMA 5-15 U.S. 3 pin (Type B) plugs are rated at 125 V. Similar plugs used in countries with higher mains voltages in the range 220-250 V are rated at 250 V. Using an appliance, <b>plug</b> or power <b>cord</b> which is not appropriate for the territory (e.g. one rated for 125 V with a 230 V supply) may constitute a safety hazard.|$|R
50|$|A typical job {{sought by}} working women {{was that of}} a {{telephone}} operator or Hello Girl. The workers would sit on stools facing a wall with hundreds of outlets and tiny blinking lights; they had to work quickly when a light flashed <b>plugging</b> the <b>cord</b> into the proper outlet. Despite the hassles many women wanted this job because it paid five dollars a week and provided a rest lounge for the employees to take a break.|$|R
50|$|Plugless Power is {{a family}} of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) {{products}} manufactured by Evatran that enable inductive charging for electric vehicles (EV). The Plugless Power EVSE wirelessly delivers electrical power to the on-board EV battery charger using electromagnetic induction without a physical connection to the vehicle. An EV equipped with a Plugless Vehicle Adapter can be charged by parking it over an inductive Plugless Parking Pad. The active step of <b>plugging</b> a <b>cord</b> into the vehicle is eliminated.|$|R

25|$|When a {{subscriber}} {{dialed the}} number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by <b>plugging</b> a <b>cord</b> into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station. For example, if a dial customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange.

For example, an E plug fits into an F outlet.|$|R
50|$|The Laboratory Modules were {{packaged}} in an extruded aluminum housing, intended {{to sit on}} an engineer's workbench, although a rack-mount bay was sold that held nine laboratory modules. They were then connected together using banana <b>plug</b> patch <b>cords</b> inserted {{at the front of}} the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5 MHz (1957), 500 kHz (1959), or 10 MHz (1960). The Modules proved to be in high demand in other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone, turning a profit at the end of its first year.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the pilot}} project in Paris has started with the {{introduction}} of 100 Z.E. cars. The map of charging stations can be downloaded from the city website.

50|$|Although the Doric organs {{sold in the}} United States {{operated}} on standard 120V power, the cable connecting the unit to a wall was unique, and, as a result, many organs are sold without plugs and users are forced to either replace the jack with an IEC standard, fashion a <b>plug</b> from appliance <b>cords,</b> or buy expensive vintage cables.
