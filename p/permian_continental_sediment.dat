40|$|Abstract. An {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} biogeochemical model SWAMCO is coupled to the ocean-sea-ice model NEMO-LIM to explore processes governing the spatial distribution of the iron supply to phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. The 3 -D NEMO-LIM-SWAMCO model is implemented in the ocean domain south of latitude 30 ◦ S and runs are per-formed over September 1989 –December 2000.

This constraint on when erosion began has influenced models of the timing and diachrony of the India–Eurasia collision 6, 7, 8, timing and mechanisms of exhumation 9, 10 and uplift 11, as well as our general understanding of foreland basin dynamics 12. But the depositional age of these basin sediments was based on biostratigraphy from four intercalated marl units 5.
