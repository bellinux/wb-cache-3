2500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} {{similarities}} between the New Testament Household Codes and Aristotle's discussion of families in Book One of Politics.

25|$|As {{of today}} the {{learning}} process varies and they are many. Since 1936 some methods {{have been published in}} the form of books or booklets. Many learn to play it from their parents and grandparents as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> tradition that in some cases is also a source of income as tiples are popular in trios or serenades.|$|E
25|$|These {{practices}} are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> lineage held by ngakpas that were handed {{down through the}} Yuthok family until they were taught to Sumton Yeshe Zung, the heart-disciple of Yuthok Yonten Gonpo the Younger. Recent lineage holders include the late Khenpo Truro Tsenam, the late Khenpo Tsultrim Gyaltsen, and Micho Khedrub Gyatso Rinpoche. Currently, Dr. Nida Chenagtsang is teaching this lineage as well.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s bottom line is that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.|$|E

25|$|SCN5A is {{a highly}} conserved gene located on human {{chromosome}} 3, where it spans more than 100 kb. The gene consists of 28 exons, of which exon 1 and in part exon 2 form the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) and exon 28 the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of the RNA. SCN5A is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of 10 genes that encode different types of sodium channels, i.e. brain-type (NaV1.1, NaV1.2, NaV1.3, NaV1.6), neuronal channels (NaV1.7, NaV1.8 and NaV1.9), skeletal muscle channels (NaV1.4) and the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5.|$|E

Later daughter Sylvia joined the act as a second target girl and then son Patrick became a thrower. Fritz and Helga have since retired but Patrick and Sylvia continue the act. Fritz is a Guinness World Record holder for rapid throwing around a live target.|$|E
25|$|The {{eigenvalues}} of unitary matrices {{are pure}} phases, {{so that the}} value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, not a real number. Another way of saying this is that a unitary matrix is the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of 2π. Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008 the Congress {{passed a}} law raising the minimum age for {{employment}} from 14 to 15, which will increase to 16; in rare cases the Ministry of Education may authorize a younger child to work as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> unit. Children {{between the ages of}} 15 and 18 may work in a limited number of job categories and for limited hours if they have completed compulsory schooling, which normally ends at age 18. Legal penalties for employing underage workers ranged from 1,000 to 5,000 pesos ($303 to $1,515) for each child employed. Provincial governments and the city government of Buenos Aires are responsible for labor law enforcement.|$|E

25|$|In March 2011, the USAF {{decided to}} {{purchase}} 80 to 100 aircraft. The Global Strike Command indicated that one {{requirement for the}} bomber is to carry a weapon of similar effect to the Massive Ordnance Penetrator. In addition to the strategic bombing, tactical bombing, and prompt global strike roles typical for a bomber, the aircraft is to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of systems responsible for ground surveillance and electronic attack. The Obama Administration in its 2012 budget request asked for $197 million {{and a total of}} $3.7 billion over five years to develop the bomber, including modular payloads for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), electronic attack (EA), and communications. It shall be nuclear-capable, but shall not be certified as such until older bombers are set to retire.|$|E
25|$|Cadbury {{has enjoyed}} a {{substantial}} fan base in India. The Dairy Milk primarily is a huge success. Initially, the company had appointed Amithabh Bhachan as the brand ambassador in 2004. However the brand soon faced a significant backlash with worms being spotted in the chocolate bars. With its new campaigns however the company did get back on its feet. Cadbury {{is known for its}} marketing campaigns in India that have known to instill a sense of playfulness and innocence with its campaigns. One campaign that promoted the product by using the country's love for cricket was very successful. The ad is noted to be the best advertisement made in India by the Times of India. Another famous campaign hosted by the company in the past was the 'Shubh Aarambh' Campaign. This campaign made use of the traditional practice of Indian households of having something sweet before every auspicious occasion. It is a traditional belief that this leads to a favourable outcome for the people. This campaign was also a huge hit and positioned Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> name. Cadbury today holds 70% of the market share of the chocolate industry in the country.|$|E

500|$|For {{his first}} ten years, [...] "Johnny" [...] McCain (the {{nickname}} {{he was given}} as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> tradition of distinguishing the generations) [...] was frequently uprooted as his family, including older sister Sandy (born 1934) and younger brother Joe (born 1942), followed his father to New London, Connecticut, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other stations in the Pacific Ocean. Summer vacations were sometimes spent at the family's Teoc plantation, but McCain always felt his heritage was military, not Southern. [...] McCain attended whatever naval base school was available, often {{to the detriment of}} his education, as schools were sometimes substandard and their curricula often erratic. [...] After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, his father was absent for long stretches. [...] His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his mother, who took advantage of the family's many long-distance travels to expose him to historical and cultural sites. He later wrote, [...] "She taught me to find so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me of the joy of living." [...] A Republican, she also made sure that he followed current events, although his parents avoided outward partisan affiliations due to his father's military career.|$|E
500|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> located {{socially}} and economically on the lower fringes of the English gentry. The Rev. George Austen and Cassandra Leigh, Jane Austen's parents, lived in Steventon, Hampshire, where Rev. Austen was the rector of the Anglican parish from 1765 until 1801. Jane Austen's immediate family was large and close-knit. She had six brothers—James, George, Charles, Francis, Henry, and Edward—and a beloved older sister, Cassandra. Austen's brother Edward was adopted by Thomas and Elizabeth Knight and eventually inherited their estates at Godmersham, Kent, and Chawton, Hampshire. In 1801, Rev. Austen retired from the ministry and moved his family to Bath, Somerset. He died in 1805 {{and for the next}} four years, Jane, Cassandra, and their mother lived first in rented quarters and then in Southampton where they shared a house with Frank Austen's family. During these unsettled years, they spent much time visiting various branches of the family. In 1809, Jane, Cassandra, and their mother moved permanently into a large [...] "cottage" [...] in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate. Austen lived at Chawton until she moved to Winchester for medical treatment shortly before her death in 1817.|$|E
