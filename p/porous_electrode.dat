Chapter 2 presents {{a comprehensive review of}} the history and recent development of amperometric gas sensors with their specific applications and limitations presented. Room temperature ionic liquids, microelectrodes and <b>porous</b> <b>electrodes</b> are also introduced in this chapter to initially discuss their potential for gas sensors. Chapter 4 studies the interaction between carbon dioxide and an imidazolium cation based RTIL. The solubility and diffusion coefficient are determined by the analysis of chronoamperometry using the Shoup and Szabo equation. A mechanism of the interaction between CO 2 and the RTIL is proposed and validated by theoretical modelling. Chapter 5 focuses on O 2 uptake in a phosphonium cation based RTIL. A mechanism of O 2 reduction in this RTIL is proposed, reflecting a two electron reduction pathway. Proof-of-concept for this RTIL to be developed into a CO 2 /O 2 dual sensor is confirmed with by experiments with CO 2 /O 2 gas mixtures.
