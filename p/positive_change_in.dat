5|$|Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a <b>positive</b> <b>change.</b> <b>In</b> his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.|$|E

Phaneuf was named an {{alternate}} captain in Toronto nine games after being acquired after Mike Komisarek suffered a season-ending injury. While Phaneuf struggled offensively to begin his tenure in Toronto – he played 25 games in Toronto before scoring his first goal – then-Leafs Head Coach Ron Wilson credited him with creating a <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the mood in the Toronto dressing room.|$|E

40|$|Background: Biopsychosocially {{informed}} {{education is}} associated with improved back pain beliefs and <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> health care practitioners’ practice behaviours. Objective: Assess {{the effect of this}} type of education for insurance workers who are important non-clinical stakeholders in the rehabilitation of injured workers. Methods: Insurance workers operating in the Western Australian workers’ compensation system underwent two, 1. 5 hour sessions of biopsychosocially informed education focusing on understanding and identifying barriers to recovery of injured workers with musculoskeletal conditions. Back pain beliefs were assessed pre-education, immediately post-education and at three-month follow-up (n =  32). Self-reported and Injury Management Advisor-reported assessment of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> claims management behaviours were collected at the three-month follow-up. Results: There were <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the Health Care Providers’ Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (p =  0. 009) and Back Beliefs Questionnaire (p =  0. 049) immediately following the education that were sustained at three-month follow-up. <b>Positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> claims management behaviours were supported by self-reported and Injury Management Advisor-reported data. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary support that a brief biopsychosocially informed education program can positively influence insurance workers’ beliefs regarding back pain, with concurrent <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> claims management behaviours. Further research is required to ascertain if these <b>changes</b> result <b>in</b> improved claims management outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Individuals are {{expected}} to mature with increasing age, {{but it is not}} yet fully understood which factors contribute to this maturation process. Using data of a representative sample of Germans (N = 14, 718) who gave information about their Big Five personality traits twice over a period of 4 years, we identified satisfaction with life, which was reported yearly, as an important variable for explaining mechanisms and interindividual differences in personality maturation. Dual latent change models suggest that more satisfied (compared to less satisfied) individuals experience more <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness and that <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> life satisfaction are associated with <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> personality.
