40|$|Cement {{pressurisation}} is {{an important}} step in total hip arthroplasty that determines the long-term integration at the cement-bone interface. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of a new pressuriser designed by us against the standard existing pressurisers in an in vitro experimental set-up using two parameters: cement penetration and cement pressurisation. A polypropylene cup model was designed to represent the acetabulum. DePuy’s T-handle, Exeter and our own <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser were each tested for cement pressurisation in this acetabular model. Cement penetration and pressures were measured. The cement intrusion into the capillaries with the DePuy pressuriser was found to vary between 2  and 8  mm (mean: 5  mm at the pole and 4. 6  mm at the rim), with the Exeter pressuriser it varied between 3  and 9  mm (mean: 5. 8  mm at the pole and 7. 8  mm at the rim) and with the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser it varied between 4  and 6  mm (mean 5. 2  mm at the pole and 4. 8  mm at the rim). The peak pressure achieved with the DePuy pressuriser was 60  kPa whereas it was 70  kPa with the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser. The mean penetration with the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser was found to be better than the other types. The penetration was found to be more uniform with equal penetration at the rim {{as well as at the}} pole...|$|R

The objective of this project is to design a new material supply mechanism that can overcome the limitation on the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> injection molding at the same the to improve {{the function of the}} current material supply that only act as a material storage. The development process consists of the design process and the validation process. The new design consists of the new function to give more functionality to the current material supply. The new function consists of the mixing mechanism and also the heating element and in additional to that, the valve is also being integrated into the mechanism in order to control the molten plastic from flowing out. The process of selecting a new material supply mechanism are made by selecting the best concept from three concept of a new material supply mechanism using a Pugh concept selection method. Due to the constrain in obtaining the component part, validation process {{was carried out}} by using CAE software. The validation process is done by using the CAE software analysis in the temperature flow on the mechanism.

50|$|Prior {{to modern}} geared dial mechanisms, test {{indicators}} using a single lever or systems of levers were common. The range and precision {{of these devices}} were generally inferior to modern dial type units, {{with a range of}} 10/1000 inch to 30/1000 inch, and precision of 1/1000 inch being typical. One common single lever test indicator was the Starrett (No. 64), and those using systems of levers for amplification were made by companies such Starrett (No. 564) and Lufkin (No. 199A), as well as smaller companies like Ideal Tool Co.

40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> QC 20121221 </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} validation of a high speed reluctance actuator for a soccer robot. The actuator is used to shoot a regular sized soccer ball by applying different force levels directly to the ball. As the application requires force in only one direction, a <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> reluctance actuator is selected. A capacitor is used to buffer energy from the battery of the robot. Through an IGBT, the energy is transferred from the capacitor to the actuator. Consequently, by applying pulse width modulation, the force applied by the actuator can be adjusted to enable a variable shooting power. The reluctance type actuator is designed using finite element analysis. The actuator is build and implemented in the robot providing the capability to shoot a ball from standstill over 12 meters with a starting speed of 11 m/s...|$|R

50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|R

The KAFOs are mainly used to support the patients with muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesions and lost structural integrity [40].
