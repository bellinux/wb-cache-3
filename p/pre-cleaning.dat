5000|$|Clinching is used {{primarily}} in the automotive, appliance and electronic industries, where it often replaces spot welding. Clinching does not require electricity or cooling of the electrodes commonly associated with spot welding. Being a mechanical joining process, clinching {{can be used to}} join materials showing no electrical conductivity such as polymers or plastic-metal composites. In addition, it does not require a substrate preparation such as <b>pre-cleaning</b> of surfaces which is required for welding processes. This fact contributes to reduce the joining costs and the environmental impact (since chemical cleaning is not required).Clinching does not generate sparks or fumes. The strength of a clinched joint can be tested non-destructively using a simple measuring instrument to measure the remaining thickness {{at the bottom of the}} joint, of the diameter of the produced button depending on the type of tools employed. Life expectancy for clinching tools is in the hundreds of thousands of cycles, making it an economical process. Clinched connections performed on aluminum sheets have higher fatigue life as compared to spot welding.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second problem}} occurs as {{the sample is}} removed from the water source and begins to {{establish}} chemical equilibrium with its new surroundings - the sample container. Sample containers must be made of materials with minimal reactivity with substances to be measured; and <b>pre-cleaning</b> of sample containers is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the sample container and any residue on that container, or chemicals dissolved in the water sample may sorb onto the sample container and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis. Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any pumps, piping, or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the sample container. Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced pressure of the atmosphere; so gas dissolved in the water may escape into unfilled space {{at the top of the}} container. Atmospheric gas present in that air space may also dissolve into the water sample. Other chemical reaction equilibria may change if the water sample changes temperature. Finely divided solid particles formerly suspended by water turbulence may settle to the bottom of the sample container, or a solid phase may form from biological growth or chemical precipitation. Microorganisms within the water sample may biochemically alter concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds. Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter pH and change solubility of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two ways}} of reusing dialyzers, manual and automated. Manual reuse {{involves}} the cleaning of a dialyzer by hand. The dialyzer is semi-disassembled then flushed repeatedly before being rinsed with water. It is then stored with a liquid disinfectant(PAA) for 18+ hours until its next use. Although many clinics outside the USA use this method, some clinics are switching toward a more automated/streamlined process as the dialysis practice advances. The newer method of automated reuse is achieved {{by means of a}} medical device which began in the early 1980s. These devices are beneficial to dialysis clinics that practice reuse - especially for large dialysis clinical entities - because they allow for several back to back cycles per day. The dialyzer is first pre-cleaned by a technician, then automatically cleaned by machine through a step-cycles process until it is eventually filled with liquid disinfectant for storage. Although automated reuse is more effective than manual reuse, newer technology has sparked even more advancement in the process of reuse. When reused over 15 times with current methodology, the dialyzer can lose B2m, middle molecule clearance and fiber pore structure integrity, which has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of the patient's dialysis session. Currently, as of 2010, newer, more advanced reprocessing technology has proven the ability to completely eliminate the manual <b>pre-cleaning</b> process altogether and has also proven the potential to regenerate(fully restore) all functions of a dialyzer to levels that are approximately equivalent to single-use for more than 40 cycles. As medical reimbursement rates begin to fall even more, many dialysis clinics are continuing to operate effectively with reuse programs especially since the process is easier and more streamlined than before.|$|E

This experiment aimed to evaluate chemical and energetic quality of corn obtained in a feed mill before and after <b>pre-cleaning.</b> Twenty samples of 30 kg of corn each were taken from trucks delivering corn to the mill. The trucks were then unloaded and the material passed through a <b>pre-cleaning</b> process when another sample was taken. Samples were graded and physical properties evaluated: density (g/L), grain percentages of foreign material, impurities, fragments, broken, soft, insect damaged, fire-burnt, fermented, damaged, cracked and fine particles, as well as chemical composition analysis: Apparent metabolizable energy for poultry (AME), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), starch (STA), water activity (WA), crude protein (CP), digestible and total lysine, methionine, cystine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, histidine and arginine. The experiment was a randomized design with two treatments (before and after <b>pre-cleaning)</b> and twenty replications. Data was analyzed using SAS &# 174; and treatment differences obtained using F test. Correlations and principal components were calculated. There was a decrease in density after the <b>pre-cleaning</b> process, which was {{probably due to the}} removal of earth and stones rather than grain and its fractions. Significant increases were found for insect damage, fermented and damaged grain while fire-burn was significantly reduced after the <b>pre-cleaning</b> process. Starch increased after <b>pre-cleaning</b> which is a result of contaminants that normally are poor in this carbohydrate, but fiber levels increased too. Apparent metabolizable energy, aminoacids, digestible (P< 0. 05) and total (P< 0. 05) histidine, total lysine and methionine (P< 0. 1) levels were reduced after <b>pre-cleaning.</b> Density was higher when there were fewer impurities such as straw, husk or small grains. Broken corn was positively correlated (P< 0. 05) with foreign material (0. 63) and fragments (0. 76), while proportion of damaged corn was positively correlated with foreign material (0. 68), fragments (0. 58) and broken corn (0. 83). In this study, even in samples classified as excellent quality before <b>pre-cleaning,</b> the <b>pre-cleaning</b> process was effective in reducing humidity and water activity which helps control the growth of fungi or other microorganisms.

Graphene 2 ̆ 6 apos;s unprecedented high mobility makes it a uniquely suited material for many applications, including high-frequency transistors, or as a transparent conductive layer. One of the challenges nowadays is synthesizing graphene on a large scale, while retaining its excellent quality. A feasible method for producing large areas of single layer graphene, is growth by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This deposition technique however, produces poly-crystalline graphene, with grain boundaries at the interface between crystals. These grain boundaries {{are known to have}} a negative effect on the electronic properties of graphene. This work describes the optimization of the quality of graphene, grown by CVD in the setup available at the Plasma 2 ̆ 6 amp; Materials Processing group of the Eindhoven University of Technology. In order to improve the quality, the amount of grain boundaries is reduced by decreasing the amount of nucleation sites. It is shown that the system pressure and the gas flow ratios can be used to control the nucleation density of graphene. The background pressure was increased by the addition of an argon gas flow to the precursor gas mixture. The increase in pressure caused by this inert gas resulted in a significant reduction in the nucleation density. The flows of the precursor gasses hydrogen and methane have also been optimized to further decrease the nucleation density. With the optimized growth condition, the nucleation density was decreased from (46. 4 ± 15. 4) · 103 mm- 2 to (1. 6 ± 0. 3) · 103 mm- 2. Furthermore, the effect of cleaning the copper substrate before it is used for the growth of graphene is investigated. It is found that the <b>pre-cleaning</b> of the copper foil with various cleaning agents reduces the nucleation density of graphene flakes. From the various solutions used, the best results have been obtained by <b>pre-cleaning</b> the copper sample for 30 s with 1 M nitric acid, before it is used for the synthesis of graphene. With this <b>pre-cleaning</b> step the nucleation density was reduced by a factor of 2 to (1. 1 ± 0. 4) · 103 mm- 2. The optimization of both the growth conditions and the <b>pre-cleaning</b> procedure have led to a decrease in the overall nucleation density by a factor of 41, from (46. 4 ± 15. 4) · 103 mm- 2 to (1. 1 ± 0. 4) · 103 mm- 2. With Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Hall measurements, graphene grown with both the original and optimized growth processes was analyzed and compared. The mobility of the graphene grown with the optimized growth process was higher in all measurements. The optical mobility, obtained with FTIR, was 3. 2 · 103 cm 2 /Vs.

An additional 200 ^∘C vacuum anneal after transfer efficiently removes interfacial bubbles and wrinkles as well as accumulated strain, thereby restoring the surface morphology of transferred flakes to their native state. Our recipe is important for building clean heterostructures of 2 D materials and increasing the reproducibility and reliability of 2 D devices...|$|E
30|$|The {{relative}} {{standard deviation}} (RSD) for each metal repeated analysis was maintained below 5 %. The detection limits for all elements were 0.4  mg kg− 1 for Cd, 5  mg kg− 1 for Pb, 30  mg kg− 1 for Cu, and 850  mg kg− 1 for Fe. A spiked sample using a known amount of metal standard was examined via acid digestion for verification of {{the accuracy of the}} analytical procedure. Recoveries of the heavy metals ranged between 85 and 110 %. All reagents used were analytical reagent grade. A <b>pre-cleaning</b> regime, i.e., acid washed was applied for each glassware apparatus prior to use. High purity water (water sensitivity ~[*] 18.2  Mohms·cm at 25  °C; Millipore, MA, USA) was used throughout this study for laboratory applications including reagents, blanks, and standard preparation.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ion {{bombardment}} on thermally evaporated and magnetron sputtered tungsten oxide films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results show that {{irrespective of the}} porosity and crystallinity of the film samples formed with different techniques and conditions, ion bombardment induced preferential sputtering of oxygen, resulting in a decrease of oxygen/tungsten (O/W) ratio with increasing sputtering time. Samples experienced electrochromic switching cycles also show the same effect, except that a higher O/W ratio is detected because the tungsten oxide film reacts with the LiClO 4 -propylene carbonate electrolyte. Angle-resolved XPS experiments further confirm preferential sputtering of oxygen, suggesting that ion beam sputtering used in XPS for <b>pre-cleaning</b> and depth profile analysis of tungsten oxide must be used with caution. Rutherford back-scattering gives more reliable composition data of tungsten oxide, since it does not involve any sputtering process. Department of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of antibiotic resistant bacteria {{is a serious}} public health issue affecting millions of people. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) is {{a leading cause of}} healthcare acquired infections today. Research has shown that patients infected or colonized with MRSA shed the bacteria into the environment, where the bacteria can survive {{for long periods of time}} and become potential sources of infection. Currently, infection prevention efforts focus on active surveillance, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment use and antimicrobial stewardship, with less attention given to environmental cleaning. Nevertheless, environmental cleaning is essential to remove infectious agents from environmental surfaces and prevent transmission. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of environmental cleaning programs in removing MRSA from environmental surfaces at an acute care hospital and a long-term care facility. Environmental swabs or sponge samples were collected from five locations (floor, television remote, call bell, bathroom doorknob and bed rail) pre- and post-terminal cleaning from the rooms of patients infected or colonized with MRSA. These swabs or sponges were then analyzed through culture isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the presence of MRSA. A total of 120 environmental samples were obtained from two medical facilities. Culture analysis followed by confirmatory PCR analysis for the mecA gene showed that 18 of the 120 samples (15 %) were positive for the presence of MRSA of which 16 were collected <b>pre-cleaning</b> (89 %), and 2 were collected post-cleaning (11 %). The location of the positive <b>pre-cleaning</b> samples included the floor (5), call bell (4), bed rail (4), bathroom doorknob (2) and TV remote (1), and the positive post-cleaning samples included the floor (1) and call bell (1). The results confirm the presence of MRSA on surfaces in patient rooms and suggest that environmental cleaning was effective, but there is potential for rooms to remain contaminated. Future research should focus on identifying the most effective cleaning programs to ensure rooms are safe for patients...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the quality of soybean seeds with high level of mechanical damages from different processing stages and stored with and without fungicide treatment. Collections of seed samples were performed during the processing at the following points: hopper, <b>pre-cleaning,</b> dryer, cleaning, spiral, sieve-classifier and the gravity table. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 9 x 2 factorial scheme, with 9 collection points and two seed treatments, in four replicates. The seeds were then evaluated immediately after processing and {{after six months of}} storage. The processing progressively improved the attributes of soybean seed quality throughout the different stages in which the gravity table {{plays an important role in}} the improvement of the physiological and sanitary quality of the lot, favoring the storage potential and vigor of the seeds. The treatment of the seeds with fungicides is effective in controlling fungi before and after storage. The storage of soybean seeds with high level of mechanical damage markedly increases their deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Energetic process {{development}} {{in the production of}} optical coatings has progressed significantly over the last two decades, permitting the practitioner of thin film coating depositions a wide choice of deposition parameters. Primarily, a series of important advances has occurred in the nearly ubiquitous use of Ion Assisted Deposition (IAD) for the production of high performance optical coatings. Progressing from the rudimentary use of ionized gas technology for <b>pre-cleaning</b> substrates, to the advanced IAD produced telecom filters (DWDM), energetic processes now {{play a vital role in}} most optical coating production. The advances in IAD technology culminate in the development of stable and durable thin films for a wide variety of stringent spectral specifications from the UV to the Far IR. The technical progression from IAD use in either sputtered or physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes to the development of Ion-Assisted Filtered Cathodic Arc Deposition (IFCAD) technology for low temperature production of thin-film coatings will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The ORMAK tokamak {{has been}} in {{operation}} since 1971, and surface impurity problems have been pursued from the beginning. Surface studies of materials removed from ORMAK have revealed the presence of C, O, and Fe. These are also the principal impurities observed spectroscopically in plasma discharges, although numerous other elements are present in lesser amounts. Spectroscopy, x- ray measurements, plasma resistance, and fast ion scattering {{have been used in}} an effort to determine Z/sub eff/, the effective nuclear charge of plasma ions. All four measurements have practical difficulties leading to relatively large experimental error limits. Oxygen discharge <b>pre-cleaning</b> has allowed ORMAK discharges to reach higher currents and correspondingly higher ion and electron temperatures; spectroscopic studies reveal a lower level of contaminants, particularly C and N. Power measurements indicate that most of the input power strikes the walls, mostly as radiation. By varying operating parameters it is found that Z/sub eff/ approximately I/sub p//anti n/sub e/.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} severe {{problems}} in the replacement of galvanic treatment with PVD coatings reside, first of all, in the higher costs of vacuum processes and in the difficulty to coat many 3 D small samples. This work describes the results obtained by using energetic deposition vacuum processes, {{of the family of}} Ion Plating Plasma Assisted (IPPA), using both thermal and sputtering sources, able to reduce dramatically the duration of deposition process and to eliminate the substrate heating and their <b>pre-cleaning.</b> Regarding the small 3 D samples, an innovative structure, named "Ionic Rotarybarrel" is presented. The realised treatments are in the fields of decorative, protective and tribological coatings. Special decorative treatments were realised by using interferential effect produced by dielectric films. Metal, plastic, glass and natural shell substrates were coated with the proposed treatments. A typical duration of 15 minutes of the whole deposition cycle was obtained. The good mechanical and environmental characteristics of the treatments are also described...|$|E
