25|$|As <b>proud</b> <b>as</b> Waramaug was of his {{imposing}} palace, he {{was even}} prouder of the light of his life, his lovely daughter, Lillinonah. Taught from birth to cultivate those virtues most revered by her father -- compassion for one's fellow man, loyalty to family and tribe and sensitivity to the beauties of Nature -- Lillinonah was, {{at the age of}} eighteen, a young woman whose humanity matched her grace and beauty. From near and far the young braves came, as moths to the flame, to pay homage to Lillinonah -- and perhaps win her hand in marriage. But first, of course, each had to pass muster with old Waramaug, and that was no simple matter.|$|E

500|$|Had Cagney's {{mother had}} her way, his stage career {{would have ended}} when he quit Every Sailor after two months; <b>proud</b> <b>as</b> she was of his performance, she {{preferred}} that he get an education.
