5|$|After {{ordering}} {{almost all}} civilians {{to leave the}} city in September, Sherman gave instructions that all military and government buildings in Atlanta be burned, although many private homes and shops were burned as well.

5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{following}} the Union of Lublin, became a {{counterpoint to the}} absolute monarchies gaining power in Europe. Its quasi-democratic political system of Golden Liberty, albeit limited to nobility, was mostly unprecedented {{in the history of}} Europe. In itself, it constituted a fundamental <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> the later development of European constitutional monarchies.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} {{coincided with}} the Dutch Revolt, 1568–1648, encouraging {{the participation of the}} rebellious Dutch provinces and the Spanish. The successful conclusion of the war consolidated Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories and encouraged a Catholic revival on the lower Rhine. Importantly, it also set a <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> outside intervention in German religious and dynastic conflicts.|$|E

5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was {{starved to death}} by her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the rope around her neck. Their bodies were thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E

5|$|Modern 400-series {{highways}} {{have high}} design standards, speed limits of , and various collision avoidance and traffic management systems.

5|$|SMS Prinz Heinrich {{was built}} at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was laid down in 1898 and {{completed}} in March 1902 {{at a cost of}} 16,588,000 Marks. Prinz Heinrichs design was a modification of Fürst Bismarck, and traded a smaller main battery for higher speed and more comprehensive armor protection. The ship set a <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> subsequent German armored cruisers by concentrating her secondary armament amidships, as opposed to Fürst Bismarck, which spread the secondary armament {{along the length of the}} ship.|$|E

5|$|The N1 {{prototype}} was {{the result}} of modifications made to Nclass No.822 during construction in 1922.

The class set the <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> the Southern Railway's subsequent 3-cylinder designs.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the point}} at which {{explicit}} constitutional authority for the creation of federal crimes runs out. But the statute went on to define additional crimes: theft or falsification of court records, perjury, bribery of federal judges, interference with judicial process, and liberation of federal prisoners.

5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century.

It {{is expected to be}} a <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} was mounted too late to prevent the attacks on Saigon, the Australians and New Zealanders successfully disrupted the communist lines of communication, limiting their freedom of manoeuvre to attack the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex, while they were also able to successfully interdict their withdrawal, causing heavy casualties. The operation was also significant {{as it was the}} first deployment of 1 ATF outside its Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR) in Phuoc Tuy, and in this it set a <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> later operations outside the province. Meanwhile, the remaining Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy Province also successfully repelled repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien, as part of the Tet Offensive that had engulfed population centres across South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the penalty was {{in the form of}} time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a <b>precedent</b> <b>for</b> the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E
