40|$|A single lens {{convergent}} light Gouy diffusiometer {{was constructed}} {{and used to}} measure diffusion coefficients near the critical mixing point of a binary and a ternary liquid mixture. Liquid-liquid equilibria measurements were made on each system to determine the binodal curves and critical mixing points. The composition and temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient near the critical point of the methanol-hexane system was determined. Since the binary diffusion coefficient is expected to vanish {{not only at the}} critical point but everywhere on the spinodal curve, the results of these studies allowed location of spinodal compositions by extrapolation to D = 0. It is suggested that spinodal locations could be used in developing accurate models of the liquid state. Gouy interferometric diffusion studies employing a temperature jump technique yielded a critical exponent along the critical line for the methanol-hexane system consistent with established results. Stability conditions require that the thermodynamic factor determinant vanish as the ternary <b>plait</b> <b>point</b> is approached, indicating that the determinant of the four independent diffusion coefficients may also vanish as the <b>plait</b> <b>point</b> is approached. The usually small cross diffusion terms would, therefore, become equal in magnitude to the main terms at this point. Temperature jump diffusion studies on the water - 2 -propanol - cyclohexane system showed that the determinant of the diffusion coefficient matrix rapidly goes to zero with a 1. 31 (+OR-) 0. 2 critical exponent. Near the <b>plait</b> <b>point,</b> negative main diffusion coefficients have been observed which are consistent with positive semidefinite thermodynamic factor stability conditions. Although the results are not entirely conclusive, it appears that each term of the diffusion coefficient matrix goes to zero as the <b>plait</b> <b>point</b> is approached; the average value of the critical exponent for the individual terms was determined to be 0. 55 (+OR-) 0. 2...|$|E

40|$|Thermodynamic {{modeling}} of the Mg-Al-Sb system {{is carried out}} {{as a part of}} thermodynamic database construction for Mg-Al based alloys. This system was modeled by combining the thermodynamic descriptions of the constituent binaries Mg-Al, Al-Sb, and Mg-Sb. The Mg-Al system has been already studied thoroughly and its database is readily available. Hence, only Al-Sb and Mg-Sb were modeled in the present work considering all available experimental phase diagrams and thermodynamic data in the literature. Liquid phases in both systems were described by the Redlich-Kister polynomial model. High temperature modification of the Mg 3 Sb 2 compound in the Mg-Sb system was described by the sublattice model. The constructed database provides a basis to understand the alloys in the Mg-Al-Sb system. It was used to calculate and predict thermodynamic properties, binary phase diagrams of Al-Sb and Mg-Sb, and liquidus projections of the ternary Mg-Al-Sb. The calculated phase diagrams, the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of mixing, and activity of liquid Al-Sb and Mg-Sb alloys were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data reported in the literature. Moreover, isothermal sections, vertical sections, and phase assemblage diagrams were calculated for the Mg-Al-Sb ternary system, and the invariant reaction points were predicted.

It {{is well known that}} ultralow {{interfacial tension}} {{plays an important role in}} oil recovery processes (Chiang and Shah 1980; Cayias et al. 1977; Wilson et al. 1976). The reasons of ultralow IFT’s have been extensively investigated. The ultralow IFT are associated with phase behavior at <b>plait</b> <b>point.</b> At the <b>plait</b> <b>point</b> of liquid/liquid system, two phases become indistinguishable and IFT between the two equilibrium phases goes to zero. The microemulsion systems exhibit ultralow IFTs over wide ranges of salinities, surfactant concentrations and temperatures, suggesting that a critical phenomenon is involved. In 1977, Shah and Schechter (1977) demonstrated from their experimental results that there was direct correlation between interfacial tension and interfacial charge in various oil–water systems. Interfacial charge density is an important factor in lowering the IFT. Partition coefficient and IFT are strong functions of salinity. The minimum IFT occurs at the same salinity where the partition coefficient is observed to unity. Baviere (1976) proposed the same correlation between IFT and partition coefficient. Different factors (such as surfactant mixture ratio, salt concentration, temperature, pressure and oil types) influence the IFT.|$|E

For the 1 -propanol and polymer systems, most of the salt was in the bottom phase while the nonionic solute was concentrated in the top phase. In the n-dodecylammonium chloride system the salt was evenly distributed between the phases {{while most of the}} surfactant was in the top phase. For the poly(propylene glycol) systems, the size of the region of two liquid phases increases with molecular weight and temperature. A modified form of the Flory-Huggins theory was developed for liquid-liquid equilibrium in binary aqueous systems of nonelectrolytes whose closed-loop phase diagrams contain both upper and lower consolute temperature points. The modification involved the assumption of an adjustable molecular size parameter $ chi sb{ 12 }$. Calculations were performed for 15 aqueous binary systems. The models correlated the liquid-liquid equilibrium data accurately. Liquid-liquid equilibrium in aqueous biphasic salt systems was modelled using an expression for the excess Gibbs energy of the solution. The expression is based on modified forms of the Mean Spherical Approximation, the Bromley equation, and the Flory-Huggins theory. The model requires 3 and 5 adjustable parameters for tenary and quaternary systems, respectively. The model accurately correlated vapor- and liquid-liquid equilibrium data for 8 ternary and 3 quaternary aqueous biphasic salt systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Long range {{fluctuations}} of {{the order}} parameter affect thermodynamic as well as transport properties in the critical region. The values of transport coefficients near a critical point are typically enhanced compared to the values in the classical region far away from a critical point. Asymptotically close to a critical point, the crit-ical enhancements obey power laws with universal critical exponents. The asymptotic critical region {{is surrounded by a}} large crossover region, where the enhancements are no longer asymptotic but still significant compared to the background values. In binary mixtures, this is also the region where differences are observed in the critical behavior of transport coefficients near liquid-liquid (consolute) and liquid-vapor (<b>plait)</b> critical <b>points.</b> In this contribution, we review the critical dynamics of binary fluid mixtures with a focus on thermodiffusion. ...|$|R

Multiplicity of reentrance can be tuned by changing the concentration, size, or the structure forming ability of the ions added. This is a route to the realization of various thermodynamic states, such as special critical points (SCPs), in the vanishing limit of reentrance. We show that in E+W+ ion systems, one can achieve a <b>plait</b> <b>point,</b> a critical double point, a double critical point, and a critical inflection point, in addition to a line of critical points.

Isopycnic phase behavior has been observed for mixtures containing the surfactants C 8 E 5, C 10 E 6, and C 12 E 6, but not for those mixtures containing either C 4 E 1 or CgE 3. Pressure-temperature (PT) projections for this isopycnic three-phase equilibrium were determined for H 2 O/CO 2 /C 8 E 5 and H 2 O/CO 2 /C 10 E 6 mixtures at temperatures from approximately 25 to 33 C and pressures between 90 and 350 bar. As a preliminary to measuring the microstructure in isopycnic three component mixtures, phase behavior and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments were performed on {{mixtures of}} D 2 O/CO 2 / n-hexaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether (C 12 E 6) {{as a function of}} temperature (25 - 31 C), pressure (63. 1 - 90. 7 bar), and CO 2 composition (0 - 3. 9 wt%).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{multiplicity}} in heterogeneous azeotropic distillation sequences is studied. Two sequences, suitable for ethanol dehydration, {{are treated as}} sample problems and compared. As a basis the #infinity#/#infinity# analysis method (Petlyuk, F. B.; Avet'yan, V. S. Theor. Found. Chem. Eng. 1971, 5, 499 - 507; Bekiaris, N.; Meski, G. A.; Morari, M. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 1993, 32, 2023 - 2038), which assumes infinite reflux rate and infinite number of trays, is extended to and applied on heterogeneous azeotropic distillation sequences {{in order to determine}} steady-state bifurcation diagrams from thermodynamic considerations. The bifurcation diagrams are very different for the two sequences despite their similar structures. In particular, it is predicted that output multiplicity of the single azeotropic column, as recently experimentally verified by Mueller and Marquardt (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 1997 a, 36, 5410 - 5418), can induce output multiplicity of one sequence. It is further predicted that output multiplicity can be avoided by the choice of a different sequence structure. Furthermore, #infinity#/#infinity# analysis predicts state multiplicity in both heterogeneous azeotropic distillation sequences. This phenomenon in the #infinity#/#infinity# case is also analyzed and it is shown that state multiplicity in heterogeneous distillation sequences can be induced either by the corresponding single column behavior as reported by Gani and Jorgensen (Comput. Chem. Eng. 1994, 18, 55) or by closing the sequence. The predicted bifurcation diagrams and multiplicities are substantiated through rigorous simulation of column sequences operating at finite reflux and with a finite number of stages. Finally, the implications of the thermodynamics including the liquid-liquid <b>plait</b> <b>point</b> position are demonstrated to be important for obtaining reliable predictions. (orig.)
