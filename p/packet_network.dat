25|$|Turing Award laureate Vinton Cerf was a {{doctoral}} student in the computer science department under Kleinrock in the early 1970s and also worked on the ARPANET. He would later team with Bob Kahn {{in the writing of}} the seminal 1974 paper A Protocol for <b>Packet</b> <b>Network</b> Intercommunication. This work proved foundational for their later development of the Transmission Control Protocol - TCP/IP protocol.|$|E
25|$|He {{earned his}} Ph.D. from UCLA in 1972. At UCLA {{he worked in}} Professor Leonard Kleinrock's {{networking}} group that connected the first two nodes of the ARPANET {{and contributed to the}} ARPANET host-to-host protocol. Cerf was an assistant professor at Stanford University from 1972–1976, where he conducted research on <b>packet</b> <b>network</b> interconnection protocols and co-designed the DoD TCP/IP protocol suite with Bob Kahn. He was a program manager for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) from 1976 to 1982. Cerf was instrumental in the formation of both the Internet Society and Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), serving as founding president of the Internet Society from 1992–1995 and in 1999 as Chairman of the Board and as ICANN Chairman from 2000 to 2007. His many awards include the National Medal of Technology, the Turing Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the Internet Society's Internet Hall of Fame.|$|E

He formed, led, and trained the team that designed the commercial QNAP Computer and Network Performance Modeling Tool. He introduced the Flexsim Object Oriented approach for the simulation in manufacturing systems. He carried {{out some of the}} first work on adaptive control of computer systems, and published seminal papers on the performance optimisation of computer network protocols and on the use of diffusion approximations for network performance. He developed new product form queueing networks with negative customers and triggers known as G-networks. He also introduced a new spiked stochastic neural network model known as the random neural network, developed its mathematical solution and learning algorithms, and applied it to both engineering and biological problems. His inventions include the design of the first random access fibre-optics local area network, a patented admission control technique for ATM networks, a neural network based anomaly detector for brain magnetic resonance scans, and the cognitive <b>packet</b> <b>network</b> routing protocol to offer quality of service to users.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem faced {{in the design}} of almost all <b>packet</b> <b>networks</b> is that of efficient operation [...] of reliably communicating given messages among nodes at minimum cost in resource usage. We present a solution to the efficient operation problem for coded <b>packet</b> <b>networks,</b> i. e., <b>packet</b> <b>networks</b> where the contents of outgoing packets are arbitrary, causal functions of the contents of received <b>packets.</b> Such <b>networks</b> are in contrast to conventional, routed <b>packet</b> <b>networks,</b> where outgoing <b>packets</b> are restricted to being copies of received packets and where reliability is provided by the use of retransmissions. This thesis introduces four considerations to coded packet networks: 1. efficiency, 2. the lack of synchronization in <b>packet</b> <b>networks,</b> 3. the possibility of broadcast links, and 4. packet loss. We take these considerations and give a prescription for operation that is novel and general, yet simple, useful, and extensible. Comment: 136 pages, 25 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Although {{instability}} in <b>packet</b> <b>networks</b> has been traditionally associated with overload conditions (because queueing network models show that, in simple configurations, only overload generates instability), some results showing {{instability in}} underloaded <b>packet</b> <b>networks</b> {{have appeared in}} the recent literature. In [1] we studied, with fluid models and with adversarial queueing theory, possible underload instabilities due to complex scheduling algorithms, that closely resemble Quality of Service (QoS) schedulers considered today for <b>packet</b> <b>networks,</b> when sources are non-adaptive. In this paper we extend the study of the underload instabilities to <b>packet</b> <b>networks</b> carrying the traffic generated by elastic (rate-adaptive) sources. In particular, we consider Additive-Increase, Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) sources, and we show this type of adaptivity is not sufficient to mitigate the phenomena leading to underload instabilities and to reduced network throughput.

40|$|Abstract — Medium {{access control}} (MAC) {{protocols}} for wireless <b>packet</b> <b>networks</b> usually {{need to be}} distributed for flexibility and robustness. In a distributed way, however, collision detection becomes difficult and collided packets are usually still fully transmitted with existing wireless MAC protocols, which wastes the precious medium resource of the network. This paper proposes a new MAC protocol that realizes effective and efficient collision detection in wireless <b>packet</b> <b>networks</b> {{by the use of}} pulses of random-length pauses. Our comprehensive simulation results show the capability of the new protocol for significantly improving the throughput of future wireless <b>packet</b> <b>networks.</b> I...|$|R
