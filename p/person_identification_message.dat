40|$|Abstract. Identification {{accuracy}} and speed are {{important factors in}} automatic <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> systems. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction method to extract brain wave features from different brain rhythms of electroencephalography (EEG) signal {{for the purpose of}} fast, yet accurate <b>person</b> <b>identification.</b> The proposed feature extraction method is {{based on the fact that}} EEG signal is complex, non-stationary, and non-linear. With this fact, non-linear analysis like entropy would be more appropriate. Shannon entropy (SE) based EEG features from al-pha, beta, and gamma wave bands are extracted and evaluated for <b>person</b> <b>identification.</b> Experimental results show that SE features provide high <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> rates yet with a low feature dimension, thus better performance. ...|$|R

In a typical {{automated}} <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> scenario, the system always contains the prior knowledge, either person-based model or refer-ence mugshot, of the person-of-interest. However, the challenge of auto-mated <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> would increase by multiple folds if the prior information is not available. In today’s world, rich and large quantity of information are easily attainable through the Internet or closed-loop surveillance network. This provides us an opportunity to employ an au-tomated approach to perform <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> with minimum prior knowledge, presume that there are sufficient amount of observations. In this paper, we propose a dominant set based <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> framework to learn the identity of a person through large-scale observa-tions, where each observation contains instances from various modality. Through experiments on two challenging face datasets we show the po-tential of the proposed approach. We also explore the conditions required to obtain satisfy performance and discuss the potential future research directions. ...|$|R

30|$|There {{are large}} {{individual}} differences in people’s face recognition ability. These individual differences {{provide an opportunity to}} recruit the best face-recognisers into jobs that require accurate <b>person</b> <b>identification,</b> through the implementation of ability-screening tasks. To date, screening has focused exclusively on face recognition ability; however real-world identifications can involve the use of other person-recognition cues. Here we incorporate body and biological motion recognition as relevant skills for <b>person</b> <b>identification.</b> We test whether performance on a standardised face-matching task (the Glasgow Face Matching Test) predicts performance on three other identity-matching tasks, based on faces, bodies, and biological motion. We examine the results from group versus individual analyses. We found stark differences between the conclusions one would make from group analyses versus analyses that retain information about individual differences. Specifically, tests of correlation and analysis of variance suggested that face recognition ability was related to performance for all <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> tasks. These analyses were strikingly inconsistent with the individual differences data, which suggested that the screening task was related only to performance on the face task. This study highlights the importance of individual data in the interpretation of results of <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> ability.|$|R

We proceed in several steps. First, text detection and temporal tracking are performed. After adaptation of images to a standard OCR system, a final post-processing combines multiple transcriptions of the same text box. The semi-supervised adaptation of this system to a particular video type (video broadcast from a French TV) is proposed and evaluated. The system is efficient as it runs 3 times faster than real time (including the OCR step) on a desktop Linux box.

This semiautomatic annotation includes annotation of the identity of people in photos.

In contrast with traditional approaches, based on what a person knows (password) or what a person has (tokens), biometric based identification providing an improved security for their users. Biometrics is the measurement of physiological traits such as palmprints, fingerprints, iris etc., and/or behavioral traits such as gait, signature etc., of an individual person for personal recognition. Hand-based <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> provides a good user acceptance, distinctiveness, universality, relatively easy to capture, low-cost and inexpensive. Palmprint identification is one kind of hand-biometric technology and a relatively new biometrics due to its stable and unique traits. The rich texture information of palmprint offers one of the powerful means in personal identification. Several studies for palmprint-based <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> have focused on the use of palmprint images captured in the visible part of the spectral band. However, recently, the multispectral palmprints have been rendered available and the tendency now in the community is how to exploit these multispectral data to improve the performances of the palmprint-based <b>person</b> <b>identification</b> systems.
