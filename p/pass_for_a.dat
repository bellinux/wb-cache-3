5|$|Adams {{returned}} Tech's kickoff to the Texas 21-yard line, and the Longhorns' offense {{took the}} field. On the first play, Brown completed a 13-yard pass to Adams, who earned {{a first down}} at the 34-yard line. Mitchell gained four yards on a running play, then Texas was penalized for having an ineligible player downfield. On the play after the penalty, Texas was penalized for an illegal formation, negating a completed <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first down. The Longhorns then faced a third down and 11, but Brown's third-down pass was knocked down and the Longhorns punted to end their final possession of the first half.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell's most {{significant}} play, according to Philadelphia media and fans, came on January 11, 2004, in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Packers. Late in the game, with the Eagles losing by three points and facing a 4th and 26 situation, Mitchell caught a 28-yard <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first down. The Eagles tied the {{score on the}} same drive and won the game in overtime. Mitchell had another catch for nineyards in the game. In the NFC Championship Game on January 18 against the Carolina Panthers, he caught four passes for 38yards in the loss. Mitchell had 35 catches for 498yards and two touchdowns in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU {{a chance for a}} first down. Boise was forced to kick the ball away once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. ECU needed just four plays to march 74yards down the field for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. After the touchdown and the extra point kick, ECU led 24–7.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the kickoff, Middle Tennessee quarterback Joe Craddock led an 80-yard, 10-play drive. It included a fake punt that caught Maryland off-guard, which allowed the punter {{to complete a}} 28-yard <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first-down conversion. Craddock ended the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass. On Maryland's second offensive play of the game, Da'Rel Scott broke free for a 63-yard run for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Middle Tennessee re-took the lead with a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Turner threw an interception that was returned 25yards to the Maryland five-yard line, and Middle Tennessee subsequently scored on a rushing play. On Maryland's next possession, Turner completed a short pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey who ran for an 80-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Maryland advanced inside the Middle Tennessee 35-yard line three times, {{but was unable to}} capitalize. Middle Tennessee defenders saved two potential touchdowns with interceptions on their own two-yard line and in the end zone to preserve a Blue Raider victory, 24–14.|$|E

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Auburn {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. The Tigers started the first drive {{of the second half}} at their 22-yard line. Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown alternated carries as Auburn gained 17 yards in their first three plays. Jason Campbell completed a <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> five-yard loss, then, on the fifth play of the drive, completed a 53-yard pass to Anthony Mix. The pass was the longest play of the game, and drove the Tigers inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Three plays later, Campbell connected with Devin Aromashodu on a five-yard pass for the game's first touchdown. With 10:39 remaining in the third quarter, Auburn had taken a 16–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the Tech kickoff {{and returned it}} to their 23-yard line. After an incomplete pass from Rix, Virginia Tech's defense was caught offsides, resulting in a five-yard gain for Florida State. A short run after the penalty gained a first down, but on the first play after the first down, the Seminoles fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's defense, and the Hokies began their second possession {{of the second half}} at the State 31-yard line. Tech was unable to capitalize on the field position, however. Noel threw an incomplete pass, was sacked, then threw a <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> loss of yardage. Tech punted the ball, which was downed at the Florida State 12-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Following Tennessee's touchdown, the {{two teams}} traded possessions, each going three and out. Virginia Tech regained the ball after a Tennessee punt to its 20-yard line with 7:31 {{remaining}} in the quarter. After a Tech fumble that was recovered by the Hokies, Tech running back Dwayne Thomas ran nine yards for the first Tech first down of the game. After an incomplete pass, DeShazo and Thomas connected on an eight-yard pass before Thomas broke free for an 11-yard run and another first down. Thomas continued advancing the ball, picking up eight yards on two rushing plays. DeShazo then completed a four-yard <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first down at the Tennessee 39-yard line. There, however, Tennessee's defense stiffened and did not allow the Hokies another first down. The Tech punt was downed at the Tennessee 7-yard line, where the Volunteers began their third possession of the game.|$|E

5|$|Following the Tech kickoff, Miami began a {{drive at}} its 20-yard line and went three and out. Following the Hurricanes' punt, Tech's offense began work at its 22-yard line. Despite having {{a chance to}} take the lead with a {{successful}} drive, the Hokies also went three and out, punting back to Miami and allowing the Hurricanes to begin a possession at their 33-yard line. This possession was more successful than Miami's first of the second half. Kelly ran for four yards, then completed a six-yard <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first down. Tech committed a 15-yard grabbing-the-facemask penalty, and Kelly completed a 15-yard pass that pushed the Miami offense to the Tech 22-yard line. Young picked up 12 yards and a first down with a rush to the left, but Kelly was sacked for a loss of 13 yards, negating the gain. Unable to gain another first down or a touchdown, Miami was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. The 31-yard attempt was good, and Miami expanded its lead to 1710 with 29 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
5|$|Hamlett {{was signed}} to the Cleveland Browns' {{practice}} squad on December 8, 2015. He signed a reserve/future {{contract with the}} team on January 5, 2016. He was released by the Browns on September 3 and was signed to the team's practice squad on September 4. He was promoted to the active roster on October 4. He made his NFL debut, and first career start, against the New England Patriots on October 9 and recorded one reception, a 17-yard touchdown pass from Charlie Whitehurst. The Browns waived Hamlett on October 31. He was re-signed to the practice squad on November 2, 2016. He played in 3 games, starting 2, during the 2016 season and caught 1 <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 17-yard touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's offense began {{play from}} the Hoosiers' 34-yard line {{following}} the kick. Paci scrambled for several yards, then completed a <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first {{down at the}} 50-yard line. On the next play, however, Paci fumbled the ball, which bounced {{into the hands of}} Tech defensive end Lawrence Lewis, who returned it 20yards for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Tech a 2113 lead with 23 seconds remaining before halftime. Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech 42-yard line, potentially setting up an Indiana field goal try before halftime. Paci completed a pass to the 36-yard line, and the few seconds remaining in the first half apparently ran off the clock before Indiana could use its final timeout to stop the clock.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{dominated}} in {{all aspects}} of the game and defeated Minnesota 58–0. In the first quarter Vincent Smith ran in a three-yard touchdown, which was followed by a Denard Robinson nine-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter Drew Dileo caught a 17-yard pass from Vincent Smith, which was followed by a Vincent Smith 28-yard touchdown reception, his second touchdown of the game. Michigan's next scoring play came on a 25-yard field goal by Brendan Gibbons. Just before halftime, Kevin Koger caught an 18-yard <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. After the break, Fitzgerald Touissant rushed for a one-yard touchdown. Next came two more field goals from Gibbons: first from 32 yards, then in the fourth quarter from 38 yards. Michigan scored its final points when Courtney Avery picked up a Minnesota fumble and ran it back 83 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Tech's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 15-yard line, and the Crimson Tide began a new drive. On the drive's first play, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Following the penalty, Alexander was stopped for a two-yard loss. Zow then completed a 40-yard <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first down at the Tech 43-yard line. After that long completion, he threw an 11-yard pass for another first down, this time at the Tech 32-yard line. A rushing play was stopped for no gain, Zow threw an incomplete pass into the end zone, then Zow committed an intentional grounding penalty {{in an attempt to}} avoid being sacked. The penalty pushed Alabama out of field goal range, and Alabama punted from the Tech 45-yard line.|$|E
