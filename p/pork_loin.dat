40|$|Abstract Background The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the effects of persimmon peel (PPM) supplementation on carcass performance, pork quality, eating quality, fatty acid composition, and cholesterol concentration of the porcine longissimus dorsi muscle. Results No adverse effects of PPM supplementation were observed on carcass and meat quality characteristics among the treatment groups (P[*]>[*] 0. 05), whereas <b>pork</b> <b>loins</b> from pigs fed a diet supplemented with 0. 9  % persimmon peel (T 3) showed more tender meat than did <b>pork</b> <b>loins</b> from pigs fed a control diet (P[*]<[*] 0. 01), even though no significant difference was observed between the control and T 1 group. The T 3 group had higher ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids relative to saturated fatty acids (0. 33 vs. 0. 28, P[*]<[*] 0. 05) and lower total cholesterol concentration (94. 4 vs. 99. 1  mg/g, P[*]<[*] 0. 05) compared to the control group. Persimmon peel appeared to have beneficial effects on fatty acid composition and cholesterol concentration, probably leading to a hypocholesterolemic effect. Conclusions Animal diets fortified with persimmon peel represents an efficient and useful method for improving the nutritional quality of pork without impairing growth performance and eating quality properties...|$|R

40|$|Intramuscular fat {{and meat}} quality Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is {{attracting}} increasingly more attention in swine breeding especially {{because it is}} also positively correlated with eating attributes of pork, such as juiciness, tenderness and flavour (Bejerholm and Barton-Gode 1986; Eikelenboom et al. 1996). Pork consumers have clearly demonstrated a preference for intramuscular fat when rating pork in blind taste panel tests (NPPC 1996). Research has shown that average IMF measured through chemical analysis lines up very well with marbling scores. Marbling is also negatively related to the incidence of pale, soft, exudative (PSE) pork (Jones et al., 1994). <b>Pork</b> <b>loins</b> must have at least 2 % fat in lean meat, else, the cooked meat will be too dry and tasteless (Meadus, 2000). In earlier studies, Bejerholm and Barton-Gode (1986) identified a threshold value of 2 % intramuscular fat for optimal tenderness. According to a US study (De Vol et al., 1988), the threshold level was 2. 5 - 3 %. European scientists also believe at least 2 % IMF is needed to produce consumer acceptable <b>pork</b> <b>loins</b> (See et al. 1995).

40|$|Translocation of {{foodborne}} pathogens {{into the interior}} tissues of pork through moisture enhancement may be of concern if the meat is undercooked. In the present study, a five-strain mixture of Campylobacter jejuni orSalmonella enterica Typhimurium was evenly spread {{on the surface of}} fresh <b>pork</b> <b>loins.</b> <b>Pork</b> <b>loins</b> were injected, sliced, vacuum packaged, and stored. After storage, sliced pork was cooked by traditional grilling. Survival ofSalmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni in the interior tissues of the samples were analyzed by enumeration. The populations of these pathogens dropped below the detection limit (10 colony-forming units/g) in most samples that were cooked to 71. 1 °C or above. The general linear mixed model procedure was used to model the association between risk factors and the presence/absence of these pathogens after cooking. Estimated regression coefficients associated with the fixed effects indicated that the recovery probability of Salmonella Typhimurium was negatively associated with increasing level of enhancement. The effects of moisture enhancement and cooking on the recovery probability of C. jejuni were moderated by storage temperature.
