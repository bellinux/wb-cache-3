The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, <b>probing</b> under loose bark and in crevices, <b>probing</b> woody fruits of Black Oak, <b>probing</b> flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} <b>probing</b> {{and double}} hashing, linear <b>probing</b> {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear <b>probing</b> searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E

40|$|Gene-specific {{oligonucleotide}} <b>probes</b> {{are currently}} used in microarrays to avoid cross-hybridization of highly similar sequences. We developed {{an approach to}} determine the optimal number and length of gene-specific <b>probes</b> for accurate transcriptional profiling studies. The study surveyed <b>probe</b> lengths from 25 to 1000 nt. Long <b>probes</b> yield better signal intensity than short <b>probes.</b> The signal intensity of short <b>probes</b> can be improved by addition of spacers or using higher <b>probe</b> concentration for spotting. We also found that accurate gene expression measurement can be achieved with multiple <b>probes</b> per gene and fewer <b>probes</b> are needed if longer <b>probes</b> rather than shorter <b>probes</b> are used. Based on theoretical considerations that were confirmed experimentally, our results showed that 150 mer is the optimal <b>probe</b> length for expression measurement. Gene-specific <b>probes</b> can be identified using a computational approach for 150 mer <b>probes</b> {{and they can be}} treated like long cDNA <b>probes</b> in terms of the hybridization reaction for high sensitivity detection. Our experimental data also show that <b>probes</b> which do not generate good signal intensity give erroneous expression ratio measurement results. To use microarray <b>probes</b> without experimental validation, gene-specific <b>probes</b> ∼ 150 mer in length are necessary. However, shorter oligonucleotide <b>probes</b> also work well in gene expression analysis if the <b>probes</b> are validated by experimental selection or if multiple <b>probes</b> per gene are used for expression measurement...|$|R

5|$|Because linear <b>probing</b> is {{especially}} sensitive to unevenly distributed hash values, {{it is important}} to combine it with a high-quality hash function that does not produce such irregularities.|$|E
5|$|Linear <b>probing</b> {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, {{it can provide}} very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear <b>probing</b> can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic <b>probing,</b> where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Probing is a {{promising}} approach for network monitoring. An important problem {{that needs to}} be addressed while developing probing-based solutions is the selection of <b>probe</b> station nodes. <b>Probe</b> station nodes are the nodes that are instrumented with the functionality of sending <b>probes</b> and analyz-ing <b>probe</b> results. The placement of <b>probe</b> stations affects the diagnosis capability of the <b>probes</b> sent by the <b>probe</b> stations. The <b>probe</b> station placement also involves the overhead of instrumentation. Thus it is important to minimize the required number of <b>probe</b> stations without compromising on the required diagnosis capability of the <b>probes.</b> In this paper, we present a novel reduction of the Minimum <b>Probe</b> Station Selection problem to the Minimum Hitting Set problem.

40|$|We have {{developed}} novel <b>probe</b> systems for real-time PCR that provide higher specificity, greater sensitivity, and lower cost relative to dual-labeled <b>probes.</b> The seven DNA Detection Switch (DDS) -probe systems reported here employ two interacting polynucleotide components: a fluorescently labeled <b>probe</b> and a quencher antiprobe. High-fidelity detection is achieved with three DDS designs: two internal <b>probes</b> (internal DDS and Flip <b>probes)</b> and a primer <b>probe</b> (ZIPR <b>probe),</b> wherein each <b>probe</b> {{is combined with}} a carefully engineered, slightly mismatched, error-checking antiprobe.

Other designs (Universal <b>probe,</b> Half-Universal <b>probe,</b> and MacMan <b>probe)</b> use generic components that enable low-cost detection. Finally, single-molecule G-Force <b>probes</b> employ guanine-mediated fluorescent quenching by forming a hairpin between adjacent C-rich and G-rich sequences.
