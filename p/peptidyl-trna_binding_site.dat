40|$|Bromoacetyl-phenylalanyl-tRNAphe {{bound to}} 70 S E. coli ribosomes reacts covalently with {{proteins}} of the 50 S subunit. The major reactions are with proteins L 2 and L 27. In {{the presence of}} poly(U), 70 S-bound bromoacetyl-phenylalanyl-tRNAphe can participate in peptidebond formation with phenylalanyl-tRNAphe or puromycin. Most of the products of these reactions are also found covalently attached to L 2 and L 27. Chloramphenicol and sparsomycin markedly inhibit the peptide-bond formation. These results strongly suggest that bromoacetylphenylalanyl-tRNAphe can function as a normal peptidyl-tRNA and that the 50 S proteins, L 2 and L 27, {{are located in the}} <b>peptidyl-tRNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site.</b> The side reactions of bromoacetyl-phenylalanyl-tRNAphe are with one or more 50 S proteins from the set L 14 - 17, L 6 and/or L 11, and L 26.

We describe structures of the intact bacterial ribosome from Escherichia coli that reveal how the ribosome binds tRNA in two functionally distinct states, determined to a resolution of ~ 3. 2 angstroms by means of x-ray crystallography.

40|$|During the {{stationary}} growth phase, Escherichia coli 70 S ribosomes are {{converted to}} 100 S ribosomes, and translations! activity is lost. This conversion {{is caused by}} the bind-ing of the ribosome modulation factor (RMF) to 70 S ribosomes. In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which 100 S ribosomes form and translational inactivation occurs, the shape of the 100 S ribosome and the RMF ribosomal binding site were investigated by electron microscopy and protein-protein cross-Unking, respectively. We show that (i) the 100 S ribosome is formed by the dimerization of two 70 S ribosomes mediated by face-to-face contacts between their constituent 30 S subunits, and (ii) RMF binds near the ribo-somal proteins S 13, L 13, and L 2. The positions of these proteins indicate that the RMF binding site is near the peptidyl transferase center or the P site (<b>peptidyl-tRNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site).</b> These observations are consistent with the translational inactivation of the ribo-some by RMF binding. After the "Recycling " stage, ribosomes can readily proceed to the "Initiation " stage during exponential growth, but during stationary phase, the majority of 70 S ribosomes are stored as 100 S ribosomes and are translationally inactive.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} rabbit liver ribosomes and their {{subunits}} to form complexes with {{different forms of}} tRNAPhe (aminoacyl-, peptidyl- and deacylated) was studied using the nitrocellulose membrane filtration technique.

The number of tRNA <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> on 80 S ribosomes or 40 S subunits is constant at different Mg 2 + concentrations (5 – 20 mM). Double reciprocal or Scatchard plot analysis indicates that the binding of Ac-Phe-tRNAPhe to the ribosomal sites is a cooperative process.

40|$|Two genes specifying model mRNAs of minimal {{size and}} coding capacity, {{with or without}} the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, were assembled, cloned, and {{transcribed}} in high yields. These mRNAs, as well as synthetic polynucleotides, phage MS 2 RNA, and a deoxyoctanucleotide complementary to the 3 ' end of 16 S rRNA were used to study the mechanism of translation initiation in vitro. Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits interact with all these nucleic acids, albeit with different affinities; the affinity for the mRNA with the SD sequence (Ka approximately 2 x 10 (7) M- 1) is more than an order of magnitude higher than that for the mRNA lacking this sequence. The initiation factors are equally required, regardless of the presence of the SD sequence, for 30 S and 70 S initiation complex formation and for mRNA translation, but the initiation factors do not affect the SD interaction or the binding of the mRNAs to the ribosomes. The SD interaction is also mechanistically irrelevant for 30 S initiation complex formation and is not essential for translation in vitro or for the selection of the mRNA reading frame. It is suggested that the function of the SD interaction is to ensure a high concentration of the initiation triplet near the ribosomal <b>peptidyl-tRNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site,</b> whereas the selection of the translational start is achieved kinetically, {{under the influence of the}} initiation factors, during decoding of the initiator tRNA...|$|E
40|$|The E site (exit {{site for}} deacyl-tRNA) {{has been shown}} to be allosterically linked to the A site (aminoacyl-tRNA binding site), in that {{occupation}} of the E site reduces the affinity of the A site, and vice versa, whereas the intervening <b>peptidyl-tRNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> (P site) keeps its high affinity. Here the question is analysed of whether or not the low affinity state of the A site caused by an occupied E site is of importance for the ribosomal accuracy of the aminoacyl-tRNA selection. In a poly(U) dependent system with high accuracy in poly(Phe) synthesis, the acceptance of the cognate ternary complex Phe-tRNA [...] EF-Tu [...] GTP (which has the correct anticodon with respect to the codon at the A site) was compared with the competing acceptance of ternary complexes with near-cognate Leu-tRNA(Leu) (which has a similar anticodon) or non-cognate Asp-tRNA(Asp) (which has a dissimilar anticodon), by monitoring the formation of AcPhePhe, AcPheLeu or AcPheAsp, respectively. Cognate (but not near-cognate) occupation of the E site reduced synthesis of the 'wrong' dipeptide AcPheLeu only marginally relative to that of the cognate AcPhe 2, whereas the formation of AcPheAsp was decreased as much as 14 -fold, thereby reducing it to the background level. It follows that the allosteric interplay between E and A sites, i. e. the low affinity of the A site induced by the occupation of the E site, excludes the interference of non-cognate complexes in the decoding process and thus reduces the number of aminoacyl-tRNA species competing for A site binding by an order of magnitude.

50|$|The sliding-rebinding model {{differs from}} the {{allosteric}} model in that the allosteric model posits that only one <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> exists and can be altered, but the sliding-rebinding model states that multiple <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> exist and aren’t changed by EGF extension. Rather, in the bent conformation which is favored at low applied forces, the applied force is perpendicular {{to the line of}} possible <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> Thus, when the association between ligand and lectin domain is interrupted, the bond quickly dissociates. At larger applied forces, however, the protein is extended and the line of possible <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> is aligned with the applied force, allowing the ligand to quickly re-associate with a new <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> after the initial interaction is disrupted. With multiple <b>binding</b> <b>sites,</b> and even the ability to re-associate with the original <b>binding</b> <b>site,</b> the rate of ligand dissociation would be decreased as is typical of catch bonds.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{receptor}} autoradiography {{was used}} to determine the distribution of excitatory amino acid <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> in the basal ganglia of rat brain. [alpha]-Amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionic acid,, kainate, quisqualate-sensitive metabotropic and, non-kainate, non-quisqualate glutamate <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> had their highest density in striatum, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. Kainate binding was higher in the lateral striatum but there was no medial-lateral striatal gradient for other <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> and [alpha]-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionic acid <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> were most dense in the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. There was no dorsal-ventral gradient within the striatal complex for the other <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> Other regions of the basal ganglia had lower densities of ligand binding. To compare <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> density within non-striatal regions, binding for each ligand was normalized to the striatal binding density. When compared to the striatal complex, [alpha]-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionic acid and metabotropic <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> had higher relative density in the globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, and subthalamic nucleus than other <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> Metabotropic <b>binding</b> also had a high relative density in the substantia nigra., non-kainate, non-quisqualate glutamate <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> had a high relative density in globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, and substantia nigra. <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> had a low relative density in pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Our data indicate heterogeneous distribution of excitatory amino acid <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> within rat basal ganglia and suggest that the character of excitatory amino acid-mediated neurotransmission within the basal ganglia is also heterogeneous...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{members of}} the phytotropin class of auxin {{transport}} inhibitors are shown to bind with high affinity to the known naphthylphthalamic acid <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> in maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles. The <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> is, thus, a phytotropin <b>binding</b> <b>site.</b> In general, the degree of binding correlates with the phytotropin structure activity rules and with physiological activities of model compounds. It is argued that the <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> may be a receptor, and it also may be the receptor involved in {{the control of the}} auxin transport process. The possibility is raised that the <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> may be intrinsic receptors for endoanalog(s) of the phytotropins...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{regulation}} is mainly obtained by transcription factors that bind sequencespecific <b>binding</b> <b>sites,</b> {{and control the}} expression of nearby genes. By modeling such sites one can scan regulatory regions, searching for putative <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> of a specific factor, thus constructing a genome-wide regulatory network. Recently, several works demonstrated the importance of rich probabilistic models that capture inner-dependencies within <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> Here we present a general, accurate and efficient method for estimating the statistical significance of putative <b>binding</b> <b>sites,</b> applicable to any probabilistic <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> model. Finally, we demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} method using synthetic and real-life data...|$|R
40|$|Summary. FSH plus insulin, cortisol, and {{thyroxine}} (IFT) stimulated {{incorporation of}} dense isotope-containing (2 H, 13 C, 15 N) amino acids into soluble 125 I-labelled hCG <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> Evidence of new synthesis of <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> appeared {{as early as}} 3 h after {{the beginning of the}} pulse-labelling period. By 48 h the majority of detectable soluble 125 I-labelled hCG <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> appeared to be newly synthesized. Studies with FSH + IFT and puromycin indicated that FSH + IFT stimulated synthesis of new LH/hCG <b>binding</b> <b>sites,</b> and that internalization or degradation of LH/hCG <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> may also require protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the specificity of Src homology 2 (SH 2) and phosphotyrosine-binding domain interactions are mediated by phosphorylated tyrosines and their neighboring amino acids. Two of the first phosphotyrosine-based <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> were found on middle T antigen of polyoma virus. Tyr- 250 acts as a <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> for ShcA, whereas Tyr- 315 forms a <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> for the SH 2 domain of the p 85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. However, genetic analysis of a given phosphotyrosine's role in signaling can be complicated when it serves as a <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> for multiple proteins. The situation is particularly difficult when the phosphotyrosine serves as a secondary <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> for a protein with primary binding determinates elsewhere. Mutation of a tyrosine residue to phenylalanine blocks association of all bound proteins. Here we show that the mutation of the amino acids following the phosphorylated tyrosine to alanine can reveal phosphotyrosine function as a secondary <b>binding</b> <b>site,</b> while abrogating the phosphotyrosine motif's role as a primary <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> for SH 2 domains. We tested this methodology by using middle T antigen. Our results suggest that Tyr- 250 is a secondary <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> for phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, whereas Tyr- 315 is a secondary <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> for a yet-to-be-identified protein, which is critical for transformation...|$|R
