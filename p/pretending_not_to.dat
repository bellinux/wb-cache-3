5|$|Returning home, JJ {{sees his}} mother, Cecilia (Juliet Cowan), {{overwhelmed}} {{by all of}} his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook {{to tell him how}} he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). <b>Pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club where British electronica duo You Love Her Coz She's Dead are playing, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs.|$|E
500|$|At Derek's loft, {{he tells}} Karen {{he needs to}} see [...] "everything you've got," [...] a come-on that {{momentarily}} panics Karen. Derek accuses her of playing the innocent and <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know why she was invited to the director's loft {{in the middle of}} the night. She retreats to the bathroom and gathers her nerves. When she comes back, she is in nothing but his shirt and, singing [...] "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" [...] as Marilyn, she climbs into his lap, straddling him, then pulls away and says [...] "not gonna happen". The next day, Karen and Ivy go to their callback singing [...] "Let Me Be Your Star", which closes out the episode.|$|E
500|$|Another {{account in}} this series is [...] "Ivan Turbincă", whose protagonist, a Russian serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and {{ultimately}} accomplishing the human ideal of cheating Death. The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and Ukrainian folklore, while, according to researcher of children's literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to German tradition's Till Eulenspiegel. In {{the beginning of the}} account, God rewards the soldier's exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (turbincă), which can miraculously trap anything in existence. In order to circumvent the laws of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> understand the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside. Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised an eternity of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to feel sad.|$|E

2500|$|He is Arkas {{the son of}} Kallisto and Zeus, and {{he lived}} in the country about Lykaion. After Zeus had seduced Kallisto, Lykaon, <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know of the matter, entertained Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe [...] which he had cut up.|$|E
2500|$|The main hiatus at {{that time}} was between British and French archaeology, as the latter had already {{discovered}} the gap 20 years earlier and had already considered three answers and arrived at one solution, the modern. Whether Brown did not know or was <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know is unclear. In 1872, the very year of Evans' publication, Mortillet had presented the gap to the Congrès international d'Anthropologie at Brussels: ...|$|E
2500|$|Otello {{enters the}} room; Iago, <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice him, {{says that he}} is deeply troubled. Cassio sees Otello from afar and goes discreetly away. Otello asks what's wrong, but Iago gives only vague answers. Finally, he hints that Cassio and Desdemona are having an affair. Otello begins to get suspicious, but {{declares}} that he needs proof before believing that Desdemona has been unfaithful. (Iago, Otello: Ciò m'accora... Che parli? / [...] "That worries me..." [...] "What did you say?") Iago warns Otello against jealousy, but also advises him to be vigilant.|$|E

60|$|As he <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see me, I <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see him. It {{was a very}} lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, {{because we}} both went into the coffee-room, where he had just {{finished}} his breakfast, and where I ordered mine. It was poisonous to me {{to see him in}} the town, for I very well knew why he had come there.|$|R
2500|$|... "Aristocratic cool", {{known as}} sprezzatura, has existed in Europe for centuries, {{particularly}} when relating to frank amorality and love or illicit pleasures behind closed doors; Raphael's [...] "Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione" [...] and Leonardo da Vinci's [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] are classic examples of sprezzatura. The sprezzatura of the Mona Lisa {{is seen in}} both her smile and the positioning of her hands. Both the smile and hands are intended to convey her grandeur, self-confidence and societal position. Sprezzatura means, literally, disdain and detachment. It {{is the art of}} refraining from the appearance of trying to present oneself in a particular way. In reality, of course, tremendous exertion went into <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> bother or care.|$|E
2500|$|... "La Paiva", as Lachmann {{became known}} after her second marriage, crossed paths in 1852 with the 22-year-old Prussian {{industrialist}} and mining magnate Count Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck. They {{met at a}} party given by the Prussian consul in Paris, and according to Count Viel-Castel, she pursued him across Europe, <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be interested in him but always managing {{to be in the}} same city at the same time and at the same social events. The young Reichsgraf was smitten and, upon meeting her again in Berlin, offered to make La Paiva his mistress and declared that, if she agreed, she would share his fortune. La Paiva, who craved riches more than anything, was reported to have said, after settling down with the count, [...] "All my wishes have come to heel, like tame dogs!" ...|$|E
