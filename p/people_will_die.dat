500|$|In September 2011, Tripathi {{confirmed}} {{that from the}} next month he would start penning the third installment of the trilogy, The Oath of the Vayuputras. In January 2013, {{it was revealed that}} The Oath of the Vayuputras would be released on 27 February of the same year, by Westland Publishing. Tripathi explained that {{the final version of the}} book was longer than he had expected it to be, and consisted of 53chapters, making it twice as long as the other books. During an interview with The Times of India, the author discussed some of the important scenarios being presented in the book. He explained that since Shiva is a mortal in his series, he would have a fitting epilogue in the book, with many of the loose ends of the plot finally being deciphered. Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. [...] "Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing someone we love? The Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go quietly into the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good. So yes, <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>die</b> in Vayuputras," [...] he concluded.|$|E

25|$|In these extreme situations, {{any medical}} care given to <b>people</b> who <b>will</b> <b>die</b> anyway can be {{considered}} to be care withdrawn from others who might have survived (or perhaps suffered less severe disability from their injuries) had they been treated instead.

2500|$|After his reappearance Shia eschatology {{predicts that}} the Mahdi will do battle against Dajjal and Sufyani. After this battle it is {{believed}} that the Imam Mahdi will be joined by the return of Christ, and of the Imam Husayn, along with other historical figures such as the prophets and saints of the past. The return of these historical figures will herald the beginning of the Last Judgment. The purpose of this return is the establishment of justice for those who were oppressed and died oppressed: the oppressors are punished directly by the oppressed during this future reappearance. [...] Shias base this belief on several verses in the Quran where it is mentioned that some <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>die</b> twice and live twice.|$|E
2500|$|In The Population Bomb's opening {{lines the}} authors state {{that nothing can}} prevent famines in which {{hundreds}} of millions of <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>die</b> during the 1970s (amended to 1970s and 80s in later editions), and that there would be [...] "a substantial increase in the world death rate." [...] Although many lives could be saved through dramatic action, {{it was already too late}} to prevent a substantial increase in the global death rate. However, in reality the global death rate has continued to decline substantially since then, from 13/1000 in 1965–74 to 10/1000 from 1985–1990. Meanwhile, the population of the world has more than doubled, while calories consumed/person have increased 24%. The UN does not keep official death-by-hunger statistics so it is hard to measure whether the [...] "{{hundreds of millions of}} deaths" [...] number is correct. Ehrlich himself suggested in 2009 that between 200-300 million had died of hunger since 1968. However, that is measured over 40 years rather than the ten to twenty foreseen in the book, so it can be seen as significantly fewer than predicted.|$|E
50|$|The {{explanation}} for this effect according to FTT is that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> tend to operate on the simplest gist that is permitted to make a decision. In {{the case of this}} framing question, the gain frame presents a situation in which people prefer the gist of some people being saved to the possibility that some are saved or no one could be saved, and conversely, that the possibility of some people dying or no one dying is preferable to the option that some <b>people</b> <b>will</b> surely <b>die.</b>|$|R

6000|$|A nation, however, as it {{confronts the}} modern world, is a purely spiritual product. Sometimes {{it has been}} born in independence, like Scotland. Sometimes it has been born in dependence, in subjugation, like Ireland. Sometimes it is a large thing cohering out of many smaller things, like Italy. Sometimes {{it is a small}} thing {{breaking}} away from larger things, like Poland. But in each and every case its quality is purely spiritual, or, if you will, purely psychological. It is a moment when five men become a sixth man. Every one knows it who has ever founded a club. It is a moment when five places become one place. Every one must know it who has ever had to repel an invasion.
