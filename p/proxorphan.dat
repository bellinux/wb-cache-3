50|$|<b>Proxorphan</b> (INN), {{also known}} as <b>proxorphan</b> tartate (USAN) (developmental code name BL-5572M), is an opioid {{analgesic}} and antitussive drug of the morphinan family that was never marketed. It acts preferentially as a κ-opioid receptor partial agonist {{and to a lesser}} extent as a μ-opioid receptor partial agonist.|$|E
5000|$|Ketorfanol (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} SBW-22), or ketorphanol, is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan family {{that was found}} to possess [...] "potent antiwrithing activity" [...] in animal assays but was never marketed. It is a 17-cycloalkylmethyl derivative of morphinan and as such, is closely related structurally to butorphanol, cyclorphan, oxilorphan, <b>proxorphan,</b> and xorphanol, which act preferentially as κ-opioid receptor agonists {{and to a lesser}} extent as μ-opioid receptor partial agonists/antagonists.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{material}} for this preparation is ketoester 1, available {{by one of the}} classical benzomorphan syntheses. Condensation with the ylide from Triethyl phosphonoacetate (HWE reaction) affords diester 2. Catalytic hydrogenation proceeds from the less hindered face to afford the corresponding saturated diester (3). The esters are then reduced by means of LiAlH4 to give the glycol (4); this undergoes internal ether formation on treatment with acid to form the pyran ring of 5. Von Braun reaction with BrCN (or ethyl chloroformate) followed by saponification of the intermediate leads to the 2° amine (6). This is converted to the cyclopropylmethyl derivative 8 by acylation with cyclopropylcarbonyl chloride followed by reduction of the thus formed amide (7) with LiAlH4. Cleave of the O-methyl ether with sodium Ethanethiol affords <b>proxorphan</b> (9).|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a series of opiold drugs on urine output in the water-loaded rat were studied and also the block of those effects by the {{irreversible}} opiold receptor antagonist, j 3 -funaltrexamine (8 -FNA). Fentanyl, d-propoxyphene, profadol, bromadoline, bu-prenorphine and nalbuphine produced only a decrease in unne output, which was antagonised by pretreatment with $-FNA, 40 mg/kg s. c., 24 hr beforehand. These drugs were thus character-ized as selective mu receptor agonists. U- 50, 488, tifluadom, Mr 2034, <b>proxorphan,</b> ethylketocydazocine and butOrphanOl aN produced an initial decrease in unne output, which was antago-nized by f 3 -FNA, and therefore probably mu receptor mediated, followed by a 13 -FNA insensitive diuretic effect, which was prob-aty kappa receptor mediated. For U- 50, 488, tifluadom, Mr 2034 and <b>proxorphan</b> the threshold dose for increasing unne outpu...|$|E
40|$|The {{irreversible}} inhibitor of mu-opioid receptor-mediated effects, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), {{was used}} to investigate the selectivity of various opioid agonists at mu-opioid receptors in the electrically stimulated guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens preparations in vitro. In the guinea-pig ileum, pretreatment with beta-FNA (3 X 10 (- 8) - 3 X 10 (- 6) M) produced a concentration-dependent antagonism of the inhibitory effect produced by the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Gly(ol) 5]enkephalin (DAGO). High concentrations of beta-FNA (3 X 10 (- 6) - 1 X 10 (- 5) M) also antagonized the inhibitory effects of the kappa-opioid agonist U 50488. Pretreatment of guinea-pig ileum with beta-FNA at 1 X 10 (- 6) M resulted in blockade {{of the effect of}} some opioid agonists. The compounds which showed the largest rightward shifts in their concentration-response curves, and hence the greatest mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity, were nalbuphine, [D-Ser 2, Leu 5]enkephalinyl-Thr 6 (DSLET), morphine, DAGO and normorphine. Responses to tifluadom, Mr 2034, ethylketocyclazocine, butorphanol, nalorphine, <b>proxorphan</b> and U 50488 were not inhibited by beta-FNA. In the mouse vas deferens, pre-treatment with beta-FNA (1 X 10 (- 6) M) produced a similar shift in the dose-response curves for normorphine as in the guinea-pig ileum. The concentration-response curves for the delta-receptor agonists [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5] enkephalin (DADLE) and DSLET were, however, also shifted, indicating that beta-FNA will also block delta-opioid receptors. Since beta-FNA does not block kappa-opioid receptor-mediated effects, it can be used in the guinea-pig ileum preparation as a selective mu-receptor inhibitor. However, its lack of selectivity between mu- and delta-opioid receptors should be taken into account in many other isolated tissues and experiments in vivo...|$|E
