50|$|In North America, semaphores were {{employed}} as train order signals, {{with the purpose}} of indicating to engineers whether they should stop to receive a telegraphed order. It was common for train order signals to point the arm straight down to indicate 'proceed'. Train order signals were typically located at the station building, with a tall common <b>post</b> <b>mounting</b> signal arms facing in opposing directions.|$|E
50|$|When {{multiple}} {{tracks are}} involved, or where space {{does not permit}} <b>post</b> <b>mounting,</b> other forms are found. In double track territory one may find two signals mounted {{side by side on}} a bracket which itself is mounted on a post. The left hand signal then controls the left-hand track, and the right signal the right-hand track. A gantry or signal bridge may also be used. This consists of a platform extending over the tracks; the signals are mounted on this platform over the tracks they control.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of <b>post</b> <b>mounts</b> {{is that the}} bolt is threaded directly into the fork lowers. If the threads are stripped or if the bolt is stuck, then the threads {{will need to be}} repaired, or the seized bolt drilled out. Frame manufacturers have standardized the IS mount for the rear disc brake mount. In recent years <b>post</b> <b>mount</b> has gained ground and is becoming more common. This is mostly due to decreased manufacturing and part cost for the brake calipers when using <b>post</b> <b>mount.</b> A limitation of the mount is that the location of the rotor is more constrained: it is possible to encounter incompatible hub/fork combinations, where the rotor is out of range.|$|R

50|$|The Frank Wilbur House is an {{historic}} house at 1273 Park Avenue in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, USA.

50|$|Bitts are paired {{vertical}} wooden or iron <b>posts</b> <b>mounted</b> either {{aboard a}} ship or on a wharf, pier or quay. The posts {{are used to}} secure mooring lines, ropes, hawsers, or cables. Bitts aboard wooden sailing ships (sometime called cable-bitts) were large vertical timbers mortised into the keel and used as the anchor cable attachment point. Bitts are carefully manufactured and maintained to avoid any sharp edges which might chafe and weaken the mooring lines.|$|R

50|$|A noria in {{contrast}} uses the water power {{obtained from the}} flow of a river. The noria consists of a large, very narrow undershot water-wheel, whose rim {{is made up of}} a series of containers which lift water from the river to a very small aqueduct {{at the top of the}} wheel. In this it is very similar to the one type of sakia without a pot-garland, with the <b>posts</b> <b>mounted</b> directly on the wheel, thus the widespread confusion.|$|R

An ell extends to the rear from the center, and a gable-roofed portico extends over the front entry, supported by decorative classically inspired <b>posts</b> <b>mounted</b> on paneled pedestals. The house, built in 1872, harkened back to the Greek Revival which was popular before the American Civil War. It was built by a local businessman from the prominent Edmiston family.|$|R

50|$|A ghost ring {{can also}} take form of a tube ranging from 3 to 6 cm long, with the <b>post</b> <b>mounted</b> at the inside end of the tube. This type of ghost ring is used when {{there can be no}} front sight at {{the front end of the}} barrel. It is {{slightly}} slower to use, because the shooter's eye has to focus close on the post, then focus on the target. However, in situations when extremely fast sighting is required, the shooter can simply look through the tube, and it is simple to see if the view is straight down the tube.|$|R
5000|$|M151A2 FAV - Fast Assault Vehicle variant {{designed}} to be carried inside a CH-53 helicopter. Modification mainly involves adding a combination radiator grille armor plate and spare tire carrier, a field radio bracket between the front seats, roll bars or roll-cage, and high-beam lights. It has a heavy weapons pedestal <b>mount</b> <b>post</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear deck (capable of carrying a Browning M2HB, Mark 19 Automatic Grenade Launcher or TOW II Missile).

40|$|Vertical delineators are {{intended}} to warn drivers of an approaching curve while providing them with a better appreciation of the sharpness of a curve. Drivers can then select an appropriate speed before entering the curve. Delineation can also provide continuous tracking information once drivers are within the curve to help position their vehicles within the travel lane while traversing the curve. The {{most common type of}} vertical delineation is <b>post</b> <b>mounted</b> delineators (PMDs). These devices are usually flexible or rigid posts with some amount of reflective surface mounted along the roadside to provide additional delineation. Another treatment that has been used is to provide additional delineation on chevron posts...|$|R
25|$|A few mills {{looked like}} post mills, {{but were not}} post mills.

Composite mills lack the central post on which {{the body of the}} <b>post</b> mill is <b>mounted</b> and turns upon to enable the mill to face the wind.|$|R

5000|$|Winemaking in Arkansas {{dates back}} to the first French Catholic settlers, and {{commercial}} winemaking started in the 1870s with German and Swiss settlers who came to Altus, Arkansas and found the climate favorable to growing grapes. One of these settlers was Jacob Post, who emigrated to the area in 1872 and his descendants are sixth generation winemakers. The four oldest running wineries in the state (Wiederkehr, <b>Post,</b> <b>Mount</b> Bethel and Cowie) are all located in Altus. At one point Arkansas had 160 wineries and produced more wine and grapes than any other state. Prohibition in the United States reduced the wineries to only a few that remain today, and about half of Arkansas's counties remain dry.|$|R
