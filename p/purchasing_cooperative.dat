40|$|All managed {{competition}} proposals for health system reform must confront several key issues. The premiums paid {{to health care}} <b>purchasing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> {{will need to be}} subsidized for those who cannot pay full fare; the amount and sources of the subsidies are controversial political issues. The payments passed on by <b>purchasing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> to health plans must be risk adjusted to account for differences in the health care needs of their enrolled populations. This is essential to create a level playing field for competition and to eliminate incentives for plans to use risk assessment for attracting enrollees. The data and methods needed for risk adjustment, however, are not adequate at present. The Clinton Administration's plan to limit expenditure increases raises a host of thorny issues. Maintaining quality of care will require health plan quality report cards to be supplemented by external quality assurance systems. Assuring quality will be particularly problematic for traditional indemnity plans. The structure and governance of the system, administration simplification, and other issues need to be addressed. The size and voluntariness of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> greatly influence all of these considerations. Physicians should inform their political representatives on how these issues should be resolved as compromise bills are drafted by the United States Congress this year...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} research {{interests in the}} <b>purchasing</b> group, <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) has not received significant attention from the operations and supply chain management researcher. This study investigates the typical advantages of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> for SME retailers, and critical success factors for managing a purchasing group, using a case study of a purchasing group established by Chinese SME retailers. The study suggests that a successful purchasing group can help SME retailers to survive in today's competitive marketplace. The main advantages of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> for SME retailers are lower purchasing prices, mutual learning and support, dealing with illegal bribes, and quality improvement. The success factors for SME retailers to manage a purchasing group are good guanxi (personal and business relationships) among group members, similar characteristics of group members, similar personality traits of top executives, and the role of a big brother (group leader) in the group. This study also provides practical insights for retail managers to consider when developing a purchasing group in dynamic environments, in order to achieve the benefits of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Â© 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

40|$|Cooperatives can broadly {{be divided}} into {{processing}} and marketing cooperatives on the one hand, and <b>purchasing</b> and supplying <b>cooperatives</b> on the other. In the early economic cooperative literature {{it is suggested that}} a processing cooperative may pursue either one of the following four objectives: a) Maximisation of the net average revenue product, b) Maximisation of the dividend, c) Maximisation of the processing cooperative’s profit, and d) Maximisation of members’ producer surplus plus the cooperative’s profit. The corresponding objectives for <b>purchasing</b> and supplying <b>cooperatives</b> are: e) Minimisation of the purchasing price, f) Maximisation of the dividend, g) Maximisation of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>cooperative’s</b> profit, and h) Maximisation of members’ consumer surplus plus the cooperative’s profit. This article analyses processing cooperative behaviour within a duality framework based on the restricted profit function.

40|$|Procurement is {{considered}} to be a promising area for lowering the costs in the health care sector. Estimates of savings on purchasing prices are 10 to 15 % (Nollet & Beaulieu, 2005). In addition, there may be up to more than 40 % cost savings on the administrative purchasing costs (Schneller, 2000). <b>Cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> is a relatively new strategy aimed at reducing costs in healthcare. Purchasing cooperation initiatives frequently fail. Previous studies have tried to explain the failures of purchasing groups. However, these studies report mixed findings and call for further research. Most studies on <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> are qualitative and explorative by nature, which limits their generalizability. By contrast, the present study is set up as a quantitative research aimed at explaining the (lack of) success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> in healthcare. The problem statement is: How can we explain the success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> in healthcare? The literature review resulted in a theoretical framework that includes six hypotheses, mostly derived from Transaction Cost Economics (TCE). Trust, commitment, group formality, IT systems, communication, and teamwork skills were believed to have a significant impact on the success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> The framework includes another set of two hypotheses where a moderating effect of trust and commitment was expected on the relationship between group formality and success. E-mail invitations for a questionnaire were sent to 69 hospitals, active in <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing,</b> covering a total of 17 purchasing groups. A total of 88 valid responses were obtained for the statistical analysis, corresponding to an estimated effective response rate of 24 %. Based on the results of a factor analysis, the Teamwork skills construct was divided in two sub-constructs: “teamwork skills-ideas” (relating to the capability of a team to form and execute plans and ideas) and “teamwork skills-conflict” (relating to the capability of a team to resolve conflicts). The results of a stepwise regression analysis indicated a significant impact of trust, IT systems, and teamwork skills-conflicts on the success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Congruently with most previous studies, trust appears to be the most important factor explaining success. No former study explicitly researched the effect of IT systems on <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> The results of this study suggest the need for good and effective IT systems for the tactical <b>purchasing</b> process of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Apparently, conflict resolution is pivotal for managing a successful purchasing group. This part of teamwork skills was also not addressed before in literature on <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> In <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> groups, there are many situations potentially leading to conflicts, such as, for example, the allocation of savings, time, and costs (Schotanus et al., 2010). Self-interest and opportunism will cause conflicts. Quick resolution of conflicts is found to be very important in the present study. The present study has some limitations that could be seen as a point of departure for further research. The sample size was relatively small and only perceptions have been measured. Further research could try to incorporate, for instance, financial data in their analysis. Our study suffered from a number of measurement problems limiting the generalizability and validity of the findings. Future research could try to work with more reliable constructs and attempt to find other explanatory variables and/or other (direct and moderating) effects. Finally, future studies within the healthcare sector could investigate other types of organizations beyond hospitals. It would be interesting to replicate the results of the present study in other parts of the public sector, the private sector, both in the Netherlands and abroad...|$|R

40|$|Purpose/Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare food cost and public school foodservice directors’ {{satisfaction}} between districts participating in school foodservice <b>cooperatives</b> or group <b>purchasing</b> arrangements and districts purchasing independently. It also assessed the prevalence of <b>purchasing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in school foodservice and various bid purchasing methods used in school foodservices to solicit and award competitive contracts for food. Methods A random sample (N = 1, 650) of school foodservice directors, stratified by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) region, was surveyed electronically regarding satisfaction with current purchasing methods, food prices currently paid for selected items, and participation in <b>cooperative</b> or group <b>purchasing.</b> Data from completed surveys (n = 453) were analyzed using t-tests and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results Study results showed nearly half of respondents indicated participation in <b>purchasing</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> The majority of cooperative members were from districts with fewer than 5, 000 students. Line-item bids were reported as used most frequently. There was no significant difference in overall satisfaction with <b>purchasing</b> outcomes between <b>cooperative</b> members and nonmembers. Primary reasons identified by district foodservice directors for joining a cooperative were lower costs, increased competition, and reduced paperwork. Among eight selected foods, cooperative members reported significantly (p =. 05) lower prices on three items. Applications to Child Nutrition Professionals Foodservice directors could use data from this study to evaluate their current competitive purchasing. Data from this study could be useful to program directors and school officials in decision making regarding joining a <b>cooperative</b> or <b>purchasing</b> group.
