40|$|Economic {{analyses}} of the greenhouse effect are typically carried out {{within the framework of}} computable general equilibrium models which represent the climate system by simple two box proxies based upon the pioneering work of Nordhaus. Since errors in predicting the carbon budget can imply high costs, there is some need to include more sophisticated climate models into the economics of global climate change. This paper presents a non-linear <b>pulse</b> <b>representation</b> of the process-based and data-validated Bern carbon model. Compared to the Nordhaus approach this leads to different results with respect to optimal climate policy and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. In particular, our results suggest that economic studies which use a Nordhaus representation of the climate system are biased towards high carbon emission and low abatement levels...|$|E

We compare implementation costs and speed of this approach with those of a parallel and a bit-serial implementation. The neural model includes both short- and long-term dynamics. Hence, networks composed of theses neurons solve delayed reinforcement and adaptive timing tasks which has been shown in several real-world applications. 1 Introduction A main motivation of neural hardware is the robustness that results from computing utilizing components' physical properties rather than relying on volatile charges that represent the software in traditional systems. Analog hardware implementations are especially attractive since continuous signals can directly exploit the physics, e. g. by making use of the full bandwidth between a transistor 's ON and OFF state [9]. However, problems like the realization of flexible non-volatile [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have {{developed}} and experimentally evaluated at high-speed, {{a complete set}} of arithmetic circuits (multiply, add, and accumulate) for high performance digital signal processing (DSP). These circuits take advantage of the unique features of the Rapid Single-Flux Quantum (RSFQ) logic/memory family, including fusion of logic and memory functions at the gate level, <b>pulse</b> <b>representation</b> of clock and data, and the ability to maintain inter cell propagation delays using Josephson transmission lines (JTLs). The circuits developed have been successfully used in the implementation of a serial radix 2 butterfly, a decimation digital filter, and of an arithmetic unit for digital beam forming. The 8 × 8 -bit RSFQ multiplier uses a two- level parallel carry- save reduction tree that significantly reduces the multiplier latency. The 80 -GHz carry-save reduction is implemented with asynchronous data-driven wave pipelined [4 : 2] compressors built with toggle flip-flop cells...|$|E

In the neural network systems, outputs and internal values {{are represented by}} pulse train. That is, analog recurrent neural networks with <b>pulse</b> frequency <b>representation</b> are considered. The <b>pulse</b> density <b>representation</b> and the simultaneous perturbation enable the systems with learning capability to easily implement as a hardware system. As typical examples of the recurrent neural networks, Hopfield neural network and the bidirectional associative memory are considered. Details of the systems and the circuit design are described. Analog and digital examples for these Hopfield neural network and the bidirectional associative memory are also shown to confirm a viability of the system configuration and the learning capability...|$|R

In distinguishing from previous treatment, our model is valid at pulse energies well exceeding the saturation energy of absorber. This is achieved by solving the mode-locking master equation in the <b>pulse</b> energy-domain <b>representation.</b> The performances of monolithic sub-picosecond blue-violet GaN mode-locked diode laser in the high-power operation regime are analyzed using the developed approach.

We anticipate that this scheme will outperform other GMSK carrier sync schemes that are derived in a more ad hoc fashion. In view of the fact that the second pulse has significantly less energy than the first, it is also possible that a single <b>pulse</b> stream AMP <b>representation</b> of GMSK is sufficient for satisfactory carrier sync performance thereby reducing the implementation complexity...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{two-dimensional}} one <b>pulse</b> (TOP) <b>representation</b> of magic-angle spinning nuclear Magnetic resonance data of half-integer quadrupolar nuclei has significant advantages over the conventional one-dimensional spectrum. The TOP spectrum, which correlates NMR frequency to spinning sideband order, provides a rapid determination {{of the number of}} sites as well as size of the their quadrupolar coupling. Additionally, synchronous acquisition spectra of the central and satellite transition resonances can be separated by different projections of the TOP spectrum, with higher resolution spectra often found in the satellite transitions projection. A previously perceived problem of centerband aliasing in TOP can be eliminated with an algorithm that uses larger subspectral widths and the sideband order dimension to distinguish centerbands from sidebands...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} {{numerical}} simulations and experiments of pulse self-compression by filamentation. Spectral and temporal evolution during ultrashort-pulse laser filamentation can be intuitively represented using spectrograms, which display spectra at different time delays of a gate <b>pulse.</b> This <b>representation</b> makes evident {{the features of}} self-compression by filamentation, namely spectral broadening and pulse shortening. In addition, it allows for {{an analysis of the}} spectral phase during the nonlinear propagation. In our simulations we observe occurrence of negative chirp over a few cm before the shortest pulse is obtained during filamentation; this provides an important basis for the understanding of the mechanisms leading to self-compressed filaments. We attribute the negative chirp to spatio-temporal reshaping due to the competition between self-phase modulation and group velocity dispersion. We show that the plasma induced dispersion plays a minor role in establishing the negative chirp...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a modular hardware {{artificial neural network}} architecture using the random <b>pulse</b> data <b>representation</b> and processing. In random pulse machine, continuous variables can be represented as a probability of a pulse occurrence at a certain sampling time. Random pulse machines deal with analog variables while using digital technology to perform arithmetic and logic operations on binary pulses which are the information carries. Thus, large systems can be built to perform parallel analog computation on large amounts of input data using this technique. This is a good trade-off between the electronic circuit complexity and the computational accuracy and well suited for VLSI neural network. Simulations have been conducted to validate the performance of both 1 -bit and 2 -bit random pulse neural network. Perception application for linear classification and autoassociative memory for digit recognition are finally presented to illustrate {{the behavior of the}} developed artificial neural network...|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} fish Eigenmannia generates on oscillating weak electric field. The amplitude {{and timing}} information of this electric field is perceived by electroreceptors distributed on its skin. The pathway of timing information, consisting of spherical cells and giant cells, was studied in an in vitro preparation. The giant cells were identified to be endogenous oscillators {{and thus have}} the functional advantage of phase locking more easily to a periodic stimulus with a frequency {{in the range of}} the intrinsic frequency. Their spontaneous rhythmic activity was perturbed by delivering excitatory single pulses or periodic pulses via their synaptic inputs. The regular and irregular dynamics produced by periodic stimulation were discussed {{in the context of a}} mathematical analysis of the response to single <b>pulses.</b> Ambiguous <b>representations</b> of the timing of the stimulus pulse were observed and could be related to this analysis. Some spontaneously firing cells could be silenced with periodic excitatory stimulation in a narrow frequency and amplitude range. Some irregularly firing cells continued to fire periodically for several seconds after phase locking to a periodic stimulus. This study is the first description of an endogenous oscillator in a system devoted to the precise timing of sensory events...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{emissions}} {{have been}} identified as a major source (~ 15 %) of global nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Parameterizations of soil NOx emissions (SNOx) for use in the current generation of chemical transport models were designed to capture mean seasonal behaviour. These parameterizations do not, however, respond quantitatively to the meteorological triggers that result in pulsed SNOx as are widely observed. Here we present a new mechanistic parameterization of SNOx implemented into a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The parameterization represents available nitrogen (N) in soils using biome specific emission factors, online wet- and dry-deposition of N as well as fertilizer and manure N derived from a spatially explicit dataset distributed using seasonality derived from data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. Moreover, it represents the functional form of emissions derived from point measurements and ecosystem scale experiments including pulsing following soil wetting by rain or irrigation, and emissions that are a smooth function of soil moisture. This parameterization yields global above-soil SNOx of 10. 7 Tg N yr− 1 , including 1. 8 Tg N yr− 1 from fertilizer N input (0. 68 % of applied N) and 0. 5 Tg N yr− 1 from atmospheric N deposition. Over the United States Great Plains, SNOx are predicted to comprise 15 – 40 % of the tropospheric NO 2 column and increase column variability by a factor of 2 – 4 during the summer months due to chemical fertilizer application and warm temperatures. SNOx enhancements of 50 – 80 % of the simulated NO 2 column are predicted over the African Sahel during the monsoon onset (April–June). In this region the day-to-day variability of column NO 2 is increased by a factor of 5 due to pulsed-N emissions. We evaluate the model by comparison to observations of the NO 2 column from the OMI instrument. We find the model is able to reproduce observations of pulsed-N induced interannual variability over the US Great Plains. We also show that the OMI mean (median) NO 2 on the overpass following first rainfall over the Sahel is 49 % (23 %) higher than in the five days preceding. The measured NO 2 on the day after rainfall is still 23 % (5 %) higher, providing a direct measure of the pulse's decay time of 1 – 2 days. This is consistent with the <b>pulsing</b> <b>representation</b> used in our parameterization and much shorter than 5 – 14 day pulse decay length used in current models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A discrete-time {{analysis}} of the orthogonal frequency division multiplex/offset QAM (OFDM/OQAM) multicarrier modulation technique, leading to a modulated transmultiplexer, is presented. The conditions of discrete orthogonality are established {{with respect to the}} polyphase components of the OFDM/OQAM prototype filter, which is assumed to be symmetrical and with arbi-trary length. Fast implementation schemes of the OFDM/OQAM modulator and demodulator are provided, which are based on the inverse fast Fourier transform. Non-orthogonal prototypes create intersymbol and interchannel interferences (ISI and ICI) that, {{in the case of a}} distortion-free transmission, are expressed by a closed-form expression. A large set of design examples is presented for OFDM/OQAM systems with a number of subcarriers going from four up to 2048, which also allows a comparison between different approaches to get well-localized prototypes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{representation}} of the glottal source {{is of paramount importance}} for describing para-linguistic information carried through the voice quality (e. g., emotions, mood, attitude). However, some existing representations of the glottal source are based on analytical glottal models, which assume strong a priori constraints on the shape of the glottal <b>pulses.</b> Thus, these <b>representations</b> are restricted to limited number of voices. Recent progresses in the estimation of the glottal models revealed that the Phase Distortion (PD) of the signal carries most of the information about the glottal pulses. This paper introduces a flexible {{representation of}} the glottal source - based on the short-term modelling of the phase distortion. This representation is not constrained by a specific analytical model, and thus can be used to describe a larger variety of expressive voices. We address the efficiency of this representation for the recognition of various voice qualities, with comparison to MFCC and standard glottal source representations...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} an attempt to {{illustrate}} the development of a mathematical model of an industrial process by combining analytical modelling techniques with a system identification study. Although both these approaches can often be applied in isolation to develop a mathematical description of a process the lack of detailed knowledge of the high power arc discharge suggests a combination of these techniques {{in the case of an}} electric arc furnace. The objective of the present study is to develop three-phase models of both arc impedance and arc current controlled electric arc furnaces. Initially, a single-phase model of the electrode position controller, arc discharge and furnace transmission system are developed for an arc impedance controlled furnace using analytical modelling techniques and assuming zero interaction between the three regulators. Th assumptions and approximations associated with this model are investigated by designing experiments and conducting tests on a production arc furnace. Properties of the arc discharge, interaction between the regulators and a <b>pulse</b> transfer function <b>representation</b> of the electrode position controller are identified. These results are extended and three-phase models of an arc impedance and arc current controlled electric arc furnace are derived...|$|R
