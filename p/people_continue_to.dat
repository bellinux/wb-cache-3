5|$|Medicinal {{properties}} {{have been}} ascribed to Phallus indusiatus {{from the time}} of the Chinese Tang Dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia. The fungus was used to treat many inflammatory, stomach, and neural diseases. Southern China's Miao <b>people</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, dysentery, enteritis, leukemia, and feebleness, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for laryngitis, leucorrhea, fever, and oliguria (low urine output), diarrhea, hypertension, cough, hyperlipidemia, and in anticancer therapy. Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment of}} epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person's entire life. The choice of anticonvulsant {{is based on}} seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health problems, and the person's age and lifestyle. A single medication is recommended initially; {{if this is not}} effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of <b>people</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.|$|E

25|$|The possessive {{of it was}} {{originally}} it’s, and many <b>people</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> write it this way, though the apostrophe was dropped in the early 1800s and authorities are now unanimous that it’s can be only a contraction of it is or it has.

25|$|The {{argument}} {{was made in}} the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger {{had nothing to do with}} the composition. The evidence for this is in my view very tenuous (and the main argument is clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once the {{argument was}} put forward, it took on a life of its own, and <b>people</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.|$|E
25|$|This {{event was}} started in 2013 by the Saddleworth branch of the Round Table as an {{alternative}} to the prior 'Beer Walk' event which was cancelled in 2011. The beer walk started in 1973. Participants walked around Saddleworth in fancy dress, stopping off at pubs. Spectators were encouraged to donate money for charity. It was organised for 39 years, however due to 4,000 (approx) unofficial walkers taking part in the event, in addition to the 2,500 official walkers, the police estimated it would cost £58,000 to stage the walk in 2012. However some <b>people</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> do the walk unofficially.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, the Churchill River {{diversion}} {{project was}} set into operation. Flow was diverted {{by a series}} of channels and control structures into the Nelson River.

It was later reopened but no longer offered casino style gaming. The Tigua Tribal Government offices are located a short distance from the church as is the Tigua Cultural Center.|$|E
25|$|Clusters of consonants are {{represented}} by different and sometimes quite irregular characters; thus, learning to read the script {{is complicated by the}} sheer size of the full set of characters and character combinations, numbering about 500. While efforts at standardizing the script for the Bengali language continue in such notable centers as the Bangla Academy at Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi at Kolkata (West Bengal, India). It is still not quite uniform as yet, as many <b>people</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> use various archaic forms of letters, resulting in concurrent forms for the same sounds. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Bengali and Assamese variations exist today in the formalized system.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, given {{names have}} a {{standard}} spelling {{that is considered}} the norm (even for non-contemporary figures) and the rules are enforced by law. The 'Instituto dos Registos e do Notariado', {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Portuguese Republic, has rules about given names. There is a defined list of allowed names; misspelt and archaic forms (e.g., Luiz is the archaic form of Luís; Felipe is a misspelling of Filipe), and names containing foreign letters – k, y, w – are usually not allowed. However, older people who were registered with archaic forms have continued to use them (examples include Manoel de Oliveira – the modern spelling would be Manuel). Regarding surnames, there are no legal restrictions, and as such many <b>people</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> use archaic spellings of family names, as in Athayde (modern form Ataíde), Telles (modern form Teles).|$|E
