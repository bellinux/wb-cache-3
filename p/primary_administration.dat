Old Jackman Hall was the first building to be constructed at the new central Vermont site. The building was erected in 1868, and named Jackman Hall in 1907 to honor Brigadier General Alonzo Jackman (NU 1836) a faculty member, proponent of the Transatlantic telegraph cable and militia Brigadier General during the American Civil War. From its construction till 1905 the building served as housing for cadets. In the mid-1950s Jackman Hall was extensively remodeled and modernized, however, {{it became apparent that}} the almost century-old barracks were too costly to maintain. It was decided that rather than pay for near continual upkeep to build a new hall on the same site. As many newer barracks had been built since its original construction it was decided that the new Jackman Hall would serve as the <b>primary</b> <b>administration</b> building.

40|$|Purpose of the Step by Step toolkit for annual {{health checks}} {{for people with}} {{learning}} disabilities: People with learning disabilities (LD) have poorer {{physical and mental health}} than other people and die younger. Many of these deaths are avoidable and not inevitable. Annual Health Checks can identify undetected health conditions early, ensure the appropriateness of ongoing treatments and establish trust and continuity care. GPs and practice nurses have the much needed generalist skills to help people with LD get timely access to increasing complex health systems. Who is this toolkit for? The toolkit collects guidance and resources to help GPs, practice nurses and the <b>primary</b> <b>administration</b> team organise and perform quality Annual Health Checks on people with a learning disability. The toolkit has been developed in partnership with the Clinical Innovation And Research Centre...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} {{schedules}} are recommended for hepatitis B vaccination of premature infants. This open-label study (217744 / 083) compared the immune response of premature (N = 94) and full-term infants (N = 92) to hepatitis B antigen following <b>primary</b> <b>administration</b> of hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine at 2 – 4 – 6 months and a booster dose at 18 months. Anti-HBsAg antibodies were determined before and {{one month after}} primary and booster doses. There {{were no significant differences}} in postprimary seroprotection rates (anti-HBsAg > 10 [*]mIU/mL; preterm 93. 4 %; full-term 95. 2 %) or geometric mean concentrations (634 versus 867 [*]mIU/ml), and neither appeared to be related to gestational length or birth weight. Prebooster seroprotection rates were 75 and 80. 6 %, respectively. Six premature infants did not respond to primary and booster doses. Primary and booster vaccinations with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib elicit satisfactory anti-HBsAg responses in preterm infants, which are not influenced by gestational age or birth weight. This schedule and vaccine will greatly facilitate the immunisation of premature infants...|$|E

40|$|Activin A/erythroid {{differentiation}} factor (EDF) {{is a human}} protein that induces differentiation of a murine erythroleukemia cell (the Friend cell). In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous activin A/EDF activity is present in murine bone marrow and spleen. In addition, this activity is secreted by bone marrow and spleen cells in <b>primary</b> culture. <b>Administration</b> of follistatin (a specific binding protein for activin A/EDF) to mice results in a decrease of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow and spleen.

50|$|Over a {{year after}} the <b>primary,</b> Palmer's <b>administration</b> was faced with an immense threat to {{national}} security: word came that a nuclear bomb was going to be detonated by terrorists in Los Angeles within a day. Upon hearing the news, Novick, Palmer's Chief of Staff immediately got on a plane to reach the President. He was surprised to find Palmer's ex-wife Sherry there when he arrived, as she had apparently convinced the President to let her help in gathering information. Given her deception in the past, Novick was unsure if she could be trusted and told Palmer so.|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} determine the effects of active immunization against one of two synthetic peptides from humans (inhibin-like peptide) or pigs (inhibin alpha-subunit) on antibody titres, ovulation rate and embryo production in ewes superovulated with 16 U ovine FSH. In Expt 1, during the breeding season, 30 ewes were subdivided into three groups: group I served as the non-immunized control; group II was immunized against inhibin-like peptide (100 mu g inhibin-like peptide equivalent, followed by three booster injections); group III was immunized against pig inhibin alpha-subunit conjugated to human serum albumin (96 mu g for the <b>primary</b> <b>administration</b> and 46 mu g for the booster). Ln Expt 2, the efficiency of immunization against pig inhibin alpha-subunit on ovarian response and embryo production was evaluated during the non-breeding season in two groups of ewes (n = 12) : group IV was a non-immunized control; Group V was immunized against pig inhibin alpha-subunit. During the breeding season, the ewes immunized against pig inhibin alpha-subunit showed higher antibody titres compared with the group immunized against inhibin-like peptide (P 0. 05) and significantly lowered their quality (54. 1 versus 100 %; P < 0. 01). in conclusion, active immunization against pig inhibin alpha-subunit can improve superovulatory response during the breeding season, while it appears to be unable to increase embryo yield during the seasonal anoestrus...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{systematically}} review and meta-analyze published data on the diagnostic performance of combined 18 F-fluoro- 2 -deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the detection of primary tumors in patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP). A systematic search for relevant studies was performed of the PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed. Reported detection rates, sensitivities and specificities were meta-analyzed. Subgroup analyses were performed if results of individual studies were heterogeneous. The 11 included studies, comprising a total sample size of 433 patients with CUP, had moderate methodological quality. Overall primary tumor detection rate, pooled sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET/CT were 37 %, 84 % (95 % CI 78 – 88 %) and 84 % (95 % CI 78 – 89 %), respectively. Sensitivity was heterogeneous across studies (P[*]=[*] 0. 0001), whereas specificity was homogeneous across studies (P =  0. 2114). Completeness of diagnostic workup before FDG-PET/CT, location of metastases of unknown <b>primary,</b> <b>administration</b> of CT contrast agents, type of FDG-PET/CT images evaluated and way of FDG-PET/CT review did not significantly influence diagnostic performance. In conclusion, FDG-PET/CT can be a useful method for unknown primary tumor detection. Future studies are required to prove the assumed advantage of FDG-PET/CT over FDG-PET alone and to further explore causes of heterogeneity...|$|E
