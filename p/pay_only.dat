Metro-North will bring its contribution to the required 35% upon passage of its 2010–2014 capital budget. Until then, ConnDOT will retain title to any rail cars which exceed its 65% share.|$|E
25|$|More limited income-relation of {{premiums}} only raises limited revenue. Currently, only 5 {{percent of}} Medicare enrollees pay an income-related premium, and most only pay 35 {{percent of their}} total premium, compared to the 25 percent most people <b>pay.</b> <b>Only</b> a negligible number of enrollees fall into the higher income brackets required to bear a more substantial share of their costs—roughly half a percent of individuals and less than three percent of married couples currently pay more than 35 percent of their total Part B costs.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{does not}} pay any money to the Queen, either for {{personal}} income or to support the royal residences outside Australia. Only when the Queen is in Australia does the Australian government support her {{in the performance of}} her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the Royal Family. Usually the Queen's Australian governments <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> for the costs associated with the Governor-General and state governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices and ceremonial occasions.|$|E
25|$|Jackson posted $3million bail, later {{requesting}} a reduced amount. The prosecution opposed this reduction, arguing that Jackson might relocate {{to another country}} as a fugitive and citing Andrew Luster as an example: Luster had fled to Mexico, notwithstanding his $1million bail bond. Many argued that Jackson {{had good reason to}} be angered at the excessive bail, as Phil Spector had to <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> $1million in his murder trial. To some, the high amount also indicated racism. After Jackson's acquittal, the judge ordered that the bail be returned to Michael.|$|E

25|$|Universities {{generally}} {{require a}} certain amount of bagrut matriculation units (as well as a certain grade average) and a good grade in the Psychometric Entrance Test, which is similar in many respects to the American SAT. The Open University of Israel accepts all applicants regardless of their academic history, though it still maintains high academic standards. All of Israel's nine public universities, and some of its colleges, are subsidized by the government, and students <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> {{a small part of the}} actual cost of tuition.

25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started {{claiming}} in 1846 {{that only}} those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed {{that under the}} previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga {{under the control of}} Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no one could not be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.|$|E

25|$|The case, {{begun by}} the Australian Council of Trade Unions and {{supported}} by the Whitlam government, extended the reach of the original but limited equal pay decision of 1969. Prior decisions had guaranteed equal <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> for certain specific occupations and later, certain limited industries (industries traditionally considered 'women's work', such as the textile industry), whereas this case extended the principle of equal pay to all workers. Gaudron's argument was based on the principles of the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention of the International Labour Organization (an organisation she would later work for). However, Gaudron later came to regard her argument, that Australia had not ratified the Convention because the Commission would not grant equal pay (thus preventing Australia from fulfilling its obligations under the Convention), as somewhat disingenuous, and recalled it with a measure of embarrassment.|$|E
25|$|As the {{professional}} for Blackpool, {{he was able}} to earn more money than any first class cricketer anywhere in the world. Each League side in Lancashire was permitted to <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> one professional. During the 1950s and early 1960s, in the summer at any one time there were more than 150,000 holidaymakers in Blackpool, and there were very large crowds indeed paying at the turnstiles of Blackpool Cricket Club. Every season, moreover, the Blackpool pro was given a benefit match. Illustrating the value of the Blackpool job, Alley was succeeded as Blackpool's pro by many of the all-time greats of the game. These included Sir Conrad Hunte, Garfield Sobers, Pankaj Roy, Hanif Mohammad and Rohan Kanhai. Playing only 2 days a week would also have given the pro the opportunity to take a second job if he had so wanted, including playing for a Minor County or a first class County Second Eleven.|$|E
25|$|Wolf was {{an active}} agent in his father's {{financial}} transactions, and shared his dignity as court factor. He later experienced great reverses of fortune, however. Having invested {{a large part of}} his wealth in loans to the Bavarian government, the stipulated terms of repayment were not kept, and bankruptcy stared him in the face. For a time he was able to <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> half of the interest on the 150,000 florins which Samson Wertheimer had donated to charity, and of which Wolf was trustee. On his father's donation of 22,000 florins in favor of the German Jews in Palestine he did not pay any interest after 1733. His embarrassment was ended by Elector Maximilian, who liquidated his debts. In his will (1762) Wolf declared that, although entailing a great loss upon him, he accepted this liquidation in order to do justice to his creditors. Further, he enjoined his children to pay in full his father's donation of 22,000 florins, although in 1759 he (Wolf) had returned to the Frankfurt congregation 10,000 florins which it had contributed to this fund.|$|E

25|$|Other {{advantages}} of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required. Among its problems are that quite a steady hand is needed to deliver the blood to the exact spot, that some patients find the finger-pricking difficult, and {{that the cost of}} the test strips must also be taken into account. In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by Medicare for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications. Medicare is now covering home testing for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Home testing requires a doctor's prescription and that the meter and supplies are obtained from a Medicare approved Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF).|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of the road did not eliminate, however, {{the need for a}} canal, and the Austrian government renewed its persuasive efforts. According to Gazeta de Transilvania in July 1855, Baron Karl Ludwig von Bruck, the Austrian Finance Minister, founded a stock company to build the desired canal. According to an article in Zimbrul on July 23, 1855, the project was of interest to Britain, the French Empire and the Austrian Empire, who were persuading the Ottoman government to allot the concession of the canal and the fitting of the port of Constanța to a consortium {{under the direction of the}} three countries. The Ottomans were to lease a league of land on each side of the canal for 99 years, where colonist could be settled. Goods were to travel freely, with ships having to <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> a per tone tax, significantly lower than the one on the Sulina branch. According to the newspaper Steaua Dunării from January 24, 1856, the Sultan issued a firman to the Anglo-French-Austrian consortium Wilson-Morny-Breda, represented by Forbes Campbell, authorizing it to build the canal which was to be called Abdul Medjid. The 12 articles of the Concession Act were published in Bukurester Deutsche Zeitung.|$|E
25|$|Discount brands {{are often}} smaller, {{regional}} chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers {{or from the}} major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, Ingles, Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, Quick Chek, Road Ranger, Sheetz and Wawa), discount stores (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, or Sam's Club), consumers are required to hold a special membership card {{in order to be}} eligible for the discounted price, or <b>pay</b> <b>only</b> with the chain's cash card, debt card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as Oregon and New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.|$|E
