5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that <b>point</b> <b>I</b> understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{creative}} process is fluid and loosely structured. [...] According to Johnson, [...] "At this <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> provide the overall direction.

[...] The bulk of the writing is done by Nite, who also contributes design ideas, while two other developers, known in the game as Riff and HotStuff, work on writing, design, and coding.|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein's {{romance and}} war comic-based works took heroic {{subjects}} from small source panels and monumentalized them.

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that <b>point</b> <b>I</b> only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Jansch's music, and {{particularly}} his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced {{a range of}} well-known musicians. His first album (Bert Jansch, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, [...] "At one <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP, I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America could touch that." [...] The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental [...] "Angie." [...] This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) The Sallyangie.|$|E
500|$|Before {{principal}} photography, {{the cast}} and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts. Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention. [...] "At one <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," [...] says Moore. Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore told the Los Angeles Times, park personnel never appeared to notice them, save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in August 1968, McCain was {{subjected}} to a program of severe torture. He was bound and beaten every two hours; this punishment occurred {{at the same time}} that he was suffering from dysentery. Further injuries led McCain to attempt suicide, which was stopped by guards. Eventually, McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda [...] "confession". He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, [...] "I had learned what we all learned over there: every man has his breaking <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> had reached mine." [...] Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract [...] "confessions" [...] and propaganda statements; virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors. McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.|$|E

500|$|Later that year, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that the September 18 show in Honolulu {{would be the last}} performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band.

[...] I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. [...] I don't want it to go stale". [...] In the same article, Reznor also admitted that [...] "the idea of five guys playing loud music [...] two hours ... has got to change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down".|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} sessions, Higgs {{suffered from}} depression. He {{referred to the}} end of their 150-date tour as [...] "an out-of-the-sauna-and-into-a-cold-bath experience", adding that [...] "riding that low as well as trying to make a record was quite hard". He was affected by frequent mood swings {{as a result of his}} medication; Pritchard said that these [...] "affected [...] pretty adversely". Drummer, Michael Spearman, explained to Q that Higgs's attempt to channel his depression into his writing worried the rest of the group. At one point during writing sessions, Higgs presented his bandmates with [...] "Pigdog", a song about [...] "how [...] a horrible person and [...] want to be one any more". Spearman objected to this style: [...] "For me that was a turning <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'Let's make a record that’s energetic and fucked up and exciting.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{influence}} from Old English sources is {{the appearance of}} named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade [...] "Sting" [...] we see Bilbo's acceptance {{of the kinds of}} cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself. This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon's hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, [...] "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same." ...|$|E
