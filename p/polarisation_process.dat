This paper therefore adds to the growing body of empirical evidence from different countries that cast doubts on technology as the dominant driver of polarisation (Autor 2015; Green and Sand 2015).|$|E

For a long time, many of them have been continuist, founded notably on what was believed to be the 'ultima ratio' [last argument]: environmental factors. By considering that a territory like the Portuguese Kingdom around 1250, almost complete from a geographical point ol view, was the product of different systems (economical exchanges, links between local communities, political network) and one identity, we shall attempt to look back over many years and study the relationship between the shape of this territory and that of the units that preceded it since in the Roman provinces of Lusitania and Galicia. Is there continuity, repetition or coincidence?

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} differences in the development of farms in Poland against the agriculture of East Germany, and to show areas with similar conditions for development. The time range of the research covered the years 2002 - 2010, i. e. the stage of preparation of Polish agriculture for accession to the European Union, the implementation of pre-accession aid programmes, and the establishment and implementation of the tools of the Common Agricultural Policy. To assess the level of agricultural development, natural, productive and social characteristics were adopted. Spatial variations in the analysed features were based on the variation coefficient (Vz), and the level of agricultural development, on Perkal’s index (Wi). In the analysed period the range of variation and the degree of the spatial dispersion of sub-indices changed, indicating a deepening of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>processes</b> in agriculture. The implementation of CAP intensified the process of specialisation and modernisation in agriculture, an example of which is the increase in the average farm size and in agricultural productivity. On the other hand, agricultural production intensified, as exemplified by a decrease in the minimum value in six of the analysed characteristics, which indicates growing disparities...|$|R
30|$|Goos and Manning (2007) used {{data for}} 1979 – 1999 and {{concluded}} that compositional changes could not explain the polarisation in the UK. This highly influential paper remains the only paper to have tackled this question [see McIntosh (2013) for a review]. This paper replicates and extends to more recent years the work of Goos and Manning (2007) and provides new insights on the <b>polarisation</b> <b>process</b> in the UK. In particular, the main contribution {{of this paper is}} to provide new evidence on the role of changes in the skill mix exploring for the first time the contribution of individual skill groups to the aggregate pattern of polarisation in general and to changes in the share of routine employment in particular. This new evidence provides a more nuanced picture of the implications of changes in the composition of labour supply for the occupational structure than in Goos and Manning (2007) and shows whether any particular feature of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>process</b> can be explained by changes in the relative size of particular skill groups.|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crisis, Europe is becoming more polarised in terms of employment, competitiveness and industrial specialisation. A “German-centred core”–which maintained employment and production–has emerged, contrasted by a “Southern periphery”, where major economic losses have occurred.

40|$|<b>Polarisation</b> <b>processes,</b> {{which began}} in Croatia in the 1950 's, {{resulted}} in disparate socio-economic development, in an uneven spatial distribution of the population, and in a concentration of people, jobs and housing in urban settlements. Coastal cities, as hubs and agents of socio-economic development, in their regions became focal points for the concentration of the population, while islands and hinterland areas suffered depopulation and demographic ageing. Intense in-migration had {{a positive influence on}} the demographic development of coastal cities. They became hotbeds of bioreproduction and up to the most recent intercensus period (1991 – 2001) displayed dynamic population growth. However political and economic changes in this recent period, together with the effects of the war, deepened and accelerated increasingly unfavourable demographic processes, which were reflected in an overall reduction of the population of coastal Adriatic cities, as well as in a deterioration of its structure. Decreasing fertility, demographic ageing and changes in life values brought about a transformation of the family, and hence changes in the size of households and in the relations among family members. The general trend today involves a gradual {{reduction in the number of}} household members, and a continuous increase in the number of two and one-member households...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to socio-spatial {{polarisation}} {{with regard to the}} rural environment in Slovakia. In fact, ongoing <b>polarisation</b> <b>processes</b> do not take place only in the rural-urban continuum, but within every single category as well. This is evident especially in the rural environment, which has begun to change significantly in terms of its structure and to diversify to a greater extent. As a result, some parts of the countryside began to stagnate and decline gradually. These parts of the rural environment can thus be referred to as marginal, peripheral. With respect to the proclaimed diversity of the rural environment, this study focuses on selected rural structures, namely mountain areas, the borderland, and the area at the intersection of those two structures. Generally, these parts of the rural environment are often confronted with the phenomenon of marginality and peripherality, and because of the given local predisposition are even more vulnerable to its manifestations. Taking into account the dynamism and multidimensional character of this phenomenon, we can further assume that its manifestation changes in time and space. With the use of ANOVA, we examine a set of selected indicators of socio-spatial polarisation and verify whether and to what extent this dynamism depends on the character of diversified rural structures...|$|R
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of existing transformers within electric utilities are approaching {{the end of their}} design life. Insulation degradation continues to be a major concern for these transformers. Insulation materials degrade at higher temperatures in the presence of oxygen and moisture. The degradation from thermal stress affects electrical, chemical and mechanical properties. Utility engineers use a number of modern diagnostic techniques to assess the insulation condition of aged transformers. Among them Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), Degree of Polymerisation (DP) measurement and Furan analysis by the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) are frequently used. In recent years, new diagnostic methods have been promoted to complement the classical insulation resistance, power frequency dissipation factor and polarisation index measurements. These new methods are based on time or frequency domain polarisation measurements. In frequency domain measurement, a sinusoidal voltage is applied and the complex dielectric constant is determined from the amplitude and phase of the current flowing through the sample. On the other hand, time domain measurements are conducted by the application of a step voltage across the insulation sample. Time domain measurements based on polarisation and depolarisation current measurements and return voltage measurements have gained significant attention over the last several years. Particularly, there has been growing interest in the condition assessment of transformer insulation by the Return Voltage Method (RVM). In recent times decay voltage measurement has also been proposed to monitor the moistening process of insulation after polarising the insulation for a long time. Polarisation and depolarisation currents have two components - conductive current and polarisation current. The conductive component provides information about the intensity of the conduction <b>process</b> and the <b>polarisation</b> component provides the intensity of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>processes</b> within a defined time range. It is difficult to separate the two components of currents and the measurement of such small current is also sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. The principle of the voltage response method is based on the measurement of the discharge and return voltages of the insulation. From the magnitude and shape of the voltage curves the quality of insulation affected by moisture and ageing can be predicted. Moisture content of the insulation can be estimated from the decay voltage measurement, while progress of thermal ageing can be estimated from the return voltage measurement. The two measurements can be conducted independently and hence conduction and <b>polarisation</b> <b>processes</b> can be investigated independently. In this research project we have investigated a number of transformers of different ages with the return voltage and decay voltage techniques. A brief analysis of the decay and return voltage methods will first be outlined in this paper. Then results from the two groups of measurements (one from the decay voltage and the other from the return voltage) will be presented...|$|R
30|$|The key {{findings}} of the paper can be summarised as follows. The main feature of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>process</b> in the UK has been a shift of employment towards high-paid occupations, which have gained 80 % of the employment shares lost by middling occupations. When occupations are ranked by education, it becomes apparent that it is those with the lowest initial level of education that have lost most employment shares. The results of the shift-share analysis suggest {{that the increase in}} the share of graduates has contributed significantly to this substantial reallocation of employment from middle-pay to high-pay occupations. The increase in immigrants, on the other hand, does not explain any particular feature of job polarisation in the UK. In addition, there is no clear indication of polarisation within all skill groups—a fact that previous literature has cited as evidence supporting the hypothesis that technology is the main driver of the process. Hence, this paper adds to the growing body of evidence from other countries (Autor 2015; Green and Sand 2015) that casts doubts {{on the extent to which}} technology can be seen as the primary driver of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|Feminist and {{management}} literature (Kanter, 1977; Burton, 1991; Hede 2000) has chronicled the deep stirrings felt by women excluded from choices and marginalised from power in many organisations. This thesis aimed {{to investigate the}} experiences of marginality for women who work in organisations and to explore the associations between marginality and career success, and between marginality and quality of work variables such as stress and role conflict. The research used a model that encompasses a version of fit, whereby stress {{is viewed as a}} mis-fit between an individual’s personal values and the ‘environmental’ supplies available to fulfil those values (Edwards, 1996; Code & Langan-Fox, 2001). This is a shift away from models that focus on appraisals of demand versus capacity (such as Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Tenets of marginality theory (Park, 1928) and gender schema theory (Bem, 1981) were key points of reference. These theories support the proposition that individuals who experience greater congruence between their own gender identity and that of the organisational culture will experience less occupational stress and higher quality work outcomes (including career success). Marginality was operationalised as the degree of incongruence between individuals’ self ratings of gender related characteristics and values, and ratings of gender related characteristics and values of the organisational culture. Marginality was conceptualised as both shaped and constructed by the individual–cultural relationship, positioned within a wider social, political and ideological context. The thesis used two studies to explore first the nature of marginality, and then its hypothesised antecedents, effects and their mediators. Three Australian private sector organisations participated in a qualitative study in Study 1 (EducOrg, MetalOrg, and ComputerOrg) and two private sector organisations participated in a quantitative study in Study 2 (ComputerOrg and InsurOrg). Study 1 involved conducting interviews with senior managers across organisations (metal, computing, and education service industries) and Study 2 involved a survey completed by a total 150 participants drawn from both the computing organisation, and from a newly recruited organisation from the insurance sector. Interviews were semi-structured around topics related to gender and career development. The survey in Study 2, the design of which was informed by findings from Study 1, comprised gender and values scales, as well as quality of work indices such as stress and job satisfaction measures. The results in Study 1 appeared to confirm the existence of gendered phenomena in the three organisations studied. Gender <b>polarisation</b> <b>processes</b> appeared to perpetuate exemplars of the ‘good’ manager as masculine, positioning women as deviant within the organisational culture. For women to deviate from the dominant management style involves risk, and many women found themselves with less freedom than expected to move at the ‘contact zone’ between masculine and feminine behavioural modalities. Study 2 provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that psychological resources and marginality, would significantly mediate stress. As hypothesised, women experienced greater degrees of marginality than men. However, marginality was experienced differently in each of the organisations studied. Findings in both organisations participating in Study 2 suggested the factor that distinguished the organisations on levels of marginality appeared to be perceptions of the existence or non-existence of nurturing values and practices in the organisation. It was hypothesised that perceptions of psychological resources (self-efficacy, locus of control, self esteem) and social support resources (network position, and availability of mentors) would be predictors of marginality and occupational stress. Findings supported this in part. Four of the psychological resource variables significantly mediated the effects of marginality. They were positive and negative affect, self-esteem and mentoring experiences. As expected, psychological and social support variables were also significant predictors of occupational stress factors, though their impact differed according to the particular stress factor. Overall the findings provided some evidence to support the framework of gender marginality developed in this thesis: that marginality, mediated by psychosocial resources, will have adverse effects on perceptions of career success and occupational stress. It was concluded that further research to address the limitations and implications of this thesis, in order to consolidate understandings of the gender differences on career success for women, is worthy of consideration. ...|$|R

Three TanDEM-X dual polarization spotlight acquisitions were taken over {{a rural area}} in Germany in the growing season 2014.

From the data of the first acquisition (June 1 st) taken before planting, a DTM of the bare ground is generated. The data of the following acquisition dates (July 15 th, July 26 th) are used to establish crop surface models (CSM). A CSM represents the crop surface of a whole field in a high resolution. By subtracting the DTM of the ground from each CSM, the actual plant height is calculated.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{argument}} {{about the nature of}} language teaching methodology, relating general educational principles to current theories of language acquisition and use. Chapter I discusses what constitutes appropriate knowledge about language teaching methodology. It argues for a Popperian epistemological model, providing that methodological innovation is seen as analogous to social policy-making. Chapter II outlines current views of the nature of language, its use and acquisition, and argues that the creation of meaning through interaction and negotiation with other language users is a central feature. Chapter III examines a number of possible <b>polarisations</b> of the <b>process</b> of language acquisition into strategies for acquiring the tokens of the language and strategies for turning them into a negotiable and value-laden system of use. Criticisms are offered of some of these, particularly Krashen's, and a pedagogically orientated distinction between accuracy and fluency is presented. • Chapter IV examines the methodological implications of making this distinction, and particularly the need to establish a 'natural' setting. Group work is seen as central to this. Chapter V explores the role of meaning in language teaching and briefly considers some curriculum design proposals. It is argued that the organisation of a syllabus is less important than the methodology used, and that a syllabus should have educational content. Chapter VI draws'on the argument so far to outline a model of teaching methodology which emphasises substantive as well as linguistic content, and depends upon interactive methods. The final chapter returns to the general model of methodological enquiry and argues that successful development of the practice of teaching depends heavily on a combination of administrative channels for effective innovation and feedback with a constant process of analysis of theoretical concepts in terms which have direct relevance to teachers.

Modern computing facilities call for a new design. We aim to develop an interactive software tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) for the reduction of single-dish radio continuum maps. Special effort is given on the reduction of distortions along the scanning direction (scanning effects) by combining maps scanned in orthogonal directions or dual- or multiple-horn observations {{that need to be}} processed in a restoration procedure. The package should also <b>process</b> <b>polarisation</b> data and offer the possibility to include special tasks written by the individual user. Based on the ideas of the NOD 2 package we developed NOD 3, which includes all necessary tasks from the raw maps to the final maps in total intensity and linear polarisation. Furthermore, plot routines and several methods for map analysis are available. The NOD 3 package is written in Python which allows to extend the package by additional tasks. The required data format for the input maps is FITS. NOD 3 is a sophisticated tool to process and analyse maps from single-dish observations that are affected by 'scanning effects' due to clouds, receiver instabilities, or radio-frequency interference (RFI). The 'basket-weaving' tool combines orthogonally scanned maps to a final map that is almost free of scanning effects. The new restoration tool for dual-beam observations reduces the noise by a factor of about two compared to the NOD 2 version. Combining single-dish with interferometer data in the map plane ensures the full recovery of the total flux density. Comment: 8 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
