40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{modifiable}} programmatic characteristics reflected in the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) Annual Accreditation Report for all accredited programs that reported <b>pass</b> <b>rates</b> on the National Physical Therapist Examination, and to build a predictive model for first-time and three-year ultimate <b>pass</b> <b>rates.</b> Methods: This observational study analyzed programmatic information from the 185 CAPTE-accredited physical therapy programs in the United States and Puerto Rico {{out of a total}} of 193 programs that provided the first-time and three-year ultimate <b>pass</b> <b>rates</b> in 2011. Fourteen predictive variables representing student selection and composition, clinical education length and design, and general program length and design were analyzed against first-time <b>pass</b> <b>rates</b> and ultimate <b>pass</b> <b>rates</b> on the NPTE. Univariate and multivariate multinomial regression analysis for first-time <b>pass</b> <b>rates</b> and logistic regression analysis for three-year ultimate <b>pass</b> <b>rates</b> were performed. Results: The variables associated with the first-time <b>pass</b> <b>rate</b> in the multivariate analysis were the mean undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and the average age of the cohort. Multivariate analysis showed that mean undergraduate GPA was associated with the three-year ultimate <b>pass</b> <b>rate.</b> Conclusions: Mean undergraduate GPA was found to be the only modifiable predictor for both first-time and three-year <b>pass</b> <b>rates</b> among CAPTE-accredited physical therapy programs...|$|R
