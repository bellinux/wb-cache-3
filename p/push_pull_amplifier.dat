This distortion is predominantly second harmonic {{which is not}} unpleasant to the ear (the second harmonic for an A on the musical scale at 440 Hz is 880 Hz which is, obviously, also an A i.e., the same note just an octave higher), but by definition their high THD figures make SET amplifiers inaccurate. In a <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> this second harmonic distortion is cancelled in the output transformer. Several percent THD is not unusual at full power output, but will be much lower at normal music levels.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Bu çalışmada Si-Ge HBT teknolojisi kullanılarak 8 - 11 GHz frekans bandında işlev gösteren simetrik sürümlü B sınıfı kuvvetlendirici tasarımı yapılmıştır. Giriş ve çıkış dengeli kapıları dengesiz kapılara uyumlamak ve sisteme bant geçiren özellik kazandırmak amacıyla giriş ve çıkışlarında kullanılmak üzere Marchand Balunu tasarlanmıştır. Kablosuz haberleşme teknolojilerindeki gelişmeler sonucu, bilgiyi yüksek frekanslı işaret şeklinde gönderme ihtiyacı doğmuştur. Bunun sebebi frekans arttıkça dalga boyunun ve buna bağlı olarak da alıcı ve verici anten boyutlarının küçülmesidir. IEEE kullanılan frekans bantlarını {{standart}} hale getirmiştir. Bu bant aralıkları küçükten büyüğe HF, VHF, UHF, L, S, C, X, Ku, K, Ka, V, W ve mm bantlarıdır. Bu çalışmada kullanılan 8 - 11 GHz bandını tam olarak karşılayan standart "X" bandıdır. Geniş bantlı yüksek frekanslı kuvvetlendirici tasarımından önce, hangi çalışma noktasında kutuplanacağına karar verilmelidir. Geniş bantlı tasarıma imkan veren A sınıfı, B sınıfı ve AB sınıfı çalışma şekilleri incelenmiştir. A sınıfının en doğrusal fakat en verimsiz, B sınıfının en az doğrusal ancak en verimli çalışma şekli olduğu görülmüş, simetrik sürümlü yapı kullanılacağından dolayı B sınıfı çalışma şekli daha uygun bulunmuştur. Yüksek dinamik aralıklı bir kuvvetlendirici tasarımında ayrıca kazanç ve doğrusallık kriterleri de oldukça önemlidir. Bu sebeple çeşitli kazanç hesaplamaları (güç kazancı, elde edilebilir kazanç, iletim kazancı) ve doğrusallık ölçütü değişkenleri (IP 2, IP 3 ve P 1 dB) incelendi. Kuvvetlendiricinin giriş ve çıkışında kullanulmak üzere tasarlanacak balun yapısı için araştırma yapılmıştır. Sık kullanılan balun yapılarından Köprü Balun, Guanella Balunu ve Marchand Balunu yapıları incelenmiştir. Köprü balunun yapısı alçak geçiren süzgeç, Gunanella balununun yapısı yüksek geçiren süzgeç karakteristiği gösterdiği için alttan ve üstten sınırlı çalışma bandı 8 - 11 GHz bandında kullanılmaya uygun olmadığı belirlendi. Bant geçiren karakteristik gösteren Marchand Balunu tercih edildi. Balun yapısı tasarım için seçilen taban malzemesine uygun şekilde AWR-DE Microwave Office benzetim programı aracılığıyla optimize edilerek tasarlandı. Kullanılacak Si-Ge tranzistor de yine aynı benzetim programında modellenerek simetrik sürümlü yapı kuruldu. Simetrik sürümlü yapının girişinde kazancı arttırmak ve de giriş empedans uyumunu sağlamak amacıyla farksalkuvvetlendici yapısı kaskat olarak eklendi. Tasarıma balunlar da eklenerek sonuçlar alındı. Employing Si-Ge semiconductor technology, 8 to 11 GHz push-pull Class B amplifier {{is designed}} with {{input and output}} balun structures due to make two balanced port network suitable to utilize in single ended systems. Applying input and output baluns also provides impedance matching and bandpass characteristic behaving like a resonant tank filtering even harmonics produced by push-pull amplifier. This work includes literature research about amplifier design criterion, classes according to amplifier operation point, types of baluns, required calculations and finally designs of whole network with simulations done using AWR Design Environment Microwave Office. Due to increase {{the performance of the}} system, some optimization tools in simulation programmeare utilized. Developments of wireless communication technologies require using high frequency to reduce wave-lenght and related with wave-lenght receiver and transmitter antenna sizes also decrease. For common use, IEEE standardizes the frequency bands. from low frequency to high frequency these bands are; HF (3 to 30 MHz), VHF (30 to 300 MHz), UHF (0. 3 to 1 GHz), L (1 to 2 GHz), S (2 to 4 GHz), C (4 to 8 GHz), X (8 to 12 GHz), Ka (12 to 18 GHz), K (20 to 40 GHz), Ku (26. 5 to 40 GHz), V (40 to 75 GHz), W (75 to 110 GHz) and mm (110 to 300 GHz). HF band is generally used in military and government communicarions, communication with the ground station in aviation applications, amateur radio applications e. t. c [...] VHF band is widely used in FM radio broadcasting, sea traffic controlling applications e. t. c [...] Some GSM operators utilize UHF band. Besides that some amateur satellite applications can be done in UHF band. Furthermore, UHF band is also used for GPS (Global Positioning System) which is very important technology. S and C bands are suitable for weather and sea radar applicatons and satellite communications. X band covers this work's frequency band 8 to 11 GHz, and can be used for electronic warfare, military satellite communications applications. In defense technology, electronic warfare is very important and promising subject to research. The selection of the dc quiescent point for the active device is very important issue before designing an amplifier. It also means determining operation class of the amplifier. A bias network is used to acquire the appropriate quiescent point for the active device under the specified operating conditions, and it maintains a constant setting irrespective of transistor parameter variations The various classes of device operation typically employed at microwave frequencies are defined as A, B, AB, C, D, E and F. The choice of the class depends majorly on the specific application that is intended for the amplifier. For example, due to design a broadband microwave amplifier designs, class A, B, or AB should be selected. D, E and F classes are high efficient switching topologies and widely used in power electronics applications. This thesis includes a brief information about A, B and AB types of operation classes for push-pull amplifier. Due to consider and acquire high efficiency and suitability to push-pull amplifier structure, class B is preferred. Although linearity of a class B amplifier is worse than a class A amplifier, its efficiency is much better. This causes decreasing the power consumption of the system which is very important for both power cost saving and heat dissipation which effects the system performance very negatively. Another important parameter that must be especially considered is linearity. In an ideal system, the output linearly changes with respect to the input. However, transfer function of an amplifier usually not as linear as desired in real world, because of distortive effects. Intermodulation signals can be dangerous if they are in the fundamental band, and cannot be easily filtered. Linearity must be increased to achieve high dynamic range operation. Some of important and widely used linearity criterions are P 1 dB, IP 3 and IP 2 are examined before design procedure. P 1 dB can be physically measured using a signal generator producing an appropriate signal which has enough amplitude for the sensitivity of the amplifier under test at desired frequency chosen from the operation bandwidth It is also seen that, there are some analytical relationships between these linearity criterions. For design procedure of the input and output balun, some balunstructure types are examined to determine which is more suitable for amplifier. The most common and widely used balun types are Bridge (Lattice) Balun, GuanellaBalun and Marchand Balun. It is seen that Bridge (Lattice) balun has low-pass, and Guanella balun has high-pass characteristics so they are not suitable for the 8 to 11 GHz application. Unlike Guanella or Bridge balun, Marchand balun has band-pass characteristics and is preffered for the input. Firstly, some literature research has done about Marchand balun to be sure about its functions are suitable for purpose. Marchand introduced the Marchand balun, which is designed using coaxial transmission lines, in 1944, and there are still studies done about implementation and developing this structure. Today, substrate technology is very sophisticate in comparison with 1940 s. Thus, current researchs are generally based on mictostrip, coplanar, stripline transmission lines. For required calculations, previous studies about Marchand Balun are used then the results are implemented on transmission line impedance calculation tool TX LINE in AWR DE MWO. After determining the type of input balun, the next issue is indicating the output balun structure. Due to transmit higher power at the output efficiently, 1 : 4 balun is chosen for output balun which is also perfectly suitable to use for class B amplifiers. Only one branch of the balun transmits the signal for each half cycle of the output signal, which leads combining the two signals with 180 -degree phase difference together. Another important stage is choosing transistor technology. There are many types of transistors widely used in similar applications such as silicon BJTs, silicon MOSFETs, GaAs MESFETs, InGaAs/InP HEMTs. As the active semiconductor elements, SiGe HBTs are employed in the class B <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> design due to its very high cut-off frequency. There is a differential amplifier with feedback due to adjust input impedance and besides that increase the total gain. Supply voltage of the structure is defined as 4 V according to characteristics of the chosen transistor model. Class B push-pull amplifier design with additional differential amplifier and input-output baluns is completed and results are achieved with AWR-DE MWO simulation program. 8 to 11 GHz push-pull Class B amplifier is designed with input and output balun structures due to make two balanced port network suitable to utilize in single ended systems. Network performance is highly increased by utilizing optimization tools in simulation program after combining all stages of design. Applying input and output baluns provides impedance matching and bandpass characteristic behaving like a resonant tank filtering even harmonics produced by push-pull amplifier. Differential amplifier at the first amplification stage provides higher gain, which helps increasing dynamic range of the cascaded amplifier. After research, calculations and optimizations, very satisfactory results are acquired according to simulation graphics. Gain is over 33 dB, output P 1 dB is 15 dBm, output IP 3 is 40 dBm, input reflection is very good (S 11 <- 10 dBm) within desired bandwidth 8 to 11 GHz. These results are very hard to achieve for X band, and promising for fabrication and implementation. After realizing the structure with lumped elements and getting good results, same network can be implemented as an integrated circuit using SiGe or some other semiconductor technology.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{investigation}} and implementation of novel techniques for the design of X band (8 - 12 GHz) power amplifiers. One of the main topics is the expansion and novel implementation of continuous mode theory, with the intention of improving the bandwidth and efficiency of X band power amplifiers. This work builds upon the Class B/J continuous mode theory to incorporate cases where <[ZF 0] 6 = RL, not described by the original Class B/J theory, with a tool called the “clipping contour”. The clipping contour tool shows a graphical representation on the Smith chart of the boundary between impedances generating a voltage waveform which will modulate or “clip” the current waveform, and a voltage waveform which will leave the current waveform unaltered. This non-clipping space is shown, with measured load <b>pull</b> and <b>amplifier</b> data, to represent the maximum efficiency case for a given ZF 0, thus the clipping contour tool thus gives designers the ability to predict the areas of highest efficiency and power given any ZF 0, without the need to use costly, time consuming multi harmonic load <b>pull</b> techniques. <b>Push</b> <b>pull</b> <b>amplifiers</b> using quarter wave coupled line baluns are proposed as an ideal matching topology to exploit this new tool. Various balun topologies are studied using a novel extended transmission line model. This model is shown to predict accurately and explain the “trace separation” effect seen in planar baluns and not their 3 D coaxial cable equivalents. It also forms the basis of analysis which results in a powerful new equation capable of guaranteeing the elimination of trace separation completely, without compromising performance. This equation is used to design an optimal balun which possesses the largest fractional bandwidth (130...|$|R

These methods are particularly required when <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> tasks are biomechanically analysed, implying that also force direction and point of application relative to the worker have to be assessed. Secondly, to obtain a limited number of external exposure measures that reflect exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> over time, aggregation of various force measurements is suggested. Internal exposure measures and parameters corresponding to guidelines are also described. Thirdly, for truck drivers and refuse collectors a strategy of approximately five repeated measurements for each representative working situation is advised to obtain a reliable estimate of an individual's exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Relevance to industryAn overview is given of methods to assess forces accompanying <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> which are very common activities in industry.

Altogether 829 workers initially received a questionnaire, of whom 459 responded both initially and after I year of follow-up. Initially, self-reported exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> was assessed by questionnaire. Furthermore, {{a representative sample of}} 131 workers was observed at work using TRAC (task recording and analysis on computer) to assess exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> objectively. For exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> the workers were classified into a reference group and medium and high exposure groups. Initially and in the follow-up, the 12 -month prevalence of low-back {{and shoulder}} complaints was assessed. Complaints reported in the follow-up were separately used as dependent variables to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis.

The results show significant preferences for all treatments over the control. <b>Push</b> <b>pull</b> with IR and fertilizer had the highest log odds ratio (2. 93), so the odds of farmers preferring this treatment are 18. 7 times the odds that farmers prefer the control. The odds ratios for the other <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> combinations were generally highest (9 15), followed by the rotation systems with Crotalaria (3. 5 7. 0), and soybeans, especially with IR maize and fertilizer (odds ratio of 5. 7). In mono-cropping systems, IR maize was only appreciated in combination with fertilizer, and then only in 2004. <b>Push</b> <b>pull</b> and Crotalaria were more appreciated in 2004 than in 2003. Farmers in Vihiga had a stronger preference for <b>push</b> <b>pull,</b> and those in Busia for soybean rotations. Significant differences among farmers were observed, but the effects were small. Women appreciated <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> more than men, while other technologies were gender-neutral. Older farmers {{were more likely to}} prefer <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> and Crotalaria with fertilizer. Livestock ownership was not found to have an effect on technology preferences. Measured yield, stem borer and Striga infestation all had significant but small effects, although their inclusion did not eliminate the treatment effects, indicating that other factors are still important. OLS of the scores for different criteria on the overall score shows yield {{to be the most important}} criterion (coefficient of 0. 40), followed by soil fertility enhancement (0. 25) and Striga resistance (0. 13). Labor saving (0. 09) and stem borer resistance (0. 03) are relatively minor criteria. This research shows that scoring and analysis with ordinal regression is a convenient way to solicit and analyze farmers preferences for new technologies, with wide applicability in farming systems and participatory research. Its application here shows that farmers like the new technologies, especially <b>push</b> <b>pull,</b> but that there are substantial differences between years, sites and farmers. The use of this method can be very helpful to define and focus further research and formulate specific and targeted recommendations for agricultural extension. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
