50|$|Finally, in both hemispheres, {{there are}} centers of action inland in large {{continental}} zones where cold or warm air can be trapped by surrounding mountainous zones or high contrast or temperature by surrounding seas. This {{is the case}} for Siberia where the temperature is very cold in winter forming the Siberian High, or very hot in summer to give a thermal low in summer. Antarctica is so cold in all seasons that it has a <b>permanent</b> <b>anticyclone</b> at its center.|$|E
50|$|From 1942 through 1947, Matthes {{tasks were}} {{determined}} by the Military Geology Unit effort and his English translation skills for European languages. One of his final tasks for the USGS was a re-examination of William Herbert Hobbs's doctrine of a <b>permanent</b> glacial <b>anticyclone</b> situated over the Greenland ice sheet versus the use of Greenland as a military airbase.|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the Argentine Basin (AB) flow is of climatic relevance, as it yields strong mixing between Antarctic water masses (carried by the Malvinas Current) and subtropical water masses (carried by the Brazil Current). Such mixing is regulated by the Zapiola Anticyclone, a counterclockwise current that encircles the Zapiola Rise, the main topographic feature of the AB. Recent observations have evidenced a clear variability of the Zapiola Anticyclone over periods that range from a 25 -day oscillation to an interannual signal controlled by the local topography. We investigate the intrinsic variability of the AB flow by using a sigma-coordinate model. The periodic domain of integration includes the Pacific/Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, so that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is also simulated; moreover, the forcing is provided by steady climatological surface heat and momentum fluxes. Results show several phenomena of both high and low-frequency variability which {{are found to be}} particularly sensitive to background stratification and the degree of smoothing of the bottom topography. The high-frequency variability is characterized by an anticyclonic wave around the Zapiola Rise: this is interpreted as a superposition of topographic Rossby normal modes which appear to be triggered by the intrinsic low-frequency variability. The latter evidences two distinct regimes of the flow with very different variance, that are connected by rapid transitions. A relatively low variable regime is characterized by a <b>permanent</b> Zapiola <b>Anticyclone</b> located over the Zapiola Rise; a more variable regime is characterized by strong eddy activity, mostly concentrated {{in the southern part of}} the basin, where the Sub-Antarctic Front is located. In general, the AB circulation is found to be strictly related to fluctuations of the position of the ACC fronts. Finally, interesting agreement is found when comparing our model results with altimeter data...|$|R
