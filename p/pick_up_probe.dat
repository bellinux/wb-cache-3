40|$|Atoms or {{pairs of}} ions <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>probe</b> tips used in dynamic force {{microscopy}} (DFM) can be strongly displaced and even hop discontinuously upon {{approach to the}} sample surface. The energy barriers {{for some of those}} hops are of the right order of magnitude to explain the rise in energy dissipation commonly observed in DFM measurements at room temperature. The systematic computations reported here can explain the infrequent jumps and very low average energy dissipation observed low temperature in a previous DFM study on a KBr(001) sample. Close to the surface we indeed find new states separated by small energy barriers which account for those phenomena. These energy barriers strongly depend on details of the atomic arrangement {{in the vicinity of the}} tip apex...|$|R
50|$|In a TOFD system, {{a pair of}} {{ultrasonic}} probes sits {{on opposite}} sides of a weld. One of the probes, the transmitter, emits an ultrasonic pulse that is <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the <b>probe</b> on the other side, the receiver. In undamaged pipes, the signals <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the receiver probe are from two waves: one that travels along the surface and one that reflects off the far wall. When a crack is present, there is a diffraction of the ultrasonic wave from the tip(s) of the crack. Using the measured time of flight of the pulse, the depth of a crack tips can be calculated automatically by simple trigonometry.|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} {{solar wind}} sail {{is a novel}} propellantless space propulsion concept. According to numerical estimates, the electric solar wind sail can produce a large total impulse per propulsion system mass. Here we consider using a 0. 5 N electric solar wind sail for boosting a 550 kg spacecraft to Uranus in less than 6 years. The spacecraft is a stack consisting of the electric solar wind sail module which is jettisoned roughly at Saturn distance, a carrier module and a probe for Uranus atmospheric entry. The carrier module has a chemical propulsion ability for orbital corrections and it uses its antenna for <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> the <b>probe’s</b> data transmission and later relaying it to Earth. The scientific output of the mission is similar to what the Galileo Probe did at Jupiter. Measurements of the chemical and isotope composition of the Uranian atmosphere can give key constraints to different formation theories of the Solar System. A similar method could also be applied to other giant planets and Titan by using a fleet of more or less identical probes...|$|R
30|$|A {{stopwatch}} {{was used}} by the RA to time the exam duration. The stopwatch was started when the EP first interacted with either the machine or the patient in preparation for the EU exam. Examples of machine interaction included plugging in the machine, turning it on, adjusting a machine setting, or <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> a <b>probe.</b> Examples of patient interaction included exposing an area to be examined or applying ultrasound gel. The EP or ancillary personnel moved the ultrasound machine to the patient bedside. The time required to move the machine {{was not included in the}} exam duration. Patient and machine clean-up were not included in the exam duration. When one patient had two or more EU exams for the primary indications (e.g. abdominal and cardiac), each exam was timed separately. In such cases, the end of the first EU exam and the beginning of the second EU exam was recorded as the point in time when the probe was taken off the patient skin for the first EU exam. Similarly, when one patient had a transvaginal and transabdominal pelvic EU exam performed, each exam was timed separately.|$|R
40|$|A new quasi-optical antenna-mixer-array {{design for}} {{terahertz}} frequencies is presented. In the design, antenna and mixer {{are combined into}} an entity, based on the technology in which millimeter-wave horn antenna arrays have been fabricated in silicon wafers. It consists {{of a set of}} forward- and backward-looking horns made with a set of silicon wafers. The front side is used to receive incoming signal, and the back side is used to feed local oscillator signal. Intermediate frequency is led out {{from the side of the}} array. Signal received by the horn array is <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by antenna <b>probes</b> suspended on thin silicon-oxynitride membranes inside the horns. Mixer diodes will be located on the membranes inside the horns. Modeling of such an antenna-mixer-array design is done on a scaled model at microwave frequencies. The impedance matching, RF and LO isolation, and patterns of the array have been tested and analyzed...|$|R

It also received data from Pioneer 5, and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.

40|$|A new millimeter-wave, integrated-circuit, back-to-back, horn-antennamixer array is presented. The {{configuration}} of the array is one called "displaced back-to-back horn-antenna array," which consists {{of a set of}} forward- and backward-looking horns made with a set of silicon wafers. The front side is used to receive the incoming signal, and the back side is used to feed the local oscillator. IF is led out {{from the side of the}} array. Pyramidal-shaped horns in silicon bounded by (111) crystal planes were formed by anisotropic etching of the silicon wafers. The power received by the horns is <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by antenna <b>probes</b> suspended on thin silicon-oxynitride membranes inside the horns. The array is fully two-dimensional, and the horns are made simultaneously by integrated-circuit processing techniques. Aperture efficiency of the horn-antenna array has been improved up to 72 %, and system coupling efficiency is 36 %. In the efficiency measurements, a new thin-film, power-density meter is developed for measuring the asolute power densities. The main applications of the array include imaging, remote sensing and plasma diagnostics...|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} {{is important}} during tissue culture. However, {{there are still}} technical difficulties in monitoring the internal status of cells or tissues. In this paper, microdialysis is adopted to monitor functional tissue growth in a bioreactor. Explanted bovine caudal intervertebral disc (IVD) {{was used as the}} test tissue. A microdialysis membrane probe of 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off was employed and in situ calibration methods with phenol red and fluorescent 40 kDa dextran were developed to measure the relative recovery of the solute of interest, and membrane fouling, respectively. Tissue metabolism was monitored successfully. At the same time soluble macromolecules were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the <b>probe</b> and were detected and quantified by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) and/or Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). These proteins were believed to be associated with biofunction of engineered tissue. Monitoring of phenol red content in the dialysate indicated that there was no significant fouling of the membrane probe during a 7 -day culture period and the Relative Recovery of macromolecules of interests remained roughly 9 %. We concluded that microdialysis could be used to sample a wide range of molecular species released during cell metabolism and extracellular matrix turnover, which were direct or indirect indications of cell and tissue functions. The application of the developed system could be extended to monitor tissue repair in vivo, and the development of the engineered tissue...|$|R
40|$|In some {{applications}} such as quality control of metal components or inspection of large metal structures, inspection systems with rapid scanning capability are required. Of particular interest are systems capable of real-time detection and sizing of surface breaking cracks in metals. Since such systems have to perform the data processing {{in the course of}} scanning, they should be based on NDE techniques with easy detection and inversion capabilities. One technique with these virtues is the alternating current field measurement (ACFM) technique [1]. In this technique, a high frequency uniform field is made incident on the work-piece and the resulting surface potential is sampled using a two-leg contacting probe. The crack signal is essentially a rectangular pulse, Fig. 1. For long cracks it can be shown that the crack depth can be determined from the crack signal using the simple expression (1) d=V 2 −V 1 V 1 ⋅Δ 2 where V 1 and V 2 are voltages <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the <b>probe</b> just before and just after the crack, Fig. 1, and Δ is the probe length. For a non-uniform crack or a non-uniform incident current, however, the above expression is not accurate. In such cases the measured depth dm resulting from (1) should be modified using a multiplier. Multipliers are based on mathematical models relating dm and d for different crack shapes and for different incident fields [1]...|$|R
