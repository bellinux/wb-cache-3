Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the <b>phugoid</b> cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E

25|$|Sankar Chatterjee {{suggested}} in 2005 that, {{in order for}} Microraptor to glide or fly, the forewings and hindwings must have been on different levels (as on a biplane) and not overlaid (as on a dragonfly), and that the latter posture would have been anatomically impossible. Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that Microraptor most likely employed a <b>phugoid</b> style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane wing structure, like those on the tibia and the tail, {{could have been used}} to control drag and alter the flight path, trajectory, etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also used computer algorithms that test animal flight capacity to test whether or not Microraptor was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that Microraptor did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew as opposed to gliding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phugoids</b> {{are often}} {{demonstrated}} to student pilots {{as an example}} of the speed stability of the aircraft and the importance of proper trimming. When it occurs, it is considered a nuisance, and in lighter airplanes (typically showing a shorter period) it can be a cause of pilot-induced oscillation.|$|R

500|$|Another {{species of}} dromaeosaurid, Microraptor gui, {{may have been}} capable of gliding using its {{well-developed}} wings on both the fore and hind limbs. A 2005 study by Sankar Chatterjee suggested that the wings of Microraptor functioned like a split-level [...] "biplane", and that it likely employed a <b>phugoid</b> style of gliding, in which it would launch from a perch and swoop downward in a 'U' shaped curve, then lift again to land on another tree, with the tail and hind wings helping to control its position and speed. Chatterjee also found that Microraptor had the basic requirements to sustain level powered flight in addition to gliding.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1951, OKB-153 {{initiated}} {{the design of}} a twin-engined assault transport aircraft, designated DT-5/8 (Desahntno-Trahnsportnyy [...] – assault transport aircraft), to be powered by two Kuznetsov TV-2 turboprop engines, and fitted with a large rear cargo door to allow vehicles to be driven straight into the hold. On 11 December 1953, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued directive No.2922-1251 to the Antonov OKB, requiring them to build a twin-turboprop transport aircraft derived from the DT-5/8. Bearing the in-house designation Izdeliye P the resulting aircraft followed state-of-the-art practice with a high wing carrying two propeller engines, atop a rectangular-section fuselage, tricycle undercarriage with main gear units housed in pods {{on either side of the}} fuselage, and an upswept rear fuselage providing clearance of the tail unit for loading and unloading. After State acceptance trials, production was not recommended due to poor spin characteristics, directional stability and control issues, nosewheel shimmy, poor controllability when landing in crosswinds above 6m/s (12 kt) and also <b>phugoid</b> oscillations in all three axes which were difficult to control and made piloting the prototype tiring. As well as the aerodynamic faults, the TV-2 engines proved difficult to start with unstable gas dynamics at altitudes above 6,000 m (19,700ft).|$|E
50|$|Since {{the lift}} {{is very much}} greater than the drag, the <b>phugoid</b> is at best lightly damped. A {{propeller}} with fixed speed would help. Heavy damping of the pitch rotation or a large rotational inertia increase the coupling between short period and <b>phugoid</b> modes, so that these will modify the <b>phugoid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{diagrammatic}} representation of a fixed-wing airplane in <b>phugoid</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{unstable}} or divergent <b>phugoid</b> is caused, mainly, {{by a large}} {{difference between}} the incidence angles of the wing and tail. A stable, decreasing <b>phugoid</b> can be attained by building a smaller stabilizer on a longer tail, or, {{at the expense of}} pitch and yaw [...] "static" [...] stability, by shifting the center of gravity to the rear.|$|E
50|$|The <b>phugoid</b> has {{a nearly}} {{constant}} {{angle of attack}} but varying pitch, caused by a repeated exchange of airspeed and altitude. It can be excited by an elevator singlet (a short, sharp deflection followed by {{a return to the}} centered position) resulting in a pitch increase with no change in trim from the cruise condition. As speed decays, the nose drops below the horizon. Speed increases, and the nose climbs above the horizon. Periods can vary from under 30 seconds for light aircraft to minutes for larger aircraft. Microlight aircraft typically show a <b>phugoid</b> period of 15 - 25 seconds, and {{it has been suggested that}} birds and model airplanes show convergence between the <b>phugoid</b> and short period modes. A classical model for the <b>phugoid</b> period can be simplified to about (0.85 × speed in knots) seconds, but this only really works for larger aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The two {{longitudinal}} motions (modes) {{are called}} the short period pitch oscillation (SPPO), and the <b>phugoid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>phugoid,</b> for {{moderate}} amplitude, {{occurs at}} an effectively constant angle of attack, although in practice {{the angle of}} attack actually varies by a few tenths of a degree. This means that the {{stalling angle of attack}} is never exceeded, and it is possible (in the <1g section of the cycle) to fly at speeds below the known stalling speed. Free flight models with badly unstable <b>phugoid</b> typically stall or loop, depending on thrust.|$|E
50|$|The 2003 {{crash of}} the Helios solar-powered {{aircraft}} was precipitated by reacting to an inappropriately diagnosed <b>phugoid</b> oscillation that ultimately made the aircraft structure exceed design loads.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2013, the toy class RC {{airplane}} typically has no elevator control. This is {{to manage}} costs, {{but it also}} allows for simplicity of control by unsophisticated users of all ages. The downside of lack of elevator control is a tendency for the airplane to <b>phugoid.</b> To damp the <b>phugoid</b> oscillation naturally, the planes are designed with high drag which reduces flight performance and flying time. The lack of elevator control also prevents the ability to [...] "pull back" [...] during turns to prevent altitude loss and speed increase.|$|E
5000|$|Proportional (vs. [...] "on-off") {{throttle}} control which {{is critical for}} preventing the excitation of <b>phugoid</b> oscillation ("porpoising") whenever a throttle change is made. It also allows for manageable and steady altitude control and reduction of altitude loss in turns.|$|E
50|$|Another {{challenge}} for pilots who {{are forced to}} fly an aircraft without functioning control surfaces is to avoid the <b>phugoid</b> instability mode (a cycle in which the aircraft repeatedly climbs and then dives), which requires careful use of the throttle.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 {{suffered}} an uncontained engine failure that caused total hydraulic system failure. The crew flew the aircraft with throttle only. Suppressing the <b>phugoid</b> tendency was particularly difficult. The pilots reached Sioux Gateway Airport but crashed during the landing attempt. The pilots {{and a majority}} of the passengers survived.|$|E
50|$|The {{plane was}} tending to pull right, and slowly oscillated {{vertically}} in a <b>phugoid</b> cyclecharacteristic of planes in which control surface command is lost. With each iteration of the cycle, the aircraft lost approximately 1500 ft of altitude. Dennis E.

50|$|In the 1975 Tan Son Nhut C-5 accident, USAF C-5 68-0218 with flight {{controls}} damaged by {{failure of the}} rear cargo/pressure door, encountered <b>phugoid</b> oscillations while the crew was attempting a return to base, and crash-landed in a rice paddy adjacent to the airport. Of the 328 people on board, 153 died, making it the deadliest accident involving a US military aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123 {{lost all}} {{hydraulic}} controls and its vertical stabiliser, {{and went into}} <b>phugoid</b> motion. While the crew were able to maintain near-level flight {{through the use of}} engine power, the plane lost height over a mountain range northwest of Tokyo before crashing into Mount Takamagahara. With 520 deaths it remains the deadliest single-aircraft disaster in history.|$|E
50|$|Oscillating motions can be {{described}} by two parameters, {{the period of time}} required for one complete oscillation, and the time required to damp to half-amplitude, or the time to double the amplitude for a dynamically unstable motion. The longitudinal motion consists of two distinct oscillations, a long-period oscillation called a <b>phugoid</b> mode and a short-period oscillation referred to as the short-period mode.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>phugoid</b> or fugoid [...] is an {{aircraft}} motion {{in which the}} vehicle pitches up and climbs, and then pitches down and descends, accompanied by speeding up and slowing down as it goes [...] "downhill" [...] and [...] "uphill". This {{is one of the}} basic flight dynamics modes of {{an aircraft}} (others include short period, dutch roll, and spiral divergence), and a classic example of a negative feedback system.|$|E
50|$|To reduce {{exposure}} to ground attack, the aircraft was executing a rapid climbout. At about 8,000 feet (2,450 metres), a 9K34 Strela-3 (SA-14 Gremlin) surface-to-air missile struck {{the left wing}} tip. The warhead damaged trailing-edge surfaces of the wing structure and caused a fire. All three hydraulic systems lost pressure and flight controls were disabled. The aircraft pitched rapidly {{up and down in}} a roller-coaster <b>phugoid,</b> oscillating between a nose-up and a nose-down position.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic fluid {{completely}} drained away {{through the}} rupture. With total loss of hydraulic control and non-functional control surfaces, plus {{the lack of}} stabilizing influence from the vertical stabilizer, the aircraft began up and down oscillation in a <b>phugoid</b> cycle. In response, the pilots exerted efforts to establish stability using differential engine thrust. Further measures to exert control, such as lowering the landing gear and flaps, interfered with control by throttle; the aircrew's ability to control the aircraft deteriorated.|$|E
5000|$|... 22 November 2003: DHL shootdown {{incident}} in Baghdad wherein Iraqi insurgents fire an SA-7 [...] "Grail" [...] surface-to-air missile at a European Air Transport Airbus A300 operating {{on behalf of}} DHL. The aircraft takes off from Baghdad airport and the missile strikes the left wing, disabling all three hydraulic systems and setting the wing on fire. The aircraft begins a dangerous <b>phugoid</b> (vertical oscillation) but the crew manages to land safely at the airport, despite being {{able to control the}} aircraft only by adjusting the engine thrust.|$|E
50|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect.

5000|$|If {{the stick}} is held fixed, the {{aircraft}} will not maintain straight and level flight, but {{will start to}} dive, level out and climb again. It will repeat this cycle until the pilot intervenes. This long period oscillation in speed and height is called the <b>phugoid</b> mode. This is analyzed by assuming that the SSPO performs its proper function and maintains the angle of attack near its nominal value. The two states which are mainly affected are the climb angle [...] (gamma) and speed. The small perturbation equations of motion are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{species of}} dromaeosaurid, Microraptor gui, {{may have been}} capable of gliding using its {{well-developed}} wings on both the fore and hind limbs.

Chatterjee also found that Microraptor had the basic requirements to sustain level powered flight in addition to gliding.|$|E
50|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} models in general require additional longitudinal and directional stability, resisting sudden changes in pitch and yaw. While it may be possible for a pilot to respond quickly enough to control an unstable aircraft (such as a Wright Flyer), a radio control scale model of the same aircraft would only be flyable with design adjustments such as increased tail surfaces and wing dihedral for stability, or with avionics providing artificial stability. Free flight models need to have both static and dynamic stability. Static stability is the resistance to sudden changes in pitch and yaw already described, and is typically provided by the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces respectively, and by a forward center of gravity. Dynamic stability is the ability to return to straight and level flight without any control input. The three dynamic instability modes are pitch (<b>phugoid)</b> oscillation, spiral and Dutch roll. An aircraft with too large a horizontal tail on a fuselage that is too short may have a <b>phugoid</b> instability with increasing climbs and dives. With free flight models, this usually results in a stall or loop {{at the end of the}} initial climb. Insufficient dihedral and sweep back will generally lead to increasing spiral turn. Too much dihedral or sweepback generally causes Dutch roll. These all depend on the scale, as well as details of the shape and weight distribution. For example, the paper glider shown here is a contest winner when made of a small sheet of paper but will go from side to side in Dutch roll when scaled up even slightly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{longer period}} mode, called the [...] "phugoid mode" [...] {{is the one}} {{in which there is a}} large-amplitude {{variation}} of air-speed, pitch angle, and altitude, but almost no angle-of-attack variation. The <b>phugoid</b> oscillation is really a slow interchange of kinetic energy (velocity) and potential energy (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the effects of inertia forces and damping forces are very low. Although the damping is very weak, the period is so long that the pilot usually corrects for this motion without being aware that the oscillation even exists. Typically the period is 20-60 seconds. This oscillation can generally be controlled by the pilot.|$|E
50|$|The seed or samara of {{this species}} is unusual in having two flat bracts {{extending}} {{either side of the}} seed to form a wing-like shape with the seed embedded along one long edge and the wings angled slightly back from it. As the seed ripens the wings dry and the long edge furthest from the seed curls slightly upwards. When ripe, the seed drops off and its aerodynamic form allows it to glide away from the tree. The wing spans some 13 cm and can glide for great distances. The seed moves through the air like a butterfly in flight - it gains height, stalls, dips and accelerates, once again producing lift, a process termed <b>phugoid</b> oscillation. In the past it was often found on the decks of ships at sea.|$|E
5000|$|Dutch roll {{is a type}} of {{aircraft}} motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of [...] "tail-wagging" [...] and rocking from side to side. This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include <b>phugoid,</b> short period, and spiral divergence). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.|$|E
50|$|Bryan {{showed that}} the {{stability}} characteristics of airplanes could be separated into longitudinal and lateral groups with the corresponding motions called modes of motion. These modes of motion were either aperiodic, {{which means that the}} airplane steadily approaches or diverges from a trimmed condition, or oscillatory, which means that the airplane oscillates about the trim condition. The longitudinal modes of a statically stable airplane following a disturbance were shown to consist of a long-period oscillation called the <b>phugoid</b> oscillation, usually with a period in seconds about one-quarter of the airspeed in miles per hour and a short-period oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The lateral motion had three modes of motion: an aperiodic mode called the spiral mode that could be a divergence or subsidence, a heavily damped aperiodic mode called the roll subsidence, and a short-period oscillation, usually poorly damped, called the Dutch roll mode.|$|E
5000|$|Lanchester was {{discouraged}} by the attitude to his aeronautical theory, and concentrated on automobile development {{for the next ten}} years. In 1906 he published the first part of a two-volume work, Aerial Flight, dealing with the problems of powered flight [...] In it, he developed a model for the vortices that occur behind wings during flight, which included the first full description of lift and drag. His book was not well received in England, but created interest in Germany where the scientist Ludwig Prandtl mathematically confirmed the correctness of Lanchester’s vortex theory. In his second volume, Lanchester turned his attention to aircraft stability, Aerodonetics , developing his <b>phugoid</b> theory which contained a description of oscillations and stalls. During this work he outlined the basic layout used in most aircraft since then. Lanchester’s contribution to aeronautical science was not recognised until the end of his life.|$|E
