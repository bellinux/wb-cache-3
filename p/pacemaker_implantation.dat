25|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} that represents the clinical consequences of suboptimal atrioventricular (AV) synchrony or AV dyssynchrony, regardless of the pacing mode, after <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantation.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantation,</b> AV {{synchrony}} should be optimized {{to prevent the occurrence}} of pacemaker syndrome. Where patients with optimized AV synchrony have shown great results of implantation and very low incidence of pacemaker syndrome than those with suboptimal AV synchronization.|$|E
25|$|Patients with intact VA {{conduction}} are {{at greater}} risk for developing pacemaker syndrome. Around 90% of patients with preserved AV conduction have intact VA conduction, and about 30-40% of patients with complete AV block have preserved VA conduction. Intact VA conduction may not be apparent at the time of <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantation</b> or even may develop at any time after implantation.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} risk factors for new-onset atrioventricular (AV) block requiring <b>pacemaker</b> (PM) <b>implantation</b> after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). BackgroundHigh-grade AV block and consecutive PM implantation are frequent complications following TAVI. MethodsFor logistic regression analysis, we included 159 patients (mean age: 81 ± 6 years, EuroSCORE: 22 ± 13 %) who underwent TAVI (n = 116 transfemoral, n = 4 via subclavian artery, n = 37 transapical, n = 2 transaortic) between June 2007 and January 2009 and who had no previously implanted PM. ResultsThirty-five patients (22 %) developed new-onset post-operative AV block with the need of PM implantation. Logistic regression revealed a 2 -fold increased risk for new-onset AV block in patients in whom a large valve is implanted in a small annulus (32 % <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantations,</b> odds ratio [OR]: 2. 378, p = NS), a 4 -fold increased risk with the implantation of the CoreValve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) versus the Edwards Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) (27 % <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantations,</b> OR: 3. 781, p = NS), and a 5 -fold increased risk for patients who exhibit an AV block episode instantly during the implantation procedure (49 % <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantations,</b> OR: 4. 819, p = 0. 001). Pre-existing ECG alterations were not identified as risk factors for AV block after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. ConclusionsWe assume that conduction tissue impairment is provoked by mechanical compression with large prostheses in smaller annuli or in the larger area of the CoreValve covering the outflow tract and may appear instantly during the implantation procedure. Continuous post-operative electrocardiogram monitoring should be performed for at least 3 days in all patients after TAVI procedures and until discharge in patients with increased risk for this complication...|$|R

40|$|Pneumothorax is a mild {{complication}} during <b>pacemaker</b> lead <b>implantation</b> {{using the}} subclavian puncture technique. We report on five-year experience in 433 <b>pacemaker</b> lead <b>implantation</b> procedures in 379 patients. The cephalic vein route was solely used in twelve patients. Three procedures were performed {{over time in}} four patients and one patient needed four repetitive punctures for <b>pacemaker</b> lead <b>implantation</b> and replacement. Thus 421 punctures were carried out in 367 patients. Eleven case of pneumothorax were observed: in eight patients (1. 9 %) a partial pneumothorax occurred and in three patients (0. 7 %) the pneumothorax was nearly complete. In the latter patients a chest tube was inserted and hospital admission was prolonged for 3, 6 and 6 days, respectively.

25|$|Individuals {{with a low}} {{heart rate}} prior to <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantation</b> are more at risk of {{developing}} pacemaker syndrome. Normally the first chamber of the heart (atrium) contracts as the second chamber (ventricle) is relaxed, allowing the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood out of the heart. When the timing between the two chambers goes out of synchronization, less blood is delivered on each beat. Patients who develop pacemaker syndrome may require adjustment of the pacemaker, or fitting of another lead to better coordinate the timing of atrial and ventricular contraction.|$|E
50|$|The results up to 100 months {{follow-up}} {{are showing}} better outcome than clinical measures or <b>pacemaker</b> <b>implantation</b> with changing the tilt-test on to normal and by absence of syncope {{in more than}} 90% of patients without medications.|$|E

40|$|Repeated <b>implantation</b> of <b>pacemaker</b> in {{the same}} patient is a common {{occurrence}} because of the increased longevity of patients.

50|$|A {{frequent}} type of sycnope, termed {{vasovagal syncope}} is originated by intense cardioinhibition, mediated {{by a sudden}} vagal reflex, that causes transitory cardiac arrest by asystole and/or transient total atrioventricular block.

50|$|For TIC due to atrial fibrillation, rate control, rhythm control, and RF {{catheter}} ablation can {{be effective}} to control the tachyarrhythmia and improve left ventricular systolic function. For TIC due to atrial flutter, rate control {{is often difficult to}} achieve, and RF catheter ablation has a relatively high success rate with a low risk of complications. In patients with TIC due to other types of SVT, RF catheter ablation is recommended as a first-line treatment. In patients with TIC due to VT or PVCs, both antiarrhythmics and RF catheter ablation can be used. However, the options for antiarrhythmic agents are limited because certain agents can be proarrhythmic in the setting of myocardial dysfunction in TIC. Therefore, RF catheter ablation is often a safe and effective choice for treatment VT and PVCs causing TIC.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} rigid pericardial endoscopy as the promising minimally invasive approach to the pericardial space was evaluated. Techniques for cell transplantation, epicardial <b>pacemaker</b> lead <b>implantation,</b> and epicardial ablation were developed. Methods Two swine and 5 canines were studied to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rigid pericardial endoscopy. After a double pericardiocentesis, a transurethral rigid endoscope was inserted into the pericardial space. The technique to obtain a clear visual field was examined, and acute complications such as hemodynamic changes and the effects on intra-pericardial pressure were evaluated. Using custom-made needles, pacemaker leads, and forceps, the applications for cell transplantation, epicardial <b>pacemaker</b> lead <b>implantation,</b> and epicardial ablation were also evaluated. Results The use of air, the detention of a stiff guide wire in the pericardial space, and the stretching of the pericardium with the rigid endoscope were all useful to obtain a clear visual field. A side-lying position also aided observation of the posterior side of the heart. As a cell transplantation methodology, we developed an ultrasonography-guided needle, which allows for the safe visualization of transplantation without major complications. Pacemaker leads were safely and properly implanted, which provides a better outcome for cardiac resynchronizing therapy. Furthermore, the success of clear visualization of the pulmonary veins enabled us to perform epicardial ablation.
