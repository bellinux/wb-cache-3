5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor was the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and its {{championship}} game MVP. According to pregame media coverage, he presented a contrasting style to Stanford's Luck. Taylor gained threw for 2,521yards {{and set a}} school record with 23 passing touchdowns, but was praised primarily for his <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> and ability to avoid defensive pressure, something Luck lacked. Taylor's presence was a contributing factor to Tech's offensive success in 2010. Virginia Tech's offense was the most productive since offensive coordinator Bryan Stinespring joined the team in 2001. It set team records for points and total yards, and led the ACC in scoring and red-zone efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the broad}} variety of {{operating}} conditions, these devices must meet specific requirements concerning their rate and duration of cooling, their power source, and their adherence to health and safety regulations. Among other criteria are the user's need for <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> and autonomy. For example, active-liquid systems operate by chilling water and circulating it through a garment; the skin surface area is thereby cooled through conduction. This type of system has proven successful in certain military, law enforcement, and industrial applications. Bomb-disposal technicians wearing special suits to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) use a small, ice-based chiller unit that is strapped to one leg; a liquid-circulating garment, usually a vest, is worn over the torso to maintain a safe core body temperature. By contrast, soldiers traveling in combat vehicles can face microclimate temperatures in excess of 65°C and require a multiple-user, vehicle-powered cooling system with rapid connection capabilities. Requirements for hazmat teams, the medical community, and workers in heavy industry vary further.|$|E

40|$|Background. Wearable accelerometry devices allow {{collection}} of high-density activity data in large epidemiological studies both in-the-lab {{as well as}} in-the-wild (free-living). Such data {{can be used to}} detect and identify periods of sustained harmonic walking. This report aims to establish whether the micro- and macro-features of walking identified in the laboratory and free-living environments are associated with measures of <b>physical</b> function, <b>mobility,</b> fatigability, and fitness. Methods. Fifty-one older adults (median age 77. 5) enrolled in the Developmental Epidemiologic Cohort Study in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were included in the analyses. The study included an in-the-lab component as well as 7 days of monitoring in-the-wild. Participants were equipped with hip-worn Actigraph GT 3 X+ activity monitors, which collect high-density raw accelerometry data. We applied a walking identification algorithm to the data and defined features of walking, such as participant-specific walking acceleration and cadence. The association between these walking features and <b>physical</b> function, <b>mobility,</b> fatigability, and fitness was quantified using linear regression analysis. Results. Micro-scale features of walking (acceleration and cadence) estimated from in-the-lab and in-the-wild data were associated with measures of <b>physical</b> function, <b>mobility,</b> fatigability, and fitness. In-the-lab median walking acceleration was strongly inversely associated with <b>physical</b> function, <b>mobility,</b> fatigability and fitness. Additionally, in-the-wild daily walking time was inversely associated with usual- and fast-paced 400 m walking time. Conclusions. The proposed accelerometry-derived walking features are significantly associated with measures of <b>physical</b> function, <b>mobility,</b> fatigability, and fitness, which provides evidence of convergent validity...|$|R

500|$|When the exorcists {{are given}} the mission to save General Cross Marian from the Noah clan, she {{believes}} Allen was killed on the journey by her former ally Suman Dark. As she copes with this, Lenalee defeats a Level 3 Akuma attacking her group's ship. She then coaxes more power from her Innocence than she can safely handle, reducing her ability to use her boots {{as well as her}} <b>physical</b> <b>mobility.</b> During this state, her Innocence becomes a crystal to protect her from harm, a behavior unheard of in Innocence. This leads the Millennium Earl to believe that Lenalee might possess the [...] "Great Heart" [...] that both exorcists and the Noah search for as the user of it will win the war. However, the Earl tries to take her, but the exorcist is saved by the returning Allen. The group is then trapped in Noah's Ark where their enemies try to kill the exorcist before the Ark is destroyed. With Cross' help, Allen saves the Ark. After returning to the Black Order, a Level 4 Akuma attacks the HQ, and many people are injured or killed. Lenalee willingly expresses a desire to become an exorcist. Accepting her conviction, the Innocence grants her greater power, becoming a never-before-seen evolved Equipment-type, dubbed a Crystal-type. These new Boots are made up of Lenalee's blood and repair themselves as long as she has blood in her body. When the Dark Boots are in their dormant state, they form two blood-red anklets. With these powers, she saves Allen from the Level 4 Akuma whom they manage to exorcise thanks to Cross.|$|E

2500|$|Shorter {{stirrups}} {{require a}} rider {{to keep the}} knees bent at a greater angle. When riding in a short stirrup, the rider {{has the ability to}} partially stand up and get the seat clear of the saddle. This allows more mobility than a longer stirrup would, but at the cost of having less feel of the horse and less security. It is a position designed to help the horse achieve greater speed, and also allows the rider greater <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> in the saddle. When riding with short stirrups, the rider often adopts what is known as a forward seat, thus inhibiting the horse's balance and athletic maneuverings as little as possible. In the past, this style was preferred by light cavalry. These fighters required speed and needed the flexibility to turn their own bodies in any direction to use light weapons such as the bow, javelin, short swords, and later, the rifle and pistol. The horsemen of Central Asia, such as the Mongols, used this type of stirrup, as did the Islamic Bedouin and Moors of the Middle East and North Africa. Historically, this type of stirrup adjustment and the seat it produced was called la jineta. Modern Jockeys, eventers, and show jumping riders use this type of stirrup, as do some cowboys when performing certain jobs that require a forward position to allow agility of horse and rider, such as calf roping ...|$|E

Focusing on lifestyle rock climbers (a particular type of lifestyle mobility dedicated {{to the pursuit of}} climbing) and events provides evidence for the ways informational and <b>physical</b> <b>mobilities</b> contribute to and even regiment rock climbing travel rhythms, while the everyday rhythms of place illustrate embodiment as crucial to the enfolding of rhythm and mobilities.

40|$|Out-of-home {{mobility}} {{is necessary}} for accessing commodities, making use of neighborhood facilities, and participation in meaningful social, cultural, and <b>physical</b> activities. <b>Mobility</b> also promotes healthy aging {{as it relates to}} the basic human need of <b>physical</b> move-ment. <b>Mobility</b> is typically assessed either with standardized performance-based tests or with self-reports of perceived difficulty in carrying out specific mobility tasks. Mobility declines with increasing age, and the most complex and demanding tasks are affected first. Sometimes people cope with declining functional capacity by making changes in their way or frequency of doing these tasks, thus avoiding facing manifest difficulties. From the physiological point of view, walking is an integrated result of the functioning of the mus-culoskeletal, cardio-respiratory, sensory and neural systems. Studies have shown that interventions aiming to increase muscle strength will also improve <b>mobility.</b> <b>Physical</b> activity counseling, an educational intervention aiming to increase physical activity, may also pre-vent mobility decline among older people. Sensory deficits, such as poor vision and hearing may increase the risk of mobility decline. Consequently, rehabilitation of sensory functions may prevent falls and decline in mobility. To promote mobility, it is not enough to target only individuals because environmental barriers to mobility may also accelerate mobility decline among older people.
