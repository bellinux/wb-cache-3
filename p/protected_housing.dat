With a reduced inoculum size, tumor takes do not occur in mice kept in the <b>protected</b> <b>housing,</b> but do occur with spatial disorientation. With a larger inoculum size, tumor takes occur in all untreated mice, and the weight of spontaneous lung metastasis is significantly increased by spatial disorientation. For mice in <b>protected</b> <b>housing,</b> cyclophosphamide results in the absence of macroscopically detectable tumors in all of the treated mice, whereas the use of spatial disorientation abolishes this therapeutic action. The antimetastatic effects of razoxane are also reduced by rotational stress. These results indicate that housing conditions and a psychological stressor can control tumor takes and metastasis formation. They also indicate that host's antitumor resistance effectors, which are susceptible to neuroendocrine modulation by environmental and psychological stressors, participate to determine the effectiveness of the treatment with a cytotoxic (cyclophosphamide) and antimetastatic (razoxane) antitumor drug...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Model housing like {{a part of}} {{self-contained}} {{rehabilitation of}} children with combinated handicap In my thesis I deal with the following subject: Model housing like a part of self-contained rehabilitation of children with combinated handicap. The model housing is totally new project which Children´s Centre ARPIDA in České Budějovice (hereinafter DC ARPIDA ") took up {{as part of its}} services. The project has been running for two years and its implementation is realized in the second grade of vocational tranining school of DC ARPIDA in the building of The model <b>protected</b> <b>housing.</b> The aim of the project is to teach children with physical and combined handicap predefined activities. These predefined model activities should enlarge their independence from other persons and increase the extent of their self-sufficiency in common and extended daily activities connected with housing. The model <b>protected</b> <b>housing</b> is designed for children who attend the two-year vocational tranining school in DC ARPIDA where they go through three month´s course of the model <b>protected</b> <b>housing.</b> At the beginning of the course the children go through ergo-therapeutical examination to determine the rate of their independence and self-sufficiency. After finishing the course they are reviewed to find out whether they have improved their results and how they have profited from passing through the course. The main goal of my thesis is to investigate whether The model <b>protected</b> <b>housing</b> contributes to the increasing of the client´s level of seff-sufficiency and why it has a great importance in the system of education and physiotherapy. Another goal which should be followed is to show how the children´s parents see the project as a whole, whether they want their children to take part in this project, if they support the idea of a separate living and how they want their children to live in the future. I used the questionnaire method and the secondary data analysis to verify the given hypotheses. The interviewed group was made up of the parents of children clients of DC ARPIDA. My main aim was to investigate how much they are informed about the possibilities of integration of their children to the society, in what ways the parents are able to support them, their willingness to assist in this proccess and what is their idea of their children´s future life. The proccess of integration is not only the result of school classes or experts´ and school staff´s effort but first of all it is the parents who are supposed {{to be the most important}} link in the proccess of integration. Their position in the proccess of successful integration is irreplaceable. The input and output physiotherapy results were used for the secondary analysis. On the basis of data obtained from this analysis it is possible to claim that the model activities which the children performed in the model <b>protected</b> <b>housing</b> help to increase the rate of independance from an other person and of everyday self-sufficiency. With respect to explicit results of the research it is possible to draw the conclusion that in all cases the course of model <b>protected</b> <b>housing</b> increases the function rate of self-sufficiency and independence from the others in the model activities. Thereby the basis hypothesis has been clearly confirmed...|$|E

Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} summarize available informations about adventure therapy (definition, history, characteristic features, etc.) and determine how therapeutic communities in the Czech Republic use adventure therapy in treatment of addictions, what are the views and attitudes of therapists who organize stressful programs, and what are the problems in organization of stressful programs. Methods: This is a qualitative research conducted using quastionnaires and semistructed interviews with experts who work in therapeutic communities in the Czech Republic.

40|$|Abstract. Background: For {{developing}} nations {{the development of}} sustainable communities has to {{go hand in hand}} with the achievement of wider goals, where emphasis has to be given to the importance of lifestyle and social change. This inter- disciplinary research draws understanding from the social, cultural and economic studies to define the values and aspirations of the middle class and the associated implications for sustainable housing. Middle-class​ mores are aspirational and aim to achieve Western living standards, moving away from a traditional communitarian social model. Methods and Results: This research presents the results of extensive fieldwork in the Southern-Indian city of Mysore that defines the values held by the emergent middle class in respect to the built environment. Common areas and shared spaces have traditionally been very actively used and have played a crucial role in both passive cooling strategies and the maintenance of socially sustainable communities. Fieldwork shows that attitudes to the built environment are polarised between well-maintained and <b>protected</b> <b>housing</b> interiors and poorly organised and maintained external spaces and examines how these transition spaces are used to reflect these values and concerns. Possible options for the external boundary conditions are tested by generating 3 D models and applying an environmental design method, Inte- grated Environmental Solutions (IES). Conclusion: The paper reflects on whether earlier traditions in sustainable building design in South Asia (Mysore) have relevance in a contemporary context and the importance of understanding the changing preferences and values of the newly affluent demographic...|$|E

40|$|Slovene {{real estate}} market {{in recent years is}} facing with one of the major crisis. Mass housing {{construction}} in recent years well filled the market, but also because of the onset of the economic crisis, demand fell sharply. The question is how, in future, focus and revive the housing market and answer to that is only possible by identifying the actual housing needs of different target customer segments. If we look at the demographic picture, we see that Slovenia is in a period of rising share of the elderly population, which according to the demographic projections for the next few decades there is no end in sight. These people have special housing needs. Residential care seems too expensive in times like these, therefore I recognized construction of <b>protected</b> <b>housing</b> for elderly as one of the possible orientations. Adequate lounge is among the basic human needs, so I used the survey to examine, which items are those, that in seniors increase quality of the living environment. By multicriterial analysis I determined the target modification of the facility. By comparing the cost estimates and calculation of the profitability for the initial and modified project, I found that timely recognized market orientation, analysis and modification of the project can deliver better business results and thus lead to the recovery of the housing market. I find an approach - the identification of the needs of real estate buyers, the basis for the development of real estate projects in the field of residential construction. in osnova za razvoj vseh nepremičninskih projektov na področju stanovanjske gradnje...|$|E
40|$|The Effectiveness of Therpay for Drug Addicts and Their Integration within Society The {{purpose of}} my thesis "The Effectiveness of Therapy for Drug Addicts and Their Integration in Society" is to {{elucidate}} {{the lifestyles of}} addicts during different stages of therapy and to help people to understand the problems of drug addicts. The function of the brain can be altered {{by a number of}} psycho-active drugs that can influence a person's behavior, conscience, morals and mood. Drug addiction results in an uncontrollable urge to acquire drugs, regardless of the consequences. This behavior leads to a gradual exclusion of the drug addict from society. Re-integration into society must be the goal of treatment. The social exclusion of addicts seriously hampers their attemts to find employment. Many addicts started to use illicit drugs before the age of 18 years. Their education has not been completed and their bonds with their family members have been broken. Health problems caused by drugs, alcohol, a low quality nourishment, often untreated infections, poor hygiene, poor or absent living arrangements are factors that contribute to the exclusion of drug addicts from society. The abstinence from drugs, for longer than three months, creates a precondition for recovery and re-integration into society. However, {{in the absence of a}} postive change in attitude of the addict towards society and in the abscence of a social safety net, drug abstinence alone does not represent a reliably positive prognostic indicator. Complex social services that include <b>protected</b> <b>housing,</b> employment, job counselling, out-patient or in-patient psychotherapy, are necessary for successful treatment...|$|E
