50|$|A {{glory hole}} {{in the context of}} the {{offshore}} petroleum industry is an excavation into the sea floor designed to protect the wellhead equipment installed at the surface of a <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> from icebergs or pack ice. An economically attractive alternative for exploiting offshore petroleum resources is a floating platform; however, ice can pose a serious hazard to this solution. While floating platforms can be built to withstand ice loading up to a design threshold, for the largest icebergs or the thickest pack ice the only sensible alternative is to move out of the way. Floating platforms can be disconnected from the wellheads in order to allow them to be moved away from threatening ice, but the wellhead equipment is fixed in place and hence vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the laboratory studies on G cement characteristics with respect to the free water, fluid loss, strength development and thickening time when palm oil fly ash (POFA) is added to the cement slurry. Laboratory experiments had been carried out by using G-cement slurry with various amount and types of standard <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> cement additivies, and various amount of palm oil fly ash. The ASTM-C 114 procedures was used for the chemical analysis and API Spec. 10 procedures under atmospheric and reservoir conditions for the cement characteristics. The results show that less free water and fluid loss, and better strength development and thickening time when palm oil fly ash is added to the cement slurry. From these results, it can be concluded that palm oil fly ash can be used as an additive for <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> cement and G-cement characteristics can be improved when palm oil fly ash was added to the cement slurry. Palm oil fly ash is compatible to be used with others standard <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> cement additives. Therefore, the total cement material cost can be reduced since palm oil fly ash is a local product. In addition, the <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> cement formulation can be improved for better strength, fluid loss and free water content...|$|E

40|$|The {{producing}} {{performance of}} a <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> depends in great part on a good primary cementing job. In a high-quality cement job, mud and gas channels have been permanently prevented, {{and there is a}} complete hydraulic seal between the casing and formation throughout the zone of interest. To properly use the available cements, additives were used to control the major cement properties, including thickening time, fluid-loss rate, free water and compressive strength. Currently, all additives were imported from oversea, therefore studies have been carried out to determine rice husk ash potential {{to be used as a}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> cement additive. The paper presents the results of laboratory experiments on G cement performance with respect to fluid loss, free water, compressive strength and thickening time when rice husk ash (RHA) was added to the cement slurry. Various burning time, RHA particles size and amounts had been used, and Halad 322 s as a standard additive. All experiments have been conducted according to American Petroleum Institute (API) Specification 10. The results show that fluid loss volume, free water content and thickening time decreases, and compressive strength increases as the amount of RHA added increases, RHA particles size decreases and burning time increases. RHA performance generally better than Halad 322 in respect to fluid loss and free water, and lower than Halad 322 s in term of compressive strength and thickening time, but still within API Spec. 10 requirements. Therefore, RHA is suitable for application in <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> cementing operation, particularly as fluid loss control agent for class G cement...|$|E
30|$|Elemental analysis, Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR), 1 H-NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, {{and surface}} tension {{methods have been}} used to characterize the molecular structure and the aggregation behaviors of two asphaltenic fractions derived, respectively, from an Algerian <b>petroleum</b> <b>well</b> and a corresponding storage tank deposit. Elemental analysis, FTIR, 1 H-NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to investigate the chemical composition and structural parameters of asphaltenes, while the surface tension method was used to measure the critical micelle concentration (CMC) in organic solvents with different solubility parameters and polarities in order to characterize the asphaltenes’ aggregation behaviors. Results show that the unstable asphaltenes fraction extracted from the storage tank deposit possesses a higher polarity (higher heteroatoms content) and a lower aromaticity than stable asphaltenes from the <b>petroleum</b> <b>well.</b> The CMC results indicate that asphaltenes with high polarity and low aromaticity have a high solubility in polar solvents such as nitrobenzene, whereas asphaltenes with low polarity and high aromaticity are more soluble in solvents with weak polarity, like toluene. It is concluded that the difference of structure of asphaltene samples and polarity of solvents can lead to difference of aggregation behaviors.|$|E
30|$|Abandoned wells {{come with}} several {{features}} that are desirable for geothermal energy production. Clauser and Ewert (2018) showed that the geothermal energy {{is one of the}} most cost-effective ways in energy production, which, however, comes with high investment costs. Drilling a geothermal well is usually time-consuming and expensive, in the same way as drilling a <b>petroleum</b> <b>well.</b> By making use of an already drilled <b>petroleum</b> <b>well,</b> huge amount of costs can be saved. In Bu et al. (2012), the major cost is reduced by 50 % when using an existing well. Existing wells also offer the opportunity to extend length of drilled wells to a deeper depth or drill a lateral to access improved thermal conditions or geothermal reservoirs farther away at a lower cost. In addition, providing further use of abandoned wells can eliminate liabilities related to plug and abandonment, because abandoning a well is a high-cost process. In consequence, most wells are done at the minimal cost and they meet the minimal obligations set by regulating agencies. Offering the chance to lower these costs by converting petroleum wells to geothermal wells will save a lot of investment costs for heat extraction.|$|E
