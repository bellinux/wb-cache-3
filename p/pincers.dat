5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, as {{they have}} {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat them. When provoked, they spread their <b>pincers</b> {{and in some cases}} raise their abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with the sting ready for immediate use. Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its <b>pincers</b> on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller <b>pincers</b> on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E

40|$|The ECE-pincer ligand {{framework}} contains several {{positions that}} are readily functionalized {{and by doing}} so offer a wealth of possibilities to modify and fine-tune the structural and electronic properties of the metal centre in ECE-pincer metal complexes. Many ECE-type <b>pincer</b> metal complexes show remarkable catalytic performances {{in a number of}} catalytic reactions. With the aim to achieve enantioselective transformations, the development of chiral <b>pincer</b> metal complexes has been an integral part of <b>pincer</b> chemistry. The development of ECE’-type (E≠=/=E’) <b>pincer</b> metal complexes is a relatively new aspect of <b>pincer</b> chemistry. In such ECE’-type <b>pincer</b> complexes, the combination and cooperation of two different types of donor atom groups, E and E’, could lead to very interesting electronic and structural properties of the metal centers, which in turn could lead to improved catalytic performances. This thesis reports about a novel series of PCN- and PCS-pincer Pd- and Pt-complexes, phosphite P’CP’-pincer Pd-complexes, C,P-cyclometalated Pd- and Pt-complexes, and P-chiral phosphoramidite-pincer Pd-complexes. It provides an overview of the fine-tuning of the geometrics and electronic properties of these phosphorus-based <b>pincer</b> metal complexes through appropriate organic transformations of the <b>pincer</b> ligand. The newly reported <b>pincer</b> complexes were found to be active catalysts in C-P cross coupling, homoallylation, tandem catalytic, and aza-Michael addition reactions. Several aspects of this study deserve special attention. First of all, the development of new P-chiral <b>pincer</b> complexes derived from readily available chiral amino alcohols provide access to a library of new P-chiral phosphoramidite <b>pincer</b> metal complexes with great potential in enantioselective catalysis. Moreover, the synthetic protocol toward a series of electronically and structurally fine-tuned PCE-pincer metal complexes (E = N and S) using isovanillin as the common intermediate holds a great promising for the synthesis of new tailor-made ECE’-type <b>pincer</b> metal complexes. The combination and possible cooperativity of different E-donors has proven potential to alter the catalytic activities of <b>pincer</b> complexes. The further development of PCE-pincer metal complexes could, therefore, provide a stepping stone to improve and extend their application in homogeneous catalysis...|$|R

5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} {{like those}} of grasshoppers. The mandibles appear as large <b>pincers</b> {{on the front of}} some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, {{originally}} planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation Rübezahl (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation Hackfleisch (Minced Meat). Hackfleisch aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the <b>pincers</b> of the other units, thereby destroying them.|$|E
40|$|The {{utilisation}} of recyclable <b>pincer</b> complexes {{in applied}} catalysis {{is a vital}} progression {{in the field of}} homogeneous catalysis. This is routed in the high thermal and mechanical stability that most <b>pincer</b> complexes demonstrate. The <b>pincer</b> framework of a tridentate bis-chelating ligand system, with two dative appendages and a direct metal ligand ?-bond, shows higher stability than most other coordination complexes. This is essential to testing immobilisation and recycling methods for homogeneous catalysis. We review herein efforts made towards the efficient immobilisation (heterogenisation) of homogeneous <b>pincer</b> complexes, and their application in a variety of catalytic processes. Recycling of <b>pincer</b> complexes, as described herein, does not display high rates of ligand and metal leaching. The outcome of this is an array of homogeneous catalyst immobilisation techniques which can be probed using <b>pincer</b> complexes...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{development}} of new <b>pincer</b> complex-catalyzed transformations. Optimization of the catalytic properties (fine-tuning) was directed to increase the catalytic activity as well as the chemo-, stereo- and enantioselectivity of the complexes. This was achieved by varying the heteroatoms in the terdentate <b>pincer</b> ligand, by changing the electronic properties of the coordinated aryl moiety and by implementing chiral functionalities in the <b>pincer</b> complexes. In the cross-coupling reaction of vinyl epoxides and aziridines with organoboronic acids the chemoselectivity of the reaction could be increased by employment of <b>pincer</b> complexes instead of commonly used Pd(0) catalysts. Furthermore, the introduction of a methoxy substituent in the aromatic subunit of the complex considerably increased the activity of the <b>pincer</b> complex catalyst. Fine-tuning of the enantioselectivity in electrophilic allylation reactions was achieved by using a wide variety of new BINOL- and biphenanthrol-based <b>pincer</b> complexes. The highest enantioselectivity (85 % ee) was obtained by applying biphenanthrol-based <b>pincer</b> complexes. Stereoselective <b>pincer</b> complex-catalyzed condensation of sulfonylimines with isocyanoacetate could be achieved under mild reaction conditions. By application of chiral PCP catalysts, 2 -imidazolines could be obtained with up to 86 % ee. A new <b>pincer</b> complex-catalyzed C-H bond functionalization based reaction between organonitriles and sulfonylimines affords homoallylic amines and beta-aminonitriles in high yields. The asymmetric version of this process affords beta-aminonitriles with up to 71 % ee. In the last chapter, a <b>pincer</b> complex-catalyzed redox coupling reaction is described. In this highly regio- and stereoselective process the integrity of the <b>pincer</b> catalysts is fully retained. This catalytic reaction proceeds {{with a high level of}} functional group tolerance, as allylic acetate and aryl halide functionalities are retained...|$|R
5|$|The German {{offensive}} against the Soviet Union began early on 22 June 1941 with an artillery barrage. The 16th Panzer Division was subordinated to Heeresgruppe Süd (Army Group South) {{under the command}} of Generalfeldmarschall Von Rundstedt. The goal, together with the 6. Armee and 17. Armee as well as Panzergruppe I, was to follow the <b>pincers</b> of both armies, heading for Kiev and rolling up the Soviet flanks in the process, and finally encircling them at the Dnieper River. The main objective was to conquer the economically important Donets Basin as well as the oil field in the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|The chelicerae ("claw horns") {{that give}} the sub-phylum its name {{normally}} consist of three sections, and the claw is formed by the third section and a rigid extension of the second. However, spiders' have only two sections, and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first when not in use. The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions' are tiny <b>pincers</b> {{that are used in}} feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.|$|E
5|$|The prosoma {{is formed}} in the embryo by fusion of the acron, which carries the eyes, with {{segments}} two to seven, which all have paired appendages, while segment one is lost during the embryo's development.

In primitive forms the acron has a pair of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes") in the middle. The mouth is between segments two and three.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Bennetts {{teamed with}} state {{botanist}} Charles Gardner {{to study the}} toxic effect of native plants species on sheep.

Based on this and later research, Gardner and Bennetts published The Toxic Plants of Western Australia in 1956. During 1935, investigations into the effects of castrating male lambs with either mechanical <b>pincers</b> compared to using a knife, both of these methods have since been replaced with rubber elastrator rings.

5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their <b>pincers</b> and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E

5|$|Four {{weeks into}} the campaign, the Germans {{realized}} they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies and General Bock quickly {{came to the conclusion}} that not only had the Red Army offered stiff opposition, but German difficulties were also due to the logistical problems with reinforcements and provisions. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation. Hitler by now had lost faith in battles of encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the <b>pincers.</b> He now believed he could defeat the Soviet state by economic means, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov, the Donbass and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major center of military production, in the north.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} motor evoked potentials (MEPs) {{and duration}} of the cortical silent period (CSP) from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left motor cortex in ten healthy subjects performing different manual tasks. They abducted the index finger alone, pressed a strain gauge with the {{thumb and index finger}} in a <b>pincer</b> grip, and squeezed a 4 -cm brass cylinder with all digits in a power grip. The level of FDI EMG activity across tasks was kept constant by providing subjects with acoustic-visual feedback of their muscle activity. The TMS elicited larger amplitude FDI MEN during <b>pincer</b> and power grip than during the index finger abduction task, and larger amplitude MEPs during <b>pincer</b> gripping than during power gripping. The CSP was shorter during <b>pincer</b> and power grip than during the index finger abduction task and shorter during power gripping than during <b>pincer</b> gripping. These results suggest excitatory and inhibitory task-dependent changes in the motor cortex. Complex manual tasks (<b>pincer</b> and power gripping) elicit greater motor cortical excitation than a simple task (index finger abduction) presumably because they activate multiple synergistic muscles thus facilitating corticomotoneurons. The finger abduction task probably yielded greater motor cortical inhibition than the <b>pincer</b> and power tasks because muscles uninvolved in the task activated the cortical inhibitory circuit. Increased cortical excitatory and inhibitory functions during precision tasks (<b>pincer</b> gripping) probably explain why MEPs have larger amplitudes and CSPs have longer durations during <b>pincer</b> gripping than during power gripping...|$|R

5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates have {{segmented}} {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma, except that mites have lost a visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest <b>pincers</b> used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as {{the oldest and most}} primitive group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.|$|E
