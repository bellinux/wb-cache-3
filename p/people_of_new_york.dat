After the American Revolutionary War, the lands passed to the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Fire Department has rebuilt itself and continues to serve the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> During the Northeast Blackout of 2003, FDNY was called on to rescue hundreds of people from stranded elevators in approximately 800 Manhattan high-rise office and apartment buildings. The entire fire department was held over from the day tour to almost double the total force to 3,401 firefighters to handle the many fires which resulted, reportedly from people using candles for light.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> are {{estimated}} to have arrived around 10,000 BC. Around AD 800, Iroquois ancestors moved into the area from the Appalachian region. The <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the Point Peninsula Complex were the predecessors <b>of</b> the Algonquian <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> By around 1100, the distinct Iroquoian-speaking and Algonquian-speaking cultures that would eventually be encountered by Europeans had developed. The five nations of the Iroquois League developed a powerful confederacy about the 15th century that controlled territory throughout present-day <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> into Pennsylvania around the Great Lakes. For centuries, the Mohawk cultivated maize fields in the lowlands of the Mohawk River, which were later taken over by Dutch settlers at Schenectady, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> when they bought this territory. The Iroquois nations to the west also had well-cultivated areas and orchards.|$|R

25|$|Tensions {{were high}} in New York {{at this time}} due to the recent Seneca Falls Convention, at which 68 women and 32 men out of 300 {{attendees}} signed the now-famous Declaration of Sentiments, which listed men's abuses of women's freedom and rights. The event was still fresh {{in the minds of}} the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> and the Protestant men of Buffalo felt threatened, increasing their strong objection to the educated, Catholic females who were running a now-state funded hospital. Buffalo's elite began speaking out against the Sisters Hospital and its state funding, criticizing its all-female leadership, lack of physicians' influence in decision making, and small staff. In early February 1850, Protestant doctors Josiah Trowbridge, Austin Flint, and James White privately complained to Lord, possibly Buffalo's most influential citizen at the time, about the administration of the hospital, arguing that three Sisters alone was not proper for the management of an entire hospital. He was enraged, seeing it not only as a religious threat but a political concern.|$|E

[...] He claims that, by 1820, it was clear that [...] "Empire State" [...] was in wide use, though he is doubtful that a clear origin of the term will ever be determined.

Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down {{in some parts of the}} city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the toilet. Articles copied into Alan Alda's book The Last Days of M*A*S*H include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York City public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the City's history. They attributed this to the fact that in the three minutes after the finale ended, around 77% of the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City flushed their toilets.

2500|$|La Guardia loathed the gangsters {{who brought}} a {{negative}} stereotype and shame to the Italian community. His first action as mayor was {{to order the}} chief of police to arrest mob boss Lucky Luciano on whatever charges could be found. La Guardia then went after the gangsters with a vengeance, stating in a radio address to the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in his high-pitched, squeaky voice, [...] "Let's drive the bums out of town". In 1934 he went on a search-and-destroy mission looking for mob boss Frank Costello's slot machines, which La Guardia executed with gusto, rounding up thousands of the [...] "one armed bandits", swinging a sledgehammer and dumping them off a barge into the water for the newspapers and media. In 1935 La Guardia appeared at The Bronx Terminal Market to institute a citywide ban on the sale, display, and possession of artichokes, whose prices were inflated by mobs. When prices went down, the ban was lifted. In 1936, La Guardia had special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey, a future Republican presidential candidate, single out Lucky Luciano for prosecution. Dewey led a successful investigation into Luciano's lucrative prostitution operation, eventually sending Luciano to jail with a 30–50year sentence. The case was made into the 1937 movie Marked Woman, starring Bette Davis.|$|E
2500|$|Justice O'Connor {{joined the}} Court's decision. She {{accepted}} {{the contention that}} there was neither a [...] "right to commit suicide" [...] nor a [...] "right to die," [...] as such. She did not, however, think that the Court needed to consider the conflict beyond rejecting the facial challenges to the statute. Justice O'Connor stated that, {{in the context of}} the questions presented in this case, the Court did not need to address whether a patient had a constitutionally cognizable interest in controlling the circumstances of his or her imminent death." [...] The statute, she claimed, was constitutional on its face, because the state had interests - such as protecting those who are not truly competent or facing imminent death or whose decisions would not be genuinely voluntary - of such gravity as to validate its legislation in pursuit of these interests. She said there was no constitutional conflict here; a patient was free to seek pain-relieving medication from their doctor, even at risk of health, to alleviate suffering, and this was a constitutionally acceptable alternative to permit in the absence of legalized assisted suicide. Justice O'Connor went on to say that, because everyone will face suffering of this kind (be it to themselves or a loved one), she had faith in the democratic process to strike an appropriate balance. In short, the law was up to the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> to decide.|$|E
2500|$|On June 26, a {{convention}} composed of delegates {{from a number}} of communities from lower New York and East Jersey established a committee of safety to oversee affairs. [...] This committee essentially became the nucleus of Leisler's later government. They chose Leisler to be the province's commander-in-chief [...] "till orders shall come from their Majesties." [...] Through July and August, his hand-picked militia exercised de facto control over the city, financed by provincial funds which Nicholson had deposited in the fort. [...] He was assisted by sympathetic officials from Connecticut who sent a troop of militia to assist in holding the fort. [...] Nicholson's company of regulars was formally disbanded on August 1, about the same time that formal word arrived that France and England were at war. [...] Leisler dispatched Jost Stoll and Matthew Clarkson to England on August 15 in order to bolster his position with the government in London. [...] They carried documents intended to support accusations that Nicholson had been conspiring against the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and to justify the propriety of Leisler's actions against his [...] "oppressive" [...] rule. [...] The agents were instructed to request a new charter for the province and to claim that the united colonies could defeat New France without assistance from the home country. [...] He made no specific requests that the new charter include any sort of democratic representation. [...] An election ordered Leisler's committee of safety formally to turn van Cortlandt out of office in October, consolidating Leisler's command over New York except the Albany area. [...] According to Bayard, the turnout in New York City was extremely low, with barely 100 voters participating. [...] Councilors Bayard and Philipse issued a proclamation on October 20 calling Leisler's rule illegal, and ordered other militia commanders to stop supporting him. [...] The proclamation had no effect.|$|E

They forgot that, under the conditions of warfare a century of science had brought about, the non-military section of the population could do no serious damage in any form to their enemies, and that there was no reason, therefore, why they should not do as they did. The balance of military efficiency was shifting back from the many to the few, from the common to the specialised.|$|E
