60|$|Morris ate {{his dinner}} in silence, not seeing {{anything}} further {{to do or}} say. His food choked him, and he {{found it necessary to}} drink great <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|When, about noon, {{they came}} to a clear spring <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> they were glad enough to sit down and rest and partake of their noonday lunch, washing it down with copious <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Before she answered, muttering [...] "After the mistress, the maid," [...] Nehushta {{swallowed}} a deep <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in her turn, which, indeed, she needed sorely. Then {{she told her}} all.|$|R

6000|$|Thus admonished, the story-teller {{cleared his}} throat, wished {{intensely}} for a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and taxed his fertile brain to the uttermost. At last under {{a feeling of}} absolute desperation, he began-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{took a long}} <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> then ate some food. His head throbbed {{with the}} pain of the wound. It had been roughly bandaged by his captors, but needed {{surgical}} dressing.|$|R

6000|$|... "And how do you, {{being an}} Englishman," [...] said the knight, [...] "protect {{your life and}} {{property}} here, when one of your nation cannot obtain a single night's lodging, or a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> were he thirsty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A weary way and long,' {{rejoined the}} {{traveller}} as {{he shook his}} head. 'A weary, weary, way. I struck my stick just now upon the bucket of your well--be pleased to {{let me have a}} <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> lady.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear old soul, I'll be good by-and-by, but now I'm {{tired and}} cross, {{so let me}} keep out of every one's way and drowse myself into a cheerier frame of mind. I want nothing but solitude, a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and a kiss." ...|$|R
60|$|He applied {{himself to}} a pump in the yard; and, having taken a deep <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and flung a {{quantity}} {{on his head and}} face, regained his accustomed manner and led the way into the house: Gride following close at his heels.|$|R
6000|$|The frugal supper {{having been}} washed {{down with a}} <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> from Nature's own cup--the joined hands--Adolay lay down under the canoe.

60|$|A long <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{from the}} jar did them an immense deal of good, but none had at present any {{inclination}} to eat.

6000|$|... "You {{would think}} little of it, had you seen more {{stricken}} fields, young Knight," [...] said Gaston, attempting to smile; [...] "I am only spent with loss of blood. Bring me a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and I can {{ride back to}} the tent. But look to your prisoner, Sir Eustace." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{guarding}} was of {{the strangest}} and cruellest.

60|$|While {{waiting for}} the water to rise, stores of {{provisions}} were collected in all the principal towns, and 200 vessels <b>of</b> small <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> gathered in readiness.

60|$|Popanilla, being thirsty, helped {{himself to}} a goblet <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which was at hand. It was the most {{delightful}} water that he ever tasted.

6000|$|... "What cheer, in thy {{woodland}} cruise, Monsieur Broad-Pennant?" [...] he said, with infinite coolness, {{the instant}} his steady glance had ascertained they were alone.

6000|$|So {{the hours}} passed, to the loud ticking {{of the old}} day-clock {{and the sound of}} Adam's tools.

60|$|All day I {{was engaged}} in my {{professional}} work, and {{it was late in}} the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet.

60|$|Learning {{that there}} was a large fleet of merchantmen lying between the islands of Ulic and Schelling, guarded by but two men-of-war, and that there were rich {{magazines}} of goods on these islands, it was determined to attack them.

60|$|I did {{not wait}} till {{he had done}} talking, but ran below immediately, and {{returned}} {{in a few seconds}} with a bottle of brandy and some broken biscuit.

60|$|Gervaise ate {{the food}} {{with a deep}} feeling of thankfulness for the fate that had thrown him into such good hands.
