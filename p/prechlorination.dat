40|$|In {{drinking}} water treatment, <b>prechlorination</b> and preozonation are often applied {{in order to}} control microorganisms and taste-and-odor-causing materials, which may influence organics removal by preoxidation and adsorption. Using commercial and natural water humid substances, the positive effect of <b>prechlorination</b> and preozonation as an aid to coagulation-flocculation of these compounds were confirmed by removal of TOC removal in Tehran city (capital of Iran). These experiments were conducted at bench-scale through a series of jar test using different pH, coagulant dosage and total organic carbon concentration of approximately 4, 8 and 12 mg L - 1. In addition to TOC removal the existence of an Optimum Preozonation Dose (OPZD) and an Optimum <b>Prechlorination</b> Dose (OPCD) were also confirmed. Experiments show that <b>prechlorination</b> and preozonation can improve of coagulation and flocculation depended on TOC concentration of influent surface raw water. The results demonstrate differential effect between <b>prechlorination</b> and preozonation on removal of TOC.

40|$|The KMnO 4 -Fe(II) {{process was}} proved {{to have good}} {{application}} potential in Microcystis aeruginosa removal, although at relatively high doses. This study aims to improve the algae removal in KMnO 4 -Fe(II) process by moderate <b>prechlorination,</b> which can realize the desorption of surface-adsorbed organic matter (S-AOM) from algae cells without damaging cell integrity. S-AOM was proved to not only inhibit algae removal but also maintain cell integrity, using various dilution methods for algal suspension preparation. The dilution after filtration method mainly removed the dissolved organics in cultured M. aeruginosa, while the dilution after centrifugal cleaning method could also remove the S-AOM on algae cells. Compared with the S-AOM-removed algal suspension, the lower algae removal in KMnO 4 -Fe(II) process and the reduced proportion of damaged cells during <b>prechlorination</b> of algal suspension without S-AOM removed indicated the inhibitory role of S-AOM in algae removal and the protective function of S-AOM toward cell integrity, respectively. Moderate <b>prechlorination</b> of directly diluted M. aeruginosa could be realized at chlorine doses of below 0. 5 mg/L, and the damaged cell ratios were below 4 % after 5 -min <b>prechlorination.</b> The ability of the KMnO 4 -Fe(II) process to remove algae was dramatically enhanced by the elevation of chlorine dose from 0 to 0. 5 mg/L, as more S-AOM was desorbed during <b>prechlorination.</b> Additionally, algae cells were easily captured by flocs after moderate <b>prechlorination,</b> which benefited the floc aggregation for formation of tightly bounded algae flocs. Therefore, the desorption of S-AOM without damaging cell integrity is the key feature of moderate <b>prechlorination,</b> which can be applied in improving the algae removal of KMnO 4 - Fe(II) process.

40|$|Several {{types of}} cyanotoxins found in surface water bodies are {{recognized}} as having human health effects, whereas taste and odor affect the palatability of water and give rise to public complaints. Conventional water treatment unit operations may be effective in removing the cyanobacteria cells, but cyanotoxins and dissolved organics are not targeted for removal by them. Special treatment units need to be introduced {{to deal with these}} substances and attention paid to the process design as many operational issues may be encountered. We used a water supply project in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka as a case study to investigate the performance of unit operations in water reatment plants for which the source is shallow surface water sources with high inflows of nutrients. The present case study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of <b>prechlorination,</b> activated carbon adsorption, dissolved air flotation (DAF), filtration and disinfection in removal of cyanotoxins, and taste and odor causing dissolved organic substances from the source water. Raw water quality was evaluated using algal concentration, algal toxin concentration, and chemical oxygen demand. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment operations, the sequence of initial unit operation was changed on each day as with <b>prechlorination</b> and with powdered activated carbon (PAC), with <b>prechlorination</b> and without PAC, without <b>prechlorination</b> and with PAC, and without <b>prechlorination</b> and without PAC. In addition, laboratory analysis was done to obtain adsorption isotherms using three types of different PAC. The primary findings of our study were that PAC was effective in removal of Microcystin and chemical oxygen demand (COD) but needs to be optimized by providing sufficient contact time, and <b>prechlorination</b> does not improve the performance, whereas postchlorination is effective in removing any traces of Microcystin left after PAC. 001 : 10. 10611 (ASCE) HZ. 21 S 3 -SS 1 S. 0000114. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

40|$|The prechlorination-induced algal {{organic matter}} (AOM) {{released}} from Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) cells {{has been reported}} to serve as a source of precursors for chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). However, previous studies have mainly focused on the precursors either extracted directly from the cell suspension or derived immediately after algal suspension <b>prechlorination.</b> This study aims to investigate the impacts of water transportation time after algal suspension <b>prechlorination</b> on cell integrity, AOM release, and DBP formation during the dissolved phase chlorination. The damage to cell integrity after <b>prechlorination</b> was indicated to depend not only on chlorine dose but also on transportation time. The highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) values were observed at 2 mg/L chlorine preoxidation before transportation, but were obtained at 0. 4 mg/L chlorine after 480 -min simulated transportation. The variation of DON with transportation time was indicated to be mainly influenced by the small molecular weight nitrogenous organic compounds, such as amino acids. Additionally, formation of the corresponding chlorinated carbonaceous disinfection byproducts (C-DBPs) and nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) during the dissolved phase chlorination showed the same variation tendency as DOC and DON respectively. The highest C-DBP (98. 4 mu g/L) and N-DBP (5. 5 mu g/L) values were obtained at 0. 4 mg/L chlorine preoxidation after 480 -min simulated transportation. Therefore, when <b>prechlorination</b> is applied for algae-laden water pretreatment, not only chlorine dose but also transportation time needs to be considered with regard to their effects on cell integrity, AOM release, and chlorinated DBP formation.

In case of seawater contamination with blistering chemical warfare agents, traces of the agents and/or degradation products in the finished water might pose a serious health hazard. The objective of the present review is to study the potential contamination, transport, fate, effect and control of blistering chemical warfare agents (CWAs), in the Kuwaiti desalination industry. In general, all the environmental factors involved in the aquatic degradation of CWAs in Kuwait marine environment except for the high salin-ity in case of blistering agents such as sulphur mustard, are in favor of a fast degrada-tion process. In case of massive releases of CWAs near the Kuwaiti shorelines, turbulence resulting from tidal cycles and high temperature will affect the dissolution process and extend the toxicity of the insoluble agent. Post- and pre-chlorination dur-ing the course of seawater desalination will catalyze and significantly accelerate the hydrolysis processes of the CWAs. The heat exerted on CWAs during the power genera-tion-desalination processes is not expected to thermally decompose them. However, the steam heat will augment the agent's rate of hydrolysis with subsequent acceleration in their rate of detoxification. Conventional pretreatment of feed seawater for reverse-osmosis desalination is theoretically capable of reducing the concentration of CWAs by coprecipitation and adsorption on flocs formed during coagulation. <b>Prechlorination</b> and prolonged detention time in pretreatment units will simultaneously promote hydroly-sis reactions...|$|E

As a general rule, THM reactivity or yield (ug THM/mg C) increases with MW. The < 10, 000 MW range was found to be the most consistent reactive fraction of aquatic organic matter. All of the various treatments preferentially removed the most reactive fraction of precursor present in each MW range. None of the various treatments proved to be very effective in removing precursor material below a MW of < 500. Humic molecules, with the highest carboxylic acidity and hence highest charge density, are generally more difficult to remove by alum coagulation. All of the various treatment processes studied preferentially removed hydrophobic over hydrophilic aquatic organic matter. None of the source related conditions (fulvic acid, kaolinite, pH) nor process-related conditions (flocculation velocity gradient, mixing time, <b>prechlorination,</b> preozonation) evaluated under the same experimental conditions exerted a major impact upon the performance of the bench-scale direct filtration process. Larger sized particles may be easier to remove by bench-scale treatment, but removal of the smaller particles may result in better removals of organic matter as quantified by NVTOC and UV Absorbance...|$|E
40|$|Les étapes de désinfection de l'eau, telles que l'ozonation et la chloration, génèrent des sous-produits d'oxydation de nature variée. Ces composés sont soupçonnés d'être toxiques à plus ou moins long terme. Certains d'entre eux sont, de plus, {{facilement}} biodégradables et favorisent donc une reviviscence bactérienne dans le réseau de distribution. Enfin, à cause de leurs caractéristiques organoleptiques, ils peuvent conduire à la détérioration de la qualité sensorielle de l'eau distribuée. La recherche de plusieurs sous-produits d'oxydation dans l'eau potable a pu être effectuée grâce à de nouvelles techniques d'analyse quantitative par chromatographie en phase gazeuse: il s'agit des aldéhydes et des cétones de faible poids moléculaire, des acides haloacétiques et de certains céto-acides. Ces composés ont été recherchés dans des usines comportant une étape d'ozonation. L'influence de ce traitement sur {{la formation}} des aldéhydes et des céto-acides est démontrée dans cette étude. L'ozonation multiplie la concentration totale d'aldéhydes par un facteur variant de 2 à 4 suivant les usines et les trois céto-acides recherchés ont été trouvés en quantités importantes dans des eaux ozonées. La filtration sur charbon, lorsqu'elle existe, s'avère efficace pour l'élimination de ces composés. Les trois acides chloroacétiques sont présents dans des eaux chlorées, en sortie d'usines appliquant des taux de chloration assez importants. Enfin, I'évolution de ces sous-produits d'oxydation tout au long d'un réseau de distribution a pu être expliquée par leur biodégradabilité. New regulations are being {{considered by the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) concerning a variety of disinfection by-products formed during chlorination and ozonation (halonitriles, haloketones, haloacids, low molecular weight aldehydes [...] .) and many surveys are underway to assess the presence of such products in drinking waters. This renewed interest for disinfection byproducts (DBPs) arises from their suspected carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. In addition to possible long term health effects, specific disinfection by-products may also induce immediate water quality deterioration due to their objectionable organoleptic properties. Biodegradable DBP's also probably contribute a substantial proportion of the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). As far as oxidation disinfection practices in France are concerned, the use of ozone is frequent. Also, most major French treatment plants include an activated carbon filtration process {{which is likely to}} remove some of the DBPs {{as well as some of}} their precursors. This paper summarizes the results obtained along various treatment plants in the Paris area, concerning three major families of DBPs considered for regulation: the DBPs investigated include 30 aldehydes and ketones, chloroacetic acids and 3 ketoacids. The aldehydes and ketones were measured by GC-ECD or GC-MS after derivatization with PFBHA; the chloroacetic acids were measured using a micro extraction method with methyltertiobutylether followed by diazomethane methylation and GC-ECD or GC-MS; the six plants investigated in the Paris area treat surface water from the river Seine upstream of Paris (Morsang, Vigneux, Orly, Ivry) or groundwater which is artificially recharged with Seine river water downstream of Paris (Le Pecq, Aubergenville). The Alençon plant which is located outside the Paris area treats raw water from the Sarthe river plus groundwater from various wells. All the treatment lines studied include an ozonation step which is followed at some plants (Morsang, Ivry, Vigneux, Le Pecq-Minor) by a granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. The treatment line investigated at Vigneux used an ozone/hydrogen peroxide combination as an oxidation step. Three of these treatment lines (Morsang, Le Pecq-Minor, Alençon) comprise a <b>prechlorination</b> step; the other plants only use chlorination as a final disinfection step. The study compares the total concentration of aldehydes detected before and after ozonation as well as after GAC filtration. Approximately half of this total is usually due to formaldehyde while acetaldehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal represent most of the remainder. These concentrations which initially range from 1 to 25 µg/l show a drastic increase after ozonation. Depending on the water DOC and ozonation conditions, the total level of aldehydes is multiplied by a factor of 2 to 4. The final chlorine disinfection step used at all these plants does not significantly influence the total concentration of the aldehydes, therefore the level of these DBPs at the outlet of the plants is mainly determined by the ozonation or ozone/GAC filtration steps. The three aldo and ketoacids analysed were glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid and ketomalonic acid. They were detected in ozonated water with total concentrations which range from 65 to 80 µg/l. Glyoxylic acid alone, represents half of these quantities. Chloroacetic acids were not detected at the outlet of the plants which are supplied by groundwater (Le Pecq-Minor, Aubergenville) and which apply a low chlorine dose (0. 1 - 0. 2 ppm) as a final disinfection stop. Although the Morsang treatment line investigated applies a low <b>prechlorination</b> dose ([smaller or equal] 1 ppm) in addition to the low postchlorination dose, no haloacids were detected at the outlet, which is agreement with the low levels of trihalomethanes usually detected at this plant. The absence of haloacids at the outlet of this plant can be attributed to the efficiency of the ozone/GAC combination as well as to the low <b>prechlorination</b> dose applied. Haloacids were only detected at the outlet of the Orly, Ivry and Alençon plants which apply a rather high chlorine dose during the final disinfection stop (between 0. 8 and 2. 2 ppm) in order to maintain a residual in the distribution system. Typical levels of haloacids are found between 10 and 35 µg/l, mainly under the form of dichloro and trichloroacetic acid. To summarize, the levels of the specific DBPs investigated remain well below their individual WHO recommendations (respectively 50, 100 and 900 µg/ 1 for dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and formaldehyde). Unless more drastic national regulations are implemented, the interest in the fate of these DBP's mainly lies in their possible secondary effects such as enhancement of bacterial regrowth in distribution systems or degradation of drinking water organoleptic properties...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{introduction}} {{mass spectrometry}} {{was developed and}} verified for direct quantification of cyanogen chloride (CNCl) and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) in environmental samples. Effects of contact time, monochloramine doses, monochloramine application modes, pH, temperature, and bromide ion concentrations on formation of DBPs were investigated. Longer reaction times led to continued formation over time for dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), 1, 1 -dichloro- 2 -propanone (1, 1 -DCP) and chloroform. Linear relationships were observed between the formation of DCAN, 1, 1 -DCP, CNCl or chloroform and the monochloramine dosage. Chloramination modes exhibited the largest impact on chloroform formation. pH values between 5 and 6 resulted in the highest DBP concentrations. Sixteen NOM isolates obtained from various water sources were chloraminated. Strong correlations were observed among the concentrations of dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), chloroform, and DCAN. Total organic halogen (TOX) and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) values {{were found to have}} linear relationships with these concentrations, but not those of chloropicrin (CP) and CNCl. The cumulative normalized excitation-emission matrix (EEM) volumes at specific regions obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy correlated linearly with yields of DCAA, chloroform, DCAN, TOX and CNCl. DBP formation in waters treated with chlorine, ozone, coagulants, and monochloramine was evaluated. <b>Prechlorination</b> enhanced formation of THM, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2 -propanone (1, 1, 1 -TCP) and total organic chloride (TOCl) and the concentrations of most DBPs increased with increasing chlorine doses. Preozonation reduced DCAN and TOCl formation and increasing ozone doses did not necessarily reduce the formation of THM and 1, 1 -DCP. Increasing coagulant doses reduced most DBP and TOCl formation but total organic bromide (TOBr) formation varied little. Model organic-N compounds were chloraminated. Long reaction times and high monochloramine to organic-N molar ratios enhanced the formation of CP. CNCl was formed from chloramination of all organic-N compounds tested, with glycine generating the highest amount. The nitrogen in CNCl and DCAN was from both organic-N compounds and isotopped monochloramine...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the removal {{efficiency}} of humic substances by conventional drinking water treatment processes was studied {{in a full}} scale operating plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada {{over a period of}} 16 months. A comparison of the removal efficiency of humic substances between conventional and advanced treatment processes such as ozonation (used as an oxidant before filtration) and the addition of granular activated carbon (GAC) was also carried out for the same water source (Detroit River) in a pilot scale treatment plant at the same location. The performance of different treatment processes in removing humic substances was evaluated through the quantification of humic substances and their apparent molecular size distributions (AMSD) in samples taken from the raw water and after each treatment process. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the concentration of the non-humic substances for the water source (Detroit River) were also determined. Results indicate that seasonal variations in humic substances concentration occurred, showing a maximum level during the month of April when the spring turn-over of water bodies took place. These seasonal variations were associated with the corresponding changes in THM concentrations observed during the same period. The fulvic and humic acid composition of humic substances and their THM formation potential (THMFP) were quantified. Their AMSD were determined by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and the high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The humic substances from the Detroit River were found to be less reactive in forming THMs (μg THM/mg C) when compared with the standard humic substances provided by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS). Coagulation-sedimentation was the most efficient process of the conventional treatment options in the removal of humic substances. The GAC greatly improved the removal efficiency of not only the humic substances but also of a large fraction of the non-humic substances. The removal of humic substances by the use of ozone as an oxidant before filtration was similar to that obtained by the conventional treatment with <b>prechlorination.</b> The THMFP was determined on water samples from different processes and on their corresponding non-humic fractions. Precursor removal after each process effectively reduced the THMFP in the treated water. The non-humic fractions appeared to be potential contributors to the formation of THMs for high chlorine dosages.

40|$|International audiencePrechlorination {{is used in}} {{seawater}} desalination {{processes to}} control biofouling in both thermal plants and membrane plants. Many disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are formed during seawater pretreatment processes using chlorination, including the regulated trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs) generally form in much smaller amounts than regulated DBPs, but have been a growing concern because of their greater health risk. As an alternative disinfectant, monochloramine (NH 2 Cl) is often used in cooling systems to get a stable disinfectant residual. However, the use of NH 2 Cl can {{be a source of}} nitrogen and leads to the formation of N-DBPs. Moreover, the disinfection of seawater can produce important amounts of N-DBPs, especially during algal blooms, enriched in nitrogen-containing compounds (e. g., amino acids). Moreover, arid regions produce water by desalination of seawater or brackish water, characterized by elevated bromide and iodide ions contents. Brominated and iodinated DBPs are generally more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. Our previous work performed in the absence of algal bloom showed that DBPs produced during seawater <b>prechlorination</b> are found in significant quantity in the brines of desalination plants (RO and MSF plants) and in trace amounts in the drinking water. This study investigates the formation of disinfection by-products on seawater samples collected during a major bloom event (Trichodesmium sp.) that occurred on the west coast of Saudi Arabia (Yanbu). The removal of the Algal Organic Matter (AOM) during Fe-coagulation-flocculation and its UF fouling potential was also studied. The quality of the Red Sea water impacted by this severe algal bloom was characterized using global (i. e., TOC/DOC content, UV-Vis spectra) and specific parameters (Fluorescence excitation emission matrix, LC-OCD, Flow cytometry). The oxidant demand and the chlorination and chloramination formation potentials of chloro, bromo and iodo DBPs (THMs, HAAs, haloacetonitriles, haloacetamides) were determined at pH 8 for short (1 hour) and long contact time (72 hours). The monitored DBPs were quantified following EPA methods 551 and 552, which are based on liquid-liquid extractions followed by GC-ECD or GC-MS analyses. The efficiency of Fe-coagulation/flocculation to remove the DBP precursors was evaluated using Jar Test equipment under controlled experimental conditions (pH, dose). In addition ultrafiltration of the Trichlodesmium sp. algal bloom was performed with a home made UF hollow fiber module under conditions that mimic real seawater RO pretreatment operations. During our presentation the reactivity with oxidants and behavior during pretreatment of the Trichodesmium sp. AOM will be compared with the results obtained using the same experimental conditions with another seawater alga grown in our laboratory (i. e., Hymenomonas sp.) ...|$|E
40|$|Gift of Water (GOW, est. 1995) is an Indiana based nonprofit {{organization}} dedicated to providing clean drinking water for communities in Haiti. Their system involves <b>prechlorination,</b> followed by a string filter, granular activated carbon (GAC), and then post-chlorination. The initial design of the GOW system included a polypropylene string filter with a nominal pore size opening of 5 μm, which has been changed to one with a nominal pore size opening of 1 μm. Experiments were conducted to compare the original system with the modified system and to quantify {{the effectiveness of the}} systems to produce clean drinking water, including measurements of volumetric flow rate, E. coli removal efficiency, turbidity, free, total and combined residual chlorine concentrations, volatile disinfection by-products (DBPs), and UV absorbance at 254 nm. The clogging rates for the 1 μm and the 5 μm filters were measured to quantify the sustainability of the two filter types. Inactivation assays for bacteriophage as surrogates for human viruses were also performed on the GOW system with a pure and a natural water source. Finally, source water quality data, including turbidity and viable E. coli concentrations, from communities where GOW systems are used were collected during a trip to Haiti. Little difference was noted in the volumetric flow rates between the two string filters throughout the course of the experiment. Bacterial inactivation was consistently effective; both filter types successfully removed the E. coli from the source water. Both filters were able to remove a large fraction of the colloidal particles from the water. The effluent turbidity values for both filter types fell below 5 NTU when the influent water was {{less than or equal to}} 12 NTU. ^ Free and total chlorine concentrations decreased in the final water samples for both filter types. The activated carbon filters were effective in removing most of the free and total chlorine from the first chlorine dose. The combined chlorine concentration measurements were substantially less than the free chlorine concentration measurements. Chloroform (CHCl 3) was the only DBP observed to be present above the detection limit in the chlorinated water samples. The chloroform concentrations measured in the effluent water samples from the 1 μm and the 5 μm filters were all well below the Maximum Contaminant Level of 80 μg/L for Total Trihalomethanes, as established by the US EPA. The absorbance at 254 nm generally decreased from intermediate to final water samples. The UV-absorbing compounds are successfully removed by the filtration or adsorption in the GAC, or by the reactions in the secondary chlorine dose. ^ The clogging rates between the two filters were nearly identical. The 1 μm filter allowed an average of 4037 liters of water through the filter, and the 5 μm filter allowed an average of 3828 liters of water through the filter before clogging occurred. This corresponds to approximately 202 runs for the 1 μm filters and 191 runs for the 5 μm filters. The GOW system achieved over seven logs of inactivation for the öS 1 phage suspension and over four logs of inactivation for the T 4 phage suspension when used with Milli-Q water. When used with Wabash River water, the GOW system achieved approximately three logs of inactivation for the öS 1 phage suspension and less than one log of inactivation for the T 4 phage suspension. The GOW system was not effective at inactivating human virus surrogates in this natural water source. ^ Water quality data from six water sources were collected in Haiti. The E. colicoli concentrations in the samples ranged from 1. 5 most probable number (MPN) of E. coli per 100 mL of the sample to 48. 3 MPN of E. coli per 100 mL of sample. The turbidity measurements ranged from 0. 19 NTU to 6. 64 NTU. ...|$|E
40|$|La {{coagulation}} par le Fe(III) de substances humiques aquatiques est optimale à pH = 5, 5 pour un rapport massique Fe/COT de l'ordre de 2, quant à l'élimination du COT. Le but de cet article est d'étudier l'influence d'une préoxydation sur l'élimination de la matière organique par coagulation dans ces conditions. La préoxydation (ozone, bioxyde de chlore ou chlore) à faibles doses induit une légère dégradation des rendements de coagulation des acides fulviques. Un taux de préoxydant fort (≈ 0, 5 mg oxydant par mg de carbone organique initial), pratiqué avant la coagulation, implique de mettre en oeuvre une dose de coagulant plus élevée [≈ 3 mg Fe(III) par mg de COT]. Cette augmentation est moins marquée dans le cas d'une préchloration. Les substances humiques ne représentant qu'une partie de la matière organique des eaux naturelles, des manipulations sur des eaux brutes ont donc été entreprises. L'effet de faibles doses d'ozone conduit à une légère amélioration de la coagulation. Cependant de fortes doses d'oxydant (0, 5 mg d'ozone ou de bioxyde de chlore par mg COT) nécessitent l'emploi de plus fortes doses de coagulant. De plus, le rendement d'élimination est aussi affecté. We present here some works {{which take}} place in the particular frame of the study of the drinking water treatment of reservoir waters containing organics at high concentration, mainly humic substances. Previous studies (LEFEBVRE and LEGUBE, 1990) on coagulation of fulvic acid solutions have proven that the optimal removal of organic matter was reached at pH = 5. 5 with 2 mg of ferric iron per mg of organic carbon. The main question in this study is to know the impact of preoxidation (ozone, chlorine dioxide, chlorine) on the removal of organics by iron(III) coagulation. The reconstituted waters obtained by dissolving fulvic acids (table 1) in a solution of salts in high-purity water (table 2), are defined by both a low inorganic content (as calcium, sulfate and bicarbonate ions) and a high organics concentration, main characteristics of real impounded waters (table 3). The experimental procedures of coagulation-flocculation-clarification followed the treatment lines shown in figure 1. Ozonation was carried out in a semi-continuous system (batch solution), by bubbling ozone (fig. 2). Chlorination and preoxidation with chlorine dioxide were performed in a batch reactor. The preoxidation steps were carried out at pH of reconstituted waters or of raw waters. A Dohrmann DC 80 was used for the determination of TOC. The accuracy of TOC measurement was found to be ± 0. 05 mg/l C (for the range of studied concentration). Residual iron was analysed by atomic absorption on a Perkin Elmer 2380 apparatus (oxy-acetylene flame). As shown in table 4, preozonation induced a slight decrease of Cebron fulvic acid removal by iron(III) coagulation at high ozone dose applied (= 0. 5 mg O 3 per mg TOCi). In order to try to understand why ozone partially inhibits the efficiency of iron coagulation to remove fulvic acid at acidic pH, we determined the optimum dosage of coagulant required to obtain the best percent of removal on preozonated fulvic acid solutions. Figure 4 shows that preozonation at about 0. 5 mg O 3 per mg TOCi appears to have shifted the region of the optimal TOC removal towards the higher Fe/TOCi mass ratios (≈ 3 mg Fe(III) per mg TOCi, for two fulvic acids). <b>Prechlorination</b> (> 1 mg Cl 2 /mg TOCi) induced a decrease of Cebron fulvic acid removal by iron(III) coagulation (table 5). Hence, we examined the optimum dosage of coagulant required to obtain the best percent of removal on prechlorinated fulvic acid solutions (fig. 6). The region of the optimal TOC removal was still obtained for a Fe/TOCi mass ratio of 2. However, the difference between the percent TOC remaining for inital fulvic acid of 10 and 15 mg/l was not significant (respectively 61. 4 % and 61. 9 %). A greater prechlorinatlon dosage (> 0. 5 mg Cl 2 /mg TOCi) would probably give a shift of the optimal mass ratio. Preoxidation with chlorine dioxide (even without ClO 2 residual) before a coagulation induced a decrease at TOC (table 4). So, we studied the shift of optimum dosage of coagulant required to remove the organic matter. Figure 5 shows that preoxidation (≈ 0. 5 mg ClO 2 /mg TOCi) shifted the region of optimal TOC removal towards higher Fe/TOCi mass ratio (≈ 3 mg per mg for Cebron fulvic acid, in figure 5). The fulvic acids represent only an amount of TOC of a raw waters. So we carried out experiments on real impounded waters. For the study of the influence of the preozonation on the coagulation efficiency, we chose to work at the optimal coagulant dose determined from previous experiments. Several runs were conducted with different dosages of ozone between 0 and 2 mg/l O 3. Results reported in tables 6 and 7 indicate that for these two raw waters (Moulin Papon and Cebron), the preozonation slightly improved the efficiency of iron coagulation at acidic pH. These results can only be compared with Cebron fulvic acid when applied ozone dose was 0. 2 mg O 3 /mg TOCi. Consequently, other experiments were carried out at a high ozone dose (- 0. 5 mg O 3 /mg TOCi). They showed a shift in the region of the optimal TOC removal towards the higher coagulant dose (fig. 7), as already observed with the fulvic acid solutions. Only one experiment was made with chlorine dioxide in the case of Moulin Papou raw water. This preoxidation (≈ 0. 5 mg ClO 2 /mg TOCi) induced a shift to higher coagulant dosage but also a decrease of the efficiency of iron coagulation whatever the applied coagulant dosage (fig. 8). As compared to humic chlorination literature, little information exists concerning ozonation of humics. Furthermore, in spite of small amounts of identified by-products in the literature, ozonation was usually found to increase smaller size materials in humic substances (GLOOR et al., 1981; VEENSTRA et al., 1983; FLOGSTAD and ODEGAARD, 1985; ANDERSON et al., 1986; AMY et al., 1987; LEGUBE et al., 1989). Moreover, analyses of carboxyl-group on the Cebron fuivic acid allowed us to show that the carboxyl content increased as ozone dosage increased (fig. 9). Some works (VAN BREEMEN et al., 1979) have proven the rate of carboxyl groups in the stoichiometry of coagulation reaction of humics with iron(III) at slightly acidic pH. Consequently, {{it is not surprising that}} preozonation of fulvic acids appears to have shifted the region of TOC removal up into the higher iron dose range, according to the enhancement of the carboxyl content in the fulvic acids by ozone. This effect of preozonation was already reported by others (JEKEL, 1983; RECKHOW and SINGER, 1983). Chlorination (GLAZE and PEYTON, 1978) or oxidation with chlorine dioxide (NORWOOD et al., 1983; COLCLOUGH Of al., 1983) led also to a decrease of the molecular weight of aquatic organic matter. The oxidative action of chlorine and chlorine dioxide gave many products like aromatic and aliphatic acids (chlorinated or not chlorinated) and probably increased the carboxyl content of humic substances. Hence, those oxidants inhibit the coagulation-flocculation of organic matter...|$|E
40|$|L'étude a permis de suivre l'évolution des caractéristiques physico-chimiques et microbiologiques des eaux dans un réseau de {{distribution}} expérimental de taille industrielle, afin de comparer d'une part l'effet du chlore et de la monochloramine sur la biomasse présente dans le système à l'équilibre et d'autre part d'établir des relations quantitatives entre prolifération bactérienne, oxydant et matière organique biodégradable. Dès les premières heures de transit dans le réseau, une consommation des oxydants est constatée, avec toutefois une plus grande stabilité de la monochloramine (vitesse de consommation de 0, 05 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1 et 0, 02 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1 respectivement pour le chlore et la monochloramine). Même en présence d'un désinfectant résiduel, il est possible de noter une accumulation de bactéries-à ta surface des tuyaux de distribution (105 à 106 cellules. cm- 2, dont environ 1 % est cultivable sur gélose) qui augmente avec la diminution de concentration du désinfectant résiduel. Les relations logarithmiques entre densité cellulaire (phase eau ou biofilm) et oxydant résiduel montrent d'une part que pour inactiver totalement les bactéries en suspension dans l'eau il convient de maintenir une chloration en continu avec un résiduel constant supérieur ou égal à 0, 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 et, d'autre part que les chloramines sont au moins 2, 5 fois moins efficaces que le chlore, même vis-à-vis des bactéries fixées. La présence de matière organique biodégradable dans les eaux explique la prolifération des bactéries dans le système de distribution. Ainsi une concentration additionnelle de 100 µg. l- 1 de carbone organique dissous biodégradable (CODB) dans l'eau entrant dans le réseau de distribution occasionne en 24 heures et à 20 °C une augmentation du nombre de bactéries fixées (+ 7, 5. 105 cellules. cm- 2) ou en suspension (+ 4. 104 cellules. ml- 1) dans le réseau de distribution, à l'équilibre, déjà largement colonisé par des micro-organismes. Ainsi le contrôle de la fraction biodégradable de la matière organique apparaît toujours comme un objectif primordial. This {{study was}} carried out in order to evaluate the variations in the physicochemical characteristics of the water in an experimental distribution system. The primary objectives of the study were :- to compare the disinfectant efficiency of chlorine and monochloramine- to establish quantitative correlations among bacterial density, concentration of residual disinfectant, and concentration of biodegradable organic matter. The finished waters were obtained from a water treatment pilot plant characterized by : <b>prechlorination</b> (average treatment rate : 1. 4 mgCl 2 l- 1 and residual alter sand filtration : 0. 08 mgCl 2 l- 1), coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation (FeCl 3 treatment rate : 30 to 60 mg l- 1 adjusted to the raw water turbidity below 0. 3 NTU), sand filtration (filtration rate : 6 h- 1) and post-disinfection with chloramine (average treatment rate : 1. 8 mgCl 2 l- 1) or chloramine (average treatment rate : 1. 66 mgCl 2 l- 1). The concentrations of post-disinfectant used were chosen in order to maintain chlorine at 0. 2 to 0. 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 and monochloramine at 1 mgC 2 l- 1 after the first 24 hours residence time in the experimental distribution system. The experimental distribution system is composed of three parallel loops connected in series (31 m length, 100 mm diameter, cement lined cast iron, water velocity : 1 m s- 1). The configuration and operation of the system permitted a residence time of 24 hours in each loop (that is 72 hours for the whole system). Appropriate sample tap locations facilitated removal of bulk water samples. Special sampling parts also permitted sampling of cement coupons for determination of attached biofilm. The measured parameters were : residual oxidant (DPD method), DOC, BDOC (28 days of incubation at 28 °C with a bacterial inoculum), cell density in the bulk water phase (CFU ml- 1) and in the biofilm (CFU cm- 2) after 15 days of incubation at 20 - 22 °C. Total cells were enumerated using the epifluorescence direct count technique. For each experiment, all the sampling sequences were carried out on each of three days, after quasi steady-state was achieved in the system (4 to 6 weeks after starting each experiment). The data were analysed in order to characterize the treated and distributed waters; the results discussed here are based on the averages of the measured parameters tram the water samples and biofilm samples taken after the system achieved quasi steady-state. Characteristics of the treated watersThe treated waters were characterized by important variations at the DOC, BDOC and cell density. For example, the concentrations of DOC showed a seasonal variation ranging from 0. 8 to 1. 3 mg Cl- 1 in winter to 1. 6 to 2. 6 mg Cl- 1 in summer. The treated waters contained approximately the same concentrations of residual disinfectant, averaging 1. 6 mgCl 2 l- 1 for chlorine and 1. 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 for monochloramine. However, a significant difference cell density was found between the two post-disinfectants. Cell densities by the epifluorescence direct count technic were 1. 6 x 103 ml- 1 (0. 3 % of CFU ml- 1) with chlorine and 6. 3 x 104 ml- 1 (0. 03 % of CFU ml- 1) with monochloramine. The difference on cell density between the post-chlorination and the post-chloramination treatments has been observed systematically, and may be explained either as cellular lysis with chlorine or an interference when using epifluorescence counting for chlorinated waters. Characteristics of the distributed watersWhatever the season, depletion of oxidant (chlorine or monochloramine), and elimination of dissolved organic matter (DOC, BDOC) occured during the first hours of circulation of water in the distribution system. The net result was an increase in bacterial cell density. During the first hours of circulation of the waters in the distribution system, depletion of the disinfectant occured. Depletion was more rapid for chlorine (- 0. 05 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1) titan for monochloramine (- 0. 02 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1), winch is considered more stable titan chlorine. Even {{in the presence of a}} residual disinfectant in the distribution system, microorganisms are present in the water phase (104 to 106 cells ml- 1 by epifluorescence direct count; 1 % CFU ml- 1 after 15 days of incubation at 20 - 22 °C) and in the biofilm (105 to 106 cells cm- 2 by epifluorescence direct count; 1 % CFU ml- 1 after 15 days of incubation at 20 - 22 °C). The bacterial density increased white the disinfectant residual decreased. The apparent growth rate of the attached biomass (µfix) in loop 2 of the chlorinated distribution system (equivalent to 48 hours detention), was close to the µfix calculated for loop 2 of the chloraminated distribution system : the values were 0. 0043 h- 1 and 0. 005 h- 1 respectively. In addition, the change in the organic matter (expressed as DOC) occured in two steps :- a slight increase in DOC during the 24 first hours of residence time (loop 1), when increased residual disinfectant were present. - a bacterial consumption of DOC after 24 hours of residence time (loops 2 and 3), even in the presence of small concentrations of disinfectants. In loop 2 (48 hours residence time of the water in the system; chlorine : 0. 01 mgCl 2 l- 1, chloramine : 0. 3 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1), the rates of DOC elimination averaged 13 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1 and 0. 42, mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1, respectively in the chlorinated and chloraminated distribution systems. This decrease in DOC concentrations was related to the increase in bacterial density. Relationships between cell density, oxidant and organic matterLinear relationships between the concentration of residual oxidant (chlorine or monochloramine) and the cell density in the water phase or in the biofilm show that :- whichever oxidant was used, the pipe loop sections without residual disinfectants were characterized by about 5 x 106 attached cells per cm 2 (4 to 10 % were able to grow on agar medium in 15 days at 20 - 22 °C) and by 4 x 105 planktonic cells per ml (1 % CFU ml- 1);- consistently, in the sections of the system with a residual disinfectant, the bacteria (CFU and epilluorescence counting) in the water phase were more sensitive to the residual disinfectant (chlorine or monochloramine) than the bacteria attached to the pipe walls (biofilm). However, there was a difference in effectiveness between the two disinfectants; chlorine was more efficient in controlling planktonic bacteria and biofilm bacteria than was monochloramine. For example, to achieve complete inactivation of the planktonic bacteria (CFU ml- 1) a constant chlorine residual of 0. 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 was required throughout the whole distribution system, compared to 2. 5 times more chloramine to achieve the same efficiency. Finally, with equivalent concentrations of residual disinfectant, the microbiological quality of the chlorinated distribution waters was better than that of the chloraminated distribution waters. From loop to loop, linear relationships between ∆DOC and cell density pointed out that the presence of biodegradable organic matter can explain the bacterial proliferation in the distribution system. For example, a concentration of BDOC as low as 0. 1 mgC l- 1 resulted in an increase in the cell density : an additional accumulation of 7. 5 x 105 attached cells cm- 2 and 4 x 104 planktonic cells ml- 1 was observed in the experimental distribution system at quasi steady-state. Consequently, the control of the biodegradable organic carbon remains one of the prime objectives in order to achieve biologically stable distribution waters...|$|E
