2500|$|The {{ship was}} berthed at Devonport Naval Base until the {{problems}} could be addressed; this was slow in coming, and by June 1997, Charles Upham was being {{referred to as}} [...] "the Calliope South Windbreak". Delays included a reassessment of Defence finances and operational requirements prioritising spending on the Army, and government calls for an independent report into the ship's acquisition and suitability for conversion (the report found that the vessel had been acquired reasonably and was suitable for modification, although the Alliance Party criticised this review as a whitewash). In October 1997, Cabinet agreed that conversion of the vessel would be considered in 2000, {{near the end of}} the three-year <b>planning</b> <b>cycle.</b> A month later, the Alliance Party published The Scandal of The Chales Upham the first of two booklets criticising the ship and her acquisition. By April 1998, pressures on the defence budget caused priority for funding the conversion to be reduced, and the RNZN made Charles Upham available for civilian charter until such funding became available again. In early 1998, the ballast tanks were refitted, and an STP was installed.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionWe {{undertook}} {{this phase}} II study to measure postoperative drug delivery and toxicity of cisplatin plus docetaxel {{in patients with}} resected stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer. MethodsThe primary endpoint was amount of cisplatin delivered over a <b>planned</b> four <b>cycles</b> of adjuvant chemotherapy. Statistical design required a cohort to close if the regimen proved unlikely to improve cisplatin delivery compared with published phase III data. The first cohort was treated with docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15, and cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 IV on day 15, every 4 weeks for four <b>planned</b> <b>cycles.</b> A second cohort was treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 IV plus cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 every 3 weeks for four <b>planned</b> <b>cycles.</b> ResultsSixteen patients were treated with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin every 4 weeks, with five of 16 (31 %) unable to complete three cycles. Subsequently, 11 patients were treated with docetaxel and cisplatin every 3 weeks, with six of 11 (55 %) unable to complete three cycles. Among the 11 patients who failed to complete three cycles, the reasons for stopping included {{one or more of}} the following: fatigue (n = 8), nausea (n = 4), febrile neutropenia (n = 1), hypotension (n = 1), and nephrotoxicity (n = 1). ConclusionsThe combination of cisplatin at 80 mg/m 2 with docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 weekly or 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks is no better tolerated than older chemotherapy regimens. The most common reason to stop chemotherapy was intolerable fatigue. These results suggest that the most common dose-limiting toxicities are attributable to the cisplatin, given similar problems were encountered whether the docetaxel was delivered as a single dose every 3 weeks or as a lower weekly dose...|$|R
