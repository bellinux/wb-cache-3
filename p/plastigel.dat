5000|$|Polymer clays {{contain a}} basis of PVC resin and a liquid plasticizer, making it a {{plastisol}}. Polymer clay plastisol is also categorized as a <b>plastigel</b> because of its rheological properties. It is a high yield thixotropic material; when a sufficient force is applied the material yields, flows like a viscous liquid until that force is removed, whereupon it returns to being a solid. This plasticity {{is what makes it}} useful as modeling clay as opposed to putty or paste. Plastigels retain their shape even when heat is applied, which is why polymer clay does not melt or droop when oven cured. Various gelling agents are added to give it this property such as aminated bentonite, metallic soaps, or fumed silica. The base resin can be modified in various ways. Mineral oil, lecithin, and odorless mineral spirits can be added to reduce its viscosity or alter its working properties. Small amounts of zinc oxide, kaolin, or other fillers are sometimes added to increase opacity, elastic modulus, or compression strength. Polymer clay is available in many colors, which can be mixed to create a wide range of colors or gradient blends. Special-effect colors and composites include translucent, fluorescent, phosphorescent, and faux [...] "pearls," [...] "metallics," [...] and [...] "stone." ...|$|E

Obtaining flame retardant and smoke suppressed PVC compositions are {{getting more and more}} important. PVC is widely applied as a covering insulation for electrical and communication cables and in domestic uses such as window frames, doors, profiles, sidings and gutters because of its high level of combustion resistance. For this reason, many additives are studied to achieve better compositions than the present ones. In this study, the synergistic effects of zinc borate (ZB). zinc phosphate (ZP) on thermal stability of plastigels obtained from PVC and dioctylphthalate (DOP) plastisols were investigated using spectroscopic and thermal techniques. Plastigels having a total of 2. 5 parts (w/w) of zinc borate and zinc phosphate, 80 parts (w/w) of DOP and 100 parts (w/w) of PVC were gelled at 140 C for 15 minutes in a vacuum oven. The <b>plastigel</b> films having different compositions of ZB and ZP were investigated after heating at 140 °C and 160 C from 15 minutes to 90 minutes by using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). The kinetic studies were made by PVC Thermomat 763 instrument. HCl gas released due to heating of the <b>plastigel</b> films at both 140 C and 160 °C in PVC Thermomat instrument under nitrogen gas increases the conductivity of deionized water in measuring vessels of this instrument. By measuring the conductivity change in water caused by the absorption of HCl released, the thermal degradation of PVC <b>plastigel</b> films were studied by means of reaction rates, rate constants and activation energies. Compositions having only ZB or ZP have retarded dehydrochlorination of PVC compared with the control sample. However, the compositions with both ZB and ZP have a superior synergistic effect on char formation of PVC. Since induction times of the compositions having both ZB and ZP were higher than that of the control samples having only ZB or only ZP, the synergistic effect was observed. The compositions greatly promote the char formation of PVC. The thermal stability of plastigels was also studied by their yellowness index (YI). The elemental compositions of these films were investigated in atomic scale using EDX and SEM and their compositions were calculated both for particles and matrix...|$|E

The thermal behavior of the ERSO was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The effect of the epoxidized oil on the thermal stability of poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) plastigels, formulated to contain dioctyl phthalate (DOP) plasticizer and various amounts of the epoxidized oil, was evaluated by using discoloration indices of the polymer samples degraded at 1600 C for 30 min and thermogravimetry at a constant heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 600 °C. The thermal behavior of the ERSO was characterized by endothermic peaks at about 150 °C, which were attributed {{to the formation of}} network structures via epoxide groups, and at temperatures above 300 °C, which were due to the decomposition of the material. Up to 50 % of the DOP plasticizer in the PVC plastisol formulation could be substituted by ERSO without a marked deleterious effect on the consistency of the <b>plastigel</b> formed. In the presence of the epoxidized oil, PVC <b>plastigel</b> samples showed a marked reduction in discoloration and the number of conjugated double bonds, as well as high temperatures for the attainment of specific extents of degradation. These results showed that the ERSO retarded/inhibited thermal dehydrochlorination and the formation of long (n > 6) polyene sequences in PVC plastigels. The plasticizer efficiency/permanence of ERSO in PVC/DOP plastigels was evaluated from mechanical properties' measurements, leaching/migration tests, and water vapor permeability studies. The results showed that a large proportion of DOP could be substituted by ERSO in a PVC plastisol formulation without deleterious effects on the properties of the plastigels...|$|E

In order to prevent decomposition of PVC, thermal stabilizers are added to PVC. The synergistic effect of zinc stearate (ZnSt 2) and/or natural zeolite (clinoptilolite) on PVC thermal stability was investigated in this project. For this purpose PVC plastisol was prepared by mixing poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and dioctyphthalate (DOP) and stabilized with different amounts of metal soaps and zeolite. The materials and the prepared PVC plastisols were characterized by spectroscopic and thermal analysis techniques. The gelation of the plastisols was observed by optical microscopy and the photographs were taken by a digital camera. The complete gelation was observed at 185 °C. The morphology of PVC <b>plastigel</b> films were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) {{analysis was used to}} obtain elemental compositions in polymer and particle phases. The thermal stability of PVC plastigels in terms of color were obtained by heating them in a static vaccum oven. When zeolite was used as a primary stabilizer it prevented the early blackening of the film. Kinetic study of dehydrochlorination was determined by 763 PVC Thermomat equipment for unstabilized and stabilized PVC plastigels. When PVC plastigels were heated in PVC Thermomat in the presence of nitrogen gas, the conductivity of water which nitrogen gas was passed due to the evolved HCl, changed with respect to time. The period when conductivity starts to increase is called as induction time, and the period when the conductivity value reaches to 50 uS/cm is called as stability time. The induction and stability time values of unstabilized and stabilized PVC <b>plastigel</b> films were obtained at 140 and 160 °C.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{activator}} ZnO and heating time at 190 °C on foaming, gelation, and dehydrochlorination of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) plastisol was investigated. For this purpose, a PVC plastisol was prepared by mixing PVC, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), azodicarbonamide (ADC), ZnO, and the heat stabilizers calcium stearate (CaSt 2) and zinc stearate(ZnSt 2). PVC plastisol films were heated for 3, 6, 12, and 24 min periods at 190 °C to see {{the effect of}} heating time on the gelation and foaming processes of the PVC foam. The time of 12 min {{was determined to be}} optimum for the completion of gelation and foaming processes without thermal degradation of PVC. No foaming was observed under the same conditions for the samples without ZnO. ZnO had a significant catalytic effect on ADC decomposition, accelerating the foaming of the films. Average porosity measurement showed a consistent increase in porosity with heating time up to 76 % and the average density decreased from 1. 17 to 0. 29 g/cm 3 on foaming. Tensile tests showed that the tensile strength and tensile strain both increased considerably up to 0. 98 MPa and 207 %, respectively, with heating time and the elastic modulus was seen to gradually decrease from 4. 7 to 0. 7 MPa with heating time. Films without ZnO had higher tensile strength since there were no pores. PVC thermomat tests showed that ZnO lowered the stability time of <b>plastigel</b> film with azodicarbonamide...|$|E
