Each end of a spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> has a metal {{terminal}} that clips onto the spark plug and distributor, coil, or magneto. There are dedicated spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> pliers, tools designed for removing the terminal from a spark plug without damaging it.|$|E
50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve cover gaskets onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby plastic spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> retainers on the valve cover {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|E

50|$|Placing spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> {{back into}} their {{separators}} or holders during replacement helps {{to keep them in}} place despite engine vibration, extending their life. A common problem with spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> is corrosion of the metal end terminals. Better-quality spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> usually have brass terminals, which are more resistant to corrosion than other metals used.|$|R

50|$|Older engines {{also have}} a wire {{connecting}} the ignition coil to the distributor, known as a coil wire. A coil wire is of the same construction as a spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire,</b> but generally shorter and with different terminals. Some distributors have an ignition coil built inside them, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate coil wire, e.g. GM High energy ignition system and some Toyotas and Hondas.|$|E

Self-contained units used to time automotive engines have an inductive pickup that clamps around the proper spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> and serves as the trigger for the strobe. Power for the strobe comes directly from the vehicle's battery. Some older timing lights require {{the removal of the}} spark plug boot in order to attach a direct pickup between the wire's terminal and the centre conductor of the spark plug.|$|E

5000|$|Die-Cut <b>Plug</b> <b>Wiring</b> Diagram Book is an artist's book by the English artist Mark Pawson, {{originally}} published in early 1992.

50|$|Another sort of {{ignition}} system commonly used on small off-road motorcycles in the 1960s and 1970s was called Energy Transfer. A coil under the flywheel generated a strong DC current pulse as the flywheel magnet moved over it. This DC current flowed through a wire to an ignition coil mounted {{outside of the}} engine. The points sometimes were under the flywheel for two-stroke engines, and commonly on the camshaft for four-stroke engines. This system worked like all Kettering (points/coil) {{ignition system}}s... the opening points trigger {{the collapse of the}} magnetic field in the ignition coil, producing a high voltage pulse which flows through the spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> to the spark plug.|$|E
50|$|A {{common use}} of {{dielectric}} grease is in high-voltage connections associated with gasoline engine spark plugs. The grease {{is applied to}} the rubber boot of the <b>plug</b> <b>wire.</b> This helps the rubber boot slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to seal the rubber boot, {{while at the same time}} preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally, spark plugs are located in areas of high temperature and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected. It can be applied to the actual contact as well, because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film. Doing so on such high pressure contact surfaces between different metals has the advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration from galvanic corrosion.|$|E
50|$|If a {{backfire}} {{does occur}} in the exhaust, that is called an after-fire. The term backfire is when unburned fuel moves back into the intake, and combusts, whereas an after-fire combusts unburned fuel in the exhaust side of the combustion cycle. A likely cause of this is from running rich, which in certain cases could be from the combustion not achieving high enough temperatures to correctly burn the fuel. Meaning a foul spark plug, coil, or <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> could be the cause. In most cases, after-fires are bad due to the combustion, or fire within the muffler or exhaust system. This will over time cause damage to the mufflers and piping of the exhaust—eventually leading to an exhaust leak, and a burned out muffler/catalytic converter. Also there will be performance lost due to a weaker combustion.|$|E
50|$|Automotive spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> are {{insulated}} {{by multiple}} layers of silicone to prevent sparks from jumping to adjacent wires, causing misfires. Silicone tubing is sometimes used in automotive intake systems (especially for engines with forced induction).|$|R
5000|$|Spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> have {{an outer}} {{insulation}} several times thicker than the conductor, {{made of a}} very flexible and heat-resistant material such as silicone or EPDM rubber. The thick insulation prevents arcing from the cable to an earthed engine component. A rubber [...] "boot" [...] covers each terminal. Dielectric grease {{can be used to}} improve insulation; a small amount can be applied in the inside of the rubber boot at each end of each wire to help seal out moisture. Printing on spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> may include a brand name, insulation thickness (in millimeters), insulation material type, cylinder number, and conductor type (suppressor or solid wire).|$|R
50|$|The {{first edition}} of Die-Cut <b>Plug</b> <b>Wiring</b> Diagram Book is a small softback book {{containing}} 36 photocopied <b>plug</b> <b>wiring</b> diagrams, mostly in colour using different coloured toners in monochrome photocopiers; 3 full colour photocopies have been tipped in as well. The 'de-luxe version' {{of the book is}} sewn together using different coloured threads that mimic electrical wiring, whilst the ordinary edition is stapled. The 'de-luxe' version sold for £3.00, twice the asking price of the stapled version. The cover is a grainy photocopy of the back of a plug diagram with three holes cut into it (where the pins would go). There is a brief essay at the end by Pawson discussing his collection of plugs, and their essential Britishness. The last page lists credits of 'contributing electricians'.|$|R

During the second weekend of time trials, Mike Hiss was drafted as a substitute, and qualified the car for Mario (he qualified 8th fastest). Mario himself won at Belgium. On race day, Mario got back in the cockpit and the car was moved {{to the back of the}} field due to the driver change. Early in the race, Andretti lost 8 laps when he had to make a long pit stop to change a spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire.</b> He was effectively out of contention very early on, and wound up 15 laps down at the finish.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, when Oswalt {{was with}} the Class A Michigan Battle Cats in the Midwest League, he {{suffered}} an apparently serious shoulder injury. After a month of pain in his upper shoulder, Oswalt was convinced that his shoulder was torn. Shortly thereafter, he was checking the spark plug wires on his pickup truck. He touched one of the spark plug wires, causing the truck's engine to start. The truck's electric current flowed through Oswalt's body, and consequently {{the muscles in his}} hand tightened on the spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire.</b> Unable to let go of it, Oswalt grasped the wire for almost one minute. Oswalt then claimed his foot slipped off the truck's bumper and he was finally [...] "thrown off." [...] After the electric shock, Oswalt told his wife that his shoulder's condition improved and that he no longer felt any pain. According to Sports Illustrated, he reported it thus to his wife: [...] "My truck done shocked the fire out of me, and my arm don't hurt no more." [...] Apparently, the electric charge loosened accumulated scar tissue in the shoulder. Oswalt claims he has not felt any pain in his shoulder since the incident. He finished 1999 with 143 strikeouts and a club-high 13 wins.|$|E

50|$|By late 1977, he {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Frank Williams, who was looking to rebuild his Formula One racing team. Williams Grand Prix had struggled for success in its first years and Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. As well as Williams, he also signed with Haas-Hall for 1978, and competed in a Lola 333CS in the Can-Am series, winning the title. Jones took nine poles in ten races but missed the Laguna Seca race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in Brian Redman finished twelfth in that race after the kill wire was crimped under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition. Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to Elliot Forbes-Robinson at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire,</b> retired through accident at St Jovite and lost a radiator at Watkins Glen. He finished third at Trois-Rivières after losing a shift fork and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am race in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and Keke Rosberg finished 1-2, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start. For Williams, his best result that season was a second-place finish at Watkins Glen. Jones helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the Williams FW07, after winning four races in the span of five events {{near the end of the}} season. Jones finished third in the championship that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign. Jones's best years in Formula One had just begun, in the middle of the ground-effect era.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 190. Jimmie Johnson beat Truex on the {{restart to}} take the lead on the ensuing lap. McMurray brought out the fourth caution of the race after suffering an engine failure on the frontstretch. He said afterwards that the engine [...] "vibrated earlier in the race and it went away. And it’s weird because engine issues usually don’t go away. It felt like it had power and then I don’t know about 40 laps before it finally blew up, it just started vibrating real bad. Very unfortunate. It is just the way it goes. The No. 42 had their problem early in the race and then at that point I’m like, ‘Well it’s kind of Austin (Dillon) and I that are going to battle this out.’ Our cars are pretty close so {{this is going to be}} a pretty good battle down to the end.” He also added that keeping the car out as long as he did with engine issues was [...] "wishful thinking at that point. No one wants to stay out and blow up, not to oil the track down. Also it's hard to diagnose the problem if the motor's blown up. Because you're in a position this weekend where you just have to go for it and what you hope is you've got something as simple as a <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> or a spark plug that you can replace and the motor's not going to grenade. We came here and looked at it, and actually on the digital dash, we have a little diagnosis page and nothing is showing up, so we didn't know what was wrong. We were just going to salvage as long as we could." [...] He went on to finish 40th.|$|E
