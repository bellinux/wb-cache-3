He never spoke publicly about the incident, and it was quickly sidelined by the press and politely ignored by writers during his lifetime. Privately he made donations to gay campaign groups, but did not endorse them in public. In his later years {{he said to the}} actor Simon Callow, [...] "I do admire <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> and Ian McKellen for coming out, but I can't be doing with that myself." ...|$|E

On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> and me, {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Feminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's {{decision}} to award Jenner with a [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman {{could be better}} than [...] "someone who is just born a woman." [...] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for statingin a BuzzFeed interview that the hardest part about being a woman [...] "is figuring out what to wear". McGowan argued: [...] "We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you.</b> You're a woman now? Well fucking learn {{that we have had}} a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege." [...] McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: [...] "Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism." ...|$|E

500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening to <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> and me", whereas [...] "stars {{bring a lot of}} memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{the song}} was {{included}} on the Parents Music Resource Center's (PMRC) [...] "Filthy Fifteen" [...] list, for the sexual content of its lyrics. The Center's founder Tipper Gore had heard her daughter listening to the song, and considered the line [...] "Gonna dress you up in my love" [...] as exemplifying 'vulgar music'. The PMRC called upon the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors– a rating system based on lyrical content. [...] "Dress You Up" [...] received a rating of 'S', for [...] "sex and obscenity", from the RIAA. Gore commented on the song: [...] "Popular culture is morally bankrupt, flagrantly licentious and utterly materialistic—and Madonna is the worst of all." [...] According to Bruce David Forbes and H. Mahan in their book Religion and Popular Culture in America, Madonna's fans took the attitude [...] "Can't you cultural conservatives see what {{she is trying to}} do—to annoy <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>you!</b> If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Stop trying to police my morality!" [...] The campaign was successful and {{led to the creation of}} the Parental Advisory sticker.|$|E

Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears.

[...] During an email exchange with Glenn Greenwald, a critic of the New Atheists, Harris argued that [...] "Islamophobia is a term of propaganda designed to protect Islam from the forces of secularism by conflating all criticism of it with racism and xenophobia.
