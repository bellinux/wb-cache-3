However, to enable wider adoption of the technology and new applications like photonic sampling, optical arbitrary waveform generation or the calibration of astronomical spectrographs, multi-GHz repetition rate femtosecond lasers with robust performance metrics, low cost, and a compact footprint are highly desirable. In this thesis, different approaches to develop GHz mode-locked laser systems at telecommunication wavelengths are discussed and current achievements presented. Design aspects for constructing a long-term stable and compact fiber laser with 187 fs short pulses at a repetition rate of 1 GHz are covered. In order to scale the repetition rate into the multi- GHz regime, coherent <b>pulse</b> <b>interleaving</b> in novel thermally tunable waveguide interleavers is demonstrated at 10 GHz. A femtosecond erbium-doped waveguide laser is developed at GHz repetition rates and important design guidelines are provided. As saturable Bragg reflectors are crucial in all of the described systems to enable mode-locking, saturable absorber optimization is discussed and their optical performance compared. Thus, this research paves the way for compact, affordable high repetition rate fiber lasers and monolithically integrated femtosecond laser sources which can be combined on-chip with additional functionalities to develop novel photonic systems with impact on spectroscopy, sensing, telecommunications and biomedical applications. by Michelle Y.

40|$|A voltage {{controlled}} oscillator (VCO), that generates a periodic signal whose frequency is tuned by a voltage, {{is a key}} building block in any integrated circuit systems. A sine wave oscillator {{can be used for}} a built-in self testing where high linearity is required. A bandpass filter (BPF) based oscillator is a preferred solution, and high quality factor (Q-factor) is needed to improve the linearity. However, a stringent linearity specification may require very high Q-factor, not practical to implement. To address this problem, a frequency harmonic shaping technique is proposed. It utilizes a finite impulse response filter improving the linearity by rejecting certain harmonics. A prototype SC BPF oscillator with an oscillating frequency of 10 MHz is designed and measurement results show that linearity is improved by 20 dB over a conventional oscillator. In radio frequency area, preferred oscillator structures are an LC oscillator and a ring oscillator. An LC oscillator exhibits good phase noise but an expensive cost of an inductor is disadvantageous. A ring oscillator can be built in standard CMOS process, but suffers due to a poor phase noise and is sensitive to supply noise. A RC BPF oscillator is proposed to compromise the above difficulties. A RC BPF oscillator at 2. 5 GHz is designed and measured performance is better than ring oscillators when compared using a figure of merit. In particular, the frequency tuning range of the proposed oscillator is superior to the ring oscillator. VCO is normally incorporated with a frequency synthesizer (FS) for an accurate frequency control. In an integer-N FS, reference spur is one of the design concerns in communication systems since it degrades a signal to noise ratio. Reference spurs can be rejected more by either the lower loop bandwidth or the higher loop filter. But the former increases a settling time and the latter decreases phase margin. An adaptive lowpass filtering technique is proposed. The loop filter order is adaptively increased after the loop is locked. A 5. 8 GHz integer-N FS is designed and measurement results show that reference spur rejection is improved by 20 dB over a conventional FS without degrading the settling time.

40|$|For {{past few}} decades, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used {{for a wide variety}} of clinical and biological research due to its excellent contrast of soft tissues in high resolution. MRI is performed in roughly two sequential procedures: excitation and acquisition. In excitation, magnetization in the target imaging volume is prepared, and in acquisition, its Fourier transform samples are measured. Conventional excitation entails transmitting a magnetic field in a radio-frequency (RF) with a single RF transmission coil. While most RF transmission excite single slices, one shortcoming of the single coil RF transmission is that it is very hard to spatially tailor the RF pulse deposition pattern in 2 D or 3 D because there is just one source for the RF transmission. Unfortunately, this is a significant limitation for multi-dimensional excitation, which recently gained much interest as a potential solution for problems such as inner-volume imaging, signal recovery for functional MRI, and robust fat-saturation. Recently, parallel excitation, simultaneous transmission of multiple RF pulses with multiple transmission coils, has been proposed to overcome this limitation of conventional single coil transmission. Many RF pulse design methods have been proposed, but most of them focused only on the optimization of the RF pulse waveforms, leaving the gradient waveforms unoptimized. In this thesis, we introduce a fast joint optimization scheme for RF pulse and gradient waveforms in parallel excitation to further enhance the excitation accuracy in both small and large tip-angle domains. We assumed an RF pulse sequence for slice-selective excitation, which is composed of trains of weighted slice-selective basis RF <b>pulses</b> <b>interleaved</b> by in-plane gradient blips. Our algorithm seeks to find effective RF pulse weights and the in-plane gradient blips considering an off-resonance effect.

Also our method could provide faster computation than conventional methods performing a convex optimization or an exhaustive greedy search by performing a fast greedy search in a much reduced candidate set...|$|R

Compared to a six-switch voltage-source-converter and a diode rectifier with a shunt active filter, DHCC presents some advantages and has good potentials for grid-tied and generator-tied applications. In the previous literature, the DHCC was controlled through a hysteresis regulator. This paper discusses in detail the current compensation and harmonic cancellation methodologies and presents improved control techniques for the three phase three-wire DHCC using <b>interleaved</b> <b>pulse</b> width modulation (PWM). PWM controllers require smaller filtering elements and/or a lower sampling frequency. The Matlab simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PWM control algorithm...|$|R

Fundamental in the design of practical output stabilizing control laws is the internal stability of the closed loop system. The first part of the thesis considers the issue of output stabilization for a continuous time affine system using a static state output linearising control law. The system considered exhibits no drift for zero output. The control considered exponentially stabilizes the system output provided the closed loop system remains internally stable. In general it is too much to hope for globally well defined closed loop dynamics, however, it is shown that there exists a neighbourhood of the zero output level set for which the closed loop system is internally stable. <b>Interleaved</b> <b>Pulse</b> Train Spectrum Estimation. The second part of the thesis considers a problem closely related to the pulse train deinterleaving proble [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} an improved clutter suppression method for the multiple pulse repetition time (PRT) technique based on simulated radar data. The suppression method is constructed using maximum likelihood methodology in time domain and is called parametric time domain method (PTDM). The procedure relies {{on the assumption that}} precipitation and clutter signal spectra follow a Gaussian functional form. The multiple <b>interleaved</b> <b>pulse</b> repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are used in this work are set to four PRFs (952, 833, 667, and 513 [*]Hz). Based on radar simulation, it is shown that the new method can provide accurate retrieval of Doppler velocity even in the case of strong clutter contamination. The obtained velocity is nearly unbiased for all the range of Nyquist velocity interval. Also, the performance of the method is illustrated on simulated radar data for plan position indicator (PPI) scan. Compared with staggered 2 -PRT transmission schemes with PTDM, the proposed method presents better estimation accuracy under certain clutter situations...|$|R
