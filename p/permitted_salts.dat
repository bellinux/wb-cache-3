This extraction method involves first mixing the sample with acetonitrile and <b>permit</b> the <b>salt</b> out liquid-liquid partitioning step using anhydrous MgSO 4 and sodium acetate. After shaking and centrifugation, cleanup is done by dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) using 150 mg of anhydrous MgSO 4, 150 mg of PSA, and 50 mg of C- 18 per milliiter of extract. The optimized analytical conditions were evaluated in terms of recoveries, repeatability, limits of quantitation and matrix effects for lettuce sample. Use of matrix matched standards provided acceptable results for most pesticides with overall average recoveries between 70 and 120 % and consistent RSD < 15 % for organochlorine pesticides...|$|R
40|$|Various {{physiological}} mechanisms regulate {{sodium and}} water {{balance in the}} human body. These processes achieve acute and chronic sodium regulation and the simultaneous or se-quential changes can be explained using a single physiological model. Steady intracellular water and osmolality is necessary for cell membrane integrity and cellular processes. Body fluids protect circulatory blood volume by altering Na &#x 002 B; and water balance. This is the most vital homeostatic function of the body. Changes in ECF volume are sensed by various cardinal sensors. Physio-logically, the main aim of Na &#x 002 B; and water balance is to <b>permit</b> variable <b>salt</b> and water intake without large fluctuations in blood pressure or volume status. Homeostatic processes act in an integrated fashion to protect against any perturbations. Characteristically, these mechanisms are sequential as well as parallel. These may be synergistic or antagonistic to each other. Rapidity, sensitivity and potency of these powerful feedback systems differ. Various physiological and pathological insults determine the magnitude of response of these systems...|$|R

40|$|In some Southern European countries, it {{is common}} {{practice}} to add varying quantities of salt to the ice used to cool and preserve the sardine, so as to improve its texture and allow longer storage. Considering that sardine stored in this way {{may be used in}} the manufacture of a number of different products, the effects of salt in the ice were investigated, with reference to functional properties such as protein solubility (PS), emulsifying capacity (EC) and apparent viscosity (ηapp). The added salt significantly increased (P≦ 0. 05) the salt content of the muscle, bringing about an initial reduction in protein solubility and a decrease in EC and ηapp as storage time progresses. In the absence of salt, these two functional properties remain constant or are enhanced. Thus, although <b>salt</b> <b>permits</b> prolonged storage, protein functions are reduced in sardine treated in this way to that in non-salted sardine, making the salted sardine is less suitable for subsequent use in different technological processes. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Bile salts and {{bacteria}} have intricate relationships. The {{composition of the}} intestinal pool of bile salts is shaped by bacterial metabolism. In turn, bile salts {{play a role in}} intestinal homeostasis by controlling the size and the composition of the intestinal microbiota. As a consequence, alteration of the microbiome–bile salt homeostasis can play a role in hepatic and gastrointestinal pathological conditions. Intestinal bacteria use bile salts as environmental signals and in certain cases as nutrients and electron acceptors. However, bile salts are antibacterial compounds that disrupt bacterial membranes, denature proteins, chelate iron and calcium, cause oxidative damage to DNA, and control the expression of eukaryotic genes involved in host defense and immunity. Bacterial species adapted to the mammalian gut are able to endure the antibacterial activities of bile salts by multiple physiological adjustments that include remodeling of the cell envelope and activation of efflux systems and stress responses. Resistance to bile <b>salts</b> <b>permits</b> that certain bile-resistant pathogens can colonize the hepatobiliary tract, and an outstanding example is the chronic infection of the gall bladder by Salmonella enterica. A better understanding of the interactions between bacteria and bile salts may inspire novel therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary diseases that involve microbiome alteration, as well as novel schemes against bacterial infections...|$|R
40|$|Deterioration of {{diaphragm}} {{function is}} one of the prominent factors that contributes to the susceptibility of serious respiratory infections and development of respiratory failure in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The NF-κB signaling pathway has been implicated as a contributing factor of dystrophic pathology, making it a potential therapeutic target. Previously, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB via a small NEMO Binding Domain (NBD) peptide was beneficial for reducing pathological features of mdx mice. Now, we stringently test the effectiveness and clinical potential of NBD by treating mdx mice with various formulations of NBD and use diaphragm function as our primary outcome criteria. We found that administering DMSO-soluble NBD rescued 78 % of the contractile deficit between mdx and wild-type (WT) diaphragm. Interestingly, synthesis of a GLP NBD peptide as an acetate <b>salt</b> <b>permitted</b> its solubility in water, but as a negative consequence, also greatly attenuated functional efficacy. However, replacing the acetic acid counterion of the NBD peptide with trifluoroacetic acid retained the peptide’s water solubility and significantly restored mdx diaphragm contractile function and improved histopathological indices of disease in both diaphragm and limb muscle. Together, these results support the feasibility of using a mass-produced, water-soluble NBD peptide for clinical use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe flocculation of montmorillonite in the presence of a glucose polymer (dextran) and to observe the effect of saturating cation and coagulant addition on the flocculation process. Flocculation of montmorillonite was dependent on polymer molecular weight, polymer/clay ratio (w/w), nature of exchangeable cation, and ionic strength of the suspension to which the polymer was added. The T 500 dextran (molecular weight = 5 x 105) caused enhanced sedimentation of Ca-montmorillonite suspension at a polymer/clay ratio of-< 0. 01. Increasing the polymer concentration above this level stabilized the suspension such that sedimentation was less than or equal to that of the control. The T 2000 dextran (molecular weight = 2 x 106) caused a similar increase in the sedimentation of Ca-montmorillonite at polymer/clay ratios of < 0. 1. The ability of the T 2000 polymer to cause flocculation at greater polymer/clay ratios as compared to the T 500 polymer was attributed to the lower osmolic pressure between clay particles for equal concentrations of the two polymers. Flocculation of Camontmorillonite by dextran was enhanced when the clay had initially been coagulated by the addition of salt. Reduction of the diffuse double layer upon addition of <b>salt</b> <b>permitted</b> the polymer to extend beyond the electrostatic barrier of the clays. Dextran was not able to flocculate Mg-montmorillonite suspensions with or without the presence of coagulant. The displacement of water molecules at the clay surface rather than within the hydration shell of the more highly polarizing Mg cations by polymer segments resulted in a greater polymer collapse on the clay surface leaving fewer and shorter polymer loops and tails available for contacting adjacent clay particles.

40|$|For order-disorder {{transitions}} of double- and triple-stranded {{nucleic acid}} helices, the midpoint temperatures Tm depend strongly on a +/-, the mean ionic activity of uniunivalent salt. Experimental determinations of dTm/d ln a +/- {{and of the}} enthalpy change (delta H(o)) accompanying the transition in excess <b>salt</b> <b>permit</b> evaluation of delta gamma, the stoichiometrically weighted combination of preferential interaction coefficients, each of which reflects thermodynamic effects of interactions of salt ions with a reactant or product of the conformational transition (formula; see text) Here delta H(o) is defined per mole of nucleotide by analogy to delta gamma. Application of Eq. 1 to experimental values of delta H(o) and Tm yields values of delta gamma for the denaturation of B-DNA over the range of NaCl concentrations 0. 01 – 0. 20 M (Privalov et al. (1969), Biopolymers 8, 559) and for each of four order-disorder transitions of poly rA. (poly rU) n, n = 1, 2 over the range of NaCl concentrations 0. 01 – 1. 0 M (Krakauer and Sturtevant (1968), Biopolymers 6, 491). For denaturation of duplexes and triplexes, delta gamma is negative and not significantly dependent on a +/-, but delta gamma is positive and dependent on a +/- for the disproportionation transition of poly rA. poly rU duplexes. Quantitative interpretations of these trends and magnitudes of delta gamma in terms of coulombic and excluded volume effects are obtained by fitting separately {{each of the two}} sets of thermodynamic data using Eq. 1 with delta gamma PB evaluated from the cylindrically symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for a standard model of salt-polyelectrolyte solutions. The only structural parameters required by this model are: b, the mean axial distance between the projections of adjacent polyion charges onto the cylindrical axis; and a, the mean distance of closest approach between a salt ion center and the cylindrical axis. Fixing bMS and aMS for the multi-stranded (ordered) conformations, we determined the corresponding best fitted values of bSS and aSS for single-stranded RNA and DNA. The resulting best fitted values of aSS are systematically less than aDS by 2 – 4 A. Uncertainty in the best-fitted values of bSS is significantly lower than in the aSS, because bMS is known with relatively high precision and because the larger uncertainty in aMS has a relatively small effect on the best-fitted values of bSS:bSS = 3. 2 +/- 0. 6 A for single-stranded poly rA and poly rU; and bSS = 3. 4 +/- 0. 2 A for single-stranded DNA.
