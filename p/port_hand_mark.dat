50|$|By {{the late}} 1960s Doel {{was running the}} {{business}} virtually single <b>handed,</b> <b>Marks</b> having died and Cohen too elderly to oversee day-to-day operations.|$|R

50|$|A player {{goes out}} when he {{successfully}} discards the only remaining card in <b>hand,</b> <b>marking</b> {{the conclusion of the}} step for all players. A player gets to this point by laying down and then playing off his and other players’ hands.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A boy {{during his}} upanayana ritual. The thin, yellow Yajnopavita thread runs from left {{shoulder}} to waist. Note the munja grass girdle around the waist. The peepal tree twig {{in his right}} <b>hand</b> <b>marks</b> his entry into the Brahmacharya stage of life.|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} solid small forward {{option for the}} Bulldogs, and in 2005 took a one <b>handed</b> <b>mark</b> against the Brisbane Lions in Round 18 {{which was one of}} the {{spectacular}} highlights of his season. Robbins finished with 31 goals from 16 games in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The codex {{contains}} {{almost complete}} {{text of the}} four Gospels on 340 parchment leaves (...) , with lacunae (Mark 1:1-3:8). The text is written in one column per page, in 19-23 lines per page, by several different <b>hands.</b> <b>Mark</b> 1:1-3:8 was supplied by a later hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went through}} my {{calculations}} yesterday, and I am {{sure that there is}} no mistake in the figures. If I am right, this is the island that we see ahead, the one called Samona; while that we see dimly away on the <b>port</b> <b>hand</b> is Mariguana. I don't see, by this map, any land marked that could be that which we see on the starboard hand.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>mark</b> Captain Dandoins {{on the street}} of that same Village; sauntering with a face of indifference, a heart eaten of black care!

50|$|Hopalong Cassidy and his sidekicks California Carlson and Lin Bradley {{leave their}} Bar 20 ranch for a cattle buy from the Stevens spread.

60|$|The breeze {{came down}} fresher {{as they drove}} out through the Narrows. Carroll had gone below; and, {{brushing}} his thoughts aside, Vane busied himself hauling {{in some of the}} mainsheet, while the water splashed more loudly beneath the bows. The great black firs rolled by in somber masses over his <b>port</b> <b>hand,</b> and presently the last of the lights were blotted out. He was alone, flitting swiftly and smoothly across the glittering sea.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, the {{moonlight}} got brighter, and when Andrew called Whitney {{they were running}} up a channel with a strip of glistening sand astern and a wild turmoil of foaming water close on their <b>port</b> <b>hand.</b> This, no doubt, marked the Horseshoe Spit, with the tide streaming across it to meet the surf. Whitney could not see how they had avoided the bank astern; {{but he was not}} given much time to look about.|$|R

60|$|At {{eleven o'clock}} the Squire {{drove down to}} Reigate, taking Mark with him, as it would save all trouble about putting up the horse and pony.

5000|$|The Preludes taut {{structure}} is in ternary form, consisting of an opening [...] "A" [...] section with punctuated sixteenth-note chords (marked Alla marcia), a more lyrical and melancholy [...] "B" [...] section with sweeping arpeggios {{in the left}} <b>hand</b> (<b>marked</b> Poco meno mosso), a transition into the original tempo, and a recapitulation of the initial march.|$|R
60|$|The Manyamba {{was not a}} fast boat; she {{anchored}} off many surf-hammered beaches {{before she}} reached the one where the adventurers had arranged to disembark, and where, as it happened, Dom Pedro had built his principal factory. He proved a pleasant companion, though Dane fancied that he was weak alike in character and in principle. One day as they rolled slowly along the spray-veiled coast with a maze of half-seen mangroves over the <b>port</b> <b>hand,</b> Dom Pedro sauntered across the deck toward Dane.|$|R
60|$|There was no wind {{except the}} draught the steamer made as she lurched across the {{dazzling}} swell. Cuba floated like a high, blue cloud over the <b>port</b> <b>hand,</b> {{cut off from}} the water by a blaze of reflected light, and the broad Yucatan Channel, glimmering like silver, stretched ahead. The deck had been holystoned and well sluiced before sunrise and was not quite dry, and there was a slight coolness in the air where Evelyn Cliffe sat under the awning.|$|R
50|$|Manzanillo is the state’s primary {{port and}} tourist destination. It's on the Pacific coast, {{less than two}} hour’s drive from the capital. Manzanillo is mostly popular with {{regional}} tourists and sports fishermen, {{but there have been}} efforts to broaden its appeal. The city is one of Mexico’s important Pacific <b>ports,</b> <b>handing</b> regional merchandise and acting as an overflow port for other ports from Mexico to Los Angeles. Most of the state’s recent economic development has been related to this port.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't {{ever feel}} about them as I have done,' said Arthurine, in tears. 'Daisy and Pansy said {{so much about}} poor dear Fred, and every one being hard on him, and his feeling my good influence--and {{all the time he}} was {{plotting}} this against me, with my chalk in his <b>hand</b> <b>marking</b> my grass,' and she broke down in child-like sobs.|$|R
5000|$|In this episode, Daniel sprays fake tan {{on himself}} {{to make him}} look like he's been away. When he returns to work he hugs Wilhelmina and makes orange <b>hand</b> <b>marks</b> on her back. Later on in the episode when Wilhelmina is in the closet with Christina the orange marks are gone from Wihemina's back however she is wearing the same white outfit! ...|$|R
50|$|The Great Channel in the Inner Moray Firth, was dredged by {{engineers}} in 1917 for the safe passage of ships {{that wanted to}} avoid the long and dangerous passage around the north of Scotland, by transiting the Caledonian Canal.

5000|$|The 'handlock' is a {{strategy}} mastered {{by those who are}} the best at mercy. Beware, 2 strong players could make each other's fingers numb and cause <b>hand</b> <b>marks</b> over them. Sometimes, if a person knows they will lose, they say [...] "What's the name of this game?" [...] to the other player. The other player may say [...] "Mercy", signifying a win for the person who asked.|$|R
50|$|The {{management}} of Lüshun Naval <b>Port</b> changed <b>hands</b> from China, to Russia 1895-1904, to Japan 1905-1945, to the Soviet Union 1945-55, {{and then back}} to China after 1955.|$|R
60|$|One night, {{some days}} after the {{incident}} just recorded, the Evening Star shot her gear, in obedience to orders, on the <b>port</b> <b>hand,</b> and proceeded, {{with the rest of}} the fleet, to give a pressing invitation to those fish which inhabited that particular shoal in the North Sea known to fishermen by the name of Skimlico. The name, when properly spelt, runs thus: Schiermonik-oog. But our fishermen, with a happy disregard of orthography, and, perhaps, with an eye to that brevity which is said to be the soul of wit, prefer to call it Skimlico.|$|R
5000|$|The voyage {{toward the}} coast of North Africa proved uneventful until 7 November 1942. Almaack—in column 01 of convoy KMFA1—went to general {{quarters}} at 0515, and soon thereafter heard an aircraft close by, on her <b>port</b> <b>hand.</b> At 0538, her watch noted the torpedoing of the nearby transport [...] Ultimately, at 1800 the section of KMFA1 to which Almaack had been attached was directed to proceed to the waters off Algiers. As she stood toward the coast, she observed navigation lights—still burning but with reduced visibility—at Cape Matifu and Cape Caxine.|$|R
60|$|Annaple {{listened and}} knitted quietly while the affairs were {{explained}} on either <b>hand.</b> <b>Mark</b> had had one serious talk with George Greenleaf, and both {{had had a}} stormy scene with Goodenough. Then Mr. Dutton had telegraphed his arrival, and Greenleaf had met him in London, with hopes, bred of long and implicit trust, that his sagacity and perhaps his wealth would carry the old house through the crisis.|$|R
