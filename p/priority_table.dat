40|$|Abstract. Among {{preemptive}} real-time uniprocessor scheduling algorithms, many researches, such as optimal and heuristic algorithms, considers {{only one}} task attribute and neglects also the variation of attributes. To understand {{the relations between}} task attributes and scheduling success ratio, we first define the sensitivity of scheduling success ratio to task attributes. Sensitivity means the intensity of variation of scheduling success ratio as task attributes varies. The paper analyzes the sensitivities of scheduling success ratio to arrival time, execution time, deadline and laxity respectively, which have close relations with scheduling. Based on the definition of sensitivity, we also define attributes ’ influence on scheduling success ratio, {{which is that the}} greater the influence, the higher the ratio. The essence of dynamic scheduling is a scheduling based on priority, with each dynamic algorithm matching a <b>priority</b> <b>table,</b> and vice versa. It is also much easier to infer the algorithm from the <b>priority</b> <b>table,</b> which can consider several task attributes. As <b>priority</b> <b>table</b> has various designs, it can correspond to a lot of algorithms, among which, many are inefficient. In order to deal with this kind of problem, we propose a new <b>priority</b> <b>table</b> design PTBM combining deadline and laxity based on the analysis of sensitivity and influence, which makes that a task with small deadline and large laxity has higher priority. We compare PTBM with EDF, LLF and PTD through simulation. The results verify the analysis of sensitivity and influence, and it also shows that PTBM outperforms on scheduling success ratio. It needs further exploration to design more efficient <b>priority</b> <b>table</b> by analyzing more task attributes ’ influence on scheduling success ratio, which includes criticalness, task type and so on...|$|E

It {{is applicable}} in environments where data requests arrive with different requirements such as real-time deadline, and user priority. Previous work on CPU scheduling {{is based on}} traditional CPU scheduler for meeting the real-time deadlines. The general idea is based on modeling the CPU scheduler in RTDBS requests aspoints in the multi-dimensional space, where each of the dimensions {{represents one of the}} parameters i. e. one dimension represents the deadline of task, another represents the criticalness or value and a third dimension represents the priority of the request, etc. The CPU scheduling problem reduces the problem of finding a linear order to scheduling these multidimensional points. <b>Priority</b> <b>table</b> base algorithms are adopted to define a linear order for sorting and scheduling objects that lie in the multi-dimensional space.

40|$|Abstract—The co-channel {{interference}} (CCI) limits {{the capacity of}} wireless networks due to {{the limited number of}} available channels {{and the fact that the}} same channel must be reused in the system. Recently, we proposed the interference-aware channel segregation based dynamic channel assignment (IACS-DCA). Stable channel reuse pattern can be formed in a distributed manner which can minimize the CCI experienced at access points (APs) or base stations (BSs). In this paper, we introduce a multi-channel access technique for the IACS-DCA. Each AP has channel <b>priority</b> <b>table,</b> in which the channels are listed by the ascending order of average CCI power. Original IACS-DCA assumes the single channel access using the first priority channel with the lowest average CCI power. By using multiple channels at the same time in the descending priority order, more number of users can access an AP. However, the use of channels below the first orders at the same time increases the CCI and may make the channel reuse pattern unstable. We examine, by computer simulation, the channel reuse pattern and confirm that the IACS-DCA improves the signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) even with multi-channel access compared to the conventional quasi-DCA using multi-channel access.

The framework combines the natural idea of different control behaviors for different mission objectives, suggested in the Behavior Based robotics approach, with the mathematical transparency of Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF) from control theory. First, each behavior is represented by a scalar function with certain CLF-like properties, describing to what extent that mission objective is satisfied. The operator then edits a <b>priority</b> <b>table</b> reflecting the order of importance between different objectives, as well as different levels of satisfaction.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} backscatter {{acquired by}} multibeam and sidescan sonars carries important {{information about the}} seafloor morphology and physical properties, providing valuable data to aid {{the difficult task of}} seafloor characterization, and important auxiliary information for a bathymetric survey. One necessary step towards this characterization is the assemblage of more consistent and more accurate mosaics of acoustic backscatter. For that, it is necessary to radiometrically correct the backscatter intensities registered by these sonars, to geometrically correct and position each acoustic sample in a projection coordinate system and to interpolate properly the intensity values into a final backscatter map. Geocoder is a software tool that implements the ideas discussed above. Initially, the original backscatter time series registered by the sonar is corrected for angle varying gains, for beam pattern and filtered for speckle removal. All samples of the time series are preserved during all the operations, ensuring that the full data resolution is used for the final mosaicking. The time serie s is then slant-range corrected based on a bathymetric model, in the case of sidescan, or based on beam bathymetry, {{in the case of the}} multibeam. Subsequently, each backscatter sample of the series is geocoded in a projected coordinate system in accordance to an interpolation scheme that resembles the acquisition geometry. An anti-aliasing algorithm is applied in parallel to the mosaicking procedure, which allows the assemblage of mosaics at any required resolution. Overlap among parallel lines is resolved by a <b>priority</b> <b>table</b> based on the distance of each sample from the ship track; a blending algorithm is applied to minimize the seams between overlapping lines.
