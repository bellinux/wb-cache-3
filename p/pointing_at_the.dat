Any existing liver damage may slow this process, increasing its concentration in blood plasma.

25|$|Personal pronouns in ASL are indexic. That is, {{they point}} to their referent, or to a locus {{representing}} their referent. When the referent is physically present, pronouns involve simply <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> referent, with different handshapes for different pronominal uses: A 'G' handshape is a personal pronoun, an extended 'B' handshape with an outward palm orientation is a possessive pronoun, and an extended-thumb 'A' handshape is a reflexive pronoun; these may be combined with numeral signs to sign 'you two', 'us three', 'all of them', etc.|$|E
25|$|Interceptions {{using the}} system started {{just like the}} normal AIS, with the {{operator}} seeking targets as the system moved in its spiral scan. When a target was selected, the radar operator turned another knob to adjust the strobe, a time-base circuit that produced a ring on the display. When the strobe lay over a target's return a button was pushed, causing the signals before or after that range to be filtered out (gating), leaving only the selected target visible on the screen. The tracking circuits would then ensure the radar dish remained <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> target as it moved.|$|E
25|$|A major {{advantage}} {{was that}} the adjustment (to set where on the propeller's disc each bullet was to impact) was now in the gun itself. This meant that each gun was adjusted separately, an important feature, since twin synchronized guns were not set to be fired in strict unison, but when they were <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same point on the propeller disc. Each gun could be fired independently, since it had its own flexible drive, linked to the engine camshaft by a junction box, and having its own clutch. This provision of a quite separate set of components for each gun also meant that a failure in the gear for one gun did not impinge on the other.|$|E

25|$|As first {{explained}} by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital {{period of a}} hypothetical satellite orbiting just above {{the surface of the}} earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|The Four Salams â€“ The Four Salams are {{the central}} part of Sama. The samazens or {{whirling}} dervishes are representative of the moon and they spin on the outside (sufi whirling) of the Sheikh who is representative of the sun. They, as previously mentioned, spin on their left foot and additionally, they have their right palm facing upwards towards Heaven and their left hand <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground. The four salams themselves are representative of the spiritual journey that every believer goes through. The first one is representative of recognition of God, the second one is recognition of the existence in his unity, the third one represents the ecstasy one experiences with total surrender and the fourth one, where the Sheikh joins in the dance, is symbolic of peace of the heart due to Divine unity. After the four salams, this part of the ceremony is concluded with another solo Taksim.|$|E

25|$|The skin {{is mounted}} with the spine {{running through the}} centre of the drum head, with the line of the spine <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> player, so the hands strike either side of the spine. Animal skins are thicker at the spine than the sides; {{mounting}} the skin with the spine centered ensures that the left and right hand play symmetric areas of equal size and thickness. In turn, this helps to minimize differences in pitch of the notes played by the left and right hand. Normally, the head end of the spine points at the player, so the hands strike the area of the skin that used to be the shoulders of the goat. With thicker skins, such as from a cow or horse, the skin round is usually taken {{from the side of the}} hide so it does not include the spine, which is too thick for use on a djembe.|$|E

500|$|Between 10 and 16 January, the Okabe Detachment [...] {{moved down}} the coast in barges to Salamaua, where it {{assembled}} and completed its preparations for the attack on Wau. On 16 January, the Japanese encountered a platoon of the 2/7th Independent Company under Captain Geoffrey Bowen. A brief action followed in which Bowen was killed, and the Australians retreated back to Skindewai. However, instead of pursuing them, Okabe chose to advance on Wau down an old and seldom used track running through difficult country parallel to the Black Cat Track, and the two sides lost contact. Okabe thereby disguised the strength and objective of his force, and took the Australians by surprise. It was necessary to cross Komiatum Hill, advance to Mubo, and then take the track westward. This route was chosen {{so as to avoid}} observation from Allied aircraft in the daytime as they cut their way into the jungle. The mountain range east of Wau was about [...] high and not particularly difficult to cross, but in parts there were no tracks. These had to be prepared without being spotted by the Allied aircraft. As the troops had to carry their food, ammunition and equipment on their backs, the advance was difficult and took longer than anticipated. Eventually they reached a peak from which they were able to look down on the Wau-Bulolo Valley. By this time, food was running short. The commander of the Okabe Detachment, <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Wau village, gave the order to attack: [...] "We are short of foodâ€”let us quickly capture Wau and get food from the enemy!" [...] However, the movement through such dense jungle caused his units to lose touch with each other. The resulting attack was delivered piecemeal, without sufficient preparation.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would like to hear it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6â€“3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E
500|$|On March 29 against Kansas, Burke {{recorded}} his fourth career double-double, with 23 points and 10 assists.

Burke also earned ESPN.com Player of the Week recognition. Although Burke admits that the team he led, with three starting freshman and no seniors, was young, he said that was no excuse <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2012 tournament champions, Kentucky, saying [...] "You saw what Kentucky did last year. We felt that being young isnâ€™t an excuse for not going far in the tournament." [...] Burke scored 24 points in the April 8, championship game against Louisville and made the 7-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when as Michigan trailed 67â€“64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean all-ball block, but was called for a foul resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game. Burke finished his sophomore season with 1,231 points, surpassing the former school record for sophomore season career point total of 1,218 by Chris Webber. His final total of 260 assists established the Michigan career record, and his average of 6.7 assists per game led the Big Ten.|$|E
