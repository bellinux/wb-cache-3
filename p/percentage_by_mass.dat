The study was conducted in two 100 -m reaches in each of six 2 nd - 3 rd order streams within the Smith and Klamath River basins in coastal northern California. Stream reaches received experimental manipulations of canopy opening and salmon carcass addition that produced sites differing in salmonid production. Within each reach, invertebrate benthos, drift, and diets from resident cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were sampled three times each during summer and winter base flow conditions and seasonal measurements of salmonid growth from PIT-tagged individuals were obtained. Taxonomic composition of the salmonid stomach samples was not substantially similar to either the drift samples or the benthic samples. Salmonids {{did not appear to be}} actively selecting for behaviorally drifting invertebrates and no relationship was observed between the growth of juvenile salmonids and the percentage of behaviorally drifting invertebrates in the drift. As such, the relative percent of behavioral drift was found to be insufficient as an index of prey availability. Contributing to the difficulty of assessing prey availability was stream flow variability, seasonal and diel abundance of other prey sources, incomplete taxonomic classification, and the opportunistic feeding behavior of juvenile salmonids.

Wood usually accounts for about 40- 60% of the wall system, the remaining portion consisting of a mortar mix and insulating fill. Cordwood construction can be sustainable depending on design and process. There are two main types of Cordwood Construction, Throughwall and M-I-M (mortar-insulation-mortar). In Throughwall, the mortar mix itself contains an insulative material, usually sawdust, chopped newsprint, or paper sludge, in sometimes very high <b>percentages</b> <b>by</b> <b>mass</b> (80% paper sludge/20% mortar). In the more common M-I-M, and unlike Brick or Throughwall masonry, the mortar does not continue throughout the wall.

Cordwood walls can be load-bearing (using built-up corners, or curved wall designed) or laid within a post and beam framework which provides structural reinforcement and is suitable for earthquake-prone areas. As a load-bearing wall, the compressive strength of wood and mortar allows for roofing to be tied directly into the wall. Different mortar mixtures and insulation fill material both affect the wall's overall R value, or resistance to heat flow; and conversely, to its inherent thermal mass, or heat/cool storage capacity.|$|R

Devising methods to lessen perchlorate contamination is crucial to minimizing the health risks associated with human exploration and colonization of Mars. We designed a perchlorate reduction pathway, which sequentially reduces perchlorate to chloride (Cl) and oxygen (O 2), for implementation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using genes obtained from perchlorate reducing bacteria Azospira oryzae and Dechloromonas aromatica, we plan to assemble this pathway directly within S. cerevisiae through recombinational cloning. A perchlorate reduction pathway would enable S. cerevisiae to lower perchlorate levels and produce oxygen, which may be harvested or used directly by S. cerevisiae for aerobic growth and compound synthesis. Moreover, using perchlorate as an external electron acceptor could improve the efficiency of redox-imbalanced production pathways in yeast. Although several perchlorate reducing bacteria have been identified and utilized in water treatment systems on Earth, {{the widespread use of}} S. cerevisiae as a synthetic biology platform justifies the development of a perchlorate reducing strain for implementation on Mars...|$|E

The facility, located at Manhattan, Kansas, has three receiving pits and one bucket elevator with a handling capacity of 190 t/h (metric ton per hour). The experiments involved moving soybeans through one of the receiving pits, followed by corn through the same flow path, without special cleaning between the two operations. Corn samples, collected at specific time intervals, were used to calculate commingling, the <b>percentage</b> <b>by</b> <b>mass</b> of soybean kernels mixed in corn. Commingling was greater than 1 % only during the first 135 s (first 2 t, 2 metric ton, received), except for the gravity-type pit configuration where commingling remained in excess of 1 % {{for the duration of the}} test (840 s or 7. 3 t of grain).

In general, the nano reinforcement is dispersed into the matrix during processing.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Coal, {{as energy}} resource, {{possesses}} numerous characteristics and properties which all {{have an influence}} on its gasification behaviour. The two properties considered critically important when evaluating a coal source for gasification are its mineral content and slagging behaviour. Research has indicated that slag formation can be inhibited or even prevented {{by the addition of}} a fluxing agent. It is thus of great importance to understand the mineral interaction during gasification, in order to select a suitable fluxing agent for the prevention of slagging and clinker formation in the gasifier. The aim of this dissertation is to evaluate the slagging properties of a coal source with the addition of iron as a fluxing agent and to study the transformation of the mineral and added iron during gasification. A pre-determined amount of elemental iron (between 2 and 20 <b>percentage</b> <b>by</b> <b>mass)</b> was added to three different coal samples obtained from Sasol's operations in South Africa. The transformation of the iron in conjunction with the possible iron-containing minerals present in the coal was studied by means of Mossbauer spectroscopy. Typical characterisation analyses were also carried out on the original coal samples. The ash fusion temperature analyses (AFT) were used to study the slagging behaviour of the iron-spiked coal samples. Even though AFT analyses only provide an average flow property, it gives a good indication of the changes that the iron addition induces in coal properties. FactSage modelling was carried out in conjunction with the Mossbauer and AFT analyses. The AFT analysis on all of the samples indicated that the iron addition led to a 20 % decrease in the AFT of all three the coal samples. The decrease observed, can be attributed to three main reasons: Formation of lower melting iron-containing phases, bridging of oxygen bonds by FeO and Fe 203 and the lowering of the viscosity by the iron-oxides, mainly hematite. Mossbauer spectra of the three original coal samples indicated that pyrite was the only iron-bearing mineral presentMaster...|$|E

Five identical test builds were produced {{with a variety of}} test pieces in order to ascertain any effect of changes in powder characteristics observed on mechanical, chemical and metallurgical properties of laser melted parts. Testing included tensile testing, fatigue testing, chemical composition testing and porosity testing. A quantity of Grade 23 Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder was taken from a single manufacturing batch and run through the SLM process five times. Powder samples were taken from the initial manufacture’s batch, and from within the build chamber {{at the end of each}} build, as well as post sieving of the powder from each build. The powders were subjected to Particle Size Distribution analysis, chemical composition analysis and imaged under Scanning Electron Microscope. The purpose of this was to determine the effect of repeated recycling on their PSD range, chemical composition and morphology. The effect of recycling on powder characteristics was shown to be an increase in the number of larger particles contained within the population, and a reduction in the number of fine particles. Repeated recycling was shown to have a statistically significant effect on values of Dx(10), Dx(50) and Dx(90), which all increased. These changes in powder characteristics within the powder population were shown to have no statistically significant effect on the mechanical properties of parts produced. There was no effect observed on UTS, Yield Strength, Percentage Elongation or Fatigue Strength for parts produced in the five builds. It was not possible to say that this trend would continue with indefinite recycling. The effect of position within the build chamber in which the parts were built was shown to be strongly significant, with large variation in mechanical properties of parts produced in different positions. Porosity analysis showed an increase in porosity for parts which exhibited the worst mechanical performance when compared to that of those with the best mechanical performance. Through chemical composition testing, there was shown to be a large increase in the percentage by weight of oxygen contained within laser melted parts when compared to the powder that was used to manufacture them.

40|$|In August 2006, the European Commission¿s Joint Research Centre (JRC) {{was asked}} by DG Enterprise to conduct {{experimental}} work to check the validity and suitability of the testing methods proposed by Basofil for the identification, quantification and characterisation of their new fibre melamine. Experimental results showed that microscopic analysis can be useful but is not a unique technique for the identification of melamine. Identification {{should be based on}} FT-IR possibly combined with Thermo Gravimetric (TG) analysis and solubility properties of the fibre. The agreed allowance of melamine fibre was experimentally evaluated and the value of 7. 00 was established. The normal pre-treatment was shown to be applicable to the new fibre. Melamine is insoluble with all methods of the Directive 96 / 73 /EC. The correction factors d were generally equal to 1. 01, except in the case of method 3 and 10, for which d value was 1. 00. Five correction factors d of melamine were confirmed through a ring trial including seventeen laboratories. The inter-laboratory trial results established the value of 1. 01 as melamine correction factor for methods 3, 4, 8 and 14. The d value calculated in the ring trial for method 7 was 1. 07, however the repeatability and reproducibility limits calculated were very poor and the data could not be considered as being part of a normal distribution. As a consequence, it was decided that method 7 would not be considered applicable to blends containing melamine. Three methods were proposed by the applicant and tested by the JRC for quantification purposes. For the three methods, solubility properties of melamine and other common fibres, supposed to be found in mixture with melamine, were evaluated, together with the effect of key parameters, such as contact time, temperature and concentration of reagent. The method with sodium hypochloride at 90 °C was deemed not applicable due to partial solubility of melamine, which was supposed to be insoluble. The hot formic acid method was considered adequate and applicable in the case of binary mixtures of melamine with aramid and cotton. It was decided that the contact time could be reduced to one hour. The temperature was proved to have a strong influence on this method and it should be carefully maintained in the range 90 ± 2 °C. The hot sulphuric acid method was judged not adequate. During the 7 th meeting of the European network of national experts on textile labelling, a consensus was reached on the need to validate the new method based on hot formic acid and to confirm the correction factors d for aramid (meta and para) and cotton. The JRC organised the ring trial with the participation of seventeen European laboratories, in accordance with the rules laid down in ISO 5725 (1994). The validation was successful. The precision of the test method, which should be quoted as a <b>percentage</b> <b>by</b> <b>mass,</b> was expressed as repeatability and reproducibility limits. Results were 0. 74 % and 1. 77 %, respectively. The correction factors d for aramid and cotton were evaluated in the same context and the established values are 1. 02 for both fibres.

The erosion rates of molybdenum and tantalum badges placed at different locations within the discharge chamber were measured {{as a function of}} the <b>percentage</b> of nitrogen (<b>by</b> <b>mass)</b> added to the xenon propellant. Reductions in the erosion rates of these badges of a factor of 8 to 50 were observed at nitrogen addition fractions between 0. 5 to 2. 0 percent. Reductions in cathode-side baffle erosion were achieved by adding nitrogen to the xenon propellant or by increasing the cathode orifice diameter. Analyses show that no significant degradation in ion engine performance should be expected at these nitrogen mass fractions. XRD, XPS and Auger analyses indicate the existence of nitrogen and nitrides in the surface of some but not all of the badges used in the tests where nitrogen was added to the xenon. Difficulty in identifying surface nitrides in the samples may be due to the existence of surface oxides and contaminants, or to the small thicknesses of the nitride layers...|$|R
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of natural beidellite were modified with cationic surfactant octadecyl trimethylammonium bromide at different concentrations. The organo-beidellite adsorbent materials were then {{used for the}} removal of atrazine with the goal of investigating the mechanism for the adsorption of organic triazine herbicide from contaminated water. Changes on the surfaces and structure of beidellite were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and BET surface analysis. Kinetics of the adsorption studies were also carried out which show that the adsorption capacity of the organoclays increases with increasing surfactant concentration up until 1. 0 CEC surfactant loading, after which the adsorption capacity greatly decreases. TG analysis reveals that although the 2. 0 CEC sample has the greatest <b>percentage</b> of surfactant <b>by</b> <b>mass,</b> most of it is present on external sites. The 0. 5 CEC sample has the highest proportion of surfactant exchanged into the internal active sites and the 1. 0 CEC sample accounts for the highest adsorption capacity. The goodness of fit of the pseudo-second order kinetic confirms that chemical adsorption, rather than physical adsorption, controls the adsorption rate of atrazine...|$|R
