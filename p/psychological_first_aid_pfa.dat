30|$|There {{are four}} primary models of {{psychological}} support utilized by the disaster psychology community in providing aid for disaster survivors: the American Red Cross (ARC) model (ARC 2009), the Psychological Triage and Rapid Treatment (PsySTART) model (Schreiber 2010), the <b>psychological</b> <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> (<b>PFA)</b> model (Ruzek et al. 2007), {{and the critical}} incident stress management (CISM) model (Mitchell and Everly 2001). While all of these models may be highly useful in disaster settings, each displays some weakness with regard to long-term sustainable practices. The need for a sustainable program with a knowledge base and usability accessible to survivors beyond the acute phase of disaster drove {{the development of the}} HST curriculum (Shelly 2011). Haitian HST volunteers were intentionally selected based on informal community connections akin to the snowball technique—a method by which participants recruit future participants from among their acquaintances. The HST program is based on a locally driven and sustainable recovery model that requires self-selection and self-motivation {{on the part of the}} volunteers.

40|$|Disaster {{mental health}} {{is based on}} the {{principles}} of ′preventive medicine′ This principle has necessitated a paradigm shift from relief centered post-disaster management to a holistic, multi-dimensional integrated community approach of health promotion, disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. This has ignited the paradigm shift from curative to preventive aspects of disaster management. This can be understood on the basis of six ′R′s such as Readiness (Preparedness), Response (Immediate action), Relief (Sustained rescue work), Rehabilitation (Long term remedial measures using community resources), Recovery (Returning to normalcy) and Resilience (Fostering). Prevalence of mental health problems in disaster affected population is found to be higher by two to three times than that of the general population. Along with the diagnosable mental disorders, affected community also harbours large number of sub-syndromal symptoms. Majority of the acute phase reactions and disorders are self-limiting, whereas long-term phase disorders require assistance from mental health professionals. Role of psychotropic medication is very limited in preventing mental health morbidity. The role of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in mitigating the mental health morbidity appears to be promising. Role of <b>Psychological</b> <b>First</b> <b>Aid</b> (<b>PFA)</b> and debriefing is not well-established.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFirst responders protect and serve. They maintain order, prevent chaos, and keep this country safe and secure. Many of the freedoms enjoyed today {{are the result}} of U. S. first responders protecting and caring for U. S. citizens. Whether it is a terrorists attack, a criminal victimizing a citizen, or a natural disaster, first responders will be among the first on the scene to deal with the crisis. For this reason, their role in homeland security is so critical. Traumatic stress experienced by first responders may impact their ability to function and handle the next critical incident, as well as obstruct public safety agencies in maintaining a robust and resilient workforce. As a result, leaders of first responder organizations need methods to recognize the different levels of stress their employees are experiencing and identify ways they can support their officers and minimize long-term effects of stress, including absenteeism, early resignation/retirement, depression, post-traumatic stress, substance abuse, and suicide. Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) is the standard clinical practice most widely utilized by public safety agencies in crisis interventions. CISM is designed to mitigate stress and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Another technique to help the traumatized, now emerging as a preferred response in crisis interventions, is <b>Psychological</b> <b>First</b> <b>Aid</b> (<b>PFA).</b> The empirical evidence is examined comparing CISM and PFA in an attempt to determine the best care for first responders. Another valuable tool examined, and sometimes overlooked as a crisis intervention tool, is the role of trained chaplains in disaster care. The author has responded to numerous traumatic incidents and witnessed firsthand the effects trauma has on first responders. As a result of witnessing the lack of care CISM provides, he was inspired to research and find the best approach to crisis interventions. PFA and trained chaplains may be the answer; however, the author also desires that this paper inspire and challenge other agencies to invest, conduct further research, and ultimately, find the best approach to crisis interventions.

Friesen Conference, "Growing Old in a Changing Climate: Exploring the Interface Between Population Aging and Global Warming," MAY 25 - 26, 2011, Vancouver, BC. Dr. Lisa Brown, "Challenges encountered by older adults when seeking safe shelter pre-disaster and receiving intervention post-disaster" - Although most healthy older adults recover without assistance after extreme weather events, there are vulnerable subgroups that {{are at increased risk}} for negative health consequences. These include elders who are socially isolated, frail, physically ill, cognitively impaired, or with previous exposure to an extreme and prolonged traumatic stressor. Findings from two research projects – 1) Use of <b>Psychological</b> <b>First</b> <b>Aid</b> (<b>PFA)</b> with older adults, and 2) disaster literacy of older adults will be discussed. 1. The need for appropriate interventions for elders who have experienced traumatic events is paramount. PFA, like medical first aid, {{does not have to be}} delivered by a licensed clinician. Study results highlight methods to assess elders, strategies to enhance coping, and approaches to implement PFA at the personal, community, and healthcare system level. 2. The consequences of low health literacy on physical health have been well documented with older adults, people from diverse cultural backgrounds, and those with low incomes more likely to have health literacy problems. Because people who were either unable or unwilling to adequately prepare for and respond to the 2004 or 2005 hurricanes experienced dire consequences, the number of publications describing steps that should be taken to ensure personal safety has grown considerably. This study evaluated if the target audience possessed sufficient disaster literacy to use the information as intended.   We also gratefully acknowledge a grant from the SFU Library 2 ̆ 7 s Scholarly Digitization Fund for videography and post-production editing.   See webpage for more information on the 20 th Annual John K.

40|$|Accidental {{injury is}} a common {{experience}} for children (ABS, 2004 - 2005), yet the debilitating psychological effects of the trauma event often go undetected and thus not treated. Whilst for many the accident will result in some distress, many children will naturally recover and move on (Bryant, 2004). In spite of this, 10 - 18 % of children will continue to experience persistent chronic stress symptoms for up to 2 years post accident (Le Brocque, Hendrikz, & Kenardy, 2009). Unfortunately, little psychological assistance is available or offered to children that may assist in their psychological recovery and even prevent the significant and debilitating effects of psychological distress. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research was to develop and investigate an intervention for children following accidental injury. This was carried out via three stages and presented as three sections within the thesis. Section 1 aimed to develop a theory driven and evidenced-based intervention. Firstly, a meta-analysis was conducted to identify potential risk factors of significance that predict post-traumatic stress symptoms. This analysis resulted in pre-trauma psychopathology, threat to life, gender (female) and parental distress being relatively strong and consistent predictors. This information helps inform potential screening tools as well as directly guidinge the development of the intervention for this thesis. Secondly, this section conducted a comprehensive literature review of relevant approaches and interventions to help guide the development of the intervention. This review drew on models of traumatic stress development such as the Resilience Framework (Kumpfer, 1999), and Paediatric Medical Traumatic Stress (Kazak et al., 2006) as well as preventative frameworks such as the Paediatric Psychosocial Preventative Health Model (Kazak, 2006) that resulted in a Universal approach being argued as the most appropriate. Following this, a review was conducted of relevant universal preventative interventions currently available or recommended following trauma including, Psychological Debriefing (PD), <b>Psychological</b> <b>First</b> <b>Aid</b> (<b>PFA)</b> and information provision. Overall it was concluded that an information provision intervention that drew on strategies used within PD and PFA (such as normalisation and coping strategies) was the most appropriate and practical approach to offering psychological assistance to children and their parents following accidental injury. Finally, this section culminated in a chapter outlining the design, delivery and content of the intervention. The intervention developed aimed to normalise reactions and enhance coping in children following the accident whilst providing parents with accurate information regarding trauma reactions and how they could assist their child’s emotional recovery. Of importance was the decision to place the child’s intervention on the internet. It was argued that this would offer a more child friendly medium and provide greater and easier access for families. Section 2 encompassed the evaluation of the intervention developed. Children (7 - 16 years) and their parents were recruited from the Royal Children’s Hospital and their trauma reactions were assessed over a 6 month period, with three assessment time points; Time 1 (baseline, within 1 - 2 weeks of the accident), Time 2 (4 - 6 weeks) and Time 3 (6 months). Children and their parents were randomised into the intervention group following Time 1. Analyses revealed that children within the intervention group reported significantly decreased anxiety, in comparison to a worsening of symptoms for children in the control group. No significant group differences were noted for the parents. Exploratory analysis conducted on high risk children (those with high initial distress) revealed that those in the control group exhibited a significant worsening of anxiety and social phobias over the 6 months. This significant increase in symptoms was not noted for children who had received the intervention. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that children who initially reported high symptoms were the ones most likely to find the intervention helpful and effective. This result was exhibited in the qualitative responses from the parents and children. Overall, the intervention showed promise and encouraging results in its ability to aid child recovery. Furthermore, the results indicated that high risk children may benefit over and above all those recruited suggested the possible appropriateness for a stepped care approach. Section 3 was conducted in light of the results of Section 2, suggesting that children with high initial distress may benefit more greatly from the intervention compared to those with low initial distress. Therefore, this section examined a number of risk factors identified via the meta-analysis conducted in Section 1, to examine whether they would moderate a child’s and parent’s trauma symptoms following treatment compared with no treatment. Thus, this section investigated whether the intervention would be best delivered universally or targeted at children and parents who exhibited certain risk factors. Results indicated that when the child risk factors of initial child distress, attribution of self-blame and parental psychopathology were present, children in the control group had significantly higher trauma symptoms in comparison to those in the intervention. When these factors were not present, there were no significant group differences. For parents, their initial post-accident depression, anxiety and stress levels moderated treatment; in that when it was not present (low) there were no group differences, however when the risk factors was present (high) those in the control group exhibited significantly higher mood disturbances at 6 months. The findings of this section resulted in the conclusion {{that there are a number}} of risk factors that impact or influence treatment, thus suggesting that the intervention could be best utilised when targeted at those presenting with risk factors. Therefore, this research developed, investigated and optimised a universal preventative intervention for children and their parents following accidental injury. The limitations and implications for this research are discussed, including debate regarding a universal versus a targeted approach to intervention delivery...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increased}} {{focus on the}} need for collaboration between first responders and the general public. This type of collaboration requires soft skills that are not necessarily included in more traditional command and control trainings for first responders. Learning to collaborate with the general public requires different didactics than learning technical skills. It also requires different support tools; tools that let the trainees experience the engagement with the target group. These didactics and their supporting tools are developed as part of the DRIVER activities. More specifically, two separate but complementary trainings with support tools have been developed in DRIVER. These two trainings will feed into the DRIVER portfolio of solutions. The first training is an Awareness training. The Awareness training will aid professionals to become aware of the possibility to see the general public as a resource. The aim is for first responders to be able to evaluate when the general public can be (safely) involved and what tasks they can (effectively) perform - primarily during the response phase.

All patients were assessed six months after hospital discharge for the presence of psychological symptoms and level of functioning using standardized tools. Results At six months, there was a decreasing trend in the proportion of patients who were positive for psychiatric symptoms of depression and anxiety from Group A through Group B to Group C (Chi square test for trend = 7. 901, p = 0. 005). This was mainly due to a decreasing trend for symptoms of anxiety (chi-square for trend = 11. 256, p = 0. 001). There was also decreasing trend in the overall prevalence of disability from Group A through Group B to Group C (chi square for trend = 7. 551, p = 0. 006), predominantly in relation to disability in family life (p = 0. 006) and social life (p = 0. 005).
