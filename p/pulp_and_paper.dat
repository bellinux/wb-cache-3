5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the <b>pulp</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E

The decision to make the <b>pulp</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers</b> as the strategic sector,  proved that {{the government}}  is serious in developing companies in this sector. However, {{in the same year}} the producer’s margin in the Asia market has dropped.

The objective of the research is to evaluate the financial performance of the <b>pulps</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers</b> companies in Indonesia. The method is using the financial ratio and economic value added that is obtained from the financial data report. The data are entered and processed using Excel software. The result obtained is that in a long term, the Tjiwi Kimia paper company has the best financial performance in solvability and profitability, while Indah Kiat <b>Pulps</b> <b>and</b> <b>Papers</b> Company have the best long term liquidity.

5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} <b>pulp</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E
