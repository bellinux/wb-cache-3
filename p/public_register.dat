Clergy of the Chapel Royal display red tassels. The office of moderator does not have corporate arms, but for official occasions, a moderator may add tassels to his personal arms to indicate parity with offices of other churches: three for a moderator of a presbytery, and six for a moderator of a regional synod. The moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland now uses a differenced version of the General Assembly's arms, with a hat having a blue cord and ten tassels on each side, and may also show the moderator's staff, a gold Celtic crosier, behind the shield {{as can be seen}} in vol 41, p 152 of the Scots <b>Public</b> <b>Register.</b>|$|E

The thesis is composed of 8 chapters.

From the comparision results was designed process and methodology to replace census using paper forms with automatically collected data from registers or at least {{reduce the number of}} questions filled in the forms. With respect to huge scale of different registers used in Czech Republic, the selection of registers was conditioned with their connection to census collected data. Such registers are described with their function, collected data and their connection to census. It is clear, that this possibility is viable for main part of collected data, for the other part additional survey is still needed.

500|$|Scottish crest badges {{are used}} by clan members to show their {{allegiance}} to their clan and chief. Much like clan tartans, crest badges owe their popularity to Victorian romanticism. Crest badges are heraldic badges which usually contain the heraldic crest of the clan chief, encircled with a buckle containing the chief's heraldic motto. However, {{in the case of}} Clan Macfie, which does not have a chief, the crest badge is derived from the coat of arms of Macfie of Dreghorn, {{who was one of the}} first Macfies to register a coat of arms in the <b>Public</b> <b>Register</b> of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland. The crest badge of Clan Macfie contains as a crest: a demi lion rampant, proper. The motto which encircles the crest is: pro rege, which translated from Latin means [...] "for the king".|$|E
500|$|The McGill {{coat of arms}} {{is derived}} from an armorial device assumed during his {{lifetime}} by {{the founder of the}} University, James McGill. The University's patent of arms was granted by the Garter King at Arms in 1922, registered in 1956 with Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh, and in 1992 with the <b>Public</b> <b>Register</b> of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada. In heraldic terms, the coat of arms is described as follows: [...] "Argent three Martlets Gules, on a chief dancette of the second, an open book proper garnished or bearing the legend In Domino Confido in letters Sable between two crowns of the first. Motto: Grandescunt Aucta Labore." [...] The coat of arms consists of two parts, the shield and the scroll. The University publishes a guide {{to the use of the}} University's arms and motto.|$|E
500|$|In 1864, {{the first}} Macfies to have coats of arms {{registered}} in the <b>Public</b> <b>Register</b> of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland were Robert Macfie of Langhouse and Airds and Robert Andrew Macfie of Dreghorntwo highly successful businessmen in the sugar industry. The heraldic crest within the clan's crest badge is actually derived from the heraldic crest on the coat of arms of Robert Andrew Macfie of Dreghorn. In 1968, Earle Douglas MacPhee of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada started a movement to have the Clan Macfie officially registered with the Lord Lyon King of Arms. On 10 May 1977, the Macfie Standing Stone on Balaruminmore on Colonsay was dedicated as a memorial to the last chief of the clan, who was executed against it in 1623. In May 1981, Clan Macfie was formally recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and later in November of that year, Earle MacPhee was appointed as Commander of Clan Macfie by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. [...] Following Earle MacPhee's death in 1982, Alexander (Sandy) Carpendale McPhie of Australia was appointed by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as Commander of Clan Macfie on 7 September 1989. In March 2008, the Lord Lyon gave permission for Clan Macfie to convene an ad hoc derbhfine to choose a successor to McPhie, who had by then decided to step down. Iain Morris McFie was chosen to petition the Lord Lyon, and on doing so was later appointed as Commander of Clan Macfie.|$|E

500|$|The ecclesiastical hat is a {{distinctive}} {{part of the}} achievement of arms of a Roman Catholic cleric. This hat, called a galero (or gallero), was originally a pilgrim's hat like a sombrero. It was granted in red to cardinals by Pope Innocent IV at the First Council of Lyon in the 13th century, and was adopted by heraldry almost immediately. The galero in various colors and forms was used in heraldic achievements starting with its adoption {{in the arms of}} bishops in the 16th century. In the 19th century the galero was viewed heraldically as specifically [...] "Catholic", but the <b>Public</b> <b>Register</b> of Arms in Scotland show Roman Catholic, presbyterian Church of Scotland and Anglican Episcopalian clergy all using the wide brimmed, low crowned hat. The galero is ornamented with tassels (also called houppes or fiocchi) indicating the cleric's current place in the hierarchy; the number became significant beginning in the 16th century, and the meaning was fixed, for Catholic clergy, in 1832. A bishop's galero is green with six tassels on each side; the color originated in Spain where formerly a green hat was actually worn by bishops. A territorial abbot was equivalent to a bishop and used a green galero. An archbishop's galero is green but has ten tassels. Bishops in Switzerland formerly used ten tassels like an archbishop because they were under the immediate jurisdiction of the Holy See and not part of an archiepiscopal province. Both patriarchs and cardinals have hats with fifteen tassels. A cardinal's hat is red or scarlet while a patriarch who is not also a cardinal uses a green hat; the patriarch's tassels are interwoven with gold. Primates may use the same external ornaments as patriarchs.|$|E

Secondly, <b>public</b> <b>registers</b> are available that contain the names of enterprises together with such features as their main economic activity, geographical area and number of employees.
