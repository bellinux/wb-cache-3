Most of these biopolymers are made from esterified mid-chain functionalized ω-long chain hydroxyacids. Aleuritic (9, 10, 16 -trihydroxypalmitic) acid is such a polyhydroxylated fatty acid and is also the major constituent of natural lac resin, a relatively abundant and renewable resource.

The management that balances marginal costs {{of water and}} fertilizers with marginal yield loss is determined. By using a number of yield response curves, {{in a couple of}} different cases (Holland and Mediterranean basin), we show that, with realistic prices both of resources and of produce, closed systems are financially viable only in two cases: 1. in regions with <b>good</b> <b>water</b> or 2. with high-value crops that offset the costs of ensuring <b>good</b> <b>water</b> (such as rain collection or desalinisation), so that there is no advantage for a grower to maintain a closed loop whenever the quality of irrigation water is poor. This means that a price structure of water resources that shifts the economic optimum towards poorer irrigation water has the consequence that the irrigation loop cannot be closed. In other words, {{there is no way that}} low-value crops using poor irrigation water may still be profitable under stricter environmental rules. We conclude that in view of the environmental impact, it would be advisable for irrigation and local authorities in horticultural areas either to <b>provide</b> <b>good</b> <b>water</b> at a relatively high price or to consider subsidizing investment costs of on-site desalinization plants, rather than stimulating use of poor quality water, or attempting to prevent pollution through unrealistic regulations.

40|$|Groundwater is {{essential}} to modern human survival during drought periods. There is also growing geological evidence of springs associated with stone tools and hominin fossils in the East African Rift System (EARS) during a critical period for hominin evolution (from 1. 8 Ma). However {{it is not known}} how vulnerable these springs may have been to climate variability and whether groundwater availability may have played a part in human evolution. Recent interdisciplinary research at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, has documented climate fluctuations attributable to astronomic forcing and the presence of paleosprings directly associated with archaeological sites. Using palaeogeological reconstruction and groundwater modelling of the Olduvai Gorge paleo-catchment, we show how spring discharge was likely linked to East African climate variability of annual to Milankovitch cycle timescales. Under decadal to centennial timescales, spring flow would have been relatively invariant <b>providing</b> <b>good</b> <b>water</b> resource resilience through long droughts. For multi-millennial periods, modelled spring flows lag groundwater recharge by 100 s to 1000 years. The lag creates long buffer periods allowing hominins to adapt to new habitats as potable surface water from rivers or lakes became increasingly scarce. Localised groundwater systems are likely to have been widespread within the EARS providing refugia and intense competition during dry periods, thus being an important factor in natural selection and evolution, as well as a vital resource during hominin dispersal within and out of Africa...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6, from January to mid-March winter wheat {{is in the}} stage of {{overwintering}} and green. A weak negative correlation and positive correlation can be identified between incipient drought-affected crop areas and crop yields, implying that incipient droughts during the wintering and greening periods of winter wheat have no significant impacts on winter wheat yields and may even increase the yields of winter wheat slightly. Precipitation and air temperature are the main climatic factors that influence crop growth but they have different impacts on the growing crops in different growth stages. Regardless of the stage of crop growth, changes in cumulative precipitation during the growing season, especially during the earlier growing season, have {{the greatest impact on}} winter wheat. A persistent precipitation deficit will potentially have serious cumulative effects on the growth and development of winter wheat, and yield can be greatly reduced. Precipitation in the study region is mainly concentrated in July–September, accounting for about 70 % of the total annual precipitation. Seeding of winter wheat occurs mainly in October. The good soil moisture conditions of the study area in early autumn <b>provide</b> <b>good</b> <b>water</b> conditions for the seeding and overwintering of winter wheat (Li et al. 2000). After a long wintering period, winter wheat in the study region enters the green stage. The increase of solar radiation and the warming temperature promote the growth of crops. During this period, under incipient drought conditions, and although winter wheat may suffer some slight water stress, the promotion effect of increased temperature and radiation is dominant in its growth, and these conditions may even increase winter wheat yield. When drought conditions aggravate from moderate to higher intensity (Figs.  8, 9, 10), however, a more serious water deficit will potentially result in a decrease in winter wheat production.|$|R

40|$|Release {{profiles}} of potassium sorbate from active-edible whey protein films were determined experimentally and {{the mechanism of}} diffusion of potassium sorbate in the films was investigated. The diffusion of potassium sorbate in whey protein films {{was found to be}} non-Fickian. A model that described the diffusion of potassium sorbate from whey protein films that swelled due to the countercurrent diffusion of solvent was used to determine potassium sorbate and solvent diffusion coefficients. The diffusivities of potassium sorbate in the films at 25 °C ranged from 5. 38 to 9. 76 × 10 − 11 M 2 /sec. ^ Potassium sorbate diffusion coefficients through the films were significantly affected by the film composition. Increasing the amounts of protein and beeswax in the films decreased potassium sorbate diffusivity. Sorbitol increased the diffusion of potassium sorbate in the films. A rise in the initial potassium sorbate concentration in the films resulted in films with higher diffusion coefficients. Strong interactions were observed between protein and beeswax and potassium sorbate and beeswax. ^ The optimum combination of constituents of whey protein films that <b>provide</b> <b>good</b> mechanical and optical properties was determined using a D-optimal mixture design. Protein, sorbitol and potassium sorbate were important factors influencing film 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties, while beeswax was the primary factor affecting the transparency of the films. ^ The optimum combination of constituents of whey protein films that <b>provide</b> <b>good</b> <b>water</b> vapor permeability, water solubility and sensory properties was also determined using a D-optimal mixture design. All film constituents had significant impacts on water vapor permeability and water solubility. Beeswax was the most important factor affecting the organoleptic properties of the films. Protein had no effect on stickiness and appearance of the films, while sorbitol had no influence on appearance. ^ Whey protein films with potassium sorbate effectively inhibited the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium roqueforti on agar plates by extending the lag period. The higher the initial potassium sorbate concentration in the films, the stronger the microbial effect. These results showed that whey protein films with potassium sorbate could be used as active superficial layers on foods to retard microbial spoilage and prolong shelf life. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} 10 years, the B. C. Forest Service has {{measured}} sediment concentration and turbidity {{on a number}} of creeks in the Kootenay region of British Columbia, which are used for community or domestic water supply. This paper summarizes the results of measurements on 11 forested watersheds. Some of them have streamflow stations, so that suspended sediment data collected for water quality purposes can be converted to sediment yield. Reasonable estimates of discharge and yield can be made for the remaining creeks. Both undeveloped and developed watersheds are included. For most watersheds, annual background suspended sediment yields are comparable to or slightly higher than the range of published Water Survey of Canada results for small forested watersheds (about 3 to 10 t/km 2 /y). These yields are lower than for most watersheds in British Columbia. Streams with low sediment yield have been chosen by communities as water sources because they <b>provide</b> <b>good</b> quality <b>water.</b> In some watersheds with forestry development, sediment yield is significantly greater than background levels, due mainly to erosion from logging roads.
