The new identity is equivalent to a four parameter partition theorem which extends the deep theorem of Göllnitz and thereby settles a problem raised by Andrews thirty years ago.

40|$|In {{a simple}} model {{composed}} of a structural equation and identity, the finite sample distribution of the IV/LIML estimator is always bimodal and this is most apparent when the concentration parameter is small. Weak instrumentation is the energy that feeds the secondary mode and the coefficient in the structural identity provides a point of compression in the density that gives rise to it. The IV limit distribution can be normal, bimodal, or inverse normal depending {{on the behavior of}} the concentration parameter and the weakness of the instruments. The limit distribution of the OLS estimator is normal in all cases and has a much faster rate of convergence under very weak instrumentation. The IV estimator is therefore more resistant to the attractive effect of the identity than OLS. Some of these limit results differ from conventional weak instrument asymptotics, including convergence to a constant in very weak instrument cases and limit distributions that are inverse normal.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{estimate}} the fraction of ground flashes {{in a set of}} flashes observed by a satellite lightning imager, such as the future GOES-R Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), would likely improve operational and scientific applications (e. g., severe weather warnings, lightning nitrogen oxides studies, and global electric circuit analyses). A Bayesian inversion method, called the Ground Flash Fraction Retrieval Algorithm (GoFFRA), was recently developed for estimating the ground flash fraction. The method uses a constrained mixed exponential distribution model to describe a particular lightning optical measurement called the Maximum Group Area (MGA). To obtain the optimum model parameters (one of which is the desired ground flash fraction), a scalar function must be minimized. This minimization is difficult because of two problems: (1) Label Switching (LS), and (2) <b>Parameter</b> <b>Identity</b> Theft (PIT). The LS problem is well known in the literature on mixed exponential distributions, and the PIT problem was discovered in this study. Each problem occurs when one allows the numerical minimizer to freely roam through the parameter search space; this allows certain solution parameters to interchange roles which leads to fundamental ambiguities, and solution error. A major accomplishment {{of this study is that}} we have employed a state-of-the-art genetic-based global optimization algorithm called Differential Evolution (DE) that constrains the parameter search in such a way as to remove both the LS and PIT problems. To test the performance of the GoFFRA when DE is employed, we applied it to analyze simulated MGA datasets that we generated from known mixed exponential distributions. Moreover, we evaluated the GoFFRA/DE method by applying it to analyze actual MGAs derived from low-Earth orbiting lightning imaging sensor data; the actual MGA data were classified as either ground or cloud flash MGAs using National Lightning Detection Network[TM] (NLDN) data. Solution error plots are provided for both the simulations and actual data analyses...|$|E

40|$|Research {{in musical}} {{performance}} anxiety {{so far has}} mainly focused on adult professional musicians. Additionally, studies have mostly maintained a `clinical approach' to musical performance anxiety, focusing on the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of maladaptive performance anxiety {{and its effects on}} selected groups of musicians. The aim of this thesis was to fill some of these gaps by exploring the experience of musical performance anxiety from the perspective of adolescent musicians. 410 students aged 12 - 19, all attending junior conservatoires and / or youth orchestras in the UK and Cyprus, responded to a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire dealt with a range of learning and performance issues and yielded both quantitative and qualitative data. Performance anxiety was measured with the Adolescent Musicians' Performance Anxiety Scale (AMPAS), designed specifically for the needs of this study. Results revealed that performance anxiety was an issue for a significant percentage of students. Differences in performance anxiety level intensity were related to nationality and gender, but not to age. Susceptibility to experiencing performance anxiety, task efficacy and quality of performance environment were important factors in determining the intensity of experienced performance anxiety. Performance anxiety was found to be a multi-faceted construct, influenced by a variety of factors relating to self-perceptions, situational <b>parameters,</b> <b>identity</b> and culture, and family environment. Student attainment was influenced by performance anxiety. Achievement of higher Grades was related to the experience of higher levels of performance anxiety and perceptions of receiving positive feedback were associated with lower perceived levels of anxiety. Performance anxiety influenced students' approaches to instrumental learning and performance, particularly in terms of susceptibility to maladaptive performance anxiety and negative perceptions of the impact of anxiety. Three types of students were identified in the data, each possessing different characteristics and experiencing anxiety and physiological arousal in musical performance in a distinctive way...|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} shown that qω(q), where ω(q) {{is one of}} the third order mock theta functions, is the generating function of p_ω(n), the number of partitions of a positive integer n such that all odd parts are less than twice the smallest part. In this paper, we study the overpartition analogue of p_ω(n), and express its generating function in terms of a _ 3 ϕ_ 2 basic hypergeometric series and an infinite series involving little q-Jacobi polynomials. This is accomplished by obtaining a new seven <b>parameter</b> q-series <b>identity</b> which generalizes a deep identity due to the first author as well as its generalization by R. P. Agarwal.

40|$|Generative 3 D face {{models are}} a {{powerful}} tool in computer vision. They provide pose and illumination invariance by modeling the space of 3 D faces and the imaging process. The power of these models comes {{at the cost of}} an expensive and tedious construction pro-cess, which has led the community to focus on more eas-ily constructed but less powerful models. With this pa-per we publish a generative 3 D shape and texture model, the Basel Face Model (BFM), and demonstrate its ap-plication to several face recognition task. We improve on previous models by offering higher shape and texture accuracy due to a better scanning device and less cor-respondence artifacts due to an improved registration algorithm. The same 3 D face model can be fit to 2 D or 3 D im-ages acquired under different situations and with dif-ferent sensors using an analysis by synthesis method. The resulting model parameters separate pose, lighting, imaging and <b>identity</b> <b>parameters,</b> which facilitates in-variant face recognition across sensors and data sets by comparing only the <b>identity</b> <b>parameters.</b> We hope that the availability of this registered face model will spur research in generative models.

50|$|The Fast Packet {{protocol}} {{defined in}} NMEA 2000 {{provides a means}} to stream up to 223 bytes of data, with the advantage that each frame retains the <b>parameter</b> group <b>identity</b> and priority.

The first byte contains a sequence counter to distinguish consecutive transmission of the same parameter groups and a frame counter set to frame zero. The second byte in the first frame identifies the total size of the parameter group to follow. Successive frames use just single data byte for the sequence counter and the frame counter. Because many of the NMEA 2000 parameter groups exceed 8 bytes but do not require the 1,785-byte capacity of multi-packet, the default method of transmitting multi-frame parameter groups in NMEA 2000 is using the Fast Packet protocol.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A multi-view gait {{recognition}} method using recovered static body {{parameters of}} subjects is presented; {{we refer to}} these parameters as activity-specific biometrics. Our data consists of 18 subjects walking at both an angled and frontal-parallel view {{with respect to the}} camera. When only considering data from a single view, subjects are easily dis-criminated; however, discrimination decreases when data across views are considered. To compare between views, we use ground truth motion-capture data of a reference subject to find scale factors that can trans-form data from different views into a common frame (“walking-space”). Instead of reporting percent correct from a limited database, we report our results using an expected confusion metric that allows us to pre-dict how our static body <b>parameters</b> filter <b>identity</b> in a large population: lower confusion yields higher expected discrimination power. We show that using motion-capture data to adjust vision data of different views to a common reference frame, we can get achieve expected confusions rates on the order of 6 %. ...|$|R
