40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} sulphate reducing bacteria for the bioremediation of acid mine drainage {{has already been}} recognised, and offers significant financial advantages over conventional chemical treatment approaches. Although the technology has been demonstrated successfully on both small- and large-scale, it’s extensive implementation has been constrained by the provision of suitable and cost effective electron donor and carbon sources. <b>Primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> is readily available in large quantities, but the slow rate of solubilization and low yield of soluble products do not apparently favour its use for this application. A number of pre-treatment steps have been introduced {{in an attempt to}} improve the yield and rates under methanogenic conditions. However, although early work suggested that degradation of lignocellulose and proteins may be more rapid under sulphate reducing conditions, the fate of <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> under these conditions has been ignored. It was proposed that by combining the hydrolysis of <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> and biological sulphate reduction, in a settling sludge bed, both processes would be enhanced. The aim {{of this study was to}} test this hypothesis on laboratory- and pilot-scale, and attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanism involved. The solubilization of <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> was enhanced in the presence of sulphate reduction in continuous laboratory-scale reactors. Particulate matter accumulated in the bed of non-sulphidogenic systems, but not in sulphidogenic ones. This was attributed to increased solubilization and the smaller average floc size in the latter. Solubilization occurred within the settling sludge bed of the reactors, and offered a possible explanation for the better performance of the multiple- over single-stage reactor. A pilot-scale Falling Sludge Bed Reactor was constructed at Grootvlei Gold Mine, Springs, South Africa, and resulted in the solubilization of more than 70 % of the influent <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge.</b> The system was also found to be highly resilient to severe perturbations, and returned rapidly to steady-state. Flask studies revealed that the hydrolysis of both proteins and complex carbohydrates was accelerated in the presence of biological sulphate reduction or sulphide. A study of the enzymology of sludge digestion revealed that sulphate reduction had little direct effect on the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes, but that reactor design was critical in the prevention of washout of these enzymes. Finally, a descriptive model was developed to explain the enhanced hydrolysis of <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge.</b> The model incorporated the effect of sulphidogenesis on floc fracture and reflocculation, and likely implications for mass transfer limitations. ...|$|R
25|$|Standards are set {{for sewage}} sludge {{generated}} or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. <b>Primary</b> <b>sludge</b> water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for using readily available and cost-effective complex carbon {{sources such as}} <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> {{for a range of}} environmental remediation processes, including biological sulphate reduction, biological nutrient removal and the bioremediation of acid mine drainage, has been constrained by the slow rate of solubilization and low yield of soluble products, which drive the above mentioned processes. Previous work conducted by the Environmental Biotechnology Group at Rhodes University indicated that the degradation of <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> was enhanced under sulphate reducing conditions. This was proven in both laboratory and pilot-scale (Reciprocating Sludge Bed Reactor) systems, where the particulate matter accumulated in the sludge bed and the molecules in smaller flocs were rapidly solubilized. The current study was aimed at investigating in more detail the factors that govern the enhanced hydrolysis under sulphate reducing conditions, and to develop a descriptive model to explain the underlying mechanism involved. The solubilization of <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> under sulphate reducing conditions was conducted in controlled flask studies and previously reported findings of enhanced hydrolysis were confirmed. The maximum percentage solubilization obtained in this study was 31 % and 63 % for the methanogenic and sulphidogenic systems respectively, and this was achieved over a period of 10 days. A rate of reducing sugar production and complex molecule breakdown of 51 mg. L- 1. hr- 1 and 167 mg. L- 1. hr- 1 was observed for the methanogenic and sulphidogenic systems respectively. The flask studies revealed that during hydrolysis of <b>primary</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> under sulphidogenic conditions there was enhanced production of soluble products, specifically carbohydrates (reducing sugars) and volatile fatty acids, compared to methanogenic conditions. The rate at which these products were utilized was also found to be more rapid under sulphidogenic as compared to methanogenic conditions. A study of the distribution of volatile fatty acids indicated that acetate was utilized preferentially in the methanogenic system, and that propionate, butyrate and valerate accumulated with time. The converse was found to occur in the sulphidogenic system. The descriptive model developed from {{the results of this study}} was based on the fact that a consortium of bacteria, composed of hydrolytic, acidogenic and acetogenic species, carries out the solubilization of complex carbon sources. Furthermore, it is essential that equilibrium between product formation and utilization is maintained, and that accumulation of soluble end products impacts negatively on the rate of the hydrolysis step. It is therefore proposed that the relatively poor utilization of VFA and reducing sugars in the methanogenic system activates a negative feedback inhibition on the hydrolytic and/ or acidogenic step. This inhibition is reduced in the sulphidogenic system where the utilization of end products is higher. ...|$|R
