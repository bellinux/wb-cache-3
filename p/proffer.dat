25|$|In 2007, Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele {{transferred}} Dryandra into Banksia, on {{the grounds}} that Banksia was paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. Mast and Thiele were not yet ready to <b>proffer</b> an arrangement for the new circumscription of Banksia, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra at series rank, so as to minimise disruption to the nomenclature. Thus the infrageneric arrangement of Dryandra has been set aside, at least temporarily, and hence none of Bentham's infrageneric taxa are in current use.|$|E

The priest will use a special ladle to <b>proffer</b> the holy ash to the layperson, who in turn daubs it on his or her forehead and eyelids, and may take some home for use after a Kushti ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Although Meissner did not <b>proffer</b> an infrageneric {{placement}} for B.victoriae in his 1855 {{publication of}} the species, he did so the following year in his chapter on the Proteaceae for A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. Under Meissner's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B.victoriae was placed in section Eubanksia, series Dryandroideae. This arrangement stood until 1870, which George Bentham published his arrangement, in which he placed the species in section Orthostylis. A major disruption to Banksias taxonomic nomenclature occurred in 1890, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. {{on the grounds that}} Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst had precedence. He proposed to transfer all Banksia species to the new genus Sirmuellera, but this was rejected, and Sirmuellera victoriae (Meisn.) Kuntze is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of B.victoriae.|$|E

25|$|In September 1989 while Chiyonofuji {{was still}} active, the Japan Sumo Association decided to <b>proffer</b> the special status of ichidai-toshiyori (one-generation sumo-elder using his ring name as his elder name) to him, but he {{declined}} it because he intended to inherit another elder name. Following his retirement from the ring in May 1991, Chiyonofuji inherited the elder name of Jinmaku; then in 1992 he purchased the Kokonoe stable from Kitanofuji and the two exchanged their elder names (Jinmaku and Kokonoe). The purchase price of the stable was reported as being around 50 million yen, below the market rate for a stable. Under his leadership, the stable produced several top wrestlers including former ōzeki Chiyotaikai, former komusubi Chiyotenzan and former maegashira Chiyohakuhō. As of March 2016, Kokonoe stable {{is one of the}} most successful stables in sumo in terms of quantity of sekitori, with two men (Chiyotairyū and Chiyootori) in the top division and four (Chiyomaru, Chiyonokuni, Chiyoshoma and Chiyo-o) in jūryō.|$|E
25|$|Company policy {{required}} land to {{be purchased}} from the indigenous peoples. The WIC would offer a land patent, {{the recipient of}} which would be responsible for negotiating a deal with representatives of the local population, usually the sachem or high chief. The Dutch (referred to by the natives as Swannekins, or salt water people) and the Wilden (as the Dutch called the natives) had vastly different conceptions of ownership and use of land—so much so that they did not understand each other at all. The Dutch thought that their <b>proffer</b> of gifts in the form of sewant or manufactured goods was a trade agreement and defense alliance, which gave them exclusive rights to farming, hunting, and fishing. Often, the Indians did not vacate the property, or reappeared seasonally, according to their migration patterns. They were willing to share the land with the Europeans, but the Indians did not intend to leave or give up access. This misunderstanding and other differences led to violent conflict later. At the same time, such differences marked the beginnings of a multicultural society.|$|E
500|$|Many causes {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the hunts, including economic distress, changing attitudes to women, {{the rise of a}} [...] "godly state", the inquisitorial Scottish judicial system, the widespread use of judicial torture, the role of the local kirk, decentralised justice and the prevalence of the idea of the diabolic pact.

She spent her professional life in the Qinhuai pleasure quarter of Nanjing in the 1580s, where she became something of a celebrity among the literati and government officials who frequented the [...] "flower houses" [...] there. She was highly selective in her clientele, accepting only learned and scholarly men as her lovers and declining to <b>proffer</b> her affections for mere financial gain; suitors might spend thousands of taels on her to no avail.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the intensity of Scottish witch-hunting was due to an inquisitorial judicial system and the widespread use of judicial torture. However, Brian P. Levack argues that the Scottish system was only partly inquisitorial and that use of judicial torture was extremely limited, similar to the situation in England. A relatively high level of acquittal in Scottish trials may have been due to the employment of defence lawyers in Scottish courts, a benefit not given accused witches in England. The close involvement of the Scottish Kirk in trials and the decentralised nature of Scottish courts, where local magistrates heard many cases (in contrast to England where most were before a small number of circuit judges), may have contributed to higher rates of prosecution. The diabolic pact is often stated as a major difference between Scottish and English witchcraft cases, but Stuart Maxwell argues that the iconography of Satan may be an imposition of central government beliefs on local traditions, particularly those concerned with fairies, which were more persistent in Scotland than in England. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch-hunt has led some historians to <b>proffer</b> the concept of [...] "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.|$|E

500|$|Well {{aware of}} the parlous state of the office's accounts, Waters retired from the Marine Pay Office in 1807 as an {{independently}} wealthy man (only to lose the fortune in his Opera House investments). The lax regime in the Pay Office rattled on, however, until 27 December 1809, when Perceval became {{aware of the}} state of Villiers' accounts. Villiers, to his credit, immediately resigned and took responsibility for his official debts. Perceval allowed him to <b>proffer</b> his resignation directly to the king, but Villiers could not face his master; Perceval informed the king of the state of affairs in a letter of 15 January 1810, laying the blame for the situation largely on Waters. Perceval's letter noted that [...] "reports were circulating on the subject to such an extent as to make it impossible to hope that it would not become the subject of Parliamentary observation." [...] By this time, Villiers's accounts had been audited through the year 1804, revealing him to be in arrears by the staggering sum of £280,000 through that point. On the advice of his brother-in-law Boringdon, Villiers offered up all his property to the Crown, although he could not hope to pay off the entire sum found wanting by this means. The episode left him in a condition of nervous prostration, the more so as he by now had five children to support. A letter by [...] "A.B." [...] in Cobbett's Political Register of 27 January 1810 assailed Villiers for his delinquency and estimated that his debt, with interest, might run to £500,000.|$|E
500|$|In the post-Reformation period {{there was}} a {{criminalisation}} of women. Women were disciplined in kirk sessions and civil courts for stereotypical offenses including scolding and prostitution, which were seen as deviant, rather than criminal. Through the 1640s there were independent commissions set up to try women for child murder and, after pressure from the kirk, a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman who concealed a pregnancy and birth and whose child later died. In {{the aftermath of the}} initial Reformation settlement, Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563, similar to that passed in England one year earlier, which made the practice of witchcraft itself and consulting with witches capital crimes. Between the passing of the act and its repeal in 1736, an estimated 6,000 persons were tried for witchcraft in Scotland. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. Various reasons for the Scottish witch-hunt, and its more intense nature than that in England, have been advanced by historians. Many of the major periods of prosecution coincided with periods of intense economic distress and some accusations may have followed the withdrawal of charity from marginal figures, particularly the single women that made up many of the accused. Changing attitudes to women, particularly in the reformed kirk, which may have perceived women as more of a moral threat, have also been noted. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch hunt has led some historians to <b>proffer</b> the concept of [...] "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.|$|E
500|$|Back in England, the {{continuous}} succession of recording sessions, gigs and promotional work started again, but {{the strain of}} this routine was wearing out Kelly Johnson, who was also tired of the music the band had been playing for four years without a break. The other members struggled to convince her to stay {{and the chance to}} record with British celebrities Noddy Holder and Jim Lea as producers persuaded the guitarist to carry on with Girlschool. Holder and Lea, who had returned in those years to great success and popularity in Great Britain with the 70s rock band Slade, were hired to produce only a single, with the following album already scheduled to be recorded in Los Angeles with Quiet Riot producer Spencer <b>Proffer.</b> However, the good chemistry found with the two Slade members led the band to decide to record not a single, but their whole fourth studio album in North London with Lea and Holder, giving up the trip to the USA. This time the group changed sensibly both their appearance and their musical style in order to appeal to a large American audience, which Bronze considered more oriented toward AOR and glam rock than to the 'biker metal' Girlschool had produced before. Play Dirty, released in October 1983, is an album with a very polished sound, filled with keyboards, choruses and melodies, but it lacks much of the aggression and power of the preceding works. The album contains covers of the Slade songs [...] "High & Dry" [...] and [...] "Burning in the Heat" [...] and of T.Rex’s [...] "20th Century Boy", which was also released as a single. Play Dirty failed to enter the top 50 chart in the UK and had a lukewarm reception by fans and critics at home. A struggle between Bronze and PolyGram for the worldwide contract of the band resulted also in poor promotion for the album in the USA. Moreover, a disastrous performance at Wembley Arena supporting ZZ Top did not help Girlschool's already degraded image in Great Britain.|$|E
