40|$|The paper {{presents}} the methodological {{challenges of the}} introduction of <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessment</b> by the German legislative (Competition Enhancement Act). Based on the standards for health economic evaluation accepted by the international scientific health economic community, this paper provides a minimum catalogue of methods and criteria to meet the legal German requirements. The methodological framework {{presented in this paper}} discusses the perspective to be used to evaluate cost and benefits, lists the appropriate study form, names the usage of primary or secondary data, the description of the cost and benefit calculation, shows the specific need on modelling and how to handle uncertainties and calls for a disclosure of potential conflict of interests. Further more, the paper contains detailed recommendations for the assessment-process in Germany. According to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut fuer Qualitaet und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, IQWiG) has to evaluate the <b>cost-benefit</b> ratio of <b>pharmaceuticals</b> in Germany. The process should be organized within two sequently parts: At first the development of a reporting plan that defines the comparative interventions to be included, the target criteria, assessment methods and the schedule to be observed, and secondly the implementation of the <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessment.</b> <b>Cost-benefit</b> <b>assessment,</b> health-economics, evaluation, methods, Germany...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{alternative ways}} of defining and measuring the marginal economic cost of public funds and reviews empirical cost estimates - including estimates for EU countries. Moreover, it illustrates how the economic cost of public funds should be accounted for in cost-benefit analyses of government expenditure, notably on public infrastructure, and how the <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessment</b> changes if user fees contribute to the financing of infrastructure services. The paper also clarifies why the economic cost of public funds must {{not be confused with}} the social discount rate, social opportunity cost, and the interest rate on government debt. In this context, the paper discusses how government borrowing - that is, taxing later in lieu of taxing now - affects the <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessment.</b> cost of public funds; excess burden of taxation; infrastructure; user fees; discounting...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} risk-informed {{decision support}} {{for assessing the}} costs and benefits of Counter-Terrorism (CT) protective measures for infrastructure. As such, a <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessment</b> needs to consider risk reduction, threat probability, and fatality and damage cost estimates. <b>Cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments</b> are conducted for three items of infrastructure using representative cost and vulnerability data. The illustrative examples showed under what combination of risk reduction, threat probability, and fatality and damage costs the CT protective measures would be cost-effective for building, bridge and aviation infrastructure. It was found that unless terrorist threat probabilities are high, then typical CT protective measures are not cost-effective. Opportunity costs associated can be considerable which makes CT protective measures even less cost-effective. The threat likelihood for bridges is considerably less than for buildings. With the possible exception of ‘key assets’, most individual items of infrastructure are likely to be not ‘critical’ to the nation or the economy and so in many cases not cost-effective to protect against terrorism...|$|R

40|$|The availability, {{quality and}} {{accessibility}} of Geographic Information (GI) have significant socio-economic and environmental benefits, but {{the collection and}} maintenance of GI require substantial investments. <b>Cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments</b> (CBAs) attempt to justify the costs of geospatial data investments, applying different methodologies and focusing on diverse areas. Therefore, the Returns on Investment (ROI) vary considerably across studies, regions and sectors. The objective {{of this study is}} to explain some of the variation in the average ROI of GI by conducting a meta-analysis of 82 <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments</b> between 1994 and 2013. In a first site, CBAs are systematically reviewed and relevant information is extracted. Particular emphasis is given to investment conditions and study characteristics. In a second step, multivariate regression methods are used to assess the size, significance and direction of individual effects. The results suggest that regional factors have the largest impact on the profitability of GI. Returns in Australia and New Zealand, for example, are four times larger than in Europe. In addition, small-scale regional investments have a 2. 5 times lower return than large-scale international investments. Overall, the expected benefits of GI investments are approximately 3. 2 times larger than the costs...|$|R

40|$|Most current {{cost-benefit}} {{analyses of}} climate change policies suggest an optimal global climate policy that is significantly less stringent than the level required to meet the internationally agreed 2 °C target. This is partly because the sum of estimated economic damage {{of climate change}} across various sectors, such as energy use and changes in agricultural production, results in only a small economic loss or even a small economic gain in the gross world product under predicted levels of climate change. However, those cost-benefit analyses rarely take account of environmental tipping points leading to abrupt and irreversible impacts on market and nonmarket goods and services, including those provided by the climate and by ecosystems. Here we show that including environmental tipping point impacts in a stochastic dynamic integrated assessment model profoundly alters <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessment</b> of global climate policy. The risk of a tipping point, even if it only has nonmarket impacts, could substantially increase the present optimal carbon tax. For example, a risk of only 5 % loss in nonmarket goods that occurs with a 5 % annual probability at 4 °C increase of the global surface temperature causes an immediate two-thirds increase in optimal carbon tax. If the tipping point also has a 5 % impact on market goods, the optimal carbon tax increases {{by more than a}} factor of 3. Hence existing <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments</b> of global climate policy may be significantly underestimating the needs for controlling climate change...|$|R

Yet, little has been done to assess uncertainty associated with natural source emissions. Importantly, uncertainty estimates continue to be particularly relevant in the assessment of potential regulatory options, as confidence in emissions can lead to different <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments.</b> To address this problem, we employed the Monte Carlo technique to improve uncertainty estimates associated with mercury emissions from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Results demonstrate that uncertainties, as they are understood in the existing literature, are overestimated.

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{commercial property}} {{responses to a}} major capacity expansion of a roadway facility in Austin, Texas, by analyzing parcel-level real estate assessment data over an 18 -year period (1982 - 1999). A land value model, an improvement or structure value model, and a total property value model were each estimated separately. Since total land values are fundamentally related to parcel acreages and improvement values are related to improvement size, parcel and improvement areas were interacted with appropriate access variables and structural variables. Empirical results suggest that improvement type, freeway proximity, parcel location at key network points (e. g., corner parcels), and timing of construction and completion play key roles in property valuation. The estimates of impacts should prove very helpful in comprehensive <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments</b> of projects of this nature by public agencies and corridor property owners. KEY WORD...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{concerns}} the ValueSec methodology and tool which support decisions {{related to the}} security measures selection in different application contexts. The ValueSec project, financed by the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7), considers security measures which properly affect risk, are cost effective, bring benefits and are free of different restrictions (political, social, legal, psychological, etc.). These restrictions, called here qualitative factors (criteria), are hard to identify and assess. The ValueSec methodology is based on three pillars: risk <b>assessment,</b> <b>cost-benefits</b> <b>assessment</b> and qualitative criteria assessment.
