5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot {{in the back of the}} head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway, its opening {{did not bring}} the financial success that had been expected. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR– in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets. 37,000 people used the line on the first day, but {{in the months following}} the line's opening only about 20,000–30,000 passengers a day used the service. The number of carriages used by the BS was cut back to three per train at peak times and only two during off-peak hours. The Daily Mail reported in April 1906 that the rush-hour trains were carrying fewer than 100 <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. To add to the line's misfortunes, it suffered its first fatality only two weeks after opening when conductor John Creagh was crushed between a train and a tunnel wall at Kennington Road station on 26 March.|$|E

5|$|For twoyears {{after the}} bombing the only {{memorials}} to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> security fence surrounding {{the site of the}} building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29million, which was raised by public and private funds. The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years {{after the bombing}}. Within the first year, it had 700,000visitors.|$|E

She says the only <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E

5|$|Such {{restrictions}} dated back {{to colonial}} times, and were {{found throughout the}} United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North {{and later in the}} South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, for instance traveling by rail from New Orleans to resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in public accommodations and public transportation.|$|E

She comes into the care of Willow Ufgood, a kind farmer and conjurer who hopes to become a real sorcerer; his wife Kiaya and his {{children}} {{fall in love with}} the baby immediately, and Willow too soon grows to love her as one of his own. During a town festival, the village is attacked by a Nockmaar hound which is quickly killed by the village warriors. The High Aldwin, the village sorcerer, learns about the baby and selects Willow, due to his devotion to the child, to accompany a party of volunteers returning the baby to the Daikini (human) <b>people.</b> <b>At</b> <b>a</b> crossroads, they find a human warrior named Madmartigan trapped in a crow's cage. The rest of the party want to give the baby to Madmartigan and go home immediately, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, so the others leave. After spending the night at the crossroads and meeting an army led by Airk Thaughbaer, an old friend of Madmartigan's marching against Bavmorda, Willow reluctantly decides to free Madmartigan so that he can take care of the baby for them.|$|E
