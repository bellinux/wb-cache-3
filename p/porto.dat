5|$|<b>Porto</b> first {{participated in}} {{international}} club competitions in 1956, {{when they took}} part in the second edition of the European Cup. Qualification for this competition – contested between Europe's national champions – was achieved after <b>Porto</b> secured their fourth Primeira Divisão title in the previous season. Their debut was in a preliminary round tie against Spanish champions Atlético Bilbao. At their new home ground, the Estádio das Antas, <b>Porto</b> lost the first match 2–1 and were eliminated a week later in Bilbao, after a 3–2 defeat. <b>Porto</b> returned to this tournament two years later but fell at the same stage. After three seasons without qualifying for European competitions, <b>Porto</b> finished the 1961–62 league as runners-up and entered the non-UEFA-affiliated Inter-Cities Fairs Cup {{for the first time in}} 1962–63. They were knocked out in the first round by Dinamo Zagreb, who secured a draw in Yugoslavia after winning in Portugal. <b>Porto</b> returned to the Fairs Cup in the following season, but failed to advance past the first round.|$|E
5|$|Ferreira {{stepped down}} at the end of the 2009–10 season and was {{replaced}} by André Villas-Boas, a former assistant of Mourinho at <b>Porto,</b> Chelsea, and Internazionale. In a single season, Villas-Boas guided the team to a record-matching four titles, including victory in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Their triumphant campaign started in the play-off round, where they overcame Belgian side Genk to reach the group stage. <b>Porto</b> topped their group undefeated, only dropping points against Beşiktaş. In the round of 32, despite a second-leg home loss, they eliminated the 2005–06 and 2006–07 UEFA Cup winners Sevilla, setting up a tie with CSKA Moscow. <b>Porto</b> defeated the Russians in both legs and advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were paired against another Muscovite club, this time Spartak Moscow. Two prolific displays, which included a hat-trick by Radamel Falcao, sealed a 10–3 aggregate win for <b>Porto.</b> In the semi-finals, Falcao went one better and scored four goals in a first-leg 5–1 win against Villarreal, which all but confirmed the club's fourth major European final. The Dublin final was an all-Portuguese affair between <b>Porto</b> and Primeira Liga rivals Braga. Contrasting with previous matches in the tournament, Porto's performance was more contained and victory was secured with a single goal by Falcao, who became the competition's top scorer.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Camp Las Casas was {{established}} in Santurce {{under the command of}} Lt. Colonel Orval P. Townshend. The <b>Porto</b> Rico Regiment was assigned to the camp. The regiment consisted of two battalions of the former <b>Porto</b> Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry.|$|E

East of <b>Porto's</b> is Antique Row, a hub for shopping in the city.|$|R
5|$|In 1955–56, <b>Porto</b> {{lifted the}} Taça de Portugal {{for the first}} time, {{and in doing so}} secured their first league and cup double. The {{following}} season saw the club's international stage premiere in the European Cup. Thirty years later, <b>Porto</b> beat Bayern Munich in the 1987 European Cup Final to win their maiden European silverware. The following season brought the club further successes in the UEFA Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup. Since taking their first Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira title in 1981, <b>Porto</b> have a record of 20 wins in 29 appearances, more than any other winner combined.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the club}} won their third Portuguese Cup and {{qualified}} for the 1968–69 Cup Winners' Cup. As in previous years, {{they were unable to}} get past the second round, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Slovan Bratislava. Porto's last participation in the Fairs Cup, in 1969–70, also ended in the second round, with a defeat against holders Newcastle United. Domestically, <b>Porto</b> finished the league in an all-time low ninth place, thus failing to qualify for European competition in the 1970–71 season. They returned the following season to participate in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Cup, which officially replaced the Fairs Cup, but their debut against Nantes led to another premature exit. <b>Porto</b> returned to this tournament in four of the following five seasons, the exception being 1973–74, when it failed qualification for European competitions. In the first of those seasons (1972–73), <b>Porto</b> reached the third round of a European competition for the first time, but were eliminated by Dynamo Dresden. They beat Barcelona in the first round, in what was the teams' first European encounter and the only time <b>Porto</b> eliminated the Spanish side from European competitions. In the 1975–76 UEFA Cup, <b>Porto</b> were again eliminated in the third round, but in the process they beat Luxembourg's Avenir Beggen with a club record home (7–0) and aggregate (10–0) win scores. In {{the first round of the}} following season's UEFA Cup, <b>Porto</b> were matched with Schalke 04. After a tie in the first leg, <b>Porto</b> squandered a 2–0 lead in the second leg, conceding three goals in the last 15 minutes, which resulted in their elimination.|$|E
5|$|Normal time {{ended with}} the game at 2–2. The ensuing periods of extra time saw {{defensive}} football from both sides; Celtic was down to ten men when Bobo Balde was dismissed on 95 minutes after his second yellow card. On 112 minutes, Derlei reacted quickest to a Robert Douglas block and rounded McNamara make it 3–2 for <b>Porto.</b> <b>Porto</b> managed to hang on even after having Nuno Valente sent off just {{before the end of}} extra-time, thus ensuring that <b>Porto</b> had ended their 16-year wait between European trophies. It was Porto's first UEFA Cup win, and they were also the first team to win a trophy on the silver goal rule.|$|E

5|$|On 18 August, <b>Porto</b> Alegre {{received}} {{instructions from}} Mitre {{to attack the}} Paraguayan fort at Curuzú. The operation would be carried out {{under the command of}} Tamandaré. <b>Porto</b> Alegre not only refused to defer to his cousin, arguing that both held the same rank, but also warned that he would operate by himself at Curuzú. <b>Porto</b> Alegre was incapable of submitting his forces to foreign direction and was unwilling to comply with orders issued by the allied commander. Nor was the situation among the allied forces improved once <b>Porto</b> Alegre and Tamandaré found common ground in their distaste for the Brazilian commander of the 1st Corps, Field Marshal Polidoro Quintanilha Jordão (later the Viscount of Santa Teresa). Jordão was ostracized for supporting Mitre and for {{being a member of the}} Conservative Party, while <b>Porto</b> Alegre and Tamandaré were Progressives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porto</b> Alegre {{assumed the}} command of the Brazilian army in Uruguaiana on 21 August 1865. From the very beginning, he had an acrimonious {{relationship}} with Brazil's allies Bartolomé Mitre, president of Argentina, and Venancio Flores, president of Uruguay, who led the armies of their respective nations. The years had not lessened <b>Porto</b> Alegre's prejudice against Hispanic-Americans; on the contrary, his antagonism had increased. On 2 September, Flores suggested an immediate attack on Uruguaiana, an option rejected by <b>Porto</b> Alegre and Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then Viscount and later Marquis of Tamandaré), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian navy. Tamandaré was a first cousin of <b>Porto</b> Alegre; their mothers were sisters. When Flores claimed that he could defeat the Paraguayan army alone, he was mocked by both Brazilian officers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porto</b> {{finished}} the {{season at the}} top of the Primeira Liga, ending a 19-year drought of league titles. In their return to the European Cup, they were eliminated in the first round after suffering their heaviest defeat in European competitions: 6–1 against AEK Athens. <b>Porto</b> secured back-to-back league titles to participate in the 1979–80 European Cup. They eliminated Milan in the first round, with a second-leg 1–0 win at San Siro, and advanced to a second-round contest with Real Madrid. Two goals from Fernando Gomes granted a 2–1 home win for <b>Porto,</b> but Real's goal proved crucial to secure their qualification on the away goals rule, after a 1–0 win in Madrid. <b>Porto</b> spent their following five seasons competing either in the UEFA Cup or Cup Winners' Cup. In the 1980–81 and 1982–83 UEFA Cup editions, <b>Porto</b> was eliminated in the second round by Grasshoppers and Anderlecht, respectively. In between, the club sailed into the 1981–82 Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals, where they were beaten by the eventual runners-up Standard Liège.|$|E

5|$|<b>Porto</b> {{won three}} {{consecutive}} Primeira Liga titles with Ferreira, ensuring {{their presence in}} the three subsequent Champions League seasons. In 2007–08, <b>Porto</b> fell again in the round of 16, losing to Schalke 04 in a penalty shootout. In the following season's round of 16, they eliminated Atlético Madrid on away goals and progressed to a quarter-final tie with Manchester United. A two-all draw in Manchester gave <b>Porto</b> the upper hand in the round, but a Cristiano Ronaldo goal in the opening minutes of the return leg ended their European run. The 2009–10 UEFA Champions League season was Ferreira's last in charge of <b>Porto,</b> and like in previous years, he successfully guided the team past the group stage. In the round of 16, a 2–1 home win over Arsenal was obliterated by a 5–0 defeat in London, which included a hat-trick from Nicklas Bendtner. Domestically, <b>Porto</b> failed to win a fifth consecutive league title and their third-place finish excluded them from competing in the 2010–11 Champions League. However, victory in the Portuguese Cup final confirmed the club's entry in the play-off round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals paired United with <b>Porto,</b> against {{whom they had}} played in the first {{knockout}} round of the 2003–04 competition. The draw also determined the semi-final pairings, with United or <b>Porto</b> drawn to play against Arsenal or Villarreal. The first leg of the quarter-final was played at Old Trafford, giving <b>Porto</b> the chance to put the pressure on Manchester United with an away goal. That away goal came in the fourth minute of the game, but Wayne Rooney equalised tenminutes later and Carlos Tevez gave United {{the lead in the}} 85thminute. However, with only oneminute left in the game, United suffered a defensive lapse, allowing Mariano González to score Porto's second away goal. Those away goals meant that United travelled to the Estádio do Dragão in <b>Porto</b> needing a win or a score-draw of 2–2 or higher to remain in the competition. A 40-yard goal from Ronaldo in the sixthminute put United into the lead, and although both sides pressed for another goal, it proved to be {{the only one of the}} game, making Manchester United the first English side to win in <b>Porto.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack <b>Porto</b> Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because {{of the value of the}} goods passing through its port, <b>Porto</b> Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for <b>Porto</b> Bello.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the count focused on two other projects: the first {{grew out of}} his longstanding {{interest}} in promoting literature and sciences, and the second, more ambitious aim was {{to fight for the}} gradual abolition of slavery. When in 1867 PedroII openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in his Speech from the Throne, <b>Porto</b> Alegre {{was one of the few}} individuals who supported him, sending him a letter of congratulation. On 18 June 1869, the Partenon Literário (Literary Parthenon), a spiritual successor to the Historic and Geographic Institute of the Province of São Pedro, was created and <b>Porto</b> Alegre was made an honorary member. In one of its sessions, the count, who had already embarked on a plan of gradually freeing his own slaves, proposed the creation of a civil association devoted to slavery's abolition. His idea was not only welcomed but came to fruition. The Sociedade Libertadora (Liberation Society) was founded on 29 August, with <b>Porto</b> Alegre as its president, its primary purpose being the purchase of freedom for enslaved children.|$|E

5|$|In February, Benfica's {{schedule}} {{included two}} difficult away matches against <b>Porto</b> and Sporting. They began the month with the semi-final of the 2008–09 Taça da Liga against Vitória de Guimarães. Benfica scored the opening goal on a Carlos Martins corner kick which Grégory headed {{into his own}} net. Near the end of regulation time, Pablo Aimar added the second (his first for the club), and Guimarães responded with a consolation goal. Four days later, Benfica played <b>Porto</b> at the Estádio do Dragão in a game between the top two teams on the league table. They scored first through Hassan Yebda, who headed in a corner kick from José Antonio Reyes. In the second half, Benfica held <b>Porto</b> until the 72th minute, when Pedro Proença signalled a controversial penalty by Yebda on Lisandro López. Lucho González converted it for a 1–1 draw. Sánchez Flores was satisfied, because the club played well and controlled the game. The result kept <b>Porto</b> {{on top of the}} league table by one point. On 15 February, Benfica hosted Paços de Ferreira. The scoring came in the second half – the first goal in the 69th minute, when Aimar assisted Óscar Cardozo. Four minutes later, Rúben Amorim made it 2–0, with Paços reacting immediately with the 2–1 from Ferreira. Near the end, Di María scored the third goal for Benfica, with Paços cutting their lead to 3–2 and then hitting the post. Sánchez Flores called it a hard-fought win, with his players' commitment keeping <b>Porto</b> at bay. Almost a week later, Benfica visited the Estádio José Alvalade to face Sporting. An 11th-minute opener from Liédson was answered with an equaliser from Reyes before half-time. In the second half, Derlei unlocked the draw, scoring Sporting's second goal before Liédson scored a third; Cardozo brought it down to 3–2, and the clock ran out three minutes later. Benfica's second league loss had troubling consequences; Sporting was tied for second place with 37 points, and <b>Porto</b> had a four-point lead. The club finished February with a home win against Leixões. Élvis opened with an own goal for Benfica. Nuno Gomes later scored the second (his fifth goal of the season), with Leixões replying with a goal of their own. Despite playing with ten men, Benfica held Leixões back and won. To Sánchez Flores, the match was intense and difficult, but the victory put pressure on their opponents (who faced each other in following day). With a goalless draw in the game between <b>Porto</b> and Sporting, Benfica finished February with 40 points, two fewer than <b>Porto.</b>|$|E
