When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal bends down and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} dorsal sepal.

The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, <b>phenylethyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 This study first {{investigated}} the developmental {{changes in the}} volatile composition and carotenoids of Pinot noir grapes. Grape berries were sampled every week from pea size to harvest during the 2011 and 2012 season. Carotenoids and organic acids were analyzed by HPLC. Volatile compounds were extracted from crushed berries using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and C₁₃-norisoprenoids potentials were analyzed by HS-SPME-GC-MS after acid hydrolysis. Malic acid accumulated before véraison and decreased dramatically during ripening. Carotenoids and chlorophylls decreased during entire developmental period although some of carotenoids showed a short accumulation stage before véraison. Pinot noir grapes had a more complex volatile compound composition pre-véraison than post-véraison, which may due to the decreasing of monoterpenes during ripening. C 6 -aldehydes significantly increased in concentration after véraison. C 6 -alcohols accumulated around véraison and decreased during ripening. Benzyl and <b>phenylethyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> increased before véraison, reached the highest amount two weeks after véraison and slightly decreased towards harvest. The concentration of volatile phenols reached the highest amount at véraison, decreased in about one week, then stayed relatively stable through maturity. Free-form C₁₃-norisoprenoids was low, but higher after acid hydrolysis, indicating the dominance of C₁₃-norisoprenoids precursors. Total C₁₃-norisoprenoids increased after véraison, corresponding to carotenoid breaking down. The analysis of grape composition in this study demonstrated a quantitative means of assessing the relationships between vineyard management practices and grape-derived secondary metabolites, {{some of which are}} important wine aroma and flavor components. Effect of cluster zone leaf removal management on grape composition were further investigated. Three cluster zone leaf removal management, including 0 % leaf removal (Control), 50 % leaf removal and 100 % leaf removal of the cluster zone were studied in commercial vineyards from 2010 to 2012. Grape samples were harvested every year and analyzed for total soluble solids (TSS), organic acids, phenolics and carotenoids. Leaf removal had no impact on grape TSS, citric and tartaric acids but lowered malic acid in year 2012. Leaf removal increased quercetin glycoside content in grape berry in three years, and increased anthocyanin content in year 2010 and 2012. For carotenoids, leaf removal decreased flavoxanthin content in the grape berry and decreased β-carotene in 2012. It is evident that more sun exposure as a result of leaf removal increases degradation of carotenoids, and could potentially increase concentration of norisoprenoids in grapes...|$|R

In {{order to understand the}} Chinese cereal vinegar further, its characteristic flavour should be researched. The purpose of the work is to find out the characteristic flavour compounds and analyze the dynamic variation trend in the process of Chinese cereal vinegar fermentation. HS- SPME fibered with polyacrylate (PA) was used in detecting aromatic compounds. It was found that in the ethanol fermentation, ethanol increased rapidly, and other aromatic compounds accumulated slowly; in the acetic acid fermentation, acetic acid and esters increased fast with reduction of alcohol, while phenols, aldehyde, ketones, hydrocarbons and heterocyclic were still slowly accumulated. The characteristic aromatic compounds were ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, <b>phenylethyl</b> acetate, β-phenylethyl <b>alcohol</b> and 4 -Vinylguaiacol. The contents of organic acids reached 6. 79 ± 0. 11 g/ 100 g sample finally, and acetic acid, succinic acid, malic acid and lactic acid were the main organic acids.

40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs) as {{an objective}} measurement of olfactory function in infants. Study design OERPs to <b>phenylethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> were measured in 13 infants, between 23 and 41 days of age. The odor was delivered with a computer-controlled olfactometer. Recording electrodes were applied using the 10 - 20 system. Data from electrodes Fz, Cz, Pz, C 3, and C 4 {{were analyzed by}} MatLab's Letswave toolbox (André Mouraux, Brussels, Belgium) using the canonical time-domain averaging {{as well as the}} time-frequency analyzing method. Results Ten of 13 infants finished the recording session. We observed OERPs in 7 of these 10 infants. Recordings were best in electrodes Fz and Cz. The N 1 peak was visible at 328 ms followed by P 2 at 505 ms. In addition, the time-frequency analysis had an increase in low frequencies (4 - 7 Hz) around 550 ms after odor presentation. Conclusions We were able to record OERPs in infants. The time-domain averaging as well as the time-frequency analysis was of value for data analysis. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Pediococcus acidilactici {{was used}} to ferment fresh pork. After fermentation, the pork jerky was {{subjected}} to sensory evaluation and the levels of pH, free amino acids, and volatile compounds were measured. The {{results showed that the}} fermented pork jerky had a better sensory evaluation score (score: 93. 2), lower pH value (3. 54), and more free amino acids (39. 24 mg/ 100 g). Furthermore, in the fermented pork jerky, the content of three acids (18. 552 %) was high, which lowered the pH of the pork jerky and inhibited growth of pathogens. Moreover, some new compounds produced, including 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone (49. 095 %), 2, 3 -butanediol (2. 790 %), 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol (2. 400 %), oxalic acid isobutyl hexyl ester (2. 280 %), <b>phenylethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (0. 953 %), and eucalyptol (0. 659 %), contributed to the flavour of pork jerky. Overall, our results demonstrated that P. acidilactici can be used for the production as well as improvement of the quality and flavour of fermented pork jerky...|$|E
40|$|Preservative {{efficacy}} {{tests were}} performed in triplicate {{on each of}} three batches of three formulated nasal spray preparations to assess the inter- and intra-batch variation in preservative performance which typically results from these procedures, and to assess {{the relative importance of}} factors influencing preservative performance in nasal products. Tests were conducted using procedures conforming, as far as possible, to both the European and the US pharmacopoeias and the results interpreted using the performance criteria of both. Despite the adoption of practices designed to maximize reproducibility, a marked variation in the degree of microbial inactivation was observed, both within and between batches of product. A preservative system comprising benzalkonium chloride and <b>phenylethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was found to be far superior to combinations of either benzalkonium chloride plus disodium edetate or potassium sorbate plus disodium edetate, both of which failed to satisfy the EP performance criteria on a number of occasions. Proposals are made for the adoption of inactivation criteria which incorporate realistic error limits reflecting the inherent problems of reproducibility of the viable counting procedures involved...|$|E
40|$|An agar medium, LL-agar (lactate-lead acetate) was {{designed}} to selectively differentiate members of the genus Pectinatus (S. Y. Lee, M. S. Mabee, and N. O. Jangaard, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 28 : 582 - 594, 1978; S. Y. Lee, M. S. Mabee, N. O. Jangaard, and E. K. Horiuchi, J. Inst. Brew. 86 : 28 - 30, 1980) from other brewery microorganisms. Selectivity was achieved {{by the use of}} sodium lactate as the sole source of carbon and <b>phenylethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> as an inhibitor for aerobic gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Differentiation was established by the introduction of lead acetate into the medium, which reacted with the H 2 S liberated by Pectinatus and resulted in a blackening of the Pectinatus colonies while the other brewery organisms, when present, remained white. In combination with the Lee tube (J. E. Ogg, S. Y. Lee, and B. J. Ogg, Can. J. Microbiol. 25 : 987 - 990, 1979) and this medium, isolation of Pectinatus organisms from beer samples was accomplished with convenience and simplicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} {{compounds in}} foxtail millet sake were extracted by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Different methods of sample preparation {{were used to}} optimize this method (SPME fiber types, sample amount, extraction time, extraction temperature, content of NaCl, and rotor speed). For final method of sample preparation, 8 [*]mL of sake {{was placed in a}} 15 [*]mL headspace vial with addition of 1. 5 [*]g of NaCl; a 50 / 30 [*]μm DVB/CAR/PDMS SPME fiber was used for extraction at 50 °C for 30 [*]min with 10 [*]rpm continuous stirring. A total of 41 volatile compounds were identified from the sake sample, including 9 esters, 6 alcohols, 4 acids, 4 aldehydes, 9 hydrocarbons, 7 benzene derivatives, and 2 others. The main volatile compounds were ethyl acetate, <b>phenylethyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> butanedioic acid diethyl ester, and hexadecane. According to their odors active values (OAVs), 10 volatile compounds were established to be odor active compounds and to contribute to the typical foxtail millet sake aroma. Hexanoic acid ethyl ester was the most prominent odor active compound...|$|E
