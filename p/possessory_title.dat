40|$|The article {{outlines}} the rules under the Land Registration Act 2002, Schedule, 6, governing applications by an adverse possessor of registered land {{to be named}} as the proprietor in the register. It discusses how the common law principle of relativity of <b>title</b> confers certain <b>possessory</b> rights on squatters who choose {{not to make a}} Sch. 6 application and thereby risk an objection from the paper owner. It also considers how this "dark market" in <b>possessory</b> <b>titles</b> can be combatted by amendment to the Land Registration Act 2002 with reference to the findings of the writers' survey of 200 conveyancing solicitors in England and Wales...|$|R
50|$|<b>Possessory</b> {{freehold}} <b>title</b> - {{there is}} no documentary evidence of title (e.g. lost title deeds). Title depends on adverse possession. It conveys no guarantee of title {{at the time of}} registration, but subsequent problems (e.g. forgery of proprietor's signature) will be covered by the guarantee. It can be upgraded into absolute title after being in possession as proprietor for 12 years (s.62(1), (4)).|$|R
40|$|The paper explores {{a problem}} thrown up by LRA 2002 Schedule 6 and the Act's {{provisions}} generally relating to changes concerning the law relating to adverse possession claims against registered titles. Under the LRA 2002 after 10 years adverse {{possession of a}} registered title a claimant for the same can apply to be registered as proprietor of the relevant land. The current registered owner is notified and is afforded the opportunity to object within certain time limits. If objection is made the adverse possessor applicant will only succeed in becoming the new registered proprietor on certain limited grounds. Due to the difficulty in succeeding the authors contend that de facto many adverse possessors of registered land do not bother applying to be registered and remain in adverse possession without making any application. This the authors contend indirectly revives the significance of <b>possessory</b> <b>titles</b> along with the issues relating to their usage, which ironically weakens the all important mirror principle the LRA 2002 was meant to strengthen. Empirical evidence {{is included in the}} paper which bears out the authors' contention in this regard. Law reform recommendations are then made so as to improve the relevant legal rules surrounding adverse possession claims against pre-existing registered titles...|$|R

50|$|A pledge is a {{bailment}} that conveys <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> {{to property}} {{owned by a}} debtor (the pledgor) to a creditor (the pledgee) to secure repayment for some debt or obligation and to the mutual benefit of both parties. The term {{is also used to}} denote the property which constitutes the security. A pledge is type of security interest.|$|E
50|$|Hanworth Common {{has been}} managed by a {{committee}} since at least 1909, the earliest minutes that are held, and all residents have grazing rights. In 1972, Hanworth Common was registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965, and, as there was no known owner, <b>Possessory</b> <b>Title</b> was granted to the Hanworth Commons Management Committee in 1974. The committee is responsible for managing The Common and letting the grazing. About 50 cattle now graze the Common from May to October.|$|E
50|$|Previously, {{this title}} was applied more liberally {{until it was}} abused {{with the release of}} Brett Leonard's The Lawnmower Man. The film, which bears little to no {{resemblance}} to King's short story, was originally released as Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man, but the <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> was removed following a lawsuit filed by King against the filmmakers. A federal court ruled in King's favor, and a Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that King's name should be removed from the title.|$|E
5000|$|Some Dollar Baby filmmakers have mistakenly {{assumed that}} Stephen King's {{explicit}} permission {{to make and}} showcase the adapted filmwork automatically qualifies the film for a possessory credit (e.g. [...] "Stephen King's Silver Bullet" [...] {{as opposed to just}} [...] "Silver Bullet"). In actuality, this is a specified legal usage of the author's name and King does not grant permission for Dollar Baby filmmakers to use his name in this manner. The <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> is only used on projects in which King has a direct and considerable involvement.|$|E
50|$|Under Roman law, {{usufruct}} was a type {{of personal}} servitude (servitutes personarum), a beneficial right in another's property. The usufructuary never had possession of this property (on the basis that if he possessed at all, he did so through the owner), {{but he did have}} an interest in the property itself for a period, either a term of years, or a lifetime. Unlike the owner, the usufructuary did not have a right of alienation (abusus), but he could sell or lease his usufructory interest. Even though a usufructuary did not have <b>possessory</b> <b>title,</b> he could sue for relief {{in the form of a}} modified possessory interdict (prohibiting order).|$|E

50|$|The Land Registry is {{obliged to}} notify the {{registered}} proprietor of the land that an application for <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> has been made. The registered proprietor then has 65 days to object to the registration. The objection may dispute the applicant's right to be registered as owner or, more usually, the registered proprietor will claim {{the benefit of the}} process found in paragraph 5 of Schedule 6. This provides that a registered proprietor who objects has a further two years to evict the adverse possessor. It will be enough to secure eviction within these two years that the registered proprietor relies on their registered title. No other reason need be given. Failure to secure the eviction of the adverse possessor within these two years gives the adverse possessor the right to re-apply to be registered and such a second application will be successful.|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{bill of lading}} by land or sea, or {{air waybill}} are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an [...] "order" [...] or [...] "bearer" [...] bill of lading which are <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, {{there is no need to}} present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting obiter dicta in [...] "The Rafaela S" [...] 2003 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and [...] "The Happy Ranger" [...] 2002 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.|$|E
5000|$|Special Field Orders No. 15.Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi,In the Field, Savannah, Ga., January 16, 1865.I. The islands from Charleston south, the {{abandoned}} rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles {{back from the}} sea, and the country bordering the Saint Johns River, Fla., are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts {{of war and the}} proclamation of the President of the United States.II. At Beaufort, Hilton Head, Savannah, Fernandina, Saint Augustine, and Jacksonville the blacks may remain in their chosen or accustomed vocations; but on the islands, and in the settlements hereafter to be established, no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside; and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves, subject only to the United States military authority and the acts of Congress. By the laws of war and orders of the President of the United States the negro is free, and must be dealt with as such. He cannot be subjected to conscription or forced military service, save by the written orders of the highest military authority of the Department, under such regulations as the President or Congress may prescribe; domestic servants, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other mechanics will be free to select their own work and residence, but the young and able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist as soldiers {{in the service of the}} United States, to contribute their share toward maintaining their own freedom and securing their rights as citizens of the United States. Negroes so enlisted will be organized into companies, battalions, and regiments, under the orders of the United States military authorities, and will be paid, fed, and clothed according to law. The bounties paid on enlistment may, with the consent of the recruit, go to assist his family and settlement in procuring agricultural implements, seed, tools, boats, clothing, and other articles necessary for their livelihood.III. Whenever three respectable negroes, heads of families, shall desire to settle on land, and shall have selected for that purpose an island, or a locality clearly defined within the limits above designated, the inspector of settlements and plantations will himself, or by such sub-ordinate officer as he may appoint, give them a license to settle such island or district, and afford them such assistance as he can to enable them to establish a peaceable agricultural settlement. The three parties named will subdivide the land, under the supervision of the inspector, among themselves and such others as may choose to settle near them, so that each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground, and when it borders on some water channel with not more than 800 feet water front, in the possession of which land the military authorities will afford them protection until such time as they can protect themselves or until Congress shall regulate their title. The quartermaster may, on the requisition of the inspector of settlements and plantations, place at the disposal of the inspector one or more of the captured steamers to ply between the settlements and one or more of the commercial points, heretofore named in orders, to afford the settlers the opportunity to supply their necessary wants and to sell the products of their land and labor.IV. Whenever a negro has enlisted in the military service of the United States he may locate his family in any one of the settlements at pleasure and acquire a homestead and all other rights and privileges of a settler as though present in person. In like manner negroes may settle their families and engage on board the gunboats, or in fishing, or in the navigation of the inland waters, without losing any claim to land or other advantages derived from this system. But no one, unless an actual settler as above defined, or unless absent on Government service, will be entitled to claim any right to land or property in any settlement by virtue of these orders.V. In order to carry out this system of settlement a general officer will be detailed as inspector of settlements and plantations, whose duty it shall be to visit the settlements, to regulate their police and general management, and who will furnish personally to each head of a family, subject to the approval of the President of the United States, a <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> in writing, giving as near as possible the description of boundaries, and who shall adjust all claims or conflicts that may arise under the same, subject to the like approval, treating such titles altogether as possessory. The same general officer will also be charged with the enlistment and organization of the negro recruits and protecting their interests while absent from their settlements, and will be governed by the rules and regulations prescribed by the War Department for such purpose.VI. Brig. Gen. R. Saxton is hereby appointed inspector of settlements and plantations and will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No change is intended or desired in the settlement now on Beaufort Island, nor will any rights to property heretofore acquired be affected thereby.By order of Maj. Gen. W. T. Sherman:L. N.

40|$|Possession is {{prima facie}} {{evidence}} of ownership. Possession is ninetents of the law, means that possession is good against all other, except the true owner. The possession ripens into ownership if it is qualified and by effluxion of time. In Serbian law {{there are two kinds}} of adverse possession ripens into ownership. The first one is named ordinary and second one extraordinary adverse possession. Ordinary possession need to be legal, conscientious and genuine. Extraordinary possession is only conscientious, but in a wide sense. Adverse possession destroys the title of the owner and vests it in possessor. An occupation of land inconsistent with the right of the true owner: the possession of those against whom a right action has accured to the true owner. It is actual possession in the absence of possession by the rightful owner and without lawful title. If the adverse possession continues, the effect at the expiration of the prescribed period is that not only the remedy but the title of former owner is extinguished. The person in adverse possession gains a new <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> which cannot, normally exceed in extent of duration the interest of the former owner...|$|E
40|$|Summary]: Each {{state and}} {{territory}} within Australia adopted the Torrens system of land title registration whereby a principal {{feature of the}} Torrens system {{is the notion of}} an indefeasible title affording protection to registrable interests by the act of a registered proprietor holding the land absolutely free from all encumbrances except those noted on the register. There are a number of exceptions, one of which is not usually recognised - the loss of legal title through an application for <b>possessory</b> <b>title</b> by adverse possession. Adverse possession can be legislated as either a whole parcel or a part-parcel application. Within all states in Australia problem survey areas exist where the accuracy of modern measurment techniques when applied over surveys completed pre-electronic distance measurement will raise the issue of reinstatement by mathematical solution versus occupation based upon earlier surveys. A problem survey can exist where mathematical solutions and occupation vary greatly. This paper examines the application of part-parcel adverse possession as a means to resolve problem survey areas where agreement between land owners {{is not likely to be}} achieved where land readjustment between adjoining owners is desirable to maintain an accurate cadastre...|$|E
