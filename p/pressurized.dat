5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{success of}} the <b>pressurized</b> water reactor, he wrote, was due less to any superior characteristics of water, but rather to the decision to power the prototype of the Mark I submarine thermal reactor with a <b>pressurized</b> version of the Materials Testing Reactor at Oak Ridge. Once <b>pressurized</b> water was established, other possibilities became too expensive to pursue, but Weinberg remained interested in other possibilities. According to Freeman Dyson, {{he was the only}} nuclear pioneer who supported the wide universe of reactor designs.|$|E

5|$|When workers leave a <b>pressurized</b> caisson or a {{mine that}} has been <b>pressurized</b> to keep water out, they will {{experience}} {{a significant reduction in}} ambient pressure. A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or extra-vehicular activity, where the pressure in their spacesuit is lower than the pressure in the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During {{filling process}} of vacuum counter-pressure casting, the <b>pressurizing</b> {{velocity}} {{is one of}} the most important parameters, and it affects whole filling process of molten metal and the quality of castings, the <b>pressurizing</b> velocity must be reasonably controlled and chosen. Through analyzing the <b>pressurizing</b> velocity of vacuum counter-pressure casting filling process, the results show that <b>pressurizing</b> velocity is related with absolute temperature of down kettle gas, radius of rising tube, initial volume of down kettle, height from original position of molten metal to top of rising tube and gas flux. When other conditions are same during filling process of vacuum counter-pressure casting, <b>pressurizing</b> velocity is proportional to gas flux, and it is linear. Meanwhile, through experimental verification for relationship of <b>pressurizing</b> velocity with gas flux, their actual relationships and mathematical models are obtained, and correction coefficient is determined at the range from 0. 95 to 0. 98...|$|R

5|$|Ikata is {{the site}} of Shikoku's only nuclear power plant. The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe <b>Pressurized</b> Water Reactor units with the Two Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the {{original}} Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi <b>Pressurized</b> Water Reactor unit with the Three Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using <b>pressurized</b> oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using <b>pressurized</b> nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|In <b>pressurized</b> water {{reactors}} {{a variable}} concentration of boronic acid in the cooling water {{is used to}} compensate the variable reactivity of the fuel: when new rods are inserted the concentration of boronic acid is maximal, and then reduced during the lifetime.|$|E
30|$|As was {{described}} in Chapter 4, the proposed <b>pressurizing</b> pattern and prototypes enable successful path selection in branched piping systems. Moreover, the proposed <b>pressurizing</b> pattern, which was presented in “Strategy to select a branch” section, enables precisely regulated movement of the six braided-tube device, as shown in Fig.  13. Thus, the proposed <b>pressurizing</b> pattern implemented in the device with the proposed design of the steering hook enables successful path selection in branched piping systems.|$|R

5|$|Because no ammonia was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, <b>pressurized</b> chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least , because pure water requires more energy to melt.|$|E
5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds.

5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In <b>pressurized</b> water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, the {{pipeline}} was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, and other features. The pipeline {{was designed to be}} <b>pressurized,</b> so any leak would be instantly detected by a loss of pressure at one of the pump stations, which could sound an alarm and halt the flow of oil quickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of <b>pressurized</b> tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main <b>pressurized</b> compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The breech {{refers to}} the mass of solid metal behind {{the bottom of the}} bore {{extending}} {{to the base of the}} breech and including the base ring; it also generally {{refers to the}} end of the cannon opposite the muzzle, i.e., the location where the explosion of the gunpowder begins as opposed to the opening through which the <b>pressurized</b> gas escapes.|$|E
5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the <b>pressurized</b> volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the <b>pressurized</b> volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a <b>pressurized</b> fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
