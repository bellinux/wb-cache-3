5000|$|The {{simplest}} kind of couple {{consists of}} two equal and opposite <b>forces</b> whose lines <b>of</b> action do not coincide. This is called a [...] "simple couple".

30|$|On the {{vertical}} <b>plane,</b> the line <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{expressed by the}} screw {{is at the same}} distance from the center of resistance in the two types of RPEs. However, the two-arm devices are susceptible to greater deformation as they have two fewer arms and lack the palatal support that opposes vertical deformation (Figs.  12 and 13). This deformation involves both the screw body and the retention arms and is responsible for the deterioration in the force expressed by the two-arm RPEs after the peak.|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{different}} types of nonlinear resonances in a weakly damped Duffing oscillator using bifurcation theory techniques. In addition to (i) odd subharmonic resonances found on the primary branch of symmetric periodic solutions with the forcing frequency and (ii) even subharmonic resonances due to symmetry-broken periodic solutions that bifurcate off the primary branch and also oscillate at the forcing frequency, we uncover (iii) novel resonance type due to isolas of periodic solutions that are not connected to the primary branch. These occur between odd and even resonances, oscillate at a fraction <b>of</b> the <b>forcing</b> frequency, and {{give rise to a}} complicated resonance `curve' with disconnected elements and high degree of multistability. We use bifurcation continuation to compute resonance tongues in the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the <b>forcing</b> frequency vs. the forcing amplitude for different but fixed values of the damping rate. In this way, we demonstrate that identified here isolated resonances explain the intriguing structure of "patchy tongues" observed for week damping and link it to a seemingly unrelated phenomenon of "bifurcation superstructure" described for moderate damping...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the base}} forces as {{fundamental}} variables {{to describe the}} stress state and the displacement gradients that are the conjugate variables <b>of</b> the base <b>forces</b> to describe the deformation state for the two-dimensional elasticity problems, a 4 -mid-node <b>plane</b> model <b>of</b> base <b>force</b> element method (BFEM) based on complementary energy principle is proposed.

The equilibrium conditions are released by the Lagrange multiplier method, and a modified complementary energy principle described by the base forces is obtained. The formulation of the 4 -mid-node <b>plane</b> element <b>of</b> the BFEM is derived by assuming that the stress is uniformly distributed on each edge <b>of</b> the <b>plane</b> elements.

5000|$|One {{notices that}} {{electric}} charge has radial [...] "lines of force" [...] emanating from it. In addition, magnetic poles have concentric [...] "circles of force" [...] radiating from them. One {{could make a}} two-dimensional version of this by means <b>of</b> the complex <b>plane.</b> The lines <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are <b>of</b> the formwhere k is a constant, and j ranges over all real numbers. For instance, if k is zero, then ej is a line <b>of</b> <b>force</b> that goes from zero to infinity. On the other hand, the circles <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are <b>of</b> the formwhere k is a constant, and ij ranges over all imaginary numbers. For instance, if k is zero, then eij is the unit circle. One switches {{from one to the}} other by multiplying the exponents by i. Therefore, one might associate electricity with real numbers, and magnetism with imaginary numbers. Since this is only a two-dimensional version of the idea, one would like to rework this into something that is consistent with four-dimensional spacetime, and with the transformations of special relativity.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{paper about}} {{different}} ways of revealing materials, and a theory of organization. It moves through a kaleidoscope of perspectives which reveal the tower crane as made through its relations {{with a series of}} {{different ways of}} seeing – engineering and mathematics, capitalist economics, and a workplace labour process. It employs a wide variety of sources, including some interviews that I have done with crane drivers.

The latter provides the theoretical scaffolding which allows me to see the crane as a temporary stabilisation of structure, and structure as an arrangement <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> and lines <b>of</b> <b>force</b> which allows certain moves just as it prevents others. This is a way of saying that an adequate understanding of ‘organization’ requires thinking multiples and relations.
