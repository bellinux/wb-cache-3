25|$|Transgender people {{experience}} a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression and their assigned sex. Transgender {{is also an}} umbrella term because, in addition to including trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity {{is the opposite of}} their assigned sex (and who are sometimes specifically termed transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition), it may include genderqueer people (whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine, but may, for example, be bigender, <b>pangender,</b> genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender, and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pangender</b> is a non-binary gender {{defined as}} being more than one gender. A <b>pangender</b> person may {{consider}} themselves a member of all genders. The prefix pan is Greek and means [...] "all." [...] <b>Pangender</b> {{is a kind of}} third gender, much like bigender, trigender, or genderqueer. <b>Pangender</b> individuals may identify with gender inclusive or gender neutral pronouns instead of gendered ones (such as she/he or her/him).|$|E
50|$|Genderqueer or non-binary identities, {{which are}} not {{exclusively}} masculine or feminine but instead are agender, androgynous, bigender, <b>pangender,</b> or genderfluid, exist outside of cisnormativity. Bigender and androgynous are overlapping categories; bigender individuals may identify as moving {{between male and female}} roles (genderfluid) or as being both male and female simultaneously (androgynous), and androgynes may similarly identify as beyond gender or genderless (postgender, agender), between genders (intergender), moving across genders (genderfluid), or simultaneously exhibiting multiple genders (<b>pangender).</b> Limited forms of androgyny are common (women wearing pants, men wearing earrings) and are not seen as transgender behavior. Androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex person. Genderqueer identities are independent of sexual orientation.|$|E
50|$|Some Star Trek plots {{introduce}} {{species that}} have sex, gender, or sexual identities {{outside of the}} gender binary and cisnormativity associated with humans. Agendered, monogendered, bigendered, trigendered, and <b>pangendered</b> species, each with unique or uncommon sexual reproductive methods, have been portrayed as having distinctly non-human assignment of reproductive responsibilities.|$|R
50|$|If {{a person}} {{identifies}} as transgender, this typically means they identify with a gender {{different than the}} gender they were assigned at birth. Some transgender people have binary gender identities (male or female) and some transgender people have nonbinary gender identities (genderqueer, agender, <b>pangender,</b> culturally-specific third gender identities, and more).|$|E
5000|$|Globally, most legal jurisdictions {{recognise}} the two traditional gender {{identities and}} social roles, man and woman, but tend to exclude any other gender identities, and expressions. However, {{there are some}} countries which recognize, by law, a third gender. There is now {{a greater understanding of}} the breadth of variation outside the typical categories of [...] "man" [...] and [...] "woman", and many self-descriptions are now entering the literature, including <b>pangender,</b> , genderqueer and agender. Medically and socially, the term [...] "transsexualism" [...] is being replaced with gender identity or gender dysphoria, and terms such as transgender people, trans men and trans women are replacing the category of transsexual people.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout much of {{the twentieth}} century, the term [...] "third sex" [...] was a common {{descriptor}} for homosexuals and gender nonconformists, but after the gay liberation movements of the 1970s and a growing separation of the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, the term fell out of favor among LGBT communities and the wider public. With the renewed exploration of gender that feminism, the modern transgender movement and queer theory has fostered, some in the contemporary West have begun to describe themselves as a third sex again. Other modern identities that cover similar ground include <b>pangender,</b> bigender, genderqueer, androgyne, intergender, [...] "other gender" [...] and [...] "differently gendered".|$|E
50|$|Transgender {{people are}} people who {{experience}} a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression, and their assigned sex. Transgender people are sometimes called transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another. Transgender is also an umbrella term: in addition to including people whose gender identity {{is the opposite of}} their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may include people who are not exclusively masculine or feminine (people who are genderqueer (also known as non-binary, e.g. bigender, <b>pangender,</b> genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. Infrequently, the term transgender is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity {{is the opposite}} of their assigned sex, and who form the core of the transgender umbrella, being included in even the narrowest definitions of it, several other groups are included in broader definitions of the term. These include people whose gender identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine but may, for example, be androgynous, bigender, <b>pangender,</b> or agender—often grouped under the alternative umbrella term genderqueer—and third-gender people (alternatively, some references and some societies conceptualize transgender people as a third gender). Although some references define transgender very broadly to include transvestites / cross-dressers, they are usually excluded, as are transvestic fetishists (because they are considered to be expressing a paraphilia rather than a gender identification) and drag kings and drag queens (who are performers and cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining).|$|E
5000|$|Throughout Hindu and Vedic texts {{there are}} many {{descriptions}} of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender. There are several instances in ancient Indian epic poetry of same sex depictions and unions by gods and goddesses. There are several stories of depicting love between same sexes especially among kings and queens. Kamasutra, the ancient Indian treatise on love talks about feelings for same sexes. Transsexuals are also venerated e.g. Lord Vishnu as Mohini and Lord Shiva as Ardhanarishwara (which means half woman). Homosexuality was never viewed as a crime, on the contrary, alternative sexuality formed an inalienable part of society. Apart from male and female, {{there are more than}} 20 types of genders, such as transwoman, transmen, androgynous, <b>pangender</b> and trigender etc. and in ancient India it was referred to as Trithiya prakirthi ...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{we cover}} those gender forms which fall outside the common binary {{of women and}} men. However, as we will see, {{bisecting}} the world into women and men – or, indeed, women, men, and others – {{is not necessarily a}} useful way of conceptualising things. Consequently, we have entitled this chapter ‘Further Genders’ in order to be comprehensible to readers who are unfamiliar with gender forms other than woman or man (whether trans or cisgender). Another commonly used umbrella term, which we use throughout the chapter, is non-binary. Broadly speaking, this includes people who: •	have no gender (e. g. gender neutral, non-gendered, genderless, agender, neuter, neutrois); •	incorporate aspects of both man and woman (e. g. mixed gender, sometimes <b>pangender,</b> androgynous); •	are to some extent, but not completely, one gender (e. g. demi man/boy, demi woman/girl); •	are of a specific additional gender (either between man and woman or otherwise additional to those genders, e. g. third gender, other gender, sometimes pangender); •	move between genders (e. g. bigender, gender fluid, sometimes pangender); •	move between multiple genders (e. g. trigender, sometimes pangender); •	disrupt the gender binary of women and men (e. g. genderqueer, genderfuck). As we will see, many people’s realities, whether they use this terminology or not, are something outside the strict categories of man (e. g. always wears blue, is aggressive, smokes a pipe) and woman (e. g. always wears pink, is passive, does knitting). Therefore, this chapter considers both those who explicitly identify outside the gender binary and those whose experience may be regarded as to some extent non-binary. Another point to consider here is that the terms above may well be unfamiliar to many readers precisely because this remains such an under-researched area (and, indeed, an under-represented area in wider Western culture). As we will see, the vast majority of psychological research and theory has assumed that gender is binary – often to the point of searching for differences between (two) genders. Relatively little work has challenged the categories of women and men, although there has been a fair amount of theory in some areas of other disciplines (such as Sociology, Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, and Trans Studies) questioning the gender binary: most notably queer theory. We touch upon this during the chapter while focusing upon the burgeoning body of knowledge within psychology. Of course, when we refer to ‘psychology’ here we are speaking of a minority Western model of psychology which has historically not engaged fully with global identities and experiences. Consequently, while this chapter endeavours to be broader in scope, it necessarily reflects this bias in its reporting of the literature. ...|$|E
