40|$|Abstract. Contact <b>path</b> <b>geometries</b> are curved {{geometric}} {{structures on}} a contact manifold comprising smooth families of paths {{modeled on the}} family of all isotropic lines in the projectivization of a symplectic vector space. Locally such a structure {{is equivalent to the}} graphs in the space of independent and depedent variables of the family of solutions of a system of an odd number of second order ODE’s subject to a single maximally non-integrable constraint. A subclass of contact <b>path</b> <b>geometries</b> is distinguished by the vanishing of an invariant contact torsion. For this subclass the equivalence problem is solved by constructing a normalized Cartan connection using the methods of Tanaka-Morimoto-Čap-Schichl. The geometric meaning of the contact torsion is described. If a secondary contact torsion vanishes then the locally defined space of contact paths admits a split quaternionic contact structure (analogous to the quaternionic contact structures studied by O. Biquard). 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments show how colonies of the ant Lasius niger systematically select the shorter of two paths of varying length and form between nest and foraging area, {{and do so}} with {{a large majority of}} foragers. Three different mechanisms were considered to contribute to this selection, and were evaluated by comparing mathematical models with experimental data. Bi-directional trail laying was shown to contribute much less than U-turns, where the proportion of ants that turned back depended on the <b>path's</b> <b>geometry</b> and length, and also on the trail strength. A strong modulation of the amount of pheromone deposited per ant {{as a function of the}} <b>path's</b> <b>geometry</b> was found. This modulation can also contribute to the selection of the shorter branch in the experiments where the rate of U-turns is initially the same. The selection of the path is shown to be a collective process whereby trail laying and following amplifies small initial differences in the traffic on each path caused by these three mechanisms. The foragers show no significant tendency to follow the path they used previously. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|The SARH system {{determines the}} closing {{velocity}} using the flight <b>path</b> <b>geometry</b> shown in Figure 1. The closing velocity {{is used to}} set the frequency location for the CW receive signal shown {{at the bottom of}} the diagram (spectrum). Antenna offset angle of the missile antenna is set after the target is acquired by the missile seeker using the spectrum location set using closing speed. The missile seeker antenna is a monopulse radar receiver that produces angle error measurements using that fixed position. Flight path is controlled by producing navigation input to the steering system (tail fins or gimbaled rocket) using angle errors produced by the antenna. This steers the body of the missile to hold the target near the centerline of the antenna while the antenna is held in a fixed position. The offset angle geometry is determined by flight dynamics using missile speed, target speed, and separation distance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} antecedent SPI devices is the prism containing the transparent face, mirror, and distilled water, whether the device descends into sediments like a periscope or is towed through the seabed like a plough (Cutter and Diaz 1998). Pushing anything into sediment requires displacing sand grains and replacing them with the imaging device without disturbing the neighbouring sediment layers {{that need to be}} imaged. Using a wedge to displace the sediments requires considerable structural integrity and force, which increases the size, weight, and cost of building and deploying it. A smaller wedge would, of course, reduce those requirements, but at the unacceptable cost of an extremely small sampling area (typical SPI devices image about 300 cm2). The mirror further restricts the shape of the wedge. Unless radical and expensive optics are used to alter the light <b>path</b> <b>geometry,</b> a 45° angle must be maintained between the sediment face and the plane of the camera. These restrictions dictate an SPI prism as an inclined plane (that is a triangular prism containing one right angle). Pushing the SPI prism into sediments is doing physical work, defined by the classic equation: ...|$|E

Using this framework, we give a new derivation of the Wilczynski invariants for a sys-tem of ODEs whose solution space is endowed with a conformal structure. We explain how to reconstruct the conformal structure directly from the integral curves, and present new examples of systems of ODEs with point symmetry algebra of dimension four and greater which give rise to anti–self–dual structures with conformal symmetry algebra of the same dimension. Some of these examples are (2, 2) analogues of plane wave space–times in General Relativity.

40|$|Heat and {{mechanical}} work are coupled in the {{friction stir welding}} process. The process variables are RPM, translational weld speed, and downward plunge force. The strain-temperature history of a metal element at each point on the cross-section of the weld {{is determined by the}} process variables plus the individual flow path taken by the particular filament of metal flowing around the tool and ending on flat point. The strain-temperature history determines the properties of a metal element on the weld cross-section. The strain-temperature history is carefully controlled in metal processes where direct control is feasible. Indirect estimates of the flow paths and the strain-temperature histories of filaments comprising friction stir welds can be made from a model, if the model is good enough.
