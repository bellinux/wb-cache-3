5|$|Whales have a two- to three-chambered stomach that {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Mysticetes contain a <b>proventriculus</b> {{as an extension of}} the oesophagus; this contains stones that grind up food. They also have fundic and pyloric chambers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and <b>proventriculus</b> (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E
5|$|After {{hatching}} {{the chick}} is brooded by a parent {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a <b>proventriculus</b> from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.|$|E
25|$|From there, the pharynx passes {{food to the}} esophagus, {{which could}} be just a simple tube passing {{it on to the}} crop and <b>proventriculus,</b> and then on ward to the midgut, as in most insects.

25|$|In {{birds and}} crocodilians, the stomach {{is divided into}} two regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the <b>proventriculus,</b> lined by fundic glands, and {{connecting}} the true stomach to the crop. Beyond lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} tract can mostly be traced, either because the intestines are still present {{or by the}} presence of food items. The position of the oesophagus is indicated by a five millimetre long series of small food particles. Below the ninth dorsal vertebra the location of the stomach is shown by a cluster of bones of prey animals, the organ itself likely having been dissolved by its own stomach acid shortly after death. The rather backward position of the cluster suggests the stomach was dual in structure, with a forward enzyme-secreting <b>proventriculus</b> preceding a muscular gizzard. Gastroliths have not been reported.|$|E
25|$|Many birds {{possess a}} muscular pouch along the {{esophagus}} called a crop. The crop functions to both soften food and regulate its {{flow through the}} system by storing it temporarily. The {{size and shape of}} the crop is quite variable among the birds. Members of the Columbidae family, such as pigeons, produce a nutritious crop milk which is fed to their young by regurgitation. The avian stomach is composed of two organs, the <b>proventriculus</b> and the gizzard that work together during digestion. The <b>proventriculus</b> is a rod shaped tube, which is found between the esophagus and the gizzard, that secretes hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen into the digestive tract. The acid converts the inactive pepsinogen into the active proteolytic enzyme, pepsin, which breaks down certain specific peptide bonds found in proteins, to produce a set of peptides, which are amino acid chains that are shorter than the original dietary protein. The gastric juices (hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen) are mixed with the stomach contents through the muscular contractions of the gizzard. The gizzard is composed of four muscular bands that rotate and crush food by shifting the food from one area to the next within the gizzard. The gizzard of some species of herbivorous birds, contains small pieces of grit or stone called gastroliths that are swallowed by the bird to aid in the grinding process, serving the function of teeth. The use of gizzard stones is a similarity found between birds and dinosaurs, which left gastroliths as trace fossils.|$|E
25|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus, and Crop and <b>proventriculus</b> (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut. Here, digestion starts as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E
500|$|Also ventriculus; gastric mill; gigerium. A {{specialized}} stomach organ {{found in}} the digestive tract of some birds constructed of thick muscular walls that is used for grinding up food, often aided by particles of stone or grit. Birds with gizzards swallow food and store it in their crop if necessary. Then the food passes into the secretory part of the stomach (called the glandular stomach, and sometimes the <b>proventriculus</b> or [...] "true stomach"). Food then passes into the gizzard {{where it can be}} ground with previously swallowed stones and passed back to the true stomach, and vice versa. Bird gizzards are lined with a tough layer made of a carbohydrate-protein complex called koilin, that protects the muscles in the gizzard.|$|E
500|$|After hatching, the chick, {{which is}} semi-altricial, is brooded and guarded {{for three weeks}} until it {{is large enough to}} defend and thermoregulate itself. During this period the parents feed the chick small meals when they relieve each other from duty. After the {{brooding}} period is over, the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents. The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips, providing meals that weigh around 12% of their body weight (around [...] ). The meals are composed of fresh squid, fish and krill, as well as stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a <b>proventriculus</b> from digested prey items by most Procellariiformes, and gives them their distinctive musty smell.|$|E
500|$|Storm petrels are monogamous {{and form}} {{long-term}} pair bonds that last {{a number of}} years. Studies of paternity using DNA fingerprinting have shown that, unlike many other monogamous birds, infidelity (extra-pair mating) is very rare. As with the other Procellariiformes, a single egg is laid by a pair in a breeding season; if the egg fails, then usually no attempt is made to re-lay (although it happens rarely). Both sexes incubate in shifts of up to six days. The egg hatches after 40 or 50 days; the young is brooded continuously for another 7 days or so before being left alone in the nest {{during the day and}} fed by regurgitation at night. Meals fed to the chick weigh around 10–20% of the parent's body weight, and consist of both prey items and stomach oil. Stomach oil is an energy rich (its calorific value is around 9600 calories per gram) oil created by partly digested prey {{in a part of the}} foregut known as the <b>proventriculus.</b> By partly converting prey items into stomach oil storm petrels can maximise the amount of energy chicks receive during feed, an advantage for small seabirds that can only make a single visit to the chick during a 24-hour period (at night). The average age at which chicks fledge depends on the species, taking between 50 or 70 days. The time taken to hatch and raise the young is long for the bird's size but is typical of seabirds, which in general are K-selected, living much longer, delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. The young leave there burrow at about 62 days. They are independent almost at once and quickly disperse into the ocean. They return to their original colony after 2 [...] or 3 years, but will not breed until at least 4 years old. Storm petrels have been recorded living as long as 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|... 1. Stomatodeum (foregut): This region stores, grinds and {{transports}} {{food to the}} next region. Included in this are the buccal cavity, the pharynx, the oesophagus, the crop (stores food), and <b>proventriculus</b> or gizzard (grinds food). Salivary secretions from the labial glands dilute the ingested food. In mosquitoes (Diptera), which are blood-feeding insects, anticoagulants and blood thinners are also released here.|$|E
2500|$|The feed is {{administered}} using a funnel {{fitted with a}} long tube (20–30cm long), which forces the feed into the bird's esophagus. [...] If an auger is used, the feeding takes about 45 to 60 seconds, however, modern systems usually use a tube fed by a pneumatic pump with an operation time of 2 to 3 seconds per duck. During feeding, efforts are made to avoid damaging the bird's esophagus, which could cause injury or death, although researchers have found evidence of inflammation of {{the walls of the}} <b>proventriculus</b> after the first session of force-feeding. There is also indication of inflammation of the esophagus in the later stages of fattening. Several studies have also demonstrated that mortality rates can be significantly elevated during the gavage period.|$|E
2500|$|Short-tailed {{albatrosses}} are {{a type of}} albatross {{that belong}} to the family Diomedeidae, [...] order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the albatross are {{on the sides of}} the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the <b>proventriculus.</b> This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland which is situated above the nasal passage helping desalinate their bodies, as an adaptation to the high amount of ocean water they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose. Going back in time, fossils of albatrosses from the mid-Pleistocene in Bermuda and North Carolina are considered to be closest to the short-tailed albatross.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>proventriculus</b> is a {{standard}} part of avian anatomy, and is a rod shaped organ, located between the Oesophagus and the Ventriculus of most birds. [...] It is generally a glandular part of the stomach that may store and/or commence digestion of food before it progresses to the gizzard. The primary function of the <b>Proventriculus</b> is to secrete Hydrochloric acid and Pepsinogen into the digestive compartments that will churn the ingested material through muscular mechanisms. Pepsinogen produces pepsin, which breaks the peptide bonds found in amino acids. The muscle contractions of the Gizzard push material back into the <b>Proventriculus,</b> which then contracts to mix materials between the stomach compartments.  This transfer of digested material can occur up to 4 times per minute, and the compartments can hold the stomach contents for thirty minutes to an hour.|$|E

50|$|Mangrove {{horseshoe}} crabs are selective benthic feeders, feeding {{mainly on}} insect larvae, small fish, oligochaetes, small crabs and thin-shelled bivalves.

The ingested food then enters the cuticle-lined oesophagus and then the <b>proventriculus.</b> The <b>proventriculus</b> {{is made up of}} a 'crop' and a 'gizzard'. The crop can expand to fit the ingested food, while the gizzard grinds the food into a 'pulp'.

5000|$|The hemin {{storage system}} plays an {{important}} role in the transmission of Y. pestis back to a mammalian host. While in the insect vector, proteins encoded by hemin storage system genetic loci induce biofilm formation in the <b>proventriculus,</b> a valve connecting the midgut to the esophagus. Aggregation in the biofilm inhibits feeding, as a mass of clotted blood and bacteria forms (referred to as [...] "Bacot's block"). Transmission of Y. pestis occurs during the futile attempts of the flea to feed. Ingested blood is pumped into the esophagus, where it dislodges bacteria lodged in the <b>proventriculus</b> and is regurgitated back into the host circulatory system.|$|E
