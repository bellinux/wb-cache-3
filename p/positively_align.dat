40|$|Abstract: We {{identify}} a firm’s growth type by its valuation volatility which proxies for {{the extent to}} which asymmetric information arises from growth opportunities rather than from assets-in-place. We show that firm investment style (measured by R&D/[Capex+R&D]) is persistent and <b>positively</b> <b>aligned</b> with growth type. The sensitivity of investment to cash flow has a monotonic negative relationship with growth type. Additionally, the sensitivity of equity-and-debt-financing-differential to market conditions increases with investment style, reflecting a growth-type-aligned pecking order in financing. These findings demonstrate that firms invest and seek financing in a manner compatible with their growth type. This suggests that informational imperfections do not necessarily impose financing constraints on firms listed on well-functioning capital markets...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the strength of an employee's identification with an organization guides and constrains that employee's decision making. Cheney (1983) states that organizational policies actually affect the development of identification [...] "in terms of what is communicated to the employee" [...] (361). Employees can only identify with those things that they are aware of, {{and many of the}} things they are aware of and how they understand those things are communicated to them by the organization in a particular way. [...] "Organizational identification guides behavior by influencing which problems and alternatives are seen and by biasing choices that appear most salient to organizational success" [...] (Kassing, 1997). Organizations can choose to emphasize particular problems and alternatives through communicated goals and values, causing employees to identify mainly with those communicated goals and values. This then limits their choices and constrains their decision-making {{in a way that is}} <b>positively</b> <b>aligned</b> with the organization's goals and values.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{patterns of}} time use among regional and rural adolescent girls and compare identified clusters {{with respect to}} correlates of physical activity (PA) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). DESIGN: Cross-sectional PA and lifestyle survey. METHODS: Data were from Year 7 - 9 adolescent girls (aged 12 - 15 years) from 16 schools involved in a cluster-randomised trial in regional and rural Victoria, Australia (n= 494). Time use data were collected using 24 -h Previous Day Physical Activity Recall (PDPAR- 24) questionnaire, collapsed into 17 categories of time use. Differences between time use clusters with regard to demographics, correlates of PA and HRQoL measured using PedsQL 4. 0 Generic Core Scales, were investigated. RESULTS: Two time use clusters were identified and were associated with correlates of PA and HRQoL. Girls who spent significantly more time in teams sports, non-team sports, school classes, watching TV and sleeping had higher levels of <b>positively</b> <b>aligned</b> PA correlates (e. g. self-efficacy, perceived sports competence) and HRQoL than girls characterised {{with high levels of}} computer use and video gaming. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight how different activity patterns of regional and rural girls affect HRQoL and can inform future intervention strategies to improve PA levels and HRQoL. Clusters characterised by low levels of PA and high computer use and video gaming require targeted interventions to address barriers to their participation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCollective action through farmer {{groups has}} contributed widely to {{improved}} rural welfare through more effective utilization of {{resources such as}} labour, knowledge and influence. The identification of characteristics of farmer groups that are successful today helps develop tomorrow’s effective groups. This case study examines characteristics associated {{with the success of}} community seed production groups in multiplying and disseminating high-yielding maize seed in Timor-Leste. Previous research from Timor-Leste indicates that the likelihood of an individual adopting a new variety is strongly related to the closeness of social relationships with growers already using that variety. This research explored the hypothesis that social capital, that is social relationships within a farmer group, can be leveraged for development through seed production groups. The groups were established in 2011 for seed production as part of the National Seed System for Released Varieties primarily through previously existing farmer groups. After 2  years, in 2013, a survey was conducted on 30 seed production groups. Successful groups produced sufficient seed for multiplication at a larger scale the following year, as well as surplus seed for distribution to group members or for sale. Several characteristics were correlated with the quantity of shared seed distributed to individual group members, as a measure of group effectiveness: meeting frequency, with r of 0. 69; the number of positive leadership traits, with r of 0. 57; the level of group trust, with r of 0. 51; and the number of defined management roles within the group, with r of 0. 41. These traits all reflect the strength of social capital and group governance. We conclude that development can be furthered through <b>positively</b> <b>aligning</b> and leveraging existing social capital among farmers for technology dissemination...|$|R

40|$|Using a composite-face paradigm, we {{show that}} social {{judgments}} from faces rely on holistic processing. Participants judged facial halves more <b>positively</b> when <b>aligned</b> with trustworthy than with untrustworthy halves, despite instructions to ignore the aligned parts (experiment 1). This effect was substantially reduced when the faces were inverted (experiments 2 and 3) and when the halves were misaligned (experiment 3). In all three experiments, judgments were affected to a larger extent by the to-be-attended than the to-be-ignored halves, suggesting that there is partial control of holistic processing. However, after rapid exposures to faces (33 to 100 ms), judgments of trustworthy and untrustworthy halves aligned with incongruent halves were indistinguishable (experiment 4 a). Differences emerged with exposures longer than 100 ms. In contrast, when participants were not instructed to attend to specific facial parts, these differences did not emerge (experiment 4 b).

The bicelles consisted of mixtures of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), and dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) in the molar ratios q = [100 DMPC + 5 DMPG]/[DHPC] = 3. 5, 4. 5, and 5. 5, to which Yb 3 + had been added in the ratio 1 : 75 Yb 3 +/phospholipid. The field gradients were applied such that diffusion was measured in the direction parallel to the normal to the bicelles' planar regions, thereby rendering the experiment sensitive {{to the ability of}} PEG to traverse lamellar defects within the bicelles. The pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance diffusive intensity decays were diffusion-time-independent in all cases, with diffusive displacements corresponding to many hundreds of bicellar lamellae. This permitted a description of such diffusive decays in terms of a mean behavior involving a combination of straight obstruction effects common to all PEG, with hindrance to diffusion proportional to the relative size of a given PEG with respect {{to the size of the}} lamellar defects. Across the range of PEG molecular weights (200 – 4600) and bicelle compositions examined, the apparent radial dimension of the lamellar defects decreased from 165 Å with q = 3. 5 to 125 Å with q = 5. 5. This is opposite to the trend predicted from static geometric models of either bicelle disks or perforated lamellae. Qualitatively, the observed trend suggests that mobility of the obstructions to diffusion will need to be considered to reconcile these differences...|$|R

Secondly, it is hypothesized that CRM performance is additionally and positively influenced by integrating four CRM areas: CRM strategy, customer insight, customer contact, and marketing. This twofold hypothesis is tested empirically using data from thirty questionnaires that were completed by {{an equal number of}} Dutch marketing, sales and account managers. All respondents had experience with the concept of CRM and represented a large variety of organizations according to size and sector.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} cross-cultural differences in facework between English and German conversation. Specifically, the research addresses facework occurring as {{part and parcel of}} sociable conversation, as it is played out within moments of focused topic development - what I term 'sociable episodes'. Drawing on extant literature, the study identifies a range of communicative parameters along which English and German communicative style has been shown to differ, non more so than those suggesting different facework norms, and orientation to face needs as opposed to such things as ideational aspects of talk. In an attempt to address these differences, the study develops a model of facework - facework as alignment -which is posited as being appropriate to the study of essentially apolite conversational interaction. Further, although utilising the notions of ritual equilibrium (Goffman 1967) and positive - negative aspects of face (Brown and Levinson), the posited model of facework focuses specifically on aspects of sociable selfhood informing sociable conversation. It is argued that facework in sociable episodes is a matter of positive and negative alignment of sociable selves in and through the claiming of solidarity with and autonomy from other co-participants in terms of expressions of definitions, evaluations, experiences. In terms of English - German differences, these are demonstrated {{to be a matter of}} alignment of different sociable selves, ones normatively and routinely <b>positively</b> and negatively <b>aligned</b> in the achievement of sociable conversation, and ones indexing prevailing but culturally differing positive social values (Goffman 1967). The study concludes by identifying areas for future research based on the facework as alignment model developed and applied throughout the thesis.

This cross-sectional study was conducted tounderstand various types of pornographic exposures, effects of pornographic exposure, and factors influence the effect. Study was conducted at five state junior high schools in Pontianak District in 2008 with 395 respondents from December 2007 to January 2008. The result shows that 83. 3 % adolescence has exposed to pornography and 79. 5 % of them had experienced the effects of pornographic exposure. 19. 8 % respondent who experienced the effects of pornography was in the addiction stage. 69. 2 % respondent of those in addiction stage was in escalation stage. 61. 1 % respondent of escalation stage was in desensitization stage, and 31. 8 % respondent of desensitization was in act-out stage.

40|$|Advances in the {{synthesis}} of materials and device structures have accentuated the need to understand nanoscale electronic structure and its implications. Scanning probe microscopy offers a rich variety of highly spatially accurate techniques that can further {{our understanding of the}} interactions that occur in nanoscale semiconductor materials and devices. The promising nitride semiconductor materials system suffers from perturbations in local electronic structure due to crystallographic defects. Understanding the electronic properties and physical origin of these defects can be invaluable in mitigating their impacts or eliminating them all together. In the second chapter of this dissertation, scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) is used to characterize local electronic structure in a-plane n-type gallium nitride. Analysis reveals the presence of a linear, <b>positively</b> charged feature <b>aligned</b> along the direction which likely corresponds to a partial dislocation {{at the edge of a}} stacking fault. In the third chapter, conductive atomic force microscopy is used to determine the effects of Ga/N flux on the conductive behavior of reverse-bias leakage paths in gallium nitride grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Our data reveal a band of fluxes near Ga/N ̃ ̃ 1 for which these pathways cease to be observable. These observations suggest a method for controlling the primary source of reverse-bias Schottky contact leakage in n-type GaN grown by MBE. A deeper understanding of the interaction between macro-scale objects and nanoscale electronic properties is required to bring the exciting new possibilities that semiconductor nanowires offer to fruition. In the fourth chapter, SCM is used to examine the effects of micron-scale metal contacts on carrier modulation and electrostatic behavior in indium arsenide semiconductor nanowires. We interpret a pronounced dependence of capacitance spectra on distance between the probe tip and nanowire contact as a consequence of electrostatic screening of the tip-nanowire potential difference by the large metal contact. These results provide direct experimental verification of contact screening effects on the electronic behavior of nanowire devices and are indicative of the importance of accounting for the effect of large-scale contact and circuit elements on the characteristics of nanoscale electronic device...|$|R

Kaupapa Māori approaches frame the research and because of this Māori knowledge and interests in the repository project are privileged. Kaupapa Māori has also supported a robust, iterative and collaborative research practice that allowed me to establish effective engagement and participation with potential repository partners. Together, we have explored the scope of our experiences, approaches, concerns and aspirations for the project. The construction of Te Rua focused on the preferred forms of audience engagement with mātauranga Māori. My Māori research partners’ recommendations are supported by my research into current digital media platforms and tools associated with indigenous content and cultural heritage projects. As a supplement to the modeled repository Te Rua, this research project has produced a set of guidelines for the design of a more permanent digital repository. The guidelines charge institutions such as Unitec with the responsibility of upholding the taonga status of mātauranga Māori. The guidelines also reflect the overarching design goal of an online repository that ensures audience access and engagement is <b>positively</b> encouraged and <b>aligns</b> with the tikanga of the marae. Key questions I explored within this project are: what are the implications for storing taonga and mātauranga Māori within digital spaces; what are the cultural practices, values and concerns that guide the research; and how might Māori processes of engagement with and on marae be transposed to a digital space?

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This study {{explores the}} {{stakeholder}} perceptions of factors affecting the Christian ethos of two Christian schools in Australia, {{one of which}} is a church-based school and the other, a parent-controlled school. The research arose from the literature and general concerns in the Christian community about the perceived secular drift of Christian educational organisations. The intention of the research was to determine and systematically describe which factors improve, and which detract from the Christian ethos of a Christian school. Consideration was given to the following factors: The role of the Bible in pedagogy; legislation; school history; existing culture; documentation; the correlation between the principal and the school ethos; the Board; staff; students; chapel services; Christian studies classes; indoctrination; parental influence; the Church’s role both locally and globally; geographic location; social media; and, other societal effects. These factors allowed the development of a rudimentary model of the Christian ethos, which, after analysis, was refined to better reflect the interaction between factors. The study used qualitative case study methodology and combined documentary evidence, interviews, focus groups and selected observations to build its evidence base. The background literature being so expansive, and covering such a broad range of topics, was by necessity limited to aspects which were considered to be the most likely factors which would influence the Christian ethos of Christian schools. The decision to include or exclude concepts or factors was primarily based upon research completed by Benne (2001) and Burtchaell (1998). By way of declaration, part of this was also influenced by my extensive experience as a senior teacher in Christian schools. The study found that Christian ethos was the defining cultural force in the two case study schools. The evidence points to the synthesis of the two key elements within a school community – the student body and the teaching staff – as essential to raising and maintaining the Christian ethos of Christian schools. The principal, administrative staff, school Board and parents also have crucial input into the Christian ethos of the case study schools with some having more influence than others in relation to a particular school. Other factors, such as the school’s geographic location, documentary records, socio-economic profiles of families, and quantity of churches in the local area were also found to have potential impacts on the Christian ethos of Christian schools. The study found that the most significant influence on the Christian ethos occurred through relational and interpersonal factors, and the overarching impact of the Bible. Several findings were significant and endemic to both the church-based and parent-controlled Christian schools. There was an absence of religious indoctrination within classroom settings where biblical concepts were espoused. In contrast there was an indication that cultural indoctrination occurred when the factors pertinent to this study were seen to <b>align</b> <b>positively.</b> The assumption that discord might occur where multiple denominations existed within the same staff was found to be false. Indeed, contrary to this view, it was found that a multidenominational staff mix positively contributed to the Christian ethos. The notion that all aspects could be defined in polarized, black and white terms, where certain factors would be found to cause an improvement in the Christian ethos while other factors would hasten a decline, was not supported by the evidence. The majority of factors were able to influence the Christian ethos in positive or negative terms, with some factors having no discernible impact. Finally, the development of a ‘Christian ethos egg model’ and the prioritising of critical factors should prove beneficial to future studies on the Christian ethos of Christian schools...|$|R
