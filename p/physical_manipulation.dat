5|$|Campaigns in From Dust are {{structured}} as {{a sequence of}} missions, whereby completing certain objectives expedites the tribe's progress and bestows additional powers, such as the capacity to jellify water. Tribal shamans alert the player to natural disasters, notably tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, shortly before they occur. These disasters can be inhibited through creative, <b>physical</b> <b>manipulation</b> of the environment: a tsunami can be jellified, wildfires extinguished, and lava flows diverted. Although there is no 'explicit sandbox' mode, Chahi stated that each mission features a distinct map, which the player can return to and manipulate further.|$|E
25|$|During {{the occult}} {{revival of the}} early 19th century, alchemy {{received}} new attention as an occult science. The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) {{the view that the}} substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience. This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the <b>physical</b> <b>manipulation</b> of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.|$|E

Over the course of the war against Amon, he was able to rise above his worker origins, serving as an {{important}} part of the war effort. Karax is shorter and stockier than most protoss. The armor he wears also differs in that it is more functional than ceremonial. Karax was among the Golden Armada when it assaulted Aiur. After Amon forced the protoss into retreat, he guided Hierarch Artanis through the Spear of Adun, explaining its systems, and how he had given orders for the Templar in stasis to have their nerve cords removed, as per Amon's corruption of the Khala.

40|$|Orthotic {{therapy is}} {{frequently}} advocated {{for the treatment}} Of musculoskeletal pain and injury of the lower limb. The clinical efficacy, mechanical effects, and Underlying mechanism of the action of foot orthotics has not been Conclusively determined {{making it difficult for}} practitioners to agree on a reliable and valid clinical approach to their application and indeed even their fabrication. This problem is compounded by evidence suggesting that the most commonly used approach for orthotic prescription, the (Biomechanical Evaluation of the Foot. Vol. 1. Clinical Biomechanics Corporation, Los Angeles, 1971) approach, has poor validity and many of the associated clinical measurements of that approach lack adequate levels of reliability. This paper proposes a new approach that is based on two key elements. One is the identification, verification and quantification of physical tasks that serve as client specific outcome measures. The second is the application of specific <b>physical</b> <b>manipulations</b> during the performance of these physical tasks. The <b>physical</b> <b>manipulations</b> are {{selected on the basis of}} motion dysfunction and their immediate effects on the client specific outcome measures serve as the basis to making an informed decision on the propriety of using orthotics in individual clients. The motion dysfunction also guides the type of orthotic that is applied. Practical case examples as well Lis generic and specific guidelines to the application of this clinical assessment process and orthotics are provided in this paper.

Introduction of reciprocation (dependent upon circle inversion) is what produces the peculiar nature of Möbius geometry, which is sometimes identified with inversive geometry (of the Euclidean plane). However, inversive geometry is the larger study since {{it includes the}} raw inversion in a circle (not yet made, with conjugation, into reciprocation). Inversive geometry also includes the conjugation mapping. Neither conjugation nor inversion-in-a-circle are in the Möbius group since they are non-conformal (see below). Möbius group elements are analytic functions of the whole plane and so are necessarily conformal.|$|R

Two avenues are proposed for investigation: reversible single-crystal to single-crystal electronic transformations and solid-state spin transfer within spin-crossover complexes. Both schemes allow computation to occur in three dimensions, within cheap and easy to assemble materials and using commonplace techniques for input and readout...|$|R
