25|$|The {{plant was}} searched {{a second time}} by a British patrol. As the {{soldiers}} <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> the doors, an Irgun guard inside heard them and escaped through a back window. The soldiers heard him and conducted a painstaking search of the plant, but failed to find the hatch.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of Japanese {{interior}} walls are often made of shōji screens that can be <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> to join two rooms together, and then close them allowing more privacy. The shōji screens are made of paper attached to thin wooden frames that roll away on a track when they are pushed. Another important feature of the shōji screen, besides privacy and seclusion, is that they allow light through. This is an important aspect to Japanese design. Paper translucent walls allow light to be diffused through the space and create light shadows and patterns.|$|E
25|$|A {{wastegate}} {{regulates the}} {{exhaust gas flow}} that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and therefore the air intake into the manifold {{and the degree of}} boosting. It can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted, generally vacuum hose attachment point diaphragm (for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system) to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the overboost point is sensed by the ecu or a solenoid operated by the engine’s electronic control unit or a boost controller, but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose attachment point spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be <b>pushed</b> <b>open,</b> thus limiting overboost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the wastegate.|$|E

25|$|Inward opening {{doors are}} doors {{that can only}} be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a {{substantial}} fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> outwards {{in the event of an}} emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.|$|E
500|$|During February and March, Yagan was {{involved}} in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February William Watson complained that Yagan had <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> his door, demanded a gun, and taken handkerchiefs. Watson had to give him and his companions flour and bread. The following month, Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear. Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson's house while he was away. The group left after Watson's wife called on neighbours for help. The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour. The frequent incidents prompted The Perth Gazette to remark on [...] "the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin's fee... For the most trivial offence ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. He is at the head and front of any mischief." ...|$|E
500|$|Treatment of an MI is time critical. Aspirin is an {{appropriate}} immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids {{may be used to}} help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In a STEMI, treatments attempt to restore blood flow to the heart, and include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where the arteries are <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> and may be stented, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use of PCI in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty. [...] After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.|$|E

2500|$|Milligan and Harry Secombe {{became friends}} while {{serving in the}} Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first {{encountered}} Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe {{was sitting in a}} small wireless truck: [...] "Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, {{and in the middle of}} it all the flap of the truck was <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody see a gun?' It was Milligan." [...] Secombe's answer to that question was [...] "What colour was it?" [...] Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.|$|E
2500|$|First, {{the dog is}} rotated {{forward to}} the [...] "safe" [...] position, and the priming pan <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> (if it is not already so). After loading a powder charge and ball through the muzzle in the usual way, the {{operator}} takes his [...] "spanner", slips {{it on to the}} square section of the wheel shaft, and turns it until a click is heard (about one half to three-quarters of a revolution), and the wheel is felt to lock in place, whereupon the spanner is withdrawn. What occurs is that when the wheel is turned, the mainspring is tensioned via the chain, which is wound partially around the shaft. The click is the sound of one end of the sear engaging in the blind hole {{on the inside of the}} wheel, as described above, thus immobilising it.|$|E
2500|$|Most PCCs {{employed}} three pedals {{with a dead}} man's {{switch to}} the left, brake in center, and power pedal on the right. [...] Depressing the brake about half way and then releasing the deadman pedal put the PCC in [...] "park". [...] Lifting the deadman alone would apply all brakes, drop sand, and balance the doors {{so they could be}} <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> easily. [...] Chicago used [...] "bicycle-type levers" [...] for power and brake but converted some cars to two pedals. St. Louis Public Service Co. (SLPS) [...] used two pedals, both with heel interlocks. [...] The right pedal is the brake; depressing this pedal about half way while lifting away from the heel applied [...] "park". [...] Once the brake is released the heel need not be engaged with the interlock [...] (although a professional driver is to cover the brake at all times.) [...] The left pedal applied the power and the heel interlock had to be engaged at all times since it was the deadman; only when the brake was in [...] "park" [...] could the deadman be disengaged.|$|E

2500|$|Lock {{screen is}} the {{simplest}} way to prevent unauthorized access your computer. [...] Since it is standard on most computers, it costs no extra memory or financial expense, but secures your computer so securely the FBI finds it difficult to gain access, let alone ordinary people. [...] Trying to control privacy and maintain parental controls within the computer without screen lock is like leaving the exterior doors of your house unlocked or wide open, relying on small locks on cabinets, drawers, closets, interior doors, (etc.), which your teenager or other intruder can lock-pick open at leisure away from the public view. Lock screen is actually more secure than common safeguards in life, such as locking your car so your child won't have a car accident which won't do any good if the child finds your keys, or a house-key while there are windows that can be smashed or <b>pushed</b> <b>open</b> for entry. If you do discover that the lock screen is not effective, then it is a certainty that you need to change your password to something less predictable, which is easily done, far easier than re-keying a car key or changing the combination of a physical lock.|$|E
