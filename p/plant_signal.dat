These mutants enforced the idea that plant root endosymbioses with bacteria and fungi share a common genetic basis. Because arbuscular mycorrhiza {{dates back to the}} first land plant and the root nodule symbiosis is much younger, this common gene set revealed that the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis evolved by co-opting genes from the existing arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. By map-based identification of so-called “common symbiosis genes”, the Parniske lab contributed to the identification of several components directly or indirectly involved in a <b>plant</b> <b>signal</b> transduction process required for both symbioses. These include a receptor-like kinase, nucleoporins, potassium channels required for nuclear calcium oscillations and a nuclear localized complex comprising a calcium-and-calmodulin dependent protein kinase and its phosphorylation target CYCLOPS, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator. The discovery of these genes and the postulated signal transduction processes had a major impact on this research field. The Parniske lab discovered that CYCLOPS is an interactor and phosphorylation substrate of the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CCaMK. Moreover, the role of CYCLOPS, initially annotated as a protein with unknown function, was {{identified a}}s a DNA-binding transcriptional activator. Research in the Parniske lab clarified the role of the CCaMK/CYCLOPS complex as a major regulatory hub in symbiotic signal transduction.|$|E

Two fo the vir genes, virA and virG, belonging to the bacterial two-component regulatory system family, control the induction of vir genes by plant signals. virA encodes a membrane-bound sensor kinase protein and virG encodes a cytoplasmic regulator protein. Although it is well established from in vitro studies that the signal transduction process involves VirA autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphate transfer to VirG, the structural state of the VirA protein involved in signal transduction is not understood. In this communication, we describe an in vivo crosslinking approach which provides physical evidence that VirA exists as a homodimer in its native configuration. The dimerization of VirA neither requires nor is stimulated by the <b>plant</b> <b>signal</b> molecule acetosyringone. We also present genetic data which support the hypothesis that VirA exists as a homodimer which is the functional state transducing the <b>plant</b> <b>signal</b> in an intersubunit mechanism.

We have found that Clr positively controls the synthesis of cAMP-dependent succinoglycan as well as the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of a so-far unknown polysaccharide compound. In addition, Clr activated expression of 24 genes of unknown function in addition to smc 02178. Genes negatively controlled by Clr were mainly involved in swimming motility and chemotaxis. Functional characterization of two novel Clr-activated genes of unknown function, smb 20495 and smc 02177, showed that their expression was activated by the same <b>plant</b> <b>signal</b> as smc 02178 ex planta.

To establish tightness in this context, the proof is less direct because the point at which to verify optimality conditions is not known explicitly. Angular synchronization consists in estimating a collection of $n$ phases, given noisy measurements of the pairwise relative phases. The MLE for angular synchronization is the solution of a (hard) non-bipartite Grothendieck problem over the complex numbers. We consider a stochastic model for the data: a <b>planted</b> <b>signal</b> (that is, a ground truth set of phases) is corrupted with non-adversarial random noise.
