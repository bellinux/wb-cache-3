The Staffordshire Moorlands <b>Pan</b> <b>is</b> a second-century Romano-British trulla apparently decorated as a souvenir for a soldier who had served on Hadrian's Wall, and probably made locally.

5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E

Plastic gold pans resist rust, acid and corrosion, and most are designed with moulded riffles along {{one side of the}} pan.

25|$|<b>Pan</b> <b>is</b> a 2015 American family fantasy film {{directed}} by Joe Wright and written by Jason Fuchs. The {{film is a}} prequel story to Scottish author J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan story, first staged in 1904. It stars Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara and Amanda Seyfried, with Levi Miller as the title character. It serves as an alternative origin story for Peter Pan and Captain Hook. The film had its world premiere in London, England on September 20, 2015, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 9, 2015, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Pan grossed $128.4 million on a $150 million budget, resulting in losses for Warner Brothers, and received generally negative reviews, with criticism leveled at its formulaic plot and computer-generated action.|$|E

During the wet season 35-75,000 zebra and wildebeest migrate into the area with regular sightings of lion, cheetah and other predators who follow in their wake. The zebra and wildebeest migration across the <b>pans</b> <b>is</b> southern Africa’s last surviving zebra and wildebeest migration and the second largest in the world.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} supreme god of the lofty sanctuary, other gods were {{evidenced}} to have been worshipped in the area. The god <b>Pan</b> <b>is</b> often connected with {{the headwaters of the}} Jordan river in the area. Inscriptions on stones used in the church of Heleliye near Sidon have referred to Threption, son of Neikon offering stone lions to Zeus. Other deities noted to have been worshipped in the area were called Theandrios and Leucothea, which were likely Greek names substituted for native Caananite gods. Leucothea was the Greek goddess of the sea and she was known to have been worshipped from 60 CE at the temple devoted to her at Rakleh and also at Kfar Zabad, Inkhil, Tel Jezreel, Tyre and Segeria as evidenced by an inscription found at Ayn al-Burj.|$|E
25|$|Carbon steel {{cookware}} can {{be rolled}} or hammered into relatively thin sheets of dense material, which provides robust strength and improved heat distribution. Carbon steel accommodates high, dry heat for such operations as dry searing. Carbon steel does not conduct heat efficiently, {{but this may}} be an advantage for larger vessels, such as woks and paella pans, where one portion of the <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> intentionally kept at a different temperature than the rest. Like cast iron, carbon steel must be seasoned before use, usually by rubbing a fat or oil on the cooking surface and heating the cookware on the stovetop or in the oven. With proper use and care, seasoning oils polymerize on carbon steel to form a low-tack surface, well-suited to browning, Maillard reactions and easy release of fried foods. Carbon steel will easily rust if not seasoned and should be stored seasoned to avoid rusting. Carbon steel is traditionally used for crêpe and fry pans, as well as woks.|$|E

500|$|Mary Shelley's gender {{concerns}} did not cease with generic issues. In {{the musical}} contest between Apollo and Pan {{in the first}} act, Apollo is associated with masculine characteristics, such as philosophy, science, and reason, and <b>Pan</b> <b>is</b> associated with feminine characteristics, such as sheep and nature. however, as Purinton notes, [...] "both sing egocentric lyrics that boast of their 'instruments' and their deeds". When Apollo wins, the play appears to celebrate [...] "male superiority". However, Pan appeals the decision to King Midas, who reverses the decision in Pan's favour, {{for which he is}} then punished. Purinton argues that the play therefore breaks down traditional gender distinctions, portraying characters with mixed gender signals. In this way, she writes, [...] "as cross-dressed dramaturgy, then, Midas is a comedy about women's issues played out on male bodies". For her, the play dramatizes the problems with the nineteenth-century ideology of separate spheres, where women were expected to remain in the private, domestic sphere and men were expected to participate in the political, public sphere.|$|E
