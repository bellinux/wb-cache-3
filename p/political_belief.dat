These gentlemen vied {{with each other in}} sending her advance-sheets of their boots, and numerous articles, letters, and pamphlets to meet the question of the day, which she swiftly translated, publishing them without money and without price, in the daily journals, and through the avenues afforded by the Union League Club. In return, she kept these noble Frenchmen accurately informed of the progress of events, and sent them such publications as could be of service.|$|E
500|$|Differences {{between the}} Glorious Revolution in Scotland and England {{stemmed from the}} impact of the 1638-51 Civil Wars and 1660 Restoration. In the 17th century, {{religion}} and political principles were closely linked and disputes that seem minor today caused huge dislocation and damage. Between 1524 - 1648, the European Wars of Religion killed an estimated 30% of the European population; the English Civil Wars caused casualties proportionally higher {{as a percentage of the}} population than those of the 1914-18 World War. This background is why apparently minor differences in religious practice and <b>political</b> <b>belief</b> caused such intense conflict in 1689.|$|E

500|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the journal Post Script, Andrew Scahill wrote {{about the power of}} {{children}} in rhetoric to create an untenable stance for an opposing viewpoint. According to Scahill, an individual arguing [...] "for the children" [...] makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to hold a [...] "not for the children" [...] position. Cassandra Wilkinson discussed the impact of [...] "think of the children" [...] rhetoric in a 2011 article for IPA Review. Wilkinson cited research by No Fear: Growing Up in a Risk-Averse Society author Tim Gill that hypersensitivity in defending children from potential harm has the adverse effect of contributing to the inability of youth to own their choices and react to dangerous situations. In the New Statesman, Laurie Penny characterized the tactic as a <b>political</b> <b>belief</b> system and called it [...] "think-of-the-children-ism".|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{new laws}} were passed, {{which made it}} {{impossible}} for Armenians to establish new foundations nor to buy or bequeath additional properties. One such law code (Law no. 903) adopted in 1967, along with a second paragraph amended to the Turkish Civil Code (no. 743) declared that, [...] "The registration of foundations that are in violation of law, morality, tradition or national interests, or that were established to support a <b>political</b> <b>belief,</b> a certain race or members of a minority will not be approved." [...] Such laws are considered by legal experts as a violation of articles concerning minority rights found in the Treaty of Laussane, the Turkish constitution, and Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which grants the [...] "freedom to establish foundations and hold meetings." [...] The new amendment and law code became the basis for a new series of confiscations that significantly obstructed the daily lives of Armenians in Turkey.|$|E

The San Francisco Chronicle argued that <b>political</b> <b>belief</b> should not exempt activists from criminal law:"Terrorism goes far beyond the expression of <b>political</b> <b>belief.</b> And dealing with it {{does not allow for}} compromise as many countries of Western Europe and United States have learned. The bombing of bars, hotels, restaurants, robbing of banks, abductions, and killings of prominent figures are all criminal acts and must be dealt with by criminal law." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arlott spoke passionately {{against the}} motion stating that [...] "It is {{political}} commitment and <b>political</b> <b>belief</b> {{that can make}} a man think that his opponent's views are so obnoxious that he will abstain from playing any game with him as a protest against what the other man believes. Any man's political commitment, if it is deep enough, is his very personal philosophy and it governs his whole way of life, it governs his belief, and it certainly governs the people with whom he is prepared to mix." [...] The motion was duly defeated by 334–160. Despite their opposing positions over the issue, Arlott was drinking with Wooller in the Cambridge Union Bar shortly after the debate had finished.|$|E
2500|$|In public {{speeches and}} {{policies}} that he formulated, Zia began expounding [...] "Bangladesh Nationalism", its [...] "Sovereignty", as opposed to Mujib's assertion of a Bengali identity based under language- based nationalism. Zia emphasised the national role of Islam as guide to life's principle. Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Zia reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the Santals, Garos, Manipuris and Chakmas, {{as well as the}} Urdu-speaking peoples of Bihari origin. He even amended the constitution to change the nationality of the citizens from Bengali, an ethnic identity, to Bangladeshi, a national identity, under sovereign allegiance not <b>political</b> <b>belief</b> or party affiliation. However, Bangladeshi nationalism excluded the country's non-Muslim minorities, particularly the Hindu community.|$|E

2500|$|Black {{also held}} that [...] "Guilt {{should not be}} imputed solely from {{association}} or affiliation with political parties or any other organization, however much we abhor the ideas which they advocate." [...] Addressing the majority's [...] "suicide pact" [...] idea, Black asserted that the First Amendment's tolerance of anti-democratic ideas was what protected the nation from disaster: [...] "...the postulate of the First Amendment is that our free institutions can be maintained without proscribing or penalizing <b>political</b> <b>belief,</b> speech, press, assembly, or party affiliation. This is a far bolder philosophy than despotic rulers can afford to follow. It {{is the heart of}} the system on which our freedom depends." [...] Citing DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937), Black noted that a unanimous Court had already struck down laws which banned citizens from attending Communist Party meetings. It should strike down the relevant portions of the Taft-Hartley Act as well, he concluded.|$|E
2500|$|Bentham and {{his ideas}} can {{nonetheless}} {{be seen as}} having inspired several of the actual founders of the University. He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly {{to those who were}} not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham's time, membership of the Church of England and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of race, creed or <b>political</b> <b>belief,</b> it was largely consistent with Bentham's vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a [...] "more than passive part" [...] in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that [...] "his interest was greater than his influence". He failed in his efforts to see his disciple John Bowring appointed professor of English or History, but he did oversee the appointment of another pupil, John Austin, as the first professor of Jurisprudence in 1829.|$|E

If you will allow me to interpose in the matter, I should strongly advise you, for your own sake, to change them at once and entirely. I don't object to moderate Liberalism--perhaps as many as one-third of our parents are moderate Liberals; but decidedly the most desirable form of <b>political</b> <b>belief</b> for a successful schoolmaster is a quiet and gentlemanly, but unswerving Conservatism. I don't say {{you ought to be}} an uncompromising old-fashioned Tory--far from it: that alienates not only the dissenters, but even the respectable middle-class Liberals. What is above all things expected in a schoolmaster is a central position in politics, so to speak--a careful avoidance of all extremes--a readiness to welcome all reasonable progress, while opposing in a conciliatory spirit all revolutionary or excessive changes--in short, an attitude of studied moderation. That, if you will allow me to advise you, Le Breton, is the sort of thing, you may depend upon it, that most usually meets the wishes of the largest possible number of pupils' parents.' ...|$|E

60|$|Polling {{was already}} in brisk {{progress}} when Courtier arrived in Bucklandbury; and partly from a not unnatural interest in the result, partly from a half-unconscious clinging to the chance of catching another glimpse of Barbara, he took his bag to the hotel, determined to stay for {{the announcement of the}} poll. Strolling out into the High Street he began observing the humours of the day. The bloom of <b>political</b> <b>belief</b> had long been brushed off the wings of one who had so flown the world's winds. He had seen too much of more vivid colours to be capable now of venerating greatly the dull and dubious tints of blue and yellow. They left him feeling extremely philosophic. Yet it was impossible to get away from them, for the very world that day seemed blue and yellow, nor did the third colour of red adopted by both sides afford any clear assurance that either could see virtue in the other; rather, it seemed to symbolize the desire of each to have his enemy's blood. But Courtier soon observed by the looks cast at his own detached, and perhaps sarcastic, face, that even more hateful to either side than its antagonist, was the philosophic eye. Unanimous was the longing to heave half a brick at it whenever it showed itself. With its d---d impartiality, its habit of looking through the integument of things to see if there might be anything inside, he felt that they regarded it as the real adversary--the eternal foe to all the little fat 'facts,' who, dressed up in blue and yellow, were swaggering and staggering, calling each other names, wiping each other's eyes, blooding each other's noses. To these little solemn delicious creatures, all front and no behind, the philosophic eye, with its habit of looking round the corner, was clearly detestable. The very yellow and very blue bodies of these roistering small warriors with their hands on their tin swords and their lips on their tin trumpets, started up in every window and on every wall confronting each citizen in turn, persuading him that they and they alone were taking him to Westminster. Nor had they apparently for the most part much trouble with electors, who, finding uncertainty distasteful, passionately desired to be assured that the country could at once be saved by little yellow facts or little blue facts, as the case might be; who had, no doubt, a dozen other good reasons for being on the one side or the other; as, for instance, that their father had been so before them; that their bread was buttered yellow or buttered blue; that they had been on the other side last time; that they had thought it over and made up their minds; that they had innocent blue or naive yellow beer within; that his lordship was the man; or that the words proper to their mouths were 'Chilcox for Bucklandbury'; and, above all, the one really creditable reason, that, so far as they could tell with the best of their intellect and feelings, the truth at the moment was either blue or yellow.|$|E
