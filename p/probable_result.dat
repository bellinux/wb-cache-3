5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} French majority in numbers, {{the attack was}} a disaster: nearly 1,000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open water under the island's gun batteries: several were sunk with all hands. Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north, inflicting further losses. British casualties were negligible. Although this operation indicated the <b>probable</b> <b>result</b> of a full-scale invasion of Britain, the threat remained and British forces began a close blockade of the surviving landing craft that were anchored in the Cotentin ports. A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette passing along the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally it {{was thought}} that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8Ga, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy {{bombardment}} by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically, the Hadean Earth would have been far more active {{than at any other time}} in its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17×105 years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250×109 years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. Internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the <b>probable</b> <b>result</b> of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.|$|E

500|$|Kruger {{was obsessed}} with the South African Republic's independence, the {{retention}} of which he perceived as under threat if the Transvaal became too British in character. The uitlanders created an acute predicament in his mind. Taxation on their mining provided {{almost all of the}} republic's revenues, but they had very limited civic representation and almost no say in the running of the country. Though the English language was dominant in the mining areas, only Dutch remained official. Kruger expressed great satisfaction at the new arrivals' industry and respect for the state's laws, but surmised that giving them full burgher rights might cause the Boers to be swamped by sheer weight in numbers, with the <b>probable</b> <b>result</b> of absorption into the British sphere. Agonising over how he [...] "could meet the wishes of the new population for representation, without injuring the republic or prejudicing the interests of the older burghers", he thought he had solved the problem in 1889 when he tabled a [...] "second volksraad" [...] in which the uitlanders would have certain matters devolved to them. Most deemed this inadequate, and even Kruger's own supporters were unenthusiastic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{model for}} {{strategic}} behaviour in parimutuel gambles with unequal winning-probabilities is developed {{and applied to}} gambles based on soccer results. Assuming that the bookmakers' quotas reflect the true probability of each possible resultof a soccer game, {{we are able to}} derive a formula for the expected payoff of a betting strategy (Tipp). Using recent (1996 - 99) data from the Austrian games Toto and Torwette we are able to calculate the optimal strategies for 90 Toto and Torwette rounds. It turns out that given the relatively high probability of a rollover, it is optimal to overbet favourite outcomes (as compared to the probability of their occurrence). Comparing optimal with actual gamblers' behaviour we find that overbetting is even more pronounced than predicted by the model. This means that gamblers bet too frequently on relatively <b>probable</b> <b>results</b> whereas less <b>probable</b> <b>results</b> are too infrequently chosen relatively to the optimal strategy. ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1578, Oai moved to Hamamatsu Castle, where she took over {{management}} of the kitchen. She became very popular with the unit of warriors from her native province, who not only admired her beauty, but regarded her as a gentle and virtuous example of the women of Mikawa. [...] While her manners and gentility were exemplary, she could, when the occasion warranted, be outspoken or sarcastic in speech, the <b>probable</b> <b>result</b> of growing up around rustic warriors in a remote castle outpost. [...] With her move {{to the court of}} Ieyasu, Oai entered a bitter arena where prospective concubines schemed and competed with each other for a chance to bear Ieyasu's child. [...] Bearing the child of a powerful samurai, especially a son, was one way an ambitious young woman of the period could elevate her status, ensure a comfortable life, and guarantee the prosperity of her family. [...] These women usually relied on their physical attributes and sexual prowess to keep their lord's attention, and some resorted to the use of aphrodisiacs. [...] Unlike these courtesans, Oai already had the attention of Ieyasu, which would have undermined the ambitions of some and very likely made her a target of resentment, hostility, and the intrigues that were common in Japanese harems.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the issue}} of whether {{language}} is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist W. Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen J. Gould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether [...] "Language has evolved as an adaptation" [...] as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the <b>probable</b> <b>result</b> of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in The Symbolic Species argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{had held}} a professorship, Ivașcu had not {{obtained}} his Ph.D., and was pressured into correcting that error. He eventually enlisted for the university's own doctoral program, with a paper on {{the early history of}} Romanian literature, and with Șerban Cioculescu as his doctoral advisor. The work, published in 1969, and echoing Călinescu's style, received poor reviews from other academics. Ivașcu took an [...] "ultra-orthodox" [...] nationalist stand on Romanian language history, downplaying the contribution of Slavs. Eugen Negrici notes that Ivașcu had annexed Slavonic texts to his area of study, covering up the paucity of literary sources, and had taken for granted protochronistic claims about [...] "baroque literature" [...] in Romania. The result, Negrici concludes, is [...] "pitiful", the <b>probable</b> <b>result</b> of a [...] "political command". As Niculescu notes, Ivașcu found his degree [...] "utterly useless", being [...] "a man of the fleeting everyday facts, of generic notes, and certainly not one to spend time documenting himself at any length."
