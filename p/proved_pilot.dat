The effectiveness of the training, in terms of transfer, using simulations, has been <b>proved</b> for <b>pilots</b> (flight simulators) and surgeons (virtual reality systems) [2]. These simulations, based in expensive technology solutions, are very difficult to be implemented in companies, for training workers for emergency fire evacuation. In everyday situations, particularly in the emergency associated with rapid evacuation of people in buildings, is required by law, the development of fire drills. The main objective of these methods is to train the workers to peacefully follow a previously taught routine. However, in a real emergency, workers can be under a high stress situation and may not follow the previously trained behavior. This article will reflect on emergency evacuation in buildings and how the effectiveness of the training process can be increased. Thus, a theoretical approach of emergency evacuation will be presented and a discussion of VR as the usage for training in these situations...|$|R
