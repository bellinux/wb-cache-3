5|$|Before the Battery Charging Specification was defined, {{there was}} no {{standardized}} way for the portable device to inquire how much current was available. For example, Apple's iPod and iPhone chargers indicate the available current by voltages on the D− and D+ lines. When D+ = D− = 2.0V, the device may <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 500mA. When D+ = 2.0V and D− = 2.8V, the device may <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1A of current. When D+ = 2.8V and D− = 2.0V, the device may <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2A of current.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the ship's side, {{but it was impossible}} in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
50|$|In his {{screenplay}} for Joy Ride, J. J. Abrams {{was influenced by}} the first film directed by Steven Spielberg, Duel, and there are numerous references to it. For example, in one scene, a seemingly maniacal ICE truck <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a gas station that the brothers have <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> In Duel, a likewise maniacal truck <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> the protagonist, and a small billboard for ICE is visible in the background.|$|R

He underrotated and fell on an {{attempted}} quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop in the short program, receiving only one point for that element. He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He went on to the 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E
5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her {{to try to convince}} them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E

25|$|Trains {{arriving}} at Kew {{were required to}} <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> end of the platform verandah. The crossover from 1 to 2 road was usually not in use by the 1950s, and a sleeve was placed across it to prevent its operation. The down home signal at Kew was usually set at proceed, unless required to be placed at stop to operate the interlocking frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{roads of}} St. Mary's County were largely unpaved and {{notoriously}} treacherous until the 1930s, and so water transportation {{was the best}} way to access the county. The school also received its mail and supplies by boat. Steamboats would <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the school dock, just below the old Statehouse grounds, as often as twice a week. For a fee they would also carry students and faculty on outings over to Piney Point, or to Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The stop {{is located}} at the {{midpoint}} of a single track unidirectional turning loop around Belmore Park. The stop consists of two platforms. Trams stop at the first platform to allow passengers to alight, then <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the second platform to allow boarding. The use of the loop avoids having to terminate the vehicles and the removes the need for the driver to change ends. This loop was not new; it had been used until 1957 as a route on the former Sydney tramway system, but in the opposite direction. The covered area in which the light rail stop is located was previously used as a staff car-park and bus interchange. The stop received an upgrade during January 2017 when the city section of the line was closed for works at the George and Hay Streets intersection.|$|E

25|$|Microbiologists {{have studied}} the genetic {{mechanisms}} by which the V. cholerae bacteria turn off the production of some proteins {{and turn on the}} production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> six litres of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.|$|E
500|$|A {{collision}} occurred near Lawrence hill on 8 January 1930, approximately [...] {{north of}} the station. At 5:41am, an express train from [...] to [...] ran {{into the back of}} a minerals train which had stopped to pick up the brakes after descending Filton Bank. The express locomotive, GWR 4000 Class number 4063 [...] "Bath Abbey", was derailed and badly damaged, with several coaches also being damaged. The incident was blamed on signalman A. H. Toop of the Lawrence Hill signal box, with contributing factors including lax working standards and the driver of the goods train, W. G. Atkins, failing to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the signal box as required.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to passenger cars, interurban companies acquired freight locomotives and line maintenance equipment. [...] A [...] "box motor" [...] was a powered car exclusive for freight {{that looked like}} a passenger interurban without windows and had wide side doors for loading freight. A freight motor was geared for power rather than speed and could <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> six freight cars depending upon the load and grades. Freight cars for interurbans tended to be smaller than those for steam railroads, and they had to have special extended couplers to prevent car corner contact at the very tight grinding turns at city street corners. Maintenance equipment included [...] "line cars" [...] with roof platforms for the trolley wire repair crew, snow plows and snow sweepers with rotating brushes, a car for weed control and to maintain track and ballast. In order to save money, many companies constructed these in their shops using retired or semi-wrecked passenger cars for the frame and the traction motor mounted trucks.|$|E

2500|$|While {{based at}} Nadzab, the group {{increasingly}} used forward strips {{from which to}} stage missions, including Hollandia, Wakde, and Borokoe Airfield on Biak. In May and June the 38th conducted a month of attacks against Japanese airpower in the Vogelkop to protect Allied amphibious movements along the north coast of New Guinea. The campaign culminated in a two-group attack on Jefman and Samate Dromes at the extreme western tip of New Guinea, led by the 38th BG. The 670-mile mission, the longest to date by medium bombers in the SWPA, required staging through Hollandia and Wakde airfields {{and the use of}} 215-gallon fuel tanks mounted in the bomb bays. Attacking in two waves of 11 aircraft abreast, the group strafed and used parachute bombs against more than forty Japanese aircraft on the fields. The leading wave of bombers claimed five Japanese aircraft shot down attempting to take off, and four others that evaded the P-38 escort and attempted to bomb the group using white phosphorus aerial-bursting bombs. The smoke from fires caused by its attack grew so thick that the last crews through were forced to fly on instruments. One mission report stated: [...] "Col. (Donald P.) Hall led the formation so low over the drome that plane number 233, piloted by Lieutenant Breneman, was forced to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> strafe the operations tower." [...] The next day the group returned to attack shipping it had observed in Sorong harbor during the mission against the airdromes. The missions earned the group its third DUC.|$|E
