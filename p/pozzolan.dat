25|$|Portland <b>pozzolan</b> cement {{includes}} fly ash cement, since fly ash is a <b>pozzolan,</b> {{but also}} includes cements made from other natural or artificial pozzolans. In countries where volcanic ashes are available (e.g. Italy, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines) these cements {{are often the}} most common form in use. The maximum replacement ratios are generally defined as for Portland-fly ash cement.|$|E
25|$|Lime (calcium oxide) {{was used}} on Crete {{and by the}} ancient Greeks. There is {{evidence}} that the Minoans of Crete used crushed potshards as an artificial <b>pozzolan</b> for hydraulic cement. It is uncertain where it was first discovered that a combination of hydrated non-hydraulic lime and a <b>pozzolan</b> produces a hydraulic mixture (see also: Pozzolanic reaction), but concrete made from such mixtures was used by the Ancient Macedonians and three centuries later on a large scale by Roman engineers.|$|E
25|$|Owing to its {{pozzolanic}} properties, fly ash {{is used as}} {{a replacement}} for Portland cement in concrete. The use of fly ash as a pozzolanic ingredient was recognized as early as 1914, although the earliest noteworthy study of its use was in 1937. Roman structures such as aqueducts or the Pantheon in Rome used volcanic ash or pozzolana (which possesses similar properties to fly ash) as <b>pozzolan</b> in their concrete. As <b>pozzolan</b> greatly improves the strength and durability of concrete, the use of ash is a key factor in their preservation.|$|E
25|$|Constituents {{that are}} {{permitted}} in Portland-composite cements are artificial <b>pozzolans</b> (blastfurnace slag (in fact a latent hydraulic binder), silica fume, and fly ashes), or natural <b>pozzolans</b> (siliceous or siliceous aluminous {{materials such as}} volcanic ash glasses, calcined clays and shale).|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, physico-chemical {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out on the possibility of using Cameroonian volcanic or clay <b>pozzolans</b> as raw material for geopolymer or pozzolanic binder. The research had made some sugges tive results and conclusions. Powders of less than 100 μm of five sampled <b>pozzolans</b> from volcanic or clay origins have been subjected to chemical and mineralogical analysis, BET specific surface, absolute density, granulometry and poz zolanic activity in solution tests. The results obtained showed that, geopolymers or pozzolanic binders can be produced from samples studied. The samples contain significant amounts of glassy or amorphous phase ready to dissolve in an alkaline solution. The high alkali content of volcanic <b>pozzolans</b> makes them more appropriate for geopolymer applica tion. Clay <b>pozzolans</b> are the easier to grind in order to obtain the appropriate fineness and can be used for both geo - polymers and pozzolanic binders. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recognizing natural <b>pozzolans</b> {{and their}} qualities {{is one of}} the most {{important}} dilemmas in the eld of cement and concrete. Although dierent methods have been published towards this aim, research shows some anomalies between the judgments of these methods. This paper aims to compare evaluation methods of natural <b>pozzolans</b> by considering their performance in concrete as a decision criterion in order to develop a guideline for their qualication. Therefore, rstly, the main available methods are described. Then, the pozzolanic activity of natural <b>pozzolans</b> is investigated using these methods and compared with the performance in concrete. Finally, a guideline is proposed, based on the discussed methods...|$|R
25|$|When {{added to}} Portland cement as a <b>pozzolan</b> they can reduce {{chloride}} permeability and improve workability. They reduce weight and help moderate water content while allowing for slower drying which improves break strength. When added to lime mortars and lime-metakaolin mortars, synthetic zeolite pellets can act simultaneously as pozzolanic material and water reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Pozzolan-lime cements. Mixtures {{of ground}} <b>pozzolan</b> and lime are the cements {{used by the}} Romans, and are present in extant Roman {{structures}} (e.g. the Pantheon in Rome). They develop strength slowly, but their ultimate strength can be very high. The hydration products that produce strength are {{essentially the same as}} those produced by Portland cement.|$|E
25|$|Very {{finely ground}} cements {{are made from}} {{mixtures}} of cement with sand or with slag or other <b>pozzolan</b> type minerals that are extremely finely ground together. Such cements can have the same physical characteristics as normal cement but with 50% less cement particularly due to their increased surface area for the chemical reaction. Even with intensive grinding they can use up to 50% less energy to fabricate than ordinary Portland cements.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium and {{magnesium}} also produce a hydraulic set, and some <b>pozzolans</b> contain these elements.|$|R
40|$|Some {{occurrences of}} massive {{volcanic}} glass {{have been recorded}} in the western region of São Paulo State duringgeological mapping and prospecting and technological characterization of pozzolanic materials. The massive volcanic glassis associated with trachydacites from the Serra Geral Formation. The geometry of these layers has not been determined yetbecause they are covered by sediments. These rocks were identified as natural <b>pozzolans</b> because their active component,volcanic glass, reacted with lime forming a calcium silicate. The technological properties of the cement produced using suchpozzolans were improved. Furthermore, the use of <b>pozzolans</b> reduces carbon dioxide emission and limestone extractionsince <b>pozzolans</b> replace part of the portland clinker in the final product. This paper presents results of some studies onmassive volcanic glass as an active component of <b>pozzolans.</b> In addition to that, this paper discusses the importance of thisfinding for construction industry and the great potential of pozzolanic materials, due to the considerable size of Serra GeralFormation in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|The natural <b>pozzolans</b> studied are {{commercial}} {{products and}} {{come from the}} volcanic islands of Milos and Kimolos, as well as North Greece mainland. The materials were characterised mineralogically and chemically by XRD and SEM/EDX respectively, while their reactivity with calcium hydroxide was studied through a pozzolanic activity test. In addition, five different lime-pozzolan mixtures were prepared and studied for their compressive strength at four preset curing periods (one, three, six and twelve months). The results indicated that when chemical and mineralogical composition was similar, the main parameter affecting the reactivity of the <b>pozzolans</b> {{and the strength of}} the produced mixtures was the grain-size distribution of the <b>pozzolans</b> within the range of 0 - 63 μm...|$|R
25|$|Pumice {{is widely}} used to make {{lightweight}} concrete or insulative low-density cinder blocks. When used as an additive for cement, a fine-grained version of pumice called <b>pozzolan</b> is mixed with lime to form a light-weight, smooth, plaster-like concrete. This form of concrete was used {{as far back as}} Roman times. Roman engineers used it to build the huge dome of the Pantheon and as construction material for many aqueducts.|$|E
25|$|In the past, fly ash was {{generally}} {{released into the}} atmosphere, but air pollution control standards now require that it be captured prior to release by fitting pollution control equipment. In the US, fly ash is generally stored at coal power plants or placed in landfills. About 43% is recycled, often used as a <b>pozzolan</b> to produce hydraulic cement or hydraulic plaster and a replacement or partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete production. Pozzolans ensure the setting of concrete and plaster and provide concrete with more protection from wet conditions and chemical attack.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks used {{volcanic}} tuff {{from the island}} of Thera as their <b>pozzolan</b> and the Romans used crushed volcanic ash (activated aluminium silicates) with lime. This mixture was able to set under water increasing its resistance. The material was called pozzolana {{from the town of}} Pozzuoli, west of Naples where volcanic ash was extracted. In the absence of pozzolanic ash, the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which are still standing. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement.|$|E
40|$|The {{durability}} of concrete structures {{is an important}} issue nowadays. Specifically in the case of reinforced concrete bridges or other infrastructures one of the main form of environmental attack is the penetration of chloride ions, which leads to corrosion of concrete steel reinforcement. This study aims to evaluate the effect of the introduction of metakaolin and diatomite, two chemically and physically different <b>pozzolans,</b> on the resistance of concrete to the penetration of chlorides but also the effect on other properties of concrete, namely, its compressive strength and its porosity distribution. The results of this study show that the <b>pozzolans</b> physical and chemical characteristics have a strong influence on the <b>pozzolans</b> behavior and, consequently, on the concrete properties...|$|R

Con el objetivo de mejorar el entendimiento del rol de las puzolanas naturales en el desempeño del hormigón, este estudio caracterizó la porosidad e interconectividad de los poros de hormigones en función del contenido de puzolanas naturales. El programa {{experimental}} caracterizó la resistencia y permeabilidad de hormigones con diferentes contenidos de puzolanas y con edades entre 28 y 84 días para así evaluar el efecto de las puzolanas en función del tiempo. Los resultados muestran que la ganancia en impermeabilidad debido al uso de puzolanas naturales es muy superior al efecto observado en resistencia. Por ejemplo, hormigones con 33 % de puzolanas en reemplazo del cemento presentaron una resistencia a compresión 27 % inferior a la del hormigón sin puzolanas; sin embargo, su impermeabilidad fue aproximadamente 200 % superior a las de los hormigones sin puzolanas. Los ensayos de permeabilidad a iones cloruro y absorción capilar, presentaron baja variabilidad y buena correlación con las reacciones puzolánicas. Se concluye que se debe controlar independientemente la permeabilidad y la resistencia del hormigón ya que son afectadas de manera diferente por las reacciones puzolánicas; además, se concluye que para considerar el efecto de las puzolanas se debe ensayar permeabilidad a edades tardías. Pozzolanic {{materials in}} portland cement concrete mixtures hydrate forming new calcium silicate hydrates which improve durability of concrete structures. The {{aim of this}} research was to enhance the understanding of the role of natural <b>pozzolans</b> in concrete performance. This study characterized porosity and pore connectivity of concrete mixtures as function of the content of natural <b>pozzolans.</b> The experimental program measured compressive strength and permeability of concrete mixtures with different levels of cement replacement by natural <b>pozzolans</b> between 28 and 84 days of age, so the effect of <b>pozzolans</b> could be assessed as a function of time. Results clearly show that the gain in impermeability of concrete due to the use of natural <b>pozzolans</b> is much more pronounced that the effect in compressive strength. For instance, concrete with 33 % of cement replaced by natural <b>pozzolans</b> had a compressive strength 27 % lower that those with no <b>pozzolans</b> replacement; nevertheless, their impermeability was approximately 200 % superior to those with no <b>pozzolans</b> replacement. Chloride ion permeability and rate of water absorption showed low variability and good correlation with pozzolanic reactions. It can be concluded {{that it is important to}} control compressive strength and permeability independently because they are affected very differently by pozzolanic reactions; also, for taking advantage of natural <b>pozzolans</b> in concrete, it is important to specify and measure permeability at late ages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate certain characteristics of tuff and volcanic ash quarried from Mt. Elgon and Mt.

It was found that incorporation of 20 to 25 % volcanic ash gave the highest compressive strength and substantially reduced alkali-silica reac-tivity. The ash met ASTM requirements for ‘Class N’ <b>pozzolans.</b> This study suggests that the volcanic ash, when ground to 506 m 2 /kg Blaine fineness develops high quali-ties for potential use as a mineral admixture in cement and concrete. Conversely, the use of tuff was found to significantly increase alkali-silica reaction.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted using an air-entraining agent and <b>pozzolans</b> such as silica fume and fly ash, {{to meet the}} design strengths 50 and 60 MPa, as well as frost resistance to 300 cycles of freezing and thawing. Among a series of concretes of grade 50 or 60 MPa, {{only a small part}} could resist 300 cycles of freezing and thawing. It was demonstrated that frost resistance might be independent on strength of concrete. By means of mercury intrusion porosimeter, the pore structure characteristics of six concretes were identified. Air entrainment, no matter whether the <b>pozzolans</b> were used, caused an increase in cumulative pore volume, and also an increase in the mean pore size. It is revealed that, as to concrete at a 0. 32 water/binder ratio, air entrainment should be a main approach to enhance frost resistance, although the <b>pozzolans</b> could be used to increase long-term strength of concrete.

40|$|Abstract—High {{strength}} concrete {{has been used}} in situations where it may be exposed to elevated temperatures. Numerous authors have shown the significant contribution of polypropylene fiber to the spalling resistance of high {{strength concrete}}. When cement-based composite that reinforced by polypropylene fibers heated up to 170 °C, polypropylene fibers readily melt and volatilize, creating additional porosity and small channels in to the matrix that cause the poor structure and low strength. This investigation develops on the mechanical properties of mortar incorporating polypropylene fibers exposed to high temperature. Also effects of different <b>pozzolans</b> on strength behaviour of samples at elevated temperature have been studied. To reach this purpose, the specimens were produced by partial replacement of cement with finely ground glass, silica fume and rice husk ash as high reactive <b>pozzolans.</b> The amount of this replacement was 10 % by weight of cement to find the effects of <b>pozzolans</b> as a partial replacement of cement on the mechanical properties of mortars. In this way, lots of mixtures with 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1 % and 1. 5 % of polypropylene fibers were cast and tested for compressive and flexural strength, accordance to ASTM standard. After that specimens being heated to temperatures of 300, 600 °C, respectively, the mechanical properties of heated samples were tested. Mechanical tests showed significant reduction in compressive strength which could be due to polypropylene fiber melting. Also <b>pozzolans</b> improve the mechanical properties of sampels.

The life cycle inventory of LEED suggested by the PCA indicated the green options for cementitious materials. Results showed that mix I and II indicated cement used, CO 2 reduction, raw materials and energy consumption all decreased more 50 % than mix III, and mix IV was 5 % less. The compressive strength and anti-corrosion levels showed that mix I and II were better than mix III and IV, and with ternary <b>pozzolans</b> could enhance the long-term durability (92 days) due to a resistivity greater 20 KΩ-cm and a charge passed lower than 2000 Coulombs.
