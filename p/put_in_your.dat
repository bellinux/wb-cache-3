I <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> lovers, for I don't allow {{it possible for}} a man to be so sincere as I am." [...] Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who was the subject of many of Seward's sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward's protest, Seward's poems became angry. However, Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd's beauty and their affection and friendship. As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, [...] "The roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:—You know not how I love her." [...] Wollstonecraft's first novel , in part, addressed her relationship with Fanny Blood.|$|E

H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: [...] "Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> claim? It is above a year and a day that you have been married, and I never once heard either of you mention a journey to Whichnoure." [...] Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes [...] "... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by all I have said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it." [...] Walpole concludes, [...] "If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither." ...|$|E

Smith noted that Myst {{had become a}} hit and was regarded as incredibly immersive despite most closely resembling [...] "the hoary technology of the slideshow (with accompanying music and effects)". Smith concluded that [...] "Mysts primary brilliance lies {{in the way it}} provides narrative justification for the very things that are most annoying" [...] about the technological constraints imposed on the game; for instance, Macworld praised Mysts designers for overcoming the occasionally debilitating slowness of CD drives to deliver a consistent experience throughout the game. The publication went on to declare Myst the best game of 1994, stating that Myst removed the [...] "most annoying parts of adventure games — vocabularies that [...] don't understand, people you can't talk to, wrong moves that get you killed and make you start over.

For why should the Lord <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hand the symbol of his body, unless it was to assure you that you really participate in it?
