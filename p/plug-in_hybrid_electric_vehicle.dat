25|$|Continuing their {{participation}} of AVTC's, CSULA {{is involved with}} General Motors' new competition series called EcoCAR3. This competition is a 4-year competition where 16 Universities across northern America were donated a 2016 Chevy Camaro and are focused on converting this traditional fossil fuel vehicle into a <b>plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle.</b> CSULA's team has focused on developing a post transmission parallel architecture for their vehicle. Additionally, the team has decided to deviate from the standard expectation of marketing their developed vehicle to consumers and is instead targeting Law Enforcement Fleets as a business to business focus. The EcoCar3 team will have four years (2014–18) to redesign and re-engineer a Chevy Camaro {{in an effort to}} reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of the vehicle, while maintaining consumer acceptability, performance, utility and safety. At the end of the four year, the student-build vehicles will participate in an over-the-road event, raising the stakes for vehicle, dependability and safety.

25|$|The {{effect of}} PHEVs on {{greenhouse}} emissions is complex. Plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on all-electric mode do not emit harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power. The clean air benefit is usually local because {{depending on the}} source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In the same way, PHEVs do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles. In the case of <b>plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> when operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles,</b> {{are rapidly}} gaining interest. Batteries of <b>plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> are charged by either {{plugging}} into electric outlets or by an on-board generator. For grid charging, these batteries are supplied by {{power from the}} grid at home from a standard outlet or on a corporate car park. The extra electrical load, from charging the batteries, {{has an impact on}} the electricity system in general and more specifically on the distribution grid and the electricity generation system. The impact of such vehicles on the distribution grid is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. The impact on the electricity generation system is investigated in terms of available generation capacity. Uncoordinated charging of <b>plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> may cause local grid problems. These grid problems can be avoided by coordinated charging. The aim is to determine the optimal charge pro¯le for each vehicle and to minimize the impact on the electricity system. For the coordination, the linear or quadratic programming technique is found to be the most e±cient and is applied for this optimization problem. <b>Plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> cannot onlycharge when connected to the grid, but also discharge and thus inject power. In that way, <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> may offer grid services to support the grid. It is not clear whether offering grid services is economic forthese vehicles. A voltage controller could be easily implemented in the charger and the grid services may be enabled. Such a controller avoids large voltage deviations at the household level. The vehicles may also be matched with distributed generation units such as combined heat and power units, small-scale wind turbines and photovoltaicpanels. If there is power or energy produced by these units, the batteries of the vehicle could be charged with this energy and their curtailment due to grid congestion is avoided. Charging of <b>plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> also has an impact on the electricity generationsystem. When the penetration level of these vehicles is high, charging during the evening peak must be avoided since not enough generation capacity is available. Therefore, the charging must be shifted in time. From the perspective of the distribution grid, the management or coordination of charging <b>plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> allows for grid reinforcements to be postponed. On the other hand, the introduction of smart chargers or meters is inevitable for the coordination of the charging of <b>plug-in</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
