40|$|Superconducting <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{have great}} promise for quantum-limited readout of superconducting qubits and detectors. Until recently, most superconducting <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> had {{been based on}} {{resonant}} structures, limiting their bandwidth and dynamic range. Broadband traveling-wave <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> based both on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting thin films and on Josephson junctions are in development. By modifying the dispersion property of the amplifier circuit, referred to as dispersion engineering, the gain can be greatly enhanced and the size can be reduced. We present two theoretical frameworks for analyzing and understanding such parametric amplifiers: (1) generalized coupled-mode equations and (2) a finite difference time domain (FDTD) model combined with a small signal analysis. We show how these analytical and numerical tools {{may be used to}} understand device performance. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

If information is transmitted using only the signals, <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are PI and their noise figures are {{comparable to those of}} erbium amplifiers. However, transmitting correlated information in the signals and idlers, or copying the signals prior to transmission, allows <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> to be phase-sensitive (PS), which lowers their noise figures. The information capacities of two-mode PS links exceed those of the corresponding PI links by 2 b/s-Hz...|$|R
50|$|The optical <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifier</b> has a wider {{bandwidth}} than a -amplifier, {{which in}} turn has a wider bandwidth than an optical parametric oscillator because of white-light generation even one octave wide.

50|$|In electronics, a step {{recovery}} diode (SRD) is a semiconductor junction diode having the ability to generate extremely short pulses.

50|$|An optical <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifier,</b> {{abbreviated}} OPA, is a {{laser light}} source that emits light of variable wavelengths by an optical parametric amplification process.

50|$|Different {{spectroscopy}} experiments require different excitation or probe wavelengths. For {{this reason}} frequency conversion techniques {{are commonly used}} to extend the operational spectrum of existing laser light sources.The most widespread conversion techniques rely on using crystals with second order non linearity to perform either parametric amplification or frequency mixing.Frequency mixing works by superimposing two beams of equal or different wavelengths to generate a signal which is a higher harmonic or the sum frequency of the first two.Parametric amplification overlaps a weak probe beam with a higher energy pump beam in a non linear crystal such that the weak beam gets amplified and the remaining energy goes out as a new beam called the idler. This approach has the capability of generating output pulses that are shorter than the input ones. Different schemes of this approach have been implemented. Examples are: optical parametric oscillator (OPO), optical <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifier</b> (OPA), non-collinear <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifier</b> (NOPA).|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{parametric}} amplification first arose at much lower frequencies: AC circuits, including radio frequency and microwave frequency (in the earliest investigations, sound waves were also studied). In these applications, typically a strong pump signal (or [...] "local oscillator") at frequency f {{passes through a}} circuit element whose parameters are modulated by the weak [...] "signal" [...] wave at frequency fs (for example, the signal might modulate the capacitance of a varactor diode). The result {{is that some of}} the energy of the local oscillator gets transferred to the signal frequency fs, as well as the difference ("idler") frequency f-fs. The term <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifier</b> is used because the parameters of the circuit are varied.|$|E
50|$|The {{other method}} is quasi-phase-matching. In this method the {{frequencies}} involved are not constantly locked in phase with each other, instead the crystal axis is flipped at a regular interval Λ, typically 15 micrometres in length. Hence, these crystals are called periodically poled. This {{results in the}} polarization response of the crystal to be shifted back in phase with the pump beam by reversing the nonlinear susceptibility. This allows net positive energy flow from the pump into the signal and idler frequencies. In this case, the crystal itself provides the additional wavevector k = 2π/Λ (and hence momentum) to satisfy the phase-matching condition. Quasi-phase-matching can be expanded to chirped gratings to get more bandwidth and to shape an SHG pulse like it is done in a dazzler. SHG of a pump and self-phase modulation (emulated by second-order processes) of the signal and an optical <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be integrated monolithically.|$|E
30|$|<b>Parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{based on}} superconducting devices have {{recently}} regained interest {{because of the}} need for better amplifiers for qubit readout and microwave quantum optics. The utility of these amplifiers have been demonstrated in a number of experiments showing single shot qubit readout [17], quantum feedback [18], vacuum squeezing [19], and in determining the statistics of nonclassical photon states [20]. There are two major advantages of superconducting parametric amplifiers: (i) they have very low dissipation, and (ii) they have well characterized and engineer-able properties. This makes it possible to design well functioning <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with good gain and little added noise [9, 21].|$|R
30|$|Superconducting {{circuits}} {{can also}} be used to build <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in the microwave domain. The use of <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with Josephson junctions was pioneered by several researchers in the 1970 s [2 – 6], as well as Bernard Yurke in the 1980 s [7, 8]. Josephson junctions are used as parametric inductances, and may be pumped either by a time varying current through the junction [9 – 11], or in a SQUID geometry by a time-varying magnetic flux [11 – 14]. Alternatively the kinetic inductance of a thin superconductor can be used as the parametric component [15, 16].|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} and numerically {{study the}} difference frequency generation and the signal amplification bandwidth {{together with the}} pump wavelength acceptance for counterpropagating optical <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> It is shown that the specific advantage of those amplifiers is that the DFG and amplification bandwidth is much narrower than in a co-propagating scheme, thus {{making it possible to}} shift spectrally or to amplify selectively a single channel over the several present in WDM optical fiber communications. Moreover, the pump wavelength acceptance is shown to be as broad as in the copropagating scheme. The implementation of such counterpropagating optical <b>parametric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in a quasi-phase-matched LiNbO 3 waveguide is discussed...|$|R
