To study the impact of reduced dose of chemical fertilizer and its combination with biofertilizer, compost and growth retardant on morpho-physiological traits of mustard field experiments were conducted during winter season of 2006, 2007 and 2008 with mustard (Brassica campestris cv. B 9) at Burdwan, West Bengal, India. In 2006, seven available varieties of mustard were cultivated using a recommended dose of chemical fertilizer (N:P:K – 100 : 50 : 50). In the second and third years, influence of six different combined doses of chemical and biofertilizers; growth regulator cycocel (CCC) and compost on morpho-physiological traits viz., leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD), leaf area ratio (LAR), crop growth rate (CGR), net assimilation rate (NAR) and harvest index (HI) of mustard and the field data were analyzed statistically by using PROC GLM of SAS (SAS Institute, 1997). Differential varietal response was reflected for the studied traits during varietal trial. The combined treatment of biofertilizer, chemical fertilizer and compost significantly (P <  0. 05) increased the LAI, LAD, CGR and NAR and reduced LAR during crop maturity. The HI index value showed significant variation among the varieties as well as between the treatments of biofertilizer, chemical fertilizer and compost. Growth regulator application significantly (P <  0. 05) reduced LAI, LAR, NAR and increased LAD, CGR at crop maturity and it can be concluded from our findings that reduced dose of chemical fertilizer and its combination with biofertilizer + compost + growth regulator have pronounced effect on crop morpho-physiological attributes under less environmental pollution with lesser use of nitrogenous and <b>phosphatic</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer...</b>|$|E

30|$|Globally, the {{agricultural}} soils are getting phosphorus (P) deficient after nitrogen (Vance et al. 2003) and hence, impairs the various physiological and biochemical processes within plants (Wu et al. 2005). Generally, on dry weight basis, it constitutes ~  0.2 % {{of the plant}} biomass (Schachtman et al. 1998). Phosphorus, being an immobile nutrient in soil necessitates the application of <b>chemical</b> <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> as its available sources for optimum production of crop plants. However, nutrient availability from <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> is not more than 20 % and has forced the poor farmers to add {{two times more than}} the optimum application rate of P-fertilizers. The addition of extra P in the soil led to consume more resources for the crop production, and hence, the costs of production of crop plants per unit area increase (Aziz et al. 2006). Moreover, there is expected depletion of high quality rock phosphate (RP) which is the major sources of P-fertilizers by the year 2050 (Vance et al. 2003). These circumstances necessitate to find out an economical and eco-friendly way to increase the availability of P, and at the same time, reduce the losses of P, and RP enriched with compost and phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) can be a good solution.|$|R
30|$|Rock {{phosphate}} (RP) is {{an important}} natural source of P and is used as raw material {{for the production of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (Reddy et al. 2002). The direct application of RP has been found suitable for acidic soils as low pH helps to solubilize the RP and increases available form of P to the plants. However, this approach does not work for alkaline/or calcareous soils due to high pH (Caravaca et al. 2004). The application of enriched-RP with compost to alkaline/or calcareous soils could be a wise approach for the solubilization of RP. Furthermore, addition of organic fertilizers also improves the physicochemical as well as biological properties of soil (Adhami et al. 2014; Lim et al. 2015). This approach also had positive effects on crop because organic fertilizers contained plenty of macro and micro-nutrients (Gaur 1997; Kalaivanan and Hattab 2016). Typically, most of the organic fertilizers are produced from biodegradable solid wastes using compost or/and vermicompost (Wu et al. 2014; Lim et al. 2016).|$|R
30|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{important}} plant nutrient after nitrogen. P availability is low in soils because of its fixation as insoluble phosphates of iron, aluminum, and calcium (especially in calcareous soil). Phosphorus deficiency is {{an important}} factor restricting plant growth, so <b>chemical</b> <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are widely used to get optimum yields. Soluble forms of phosphorus fertilizer used are easily precipitated as insoluble forms; this leads to the excessive and repeated application of P fertilizer to cropland. Despite its importance in plants growth and metabolism, phosphorus is the least accessible macronutrient and hence most frequently deficient nutrient in most agricultural soils because of its low availability and its poor recovery from applied fertilizers. The low availability of phosphorus is due to it readily forms insoluble complexes with cation such as aluminum and iron under acidic soil condition and with calcium and magnesium under alkaline soil conditions whereas the poor phosphorus fertilizer recovery {{is due to the fact}} that the phosphorus applied in the form of fertilizers is mainly adsorbed by the soil and is not available for plants uptake (Cordell et al. 2011).|$|R

The experiment was carried out in 2002 - 2003 covering an area of 4367 ha at PTPN IV in North Sumatra and of 515. 58 ha at PTPN V in Riau. The planting material was Dura x Pasifera variety and planted in 1980 - 1995. A randomized block design was used having three fertilizer treatments: (A) 100 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (normal dosage), (B) 75 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> + BF, and (C) 50 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> + BF. The replications at PTPN IV and V were 11 and 7, respectively. The BF was applied firstly in May 2002. Dosage of BF was 250 g tree- 1 yr- 1. The BF was given in pockets with four pockets per palm tree. The parameters observed were fresh fruit bunch (FFB) weight, average of bunch weight, and average of bunch number. Results of the experiments showed that palm yield treated with 75 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> + BF and 50 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> + BF were both not significantly different with palm yield treated with 100 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The application of 75 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> + BF and 50 % <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> + BF gave benefit of Rp 509, 093 and Rp 1, 231, 535 ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively.

Our previous study indicated that reducing <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> input effectively decreased the soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in an intensive vegetable cropping system in the coastal area of southeast Lake Dianchi, China. This study aimed to decrease the input–output balance, namely the nutrient balance between input of fertilizer and output through vegetable harvesting, by reducing <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application without yield loss. A pot experiment was performed using <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> with different amounts of N, P, and K on soils from six vegetable fields’ representative of the study area. High nitrate concentration in soils 2, 3, and 6 resulted in high N absorption from soil, and low N absorption from <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Moreover, the responses of dry matter production to N absorbed from <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> were less sensitive in soils 2, 3, and 6 {{than those in the}} other soils. Accordingly, reducing N input of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> did not decrease total N absorption or dry matter production, which should be the reason why reducing N input of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> did not reduce dry matter production in soils 2, 3, and 6. In the cases of soils 1, 4, and 5, reducing N input of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> reduced dry matter production, owing to lower levels of soil nitrate.

The colony forming units (cfu) of Azospirillum and Azotobacter were higher in the presence of quarter dose of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Activities of soil enzymes viz. urease and phosphatase were enhanced by Azotobacter in combination with quarter doses of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and Azospirillum in combination with half dose of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> respectively whereas; root proliferation was enhanced by Azotobacter and Azospirillum supplemented with half and quarter doses of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> The 2 nd experiment was focused on the effect of PGPR and <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> under field conditions on plant growth, seed yield, oil contents and quality of safflower with perspective to biodiesel production. The indole acetic acid, gibberellic acid, oil contents, oil/protein ratio and seed phenolics were improved by Azospirillum with half dose of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Azospirillum in combination with quarter dose of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> improved the fatty acid profile, oil quality and amino acids contents with parallel increase in biodiesel yield whereas; Azotobacter in combination with quarter dose of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> improved seed crude protein and induced protein of 130 KDa and 100 KDa. Seed nutrients viz. Ca+ 2, K+ were increased by Azotobacter and Azospirillum supplemented with half dose of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> In the 3 rd experiment effects of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> Azospirillum and Azotobacter were studied on plant growth, seed yield and oil quality of canola (Brassica napus L.) var. Pakola pertaining to biodiesel production. Significant improvements in seed yield and seed size were recorded in <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> treatment while oleic acid (C 18 : 1) was improved by Azospirillum treatment with parallel decrease in erucic acid contents. Azotobacter showed maximum increase in seed oil content with concomitant decrease in seed glucosinolate and moisture content. <b>Chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and Azospirillum decreased the oil acid value and free fatty acid (%FFAs) contents with concomitant increase in seed protein and biodiesel yield (93 % and 92 % respectively). Protocol for the production of safflower biodiesel was optimized using 1 H NMR, FTIR, GC-MS and refractometer techniques. The biodiesel samples prepared by base catalyzed transesterification reaction showed maximum yield (97. 84 %) at 0. 5 % catalyst concentration with 6 : 1 methanol/oil ratio at 65 Â°C as quantified by 1 H NMR technique with minimum (1. 41) refractive index and improved physico-chemical properties. The GC/MS analysis showed the presence of five major faty acid methyl esters. Improvement in separation and quantification of fatty acid methyl esters in safflower oil was achieved using comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GCÂ´GC). The GCÂ´GC separation accomplished by the combination of SLB-IL 111 with IL 59 column phases provided excellent separation of FAME standard mixture and also safflower FAMEs were well separated and quantified in a short run of 16 min. It is inferred that PGPR can supplement the <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> upto 50 %â€“ 75 % in order to obtain optimum growth and yield of safflower and use of advanced technologies improved biodiesel and fatty acid analyses being more rapid, precise and cost effective...|$|R
