5|$|The park {{contains}} five buildings, {{the first}} of them being the Märkisches Museum, a complex of buildings. The complex was built between 1907 and 1907, and was designed by Ludwig Hoffmann. The second was the Bärenzwinger, next to the south entrance to the park. This was built between 1938 and 1939 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, and was designed by Ludwig Hoffmann. The Bärenzwinger has contained up to five bears at once, however no longer contains any following the death of Schnute, Berlin's last official city bear in 2015. At the east end of the park there is the Landesversicherungsanstalt building, a large office building designed by Alfred Messel, to be the headquarters of the Landesversicherungsanstalt, an insurance company. The fourth building is the AOK building, a six-storey steel-framed office building built from purplish brick, {{on the south side of}} the park, opposite the Bärenzwinger. The final building is the Volksbadeanstalt, on the western side of the park. It was built in 1888 as a <b>public</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Public</b> <b>baths</b> {{originated}} from a communal need for cleanliness {{at a time}} when most people did not have access to private bathing facilities. The term [...] "public" [...] is not completely accurate, as some types of <b>public</b> <b>baths</b> are restricted depending on membership, gender, religious affiliation, or other reasons. As societies have changed, the need for <b>public</b> <b>baths</b> has reduced: dwellings now have their own private bathroom. <b>Public</b> <b>baths</b> have also become incorporated into the social system as meeting places. As the title suggests, public bathing does not refer only to bathing. In ancient times public bathing included saunas, massages and relaxation therapies, comparable to today's spas.|$|R

According to Lisan al-Mulk the harassment was due to their staying in the same inns, and using the same <b>public</b> <b>bath.</b> In a different account the Babis are harassed by anti-Babi inhabitants of villages that they pass through. Finally when they arrived in Barfurush, they were given some shelter among the Babis.|$|E

25|$|Eleventh Street <b>Public</b> <b>Bath</b> – {{designated}} in 2008, {{this highly}} intact work of prominent architect Arnold W.

Built between 1904 and 1905 and designed in the neo-Italian Renaissance style, the bath (as {{well as the other}} thirteen City-operated public baths opened between 1901 and 1914) was the result of hard-fought efforts made by progressive reformers decades earlier.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{archaeology}} at Kom El Deka (heap {{of rubble}} or ballast) {{has found the}} Roman quarter of Alexandria beneath a layer of graves from the Muslim era. The remains found at this site, which are dated circa the fourth to seventh centuries AD, include workshops, storefronts, houses, a theater, a <b>public</b> <b>bath,</b> and lecture halls, as well as Coptic frescoes. The baths and theater {{were built in the}} fourth century and the smaller buildings constructed around them, suggesting a sort of urban renewal occurring in the wake of Diocletian.|$|E
25|$|The Square Water Pavilion, {{also called}} the Queen's Bath, is in the {{south-east}} of the royal centre. It has a pavilion, a water basin and a method of moving fresh water to it and taking away wash water and overflows. The basin is enclosed within an ornate, pillared, vaulted bay. Nearby are ruins of the aqueduct. The modern name of this building, the Queen's bath, is probably a misnomer {{because this was a}} <b>public</b> <b>bath</b> for men and travellers. The building's interior arches show influence of the Indo-Islamic style, reflecting an era n which Hindu and Muslim arts influenced each other in India.|$|E

25|$|The obvious {{distinguishing}} features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects.

Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models {{for the type of}} large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and <b>public</b> <b>bath</b> houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.|$|E
