25|$|Glassblowing is a glassforming {{technique}} that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or <b>parison),</b> {{with the aid}} of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer. A lampworker (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.|$|E
2500|$|Referring to the mechanism, the [...] "rings" [...] {{are sealed}} from below {{by a short}} plunger.

2500|$|The Encomium {{demonstrates}} Gorgias’ love of paradoxologia. [...] The performative {{nature of}} the Encomium requires a reciprocal relationship between the performer and the audience, one which relies on the cooperation between the deceptive performer and the equally deceived audience (Wardy 36). [...] Gorgias reveals this paradox in the final section of the Encomium where he writes: [...] "I wished to write this speech for Helen’s encomium and my amusement" [...] (Gorgias 33). Additionally, {{if one were to}} accept Gorgias’ argument for Helen’s exoneration, it would fly {{in the face of a}} whole literary tradition of blame directed towards Helen. [...] This too is paradoxical. While Gorgias primarily used metaphors and paradox, he famously used [...] "figures of speech, or schemata," [...] (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa). This included balanced clauses (isocolon), the joining of contrasting ideas (antithesis), the structure of successive clauses (<b>parison),</b> and the repetition of word endings (homoeoteleuton) (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). The Encomium shows Gorgias' interest in argumentation, as he makes his point by [...] "systematically refuting a series of possible alternatives," [...] (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). It is an encomium of the [...] "rhetorical craft itself, and a demonstration of its power over us," [...] (Gumpert, 73). According to Van Hook, The Encomium of Helen abounds in [...] "amplification and brevity, a rhythm making prose akin to poetry, bold metaphors and poetic or unusual epithets" [...] (122).|$|E
60|$|In nothing {{were the}} sculptors of the Renaissance more {{fortunate}} than in being {{in advance of}} us with their tombs: they have left us noting to say {{in regard to the}} great final contrast, - the contrast between the immobility of death and the trappings and honors that survive. They expressed in every way in which it was possible to express it the solemnity, of their conviction that the Marble image {{was a part of the}} personal greatness of the defunct, and the protection, the re- demption, of his memory. A modern tomb, in com- <b>parison,</b> is a sceptical affair; it insists too little on the honors. I say this in the face of the fact that one has only to step across the cathedral of Nantes to stand in the presence of one of the purest and most touching of modern tombs. Catholic Brittany has erected in the opposite transept a monument to one of the most devoted of her sons, General de Lamoriciere, the de- fender of the Pope, the vanquished of Castelfidardo. This noble work, from the hand of Paul Dubois, one of the most interesting of that new generation of sculp- tors who have revived in France an art of which our overdressed century had begun to despair, has every merit but the absence of a certain prime feeling. It is the echo of an earlier tune, - an echo with a beauti- ful cadence. Under a Renaissance canopy of white marble, elaborately worked with arabesques and che- rubs, in a relief so low that it gives the work a cer- tain look of being softened and worn by time, lies the body of the Breton soldier, with, a crucifix clasped to his breast and a shroud thrown over his body. At each of the angles sits a figure in bronze, the two best of which, representing Charity and Military Courage, had given me extraordinary pleasure when they were exhibited (in the clay) in the Salon of 1876. They are admirably cast, and they have a certain greatness: the one, a serene, robust young mother, beautiful in line and attitude; the other, a lean and vigilant young man, in a helmet that overshadows his serious eyes, resting an outstretched arm, an admirable military member, upon the hilt of a sword. These figures con- tain abundant assurance that M. Paul Dubois has been attentive to Michael Angelo, whom we have all heard called a splendid example but a bad model. The visor-shadowed face of his warrior is more or less a reminiscence of the figure on the tomb of Lorenzo de' Medici at Florence; but it is doubtless none the worse for that. The interest of the work of Paul Dubois is its peculiar seriousness, a kind of moral good faith which is not the commonest feature of French art, and which, united as it is in this case with exceeding knowledge and a remarkable sense of form, produces an impression, of deep refinement. The whole monu- ment is a proof of exquisitely careful study; but I am not sure that this impression on the part of the spec- tator is altogether a happy one. It explains much of its great beauty, and it also explains, perhaps, a little of a certain weakness. That word, however, is scarcely in place; I only mean that M. Dubois has made a vi- sible effort, which has been most fruitful. Simplicity is not always strength, and our complicated modern genius contains treasures of intention. This fathomless modern element is an immense charm on the part of M. Paul Dubois. I am lost in admiration of the deep aesthetic experience, the enlightenment of taste, re- vealed by such work. After that, I only hope that Giuseppe Garibaldi may have a monument as fair.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] Extrusion Blow Molding (EBM), plastic {{is melted}} and {{extruded}} {{into a hollow}} tube (a <b>parison).</b> This <b>parison</b> is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the <b>parison,</b> inflating it {{into the shape of}} the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected. [...] Continuous and Intermittent are two variations of Extrusion Blow Molding. In Continuous Extrusion Blow Molding the <b>parison</b> is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife. In Intermittent blow molding there are two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby the screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the <b>parison.</b> In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently. With continuous extrusion the weight of the <b>parison</b> drags the <b>parison</b> and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The accumulator head or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the <b>parison</b> out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a <b>parison</b> programming device.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have been made}} to simulate plastic blowmoulding and thermoforming processes.

To take into account the anisotropy induced by aligned ﬁbers, the material symmetry classis considered transversely isotropic. A general expression of the strain energy function in terms of tensorial invariants is developed and governing equations of the inﬂation problem are solved by a total Lagrangian ﬁnite element method for space discretization and an explicit ﬁnite-diﬀerence algorithm for time integration.

An instrument was designed to measure attitudes and administered to all faculty in a large urban, private university. Responses from 192 faculty members were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis; results indicated that the instrument contained 12 reliable factors. Further, correlational analyses pro vided preliminary support for the instrument's construct validity by showing that major constructs were associated with each other in expected directions. Descriptive analyses indicated that faculty generally had positive perceptions about students with LD and were willing to spend time supporting students with LD. Consis tent with prior research, faculty expressed greater willingness to provide minor, rather than major, accommodations.
