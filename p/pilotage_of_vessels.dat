50|$|<b>Pilotage</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary was {{overseen by}} Bristol until 1861, when Cardiff, Newport and Gloucester took concerted action {{because of the}} {{increase}} in the trades using the ports of Cardiff, Newport and Gloucester and petitioned Parliament to press for the passing of the Bristol Channel Pilotage Act 1861. This gave the ports the independence they sought. Pilotage Commissioners were constituted for these ports with powers to licence pilots for the non-compulsory pilotage of ships in the Bristol Channel and River Severn bound for these ports, each port having a defined area of jurisdiction. After a new dock was built in Sharpness in 1874 that was capable of handling larger vessels, the number of ships visiting the Gloucester docks declined and the custom house was moved to Sharpness. The Sharpness Lighthouse Authority were set up in 1888 to provide aids to navigation throughout the harbour area so that ships could enter the port both by day and night. The following year this became the Gloucester Harbour Authority which, as well as being responsible for lights in the estuary, were tasked with controlling navigation there. Gloucester Harbour Authority later evolved into the Gloucester Harbour Trustees, which later relocated to Sharpness; it is responsible for all pilotage in the estuary. The trustees also established moorings at Northwick Oaze south of Aust and created a deeper channel so that larger vessels could reach Sharpness more easily.|$|E
