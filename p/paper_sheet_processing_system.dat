In addition, the PC value of the blank <b>paper</b> <b>sheet</b> and the surface-sized <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> with by FBD and PFBD are, respectively, 9.84, 3.06, and 2.66. Obviously, the paper containing PFBD showed a better effect on the anti-UV aging than that of FBD, which may be due to a better water solubility the PFBD is, and good film-forming property the PFBD owns. PFBD has good water solubility with positive charge, which could enhance the combination with paper fiber. Besides, PFBD solution with cohesiveness could form a layer of thin film when it is coated on the surface of <b>paper</b> <b>sheet.</b> Therefore, the PFBD has a positive impact on the anti-UV aging as fluorescent brightener.|$|R

Our study compares the values of the contact angle and of the surface energy of laboratory handsheets produced with demineralized water and with white water (collected from the paper mill). In addition, and to assess the influence of paper roughness on the contact angle measurements, some 3 -D topographical parameters were computed by perfilometry. Complementary measurements were also performed with commercial paper samples. The results clearly demonstrate that the kind of water used in the sheet-making process has a more pronounced influence on the surface energy of the <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> than whether the <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> were made in a laboratory sheet former or in an industrial paper machine. Application: This study clarifies factors that have influence on the practical determination of the surface energy of <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> by contact angle measurements.

40|$|Footpad {{dermatitis}} (FPD) {{is a type}} of skin inflammation {{that causes}} necrotic lesions on the plantar surface of footpads in commercial poultry, with significant animal welfare and economic implications. To identify biomarkers for FPD development and wound healing, a battery cage trial was conducted in which a <b>paper</b> <b>sheet</b> was put on the bottom of cages to hold feces to induce FPD. Day-of-hatch Ross 308 male broiler chicks were fed a corn soybean meal diet and assigned to 3 treatments with 8 cages per treatment and 11 birds per cage. Cages without <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> were used as a negative control (NEG). Cages with <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> during the entire growth period (d 0 - 30) were used as a positive control (POS) to continually induce FPD. Cages with <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> during d 0 - 13 and without <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> during d 14 - 30 were used to examine the dynamic of FPD development and lesion wound healing (LWH). Footpad lesions were scored to grade (G) 1 to 5 with no lesion in G 1 and most severe lesion in G 5. Covering with <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> in POS and LWH induced 99 % incidence of G 3 footpads on d 13. Removing <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> from LWH healed footpad lesions by d 30. One representative bird, with lesions most close to pen average lesion score, was chosen to collect footpad skin samples for biomarker analysis. Total collagen protein and mRNA levels of tenascin X, type I α 1 collagen, type III α 1 collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3, and integrin α 1 mRNA levels were decreased (P < 0. 05), while mRNA levels of tenascin C, tumor necrosis factor α, Toll-like receptor 4, vascular endothelial growth factor, and IL- 1 β were increased (P < 0. 03) in G 3 footpads in POS and LWH compared to G 1 footpads in NEG on d 14. These parameters continued to worsen with development of more severe lesions in POS. After removing <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> (LWH), levels of these parameters returned to levels measured in NEG. In summary, these biomarkers were interrelated with dynamic changes of footpad lesion scores, suggesting they may be used as potential biomarkers for footpad lesion development and wound healing...|$|R

40|$|Cellulosic {{materials}} {{are used in}} a wide range of areas of application, and one of these is paperboard for packaging solutions. Paper or paperboard as a packaging material has benefits like low density, low costs, high stiffness, good printability, and paper is environmentally friendly. Compared to other packaging materials, such as plastics, paper has some weaknesses By improving some of its weaknesses, paper as a packaging material, can become more competitive on the market, and knowing how to utilize this resource in a more effective and sustainable way will become increasingly important in the future. One way to decrease the amount of fibers needed in paper and paperboard is by improving the strength properties of cellulose fibers. Greater fiber strength can be achieved by, for example crosslinking the fibers, and crosslinking can be achieved with only a small amount of chemicals. By using electromagnetic radiation, like ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the fibers can be crosslinked with the aid of a UV curing solution. Pretreatment of the fibers through an acrylic esterification reaction may enhance UV curing since polyester and acrylate groups are prone to be more reactive for UV radiation. In this thesis, UV curing of <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> with the aid of a UV curing solution is evaluated with tensile tests, microscopy and water retention measurements.

In the steel <b>sheet</b> <b>processing</b> line, {{the dynamics of}} sheets is represented by differential equation.

At the next step, control laws are extracted from the results obtained by receding horizon scheme. The method identifies probability weighted ARX (PrARX) functions as a controller. Some simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the identified controller can achieve fast and near-optimal control. ...|$|R
