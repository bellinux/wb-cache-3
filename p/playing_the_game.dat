5|$|In April 2009, it was {{proposed}} that the annual Apple Cup between the Seattle-based Huskies and the Pullman-based Cougars be hosted at CenturyLink Field for sixyears beginning in 2010. The two programs could not reach an agreement on how to divide tickets. Pullman's business community had expressed concerns that <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> away from the area would be detrimental to the local economy.|$|E

She was selected to represent Australia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in goalball.|$|E
5|$|The Season Six DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael berating and then apologizing to Erin, Michael making a racist remark about slavery while in character, various conference room scenes, and extended sequences {{of the members of}} the office <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in-character.|$|E

50|$|During the Vietnam War, two {{soldiers}} {{wait in the}} jungle to kill an enemy Vietcong fighter. While they wait they <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> of Botticelli. <b>The</b> enemy appears and the soldiers kill him, all the while continuing to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> <b>The</b> civilized and cultured nature of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> contrasts ironically with the brutal indifference of war.|$|R
5|$|The video then cuts {{to a shot}} of {{the band}} <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> before {{returning}} to the map screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes. The second level begins {{in much the same way}} as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right. The villain again stands in front of the players, laughing before disappearing. A boat/submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was also concerned about the restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for some time.|$|E
5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

50|$|Many {{reviews of}} the iOS/Android version of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{levelled}} criticism at the 'always-online' necessity, where the user needs {{to be connected to}} the Internet in order to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Reviewers stated that requirement made it difficult to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> while on <b>the</b> move.|$|R
50|$|The Go Club {{consists}} {{of students who}} <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> of Go. <b>The</b> Go Club sponsor Mr. Lochhead researched <b>the</b> unknown <b>game</b> and shared his new finding with his students.

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to play the game}} with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards. Analogously to simultaneous chess, this way of <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is referred to as simultaneous bughouse. It can also be played with just one clock by playing the boards in a specific order (WhiteA, WhiteB, BlackB, BlackA) and pressing the clock after each move. This variation is suitable for play by mail.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack {{features}} {{a wide range}} of musical styles, including chanting, string orchestra, and percussion. Upon release, the soundtrack was well received by critics. Some complimented the wide range of musical styles, and most agreed that <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is not required to enjoy the soundtrack. A special edition of the soundtrack was released on October 28, 2003, featuring a DVD with a trailer, demo movie, and high quality music for Halo 2.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} its release in August 2001, Funcom began {{offering}} free trial subscriptions, now common practice for other {{games in the}} MMOG genre. New players were able {{to sign up for}} accounts that remained free for a limited number of days. This required them to supply some personal information, including a credit card number. After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> at the cost of the monthly subscription fee.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is {{to see whether the}} graphic design of a game {{influences}} children’s will to play games. I am especially looking at minimalist graphic design and how well it works for a game aimed at children age 7 - 9. Does the style of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> design have any impact at all concerning the children’s wish to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> or is <b>the</b> <b>game</b> mechanic all that matters. The final results concluded that although <b>the</b> graphic design <b>plays</b> a part in the children’s willingness to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> mechanics are by far the biggest factor in whether children will <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> or not...|$|R
5|$|Various special editions and tournaments {{have been}} {{conducted}} which feature celebrities <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and donating winnings to charities of their choice. During celebrity editions on the original ABC version, contestants were allowed to receive help from their fellow contestants during the first ten questions. The most successful celebrity contestants throughout the show's run have included Drew Carey, Rosie O'Donnell, Norm Macdonald, and Chip Esten, all of whom won $500,000 for their respective charities. The episode featuring O'Donnell's $500,000 win averaged 36.1 million viewers, the highest number for a single episode of the show.|$|E
5|$|Woods collaborated {{closely with}} TAG Heuer {{to develop the}} world's first {{professional}} golf watch, which was released in April 2005. The lightweight, titanium-construction watch, designed to be worn while <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> incorporates numerous innovative design features to accommodate golf play. It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far {{in excess of the}} forces generated by a normal golf swing. In 2006, the TAG Heuer Professional Golf Watch won the prestigious iF product design award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category.|$|E
5|$|Adventure was {{published}} by the developer of the 2600 console, Atari, Inc, and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, but this required them to plan for their next game as they neared completion of their current one to stay productive. Robinett was finishing his work on Slot Racers when he was {{given an opportunity to}} visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version of the game.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> {{and the role of}} experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
30|$|In <b>the</b> <b>game</b> level 1, 2 and 3, {{we shall}} deem <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>playing</b> as well {{performed}} {{if students are}} able to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from “explore” through “known”. In level 4, 5 and 6, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is more difficult because a higher level of engineering methods are used, so <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>playing</b> is deemed well performed if {{students are able to}} <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from “explore” through “fluent”. If most students are able to <b>play</b> through <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> we may conclude that students’ abilities are high.|$|R

5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a four-part series {{published}} between April and August 1995, Brock {{returns to}} New York City in prusuit of supervillain Carnage after learning about Carnage Unleashed, {{a video game}} based on Carnage's rampage in Maximum Carnage (1993). Carnage discovers a method of transporting his symbiote through phone lines, which he uses to hack computers and attack people <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> He escapes from the Ravencroft asylum and kidnaps his caregiver, Dr. Pazzo. Venom confronts Carnage in cyberspace, before Pazzo douses Carnage in flammable liquid and sets him ablaze. Venom saves Carnage from dying, reasoning that death is what he wants. A subplot has Brock meeting Kirstin, a young musician. When Brock accidentally paralyzes her boyfriend Clive, Kirstin asks her mother to avenge him; this storyline continues in Venom: Sinner Takes All.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E
