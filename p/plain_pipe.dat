40|$|Creep {{failure of}} welds in {{high-temperature}} power plant steam piping systems {{is known to}} be a potential cause of plant failure. Creep behaviour of <b>plain</b> <b>pipes</b> with circumferential welds and cross-weld specimens have received fairly extensive attention. However, research into the creep behaviour of welded thick-walled branched steam pipes has received less attention. Consequently, this thesis addresses improving the understanding of the creep behaviour for this type of geometry. Numerical and analytical methods are used to assess the creep behaviour of typical power plant branched pipe geometries. The effects of various geometric and material parameters on the creep stress and creep life behaviour of the connections are studied. In particular, the effect of the differing creep properties associated with the various material regions of the weld are investigated. The importance of incorporation of weld properties in creep life assessments is thus assessed. Finite element steady-state and continuum damage mechanics creep analyses have been used to identify the relative creep strength of typical connections compared to <b>plain</b> <b>pipes.</b> The work identifies typical creep rupture locations within branched pipe welds and the associated damage accumulation at and around these positions. Various creep life assessment methods/procedures are used in practise: these are mainly the British Standard codes, British Energy's R 5 procedure, steady state creep approaches and continuum damage mechanics approaches. The relative accuracy and conservatism of these distinct approaches are addressed for the application to typical branched pipes. The general formulation of steady-state creep stress is applied to the parametric study of weld materials in a typical multi-material welded branched pipe. An approximate interpolation technique for power-law creep is implemented {{to reduce the number of}} analyses needed to span a wide range of material parameters. The method is used to estimate the creep stresses and lives at several critical regions within the various material zones of the weld. The advantages of the technique are related to the small number of analyses required and the simple and compact way of presenting the results for weld design and life assessment purposes.

The Lower Platte River in eastern Nebraska provides many resources for wildlife {{and a variety of}} stakeholders. This river and its major tributaries contain important nesting habitat for two state and federally-listed bird species, the Interior Least Tern (endangered; Sternula antillarum athalassos) and the Northern Great <b>Plains</b> <b>Piping</b> Plover (threatened; Charadrius melodus). Both species nest on bare or sparsely-vegetated expanses of sand in natural and human-created habitat, which occur in and along river channels; the Lower Platte River system is critical for the survival and recovery of both species. In contrast to other river systems in Nebraska, there is no programmatic agreement or framework that generates a comprehensive Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover policy on the Lower Platte River. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (NGPC) and the Tern and Plover Conservation Partnership (TPCP), in cooperation with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), are responsible for making and implementing management decisions in this region. Collectively, these decisions constitute a de facto tern and plover policy for the Lower Platte River. The fundamental challenge with regard to policy-making on the Lower Platte River is how to conserve terns and plovers while balancing the needs and concerns of stakeholders. This document serves as a foundation for developing management strategies for Interior Least Terns and Piping Plovers on the Lower Platte River. To meet this end, we provide a summary of the area’s geographic and political setting. Next, we provide detailed species descriptions for Interior Least Tern and Piping Plovers, including their ecology, population trends, and reasons for both species’ declines. Finally, we describe current management activities by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and the Tern and Plover Conservation Partnership. We hope that this document will facilitate meaningful discussion {{about the future of the}} Lower Platte River and the people and wildlife that depend on it. INTRODUCTION The Lower Platte River in Nebraska is an important resource for a variety of stakeholders. The river has been, and will continue to be, modified to meet the needs of these stakeholders. The modifications take two general forms, 1) use of the river’s water and 2) control of the annual hydrological variation in the river system. Examples of the first include water diversion for agricultural or industrial purposes and of the second include levee construction for flood control. Balancing the needs for natural resource use by people and conservation of imperiled species in the ecosystem presents a challenge for decision-makers, resource agencies, and stakeholders. Currently, the river retains the capacity to create and maintain habitat for wildlife that depend on the river. However, as demands on the river’s resources accumulate, the river system may reach a threshold beyond which the river will lose much of its natural function and become unable to create and maintain habitat for wildlife. This has occurred on the nearby Central Platte and Missouri rivers, and massive efforts are underway to restore the components of the former ecosystem so the wildlife and economies that rely on these rivers are able to survive. The Lower Platte River differs from the Central Platte and Missouri Rivers in that there is no omnibus agreement in place that controls the management of the river. Management of the Missouri River is dictated by congressional mandate (e. g., Flood Control Act of 1944 and USFWS Biological Opinion of 2003) and is carried out by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Management of the Central Platte River is influenced by local water use policy and by a three-state cooperative agreement (Platte River Recovery Implementation Program, [URL] that implements actions to provide habitat for imperiled wildlife. The Lower Platte River system provides habitat for two state and federally-listed bird species, the Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) and the Northern Great <b>Plains</b> <b>Piping</b> Plover (Charadrius melodus). Terns and plovers breed along the river during late spring and summer and spend the remainder of year in migration or on their wintering areas. Both species nest in aggregations on bare or sparsely-vegetated expanses of sand in natural and human-created habitat. Natural habitat consists of sandbars within the river channel, which are created and maintained by geomorphological processes. Human-created habitat occurs outside the river channel and is created by industrial or commercial activities (i. e., sand and gravel mining, dredging and construction). The Interior Least Tern is state and federally listed as endangered (50 Federal Register 21784 – 21792), and the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>Piping</b> Plover is state and federally listed as threatened (50 Federal Register 50726 – 50734). Federal listing is under authority of the Endangered Species Act (1973), and state listing is under authority of the Nebraska Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act (Revised Statutes of Nebraska 1943; Neb.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for fossil fuels increases, {{pipelines}} are constructed in inhospitable areas. Under these conditions, not only the strength but also the deformability of the pipelines becomes crucial. A strain based design (SBD) procedure needs to be established. Traditional stress based approaches to evaluate defect tolerance lead to conservative predictions. There {{is a need to}} accurately define the fracture toughness of the pipeline steel and assess the criticality of weld defects under strain based conditions. This paper focuses on the implementation of the unloading compliance method to determine stable crack growth. The standardized test procedure described in ASTM E 1820 is applied. This method is a handy tool to obtain the J-resistance curves which can forecast ductile failure in pipeline girth welds. Preliminary experiments have been performed on Single Edge Notch Bend (SENB) specimens of <b>plain</b> <b>pipe</b> metal. Using the implemented procedure, it was possible to obtain a good fit between calculated and measured crack size.

40|$|Subsea {{pipeline}} is {{a transportation}} infrastructure {{of oil and}} gas as an alternative for ship tanker. The uneven topography surface of the sea floor resulting the pipe undergoes free span. The free span is a condition endured by the pipe where the pipe position has  distance or gap with the seabed supported by two pivot. The free span is at risk of experiencing a vibration caused by the presence of dynamic load that is current and the wave. The vibration that occurs is the impact of the presence of the phenomenon of Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV). The Phenomenon Of VIV occur on a cylindrical component caused by ocean currents, causing the occurrence of vibration by the movement of fluid on the pipe so that it raises the vortex {{at the rear of the}} direction of oncoming flow. One way to dampen or reduce the impact of VIV is by adding suppresion device. VIV suppression device is a tool that is installed on the pipeline on offshore piping installationcthat serves to dampen or reduce the impact of VIV. One of the simulations used to know the characteristics of a fluid is to use (CFD) Computational Fluid Dynamic.

40|$|Existing {{experimental}} results are studied {{to determine the}} factors (including those not previously identified) affecting the strength of grouted connections. The current bond strength formula is evaluated and its limitations noted. Previous analytical work is examined and strengths and weaknesses investigated. A nonlinear finite element analysis is developed using a friction gap element to model the steel/grout bond. This includes a dilation effect when slip occurs and successfully simulates the behaviour of <b>plain</b> <b>pipe</b> connections up to ultimate load. An elastic-plastic, work-hardening, cracking and crushing constitutive model is developed to represent the behaviour of grout material. This is used for a detailed finite element analysis of the load-slip behaviour of individual shear keys of various shapes. The friction-gap element is adapted to give {{a representation of the}} shear keys using data derived from the detailed shear key analysis. A confinement factor is used to give higher ultimate shear key loads when the bond opening is small. This accounts for the observed fact that higher key loads are achieved with increased sleeve and pile dimensions due to greater confinement of the grout. Load-slip behaviour and strains up to ultimate load for shear keyed connections are successfully simulated using the friction-gap element. Bond stress distributions show that high normal bond stress concentrations are necessary to balance the bending moments in the grout annulus. Various extreme geometries are analysed and their failure modes determined. The effects of connection length, stiffeners, alternative loading arrangements, scale and shear key geometry are also fully investigated. Results are used to produce a new bond strength formula which takes into account most factors affecting bond strength and is stle to give good results over the full rang of geometries. Experimental tests have been conducted to determine the coefficient of friction between shot-blasted steel and grout for use in the numerical analyses...|$|E
40|$|Many {{components}} in conventional {{and nuclear power}} plant, aero-engines, chemical plant etc., operate at temperatures which are high enough for creep to occur. These include <b>plain</b> <b>pipes,</b> pipe bends, branched pipes etc., the manufacture of such components may also require welds to be inserted in them. In most cases, only nominal operating conditions (i. e., pressure, temperatures, system load, etc.) are known and hence precise life predictions are not possible. Also, the proportion of life consumed will vary from position to position within a component and the plant. Hence, nondestructive techniques are adopted to assist in making decisions on whether to repair, continue operating or scrap certain components. One such approach is to use scoop samples removed from the components to make small creep test specimens, i. e., sub-size uniaxial creep test specimens, impression creep test specimens, small punch creep test specimens, and small ring (circular or elliptical) creep test specimens. Each specimen type has its own unique advantages and disadvantages {{and it may not}} be obvious which one is the most appropriate test method to use.

The examination were tested to evaluate their influence on effectiveness of heat exchanger, heat transfer coefficient, number transfer unit and pressure drop at steady-state condition. Water was used as a working fluid in the double pipe heat exchanger where hot water flow in inner tube and cold water flow in outer tube. The study was conducted at the hot water mass flow rates between (0. 066 - 0. 198 kg/s) and (0. 1997 kg/s) cold water mass flow rate. The inlet temperatures of hot and cold water were (43 ᵒC) and (18 ᵒC) respectively.

The objective of this thesis is to study the heat transfer coefficient of nanofluid at various volume concentrations and Reynolds number using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software. This thesis describes the CFD analysis techniques to predict the heat transfer coefficient using FLUENT software. Aluminum Oxide, Al 2 O 3 /Water with 0. 02 %, 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % of volume concentration were studied in this thesis which commonly available nanofluid in market. The structural three-dimensional solid modelling of <b>plain</b> <b>pipe</b> tube was developed using the computer aided-drawing software, SolidWorks. The strategy of validation of CFD model was developed by comparing the result from water simulation with the available equation {{in the study of}} forced convection heat transfer. The CFD analysis was then performed using FLUENT with nanofluid as the working fluid. The CFD model of components was analyzed using the pressure based solver and k-epsilon viscous model. Finally, the bulk temperature and wall temperature of the working fluid obtained from the simulation are used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient of the fluid. From the result, it is observed that the heat transfer coefficient of base fluid, water is increased about 20 % in the presence of nanoparticles when Reynolds number and volume concentration are increase. But, increase in heat transfer coefficient by increasing volume concentration of nanofluid is valid when Reynolds number below 10, 000. Results obtained from simulation were then compared with the experiment and it is observed that a close agreement between simulation and experiment is achieved. Both simulation and experiment results concluded that the heat transfer coenfficient increase when nanofluid is used as the working fluid.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a combined experimental and computational {{study on the}} thermo-mechanical fatigue performance of welded P 91 material to (i) characterise the thermomechanical behaviour, and (ii) predict the number of cycles to fatigue crack initiation, for power plant P 91 material (including welded material) and components, operating under realistic loading conditions. A programme of isothermal high temperature low cycle fatigue (HTLCF) strain- and stress-controlled and thermo-mechanical fatigue tests on service-aged (SA) P 91 base metal, weld metal and welded specimens was conducted to characterise the thermo-mechanical performance of the P 91 parent, weld metal and heat-affected zone materials. Novel cross-weld test specimens, as well as weld and parent metal specimens, were manufactured here from a specially-fabricated P 91 weld repair header pipe, {{in collaboration with the}} plant operator. A sequentially coupled thermomechanical simulation methodology, using realistic temperature and pressure loading histories, was developed within a general-purpose, non-linear, finite element code to predict and analyse the thermomechanical behaviour of P 91 power plant components. An anisothermal cyclic viscoplasticity material model for P 91 parent material was developed and calibrated for both service-aged and as-new material, using the tests conducted within this thesis and published data. This constitutive model including isotropic softening, non-linear kinematic hardening and viscoplasticity (Norton power-law creep) terms to simulate the complex evolution of material hysteresis response. This calibrated material model formed the basis for a sequential thermo-mechanical methodology of power plant components, namely, a <b>plain</b> <b>pipe</b> and a branched connection from a fossil fuel plant in Ireland. This methodology also includes a transient heat transfer phase with sequential cyclic thermo-mechanical phase to simulate (i) a plant start-up, and (ii) a load-following scenario, based on measured data to identify key damaging events caused during plant operation. The transient heat transfer model was calibrated and validated against the measured plant start-up cycle data. For the branched connection, a global-sub-modelling framework was employed for detailed mesh refinement to identify the local thermomechanical stress-strain response at critical locations. A multiaxial, rain flow cycle counting methodology was developed for thermo-mechanical fatigue prediction using a critical-plane approach and applied to predict thermomechanical fatigue crack initiation at critical locations of the branched pipe sub-models. The results were shown to be consistent with plant operator experience and previously published experimental findings for similar plant connections. A key contribution of the present thesis is the development of a methodology for identification of the high temperature cyclic viscoplasticity parameters for the weld material and heat-affected zone, including isotropic softening, non-linear kinematic hardening and viscoplasticity terms. Theoretical and finite element models of the parent, weld and cross-weld test specimens were employed for identification of the cyclic viscoplasticity material parameters, via direct comparison with the measured hysteresis evolutions for the parent, weld and cross-weld specimens. The methodology developed, in direct collaboration with a power plant operator, provides a comprehensive framework for life assessment of existing, retrofitted and proposed new plant, for coal-fired and gas-fired operation. It will specifically allow assessment of the impact of more flexible plant operation to allow for renewable energy uptake and energy cost fluctuations and provides a framework for extension to future ultra-supercritical operation scenarios. This work also provides a more rational basis for experimental thermomechanical fatigue characterisation of candidate materials, as well as, design of tests for welded connections under power plant loading conditions...|$|E

ABS standard (ABS 2006) put forward a model to determine the maximum allowable moment. However, both methods have some weaknesses. Specifically, the model in the ABS standard is only applicable for pipes with a diameter/thickness ratio of 10 – 60, which cannot be used in pipes with larger diameter/thickness ratio. Also, it is limited by practicable materials and ignoring strain hardening effect; the ‘Mohareb–Murray interaction equation’ and model in ABS may overestimate or underestimate the critical bending moment (Nazemi 2009). Thus, accurately determining the critical bending moment is a crucial issue for predicting local buckling behavior. Currently, the critical compressive strain has been studied {{for a long time and}} some results have been used in practical standards, e.g., the formulation from Murphey and Langner (Gresnigt and Foeken 2001) has been used in American Bureau of Shipping (ABS 2006) and the research conducted by Gresnigt (1986) has been adopted by Canadian Standards Association (CSA 2007). Also, other standards provide similar design formulae of critical compressive strain (ASCE 1984; ALA 2001), which have been widely used in engineering design. However, critical compressive stress is currently poorly understood. Plantenma studied the buckling stress of circular cylinders and round tubes under compression conditions (Ahn et al. 2016), which are not applicable under bending loading conditions. These models mentioned above have not comprehensively considered the critical properties of strain hardening of high-strength pipelines with bending load. Thus, in this paper, the primary concern is about the local buckling of high-strength pipelines.|$|R
40|$|We counted least terns (Sterna antillarum) and piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) in Nebraska during June and July, 1991. This {{undertaking}} {{was part}} of an international effort to census the threatened piping plover throughout Canada and the United States. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) (1988) has called for the censusing of piping plovers every five years to monitor the status of the species and to gage the effectiveness of recovery efforts. This first international census of the piping plover has been organized by the USFWS 2 ̆ 7 s Great Lakes/Northern Great <b>Plains</b> <b>Piping</b> Plover recovery team. The census {{is one of the first}} attempts to complete a total count of one species of breeding shorebird. The least tern in the Great Plains is endangered and also requires periodic censusing (USFWS 1990). Because both species nest on the same river sandbars and adjacent sand and gravel pits (sandpits) in Nebraska, least terns were counted during the census of piping plovers. Study Area and Methods The distribution of the least tern and piping plover in Nebraska has been well known for several years. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, Platte River Whooping Crane Habitat Maintenance Trust, USFWS, and others began censusing in the late 1970 s. In the intervening years most stretches of river and sandpits used for nesting were identified. Sandpits (Figure 1) are areas mined for the commercial sale of sand and gravel and are usually located within 2 - 3 miles of a river. Three areas we included as sandpits consisted of sand and gravel that had been side casted along diversion canals from the Loup River (Loup River Diversion), South Platte River (Korty Diversion), and from near the confluence of the North and South Platte rivers (Central Diversion). Periodic dredging to keep the canals open creates and maintains a large expanse of barren sand and gravel. The barren sand and gravel at pits is similar to the barren sandbar substrate found in rivers (Kirsch 1991, Lingle 1990, Wilson 1991). We also surveyed pits that were no longer being actively mined but contained some suitable nesting substrate. Vegetation eventually will cover inactive sand and gravel areas and render them unsuitable as nesting habitat...|$|R
40|$|The optimum heat {{transfer}} condition for a tubular type solar receiver was investigated for various receiver pipe size, {{heat transfer}} fluid, and design requirement and constraint(s). Heat transfer {{of a single}} <b>plain</b> receiver <b>pipe</b> exposed to concentrated solar energy was modelled along the flow path of the heat transfer fluid. Three different working fluids, molten salt, sodium, and supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2) were considered in the case studies with different design conditions. The optimized ideal heat transfer condition was identified through fast iterative heat transfer calculations solving for all relevant radiation, conduction and convection heat transfers throughout the entire discretized tubular receiver. The ideal condition giving the best performance was obtained by finding the highest acceptable solar energy flux optimally distributed to meet different constraint(s), such as maximum allowable material temperature of receiver, maximum allowable film temperature of heat transfer fluid, and maximum allowable stress of receiver pipe material. The level of fluid side turbulence (represented by pressure drop in this study) was also optimized to give the highest net power production. As {{the outcome of the}} study gives information on the most ideal heat transfer condition, it {{can be used as a}} useful guideline for optimal design of a real receiver and solar field in a combined manner. The ideal heat transfer condition is especially important for high temperature tubular receivers (e. g. for supplying heat to high efficiency Brayton c...|$|R

Finally, the influence of mechanical constraints, of pipe geometry, of fluid physical properties, of wall material and offluid pressure on the global pipe dynamic response characteristics, and in particular on the fluid celerity, on the Machnumber and on the natural frequency, is evidenced...|$|R
50|$|Legend, as {{recorded}} in the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan) which is an ancient history of Japan compiled in 720, states that thaniwa was ordered {{at the time of}} an empress's death by the emperor who regretted the custom of servants and maids of the deceased following their master in death, and ordered that clay figures be molded and placed around the kofun burial mound instead of the sacrifice of living beings. Scholars doubt the authenticity of this story and contend that <b>plain</b> cylindrical clay <b>pipes</b> were the first haniwa forms, and that they were used in the manner of stakes to hold the earth of the burial mound in place. Later these plain cylindrical haniwa came to be decorated and to take various forms, including the shapes of houses and domestic animals as well as human beings. They have been found arranged in a circle around the mound, lending credence to the scholars' theory. However, the haniwa figures no doubt came to take on some sort of religious symbolism later, aside from their original practical purpose as stakes.|$|R
40|$|Threaded pipe {{connections}} {{are commonly used}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry in particular to connect casing strings, drillpipe strings or production and transportation risers and pipelines. In order to maintain a sealed and secure connection while in service, the connections are generally preloaded. To introduce this preload, the connections commonly have tapered threads and they are assembled by applying a certain make-up torque. The combination of the make-up torque and external loads results in a multiaxial stress distribution over the coupling, where the coupling’s threads act as stress raisers. When used in offshore environments, waves and currents cause dynamic loads acting on the pipelines. The {{pipe connections}} remain the weakest points because fatigue cracks can initiate in the connection’s threads. A wide variety of patented threaded pipe connection designs exists, all claiming to improve a connection’s fatigue life. However, experimental data for such designs, available in literature, is limited. Published studies generally comprise experiments on a single connection type. In addition, as no uniformity in testing setup, loading conditions and damage detection techniques exists, results from different studies can not be used for a detailed fatigue analysis to compare the designs. Furthermore, current design curves in codes and standards lead to overly conservative or inaccurate results. The aim of this work is to provide a better understanding of the fatigue mechanisms of threaded pipe connections and to study the effect of different design features on a connection’s fatigue life. Final goal is to formulate guidelines for new fatigue resistant connection designs. In this study, the API Line Pipe connection is used as a reference. Several modifications and design features are applied to this connection type. To simulate the influence of these modifications, a parametric 2 D axisymmetric finite element model, called ThreadGen, is developed. The results of this model are compared with a 3 D finite element simulation to prove its validity for both make-up and bending. In addition the results of the 2 D axisymmetric simulations are validated by static strain gauge measurements during a make-up test, an axial tension test, a bending test and an internal pressure test. The validated model is then used to evaluate the influence of connection properties and design features on the threaded connection’s behaviour. Test rigs are developed to perform fatigue experiments on three scales: the small scale experiments on 1 ” (33. 4 mm outer diameter) connections are performed in four-point bending; the medium scale tests on 4. 5 ” (114. 3 mm) connections are carried out under axial tension and in four-point bending; for full scale testing of specimens in the range of 150 mm to 500 mm in diameter a resonant bending fatigue setup is developed. A significant part of this work is dedicated to this last setup. Two <b>plain</b> <b>pipes</b> without a threaded connection are tested in the setup to characterize its dynamic behaviour and to measure the response of a pipe subjected to a certain excitation frequency. The testing of full scale threaded pipe connections in this setup is part of future research. The majority of the performed fatigue tests comprises small scale experiments. Several modified configurations are tested. For each configuration an S-N curve is constructed, so that the effect of a certain configuration on the connection’s fatigue life can be quantified. It is observed that a local modification of the threaded connection’s geometry as well as the connection’s contact conditions can have an important influence on the fatigue life of the connection. During the medium scale four-point bending tests, advanced measuring techniques are used to monitor the fatigue crack growth during the test. Although these are existing techniques, they are applied to crack sizing in threaded connections for the first time. A dynamic 3 D optical displacement measurement system is used to detect changes in the bending deflection shape of the pipe as a result of a propagating crack. Besides, a local crack opening measurement is carried out and modal analysis techniques are applied to monitor changes of the pipe’s eigenfrequencies. To visualize the crack fronts at different moments during the tests, a beach marking technique is used so that the exact crack shapes can be seen during post-mortem analysis. It is shown that a crack initiates at the root of the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection, and propagates gradually over a large segment of the circumference, forming a long shallow crack. When the crack penetrates the pipe wall, it rapidly increases in size along two crack fronts. The observed crack shapes do not have a semi-elliptical shape as commonly used in fracture mechanics. A fatigue crack growth analysis that considers the crack as an annular flaw, is effective in describing the crack growth behaviour. The results from the finite element simulations and the experimentally obtained S-N curves are combined in a multiaxial damage evolution law. Using this fatigue analysis, the observed trends in the fatigue lives of the configurations are explained. The general concept of using a connection’s thread load distribution as a measure for its fatigue life is proven to be inaccurate. The main reason for this is that the load distribution is related to the axial stresses over the connection. However, the fatigue life of a threaded connection is determined by the local multiaxial stress distribution and strain range around the root of the last engaged thread. These local conditions are not only the result of the load distribution, but they are also affected by the hoop stress introduced during make-up, which can additionally be affected by a changed connection stiffness. In addition, the multiaxial damage evolution law is used to analyse the influence of several features on a connection’s fatigue life. Not for all patented modifications an increased fatigue life is predicted when applied to the API Line Pipe connection. It is finally stated that to optimize a fatigue resistant connection, it is appropriate to combine several design features. The thread shape can be optimized to obtain a low stress concentration factor and reduce the local strains at the thread root. The connection global geometry and make-up conditions can be optimized to improve the load distribution over the threads and reduce local stresses and strains at the threads...|$|R
40|$|Threatened and {{endangered}} migratory birds present {{a challenge to}} conservation efforts because they use different habitats during {{different times of the}} year. As a result, successful efforts in one part of their range may be nullified by negative events taking place in other parts of their range. In many cases, information that links individual birds or populations to specific breeding, non-breeding, and migratory areas across the species 2 ̆ 7 range is not available. Without these links, {{it can be difficult to}} coordinate conservation efforts across the species 2 ̆ 7 range, and species recovery efforts may be less effective. The observation of uniquely marked individuals can be useful in linking different regions and habitats used throughout a species 2 ̆ 7 annual cycle. As part of our efforts to monitor and protect Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) in Nebraska, we initiated a research and banding program in 2008. Here we describe the color banding scheme we are using along the lower Platte River and report re-sightings of color banded plovers from non-breeding areas along the United States Gulf Coast. In the United States, the Great <b>Plains</b> population of <b>Piping</b> Plovers is federally listed as threatened. In Nebraska, the Piping Plover is listed as a state threatened species. The authority for this listing status is provided by the Nebraska Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act (Nebraska Revised Statutes §§ 37 : 801 – 811). Historically, Piping Plover numbers declined as a result of unregulated hunting (Bent 1927), but the principal reason for the current decline is the continuing loss of breeding habitat due to human activity (USFWS 1988, 2009, Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004, [URL] In addition to the loss of breeding habitat, Piping Plovers in the Great Plains are threatened by wild, feral, and pet animal predation; water pollution; hydro-peaking; shoreline stabilization and bank armoring; loss of river sandbars; and the consequences of water management decisions (Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004, [URL] [URL] Efforts by state and federal agencies and NGOs are underway to help plover populations recover across their range...|$|R
