40|$|Recovery of {{actinides}} is {{an integral}} part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Pyrometallurgical nuclear fuel recycling processes have been developed in the past for recovering actinides from spent metallic and nitride fuels. The process is essentially to dissolve the spent fuel in a molten salt and then extract just the actinides for reuse in a reactor. Extraction is typically done through electrorefining, which involves electrochemical reduction of the dissolved actinides and plating onto a cathode. Knowledge of a number of basic thermokinetic properties of salts and salt-fuel mixtures is necessary for optimizing present and developing new approaches for <b>pyrometallurgical</b> waste <b>processing.</b> The properties of salt-fuel mixtures are presently being studied, but there are so many solutes and varying concentrations that direct experimental investigation is prohibitively time consuming and expensive (particularly for radioactive elements like Pu). Therefore, there is a need to reduce the number of required experiments through modeling of salt and salt-fuel mixture properties. This project will develop first-principles-based molecular modeling and simulation approaches to predict fundamental thermokinetic properties of dissolved actinides and fission products in molten salts. The focus of the proposed work is on property changes with higher concentrations (up to 5 mol%) of dissolved fuel components, where there is still very limited experimental data. The properties predicted with the modeling will be density, which is used to assess the amount of dissolved material in the salt; diffusion coefficients, which can control rates of material transport during separation; and solute activity, which determines total solubility and reduction potentials used during electrorefining. The work will focus on La, Sr, and U, which are chosen to include the important distinct categories of lanthanides, alkali earths, and actinides, respectively. Studies will be performed using LiCl-KCl salt at the eutectic composition (58 mol% LiCl, 42 mol% KCl), which is used for treating spent EBR-II fuel. The same process being used for EBRII fuel is currently being studied for widespread international implementation. The methods will focus on first-principles and first- principles derived interatomic potential based simulations, primarily using molecular dynamics. Results will be validated against existing literature and parallel ongoing experimental efforts. The simulation results will be of value for interpreting experimental results, validating analytical models, and for optimizing waste separation by potentially developing new salt configurations and operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Australia has {{abundant}} {{deposits of}} laterite ores which role in production of nickel is increasing with rising demand for nickel and depletion of sulphide reserves. Laterite ores cannot be efficiently upgraded prior to <b>pyrometallurgical</b> or hydrometallurgical <b>processing</b> what leads to significant challenges in extraction of nickel. The PhD project was undertaken within the ARC (Australian Research Council) Discovery Grant (Project No. DP 1094880) which examined {{a novel approach}} to processing of laterite ores based on the selective reduction of the ore and extraction of nickel by carbonylation of the selectively reduced ore. Selective reduction of the laterite ore was studied by J. Yang in his PhD project (Yang, 2014). The ultimate aim of this project was to establish the feasibility of extraction of nickel by carbonylation of selectively reduced laterite ore. The project undertook a systematic study of carbonylation of pure nickel and iron, and carbonylation of selectively reduced laterite ore to develop a further understanding of carbonylation reactions and extraction of nickel from laterite ore by carbonylation. Specific objectives of this study included: 1) to {{study the effects of}} reaction parameters on carbonylation of nickel and iron, including reaction temperature (80 - 100 °C), carbon monoxide (gauge) pressure (0 - 56 atm), gas flow rate (0. 14 - 0. 50 L/min), nickel mass (0. 8 - 3. 2 g) and particle sizes (0. 29 – 2. 67 µm), and the effect of sulphur-containing catalysts (sulphur, iron sulphide and hydrogen sulphide); 2) to study the non-catalytic and catalytic carbonylation of laterite ores; the impacts of reduction conditions; and effects of reaction parameters; 3) to develop further understanding of kinetics and mechanisms of carbonylation processes. Pure metals and nickel-iron mixture were prepared by the reduction of associated oxides by hydrogen at 500 °C (gas flow rate 1. 0 L/min); the degree of reduction of oxides was over 98 %. Two types of Australian laterite ores supplied by CSIRO were examined (labelled by CSIRO) : BCS ore containing 1. 35 wt% Ni, 10. 4 wt% Fe and 0. 038 wt% Co, particle size 53 - 200 µm; and MIN ore with particle sizes 38 - 53 µm, 75 - 90 µm, 140 - 200 µm, and 355 - 495 µm, containing 1. 68 - 2. 37 wt% Ni, 8. 90 - 11. 8 wt% Fe and 0. 135 - 0. 144 wt% Co). Selective reduction of laterite ores was conducted by CO-CO 2 gas mixture (60 vol% CO) at 750 °C. Carbonylation experiments were conducted in a flexible U – shaped reactor (max pressure 68 atm) immersed into the oil bath. Carbonylation was studied using CO at different pressures. Carbonyls were absorbed by aqua regia in two Dreschel bottles. Samples were taken from the aqua regia solution at different times and analysed by ICP-OES. The extent of carbonylation was calculated using results of the ICP-OES analysis. The non-catalytic carbonylation of nickel at 100 °C and CO pressure 27 atm was close to completion (extent of reaction was 98 %) in about 5. 5 hours. Carbonylation of pure iron was slow; the extent of iron carbonylation at 100 °C and CO pressure up to 55 atm (gauge) was less than 5. 0 %. The extent of cobalt carbonylation under these conditions was less than 0. 5 %. Sulphur containing catalysts accelerated the carbonylation reaction. The time for a complete carbonylation of nickel was shortened from 5. 5 hours in the non-catalytic reaction to 2 hours in the catalytic carbonylation at 100 °C and CO pressure 14 atm. The extent of non-catalytic carbonylation of nickel from the selectively reduced BCS laterite ore at 100 °C and CO pressure 41 atm was below 50 %. The use of catalysts in the carbonylation of selectively reduced ore was inefficient. The major parameter affecting the rate of ore carbonylation was the particle size. The rate of reaction increased significantly with decreasing particle size; the carbonylation of nickel in MIN ore with the particle size 38 - 53 and 75 - 90 µm, was close to completion after 4 hours reaction. Results of a systematic study of the carbonylation of nickel and selectively reduced laterite ores are significant for further understanding of carbonylation reactions. Promising results were obtained for further development of technology of extraction of nickel from laterite ores by the carbonylation process...|$|R

The accomplishment of this target faces problems related mainly to the fine dissemination and interweaving of mineralogical phases and the present work is focused on addressing the associated mineralogical issues.

The {{production}} of Platinum Group Metals (PGM) normally entails the smelting of PGM flotation concentrates, converting of the furnace matte and {{removal of the}} bulk of the Ni, Cu, Co, S and Fe through atmospheric and pressure leaching in a base metals refinery to produce a PGM-rich concentrate. A number of impurities, mostly Se, Te, As, Bi, Os and Pb, are not removed significantly during the oxidising leach process in sulphuric acid media. In addition slag inclusions in matte leads to contamination of the PGM residues with silica, fayalite, magnetite and trevorite phases. Furthermore some Cu, Ni, Fe and S also remain. For this reason a typical Precious Metal Refinery (PMR) feed material contains less than 65 % PGMs. The PMR is based on a chloride process and requires contaminants to be within narrow specification limits to prevent the formation of PGM residues that must be reprocessed or tolled, leading to poor first pass metal efficiencies and extending the duration of the production pipeline for efficient recovery. A process has been developed to significantly upgrade the BMR leach residues through <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processing,</b> which include a multistep process of roasting under oxidisin...|$|E
40|$|The {{major issue}} in {{stainless}} steelmaking is the difficulty of oxidising carbon from molten steel without also oxidising large proportions of expensive chromium. This can, however, be achieved by reducing the partial pressure of the gaseous product of carbon oxidation, carbon monoxide, by dilution with argon. Modern stainless steelmaking is dominated by duplex processes which prepare a high carbon melt in an electric arc furnace, and then decarburise it in an argon-oxygen decarburisation (AOD) converter. In this work, the thermodynamic basis of preferential carbon oxidation by dilution of oxygen with argon is discussed, together with a review of AOD practice. The AOD process was simulated using computational thermodynamics software to illustrate {{the way in which}} it can achieve very low carbon levels in the molten steel bath without excessive cooxidation of chromium. The slag reduction stage using ferrosilicon additions was also modelled and shown to be able to recover almost all oxidised chromium from the slag, limited only by the accompanying increase in the silicon content of the steel. The models, although simple and easy to develop, correctly predicted all trends in output variables as input parameters were changed and often matched plant data very well. The models provide a valuable learning tool for those interested in <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processing</b> in general, and stainless steelmaking in particular...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} zinc {{extraction}} from spinels through hydro and <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processing.</b> Two zinc-bearing spinels are covered: zinc ferrite ZnO·Fe 2 O 3 {{to a limited}} extent and gahnite ZnO·Al 2 O 3 as the main subject, compounds which are found naturally on the Earth’s crust {{as well as in}} industrial residues from the zinc industry, steel industry and others. Zinc ferrite contains 27 % of Zn and 33 % as ZnO; resource recovery from ferrite has been studied already in the past. On the other hand, the processing of gahnite, containing 35 % of Zn and 44 % as ZnO, is studied more extensively since research in the field of extractive metallurgy is effectively non-existent. Hence, the main objective of the present thesis is finding routes of treatment for this spinel. Zinc ferrite was produced synthetically at the CiTG/ 3 mE labs by mixing equimolar amounts of ZnO and Fe 2 O 3 at 1100 °C. Gahnite was produced by an analog method, a mixture of equimolar amounts of ZnO and Al 2 O 3. The first approach was hydrometallurgical. Atmospheric hot acid leaching (4 M, 95 °C, 120 min, L/S 40) was performed with H 2 SO 4, HCl and HNO 3, resulting in a non-detected dissolution of the compound. Pressure leaching (90 min, L/S 40) was carried out in an autoclave with H 2 SO 4 and HNO 3, resulting in a low (2. 9 %; 0. 75 M, 140 °C, 3. 6 bar) and a moderate extraction (22. 2 %; 4. 0 M, 250 °C, 39. 7 bar) respectively. The second approach was <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processing</b> (60 min dwell, 10 °C/min heating rate), divided into two sub-routes. A series of carbothermic tests (1 : 1. 25 stoichiometric ratio) successfully led to a full reduction of the spinel at 1300 °C (99. 90 % extraction of zinc). Aluminothermic tests (1. 5 : 2 stoichiometric ratio) successfully resulted in a 99. 98 % zinc extraction at 1200 °C. The mix of gahnite and ferrite with carbon at 1300 °C produced a 99. 65 % extraction of the metal. Addition of ZnO to the previous mixture resulted in a 100 % extraction, at 1300 °C. Further experiments with gahnite at 1200 °C by adding SiO 2, first with carbon and later with aluminium, resulted in a moderate 23. 14 % and a low 4. 69 % extraction correspondingly. Trials with CaO at 1400 °C created a glass residue and a slag, in each case. It is thus possible to establish the zinc extraction from gahnite ZnO·Al 2 O 3 as follows: Route / Zinc extraction Atmospheric acidic leaching / Non-detected Pressure leaching / Low – Moderate Reduction with aluminium and silica / Low Reduction with carbon and silica / Moderate Carbothermic reduction / Full Aluminothermic reduction / FullEuropean Mineral Engineering CourseGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Waste of {{electronics}} and electrical equipment (WEEE or e-waste) {{can be viewed}} as a resource for metals, as it does not only contain the common metals like iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), lead (Pb) and copper (Cu) but also traces of precious and rare elements such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), tin (Sn), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), tantalum (Ta), cobalt (Co) and indium (In). The recovery of these trace elements is vital, not just because it has high commercial values, but also for resources efficiency. One of the existing industrial routes for processing of e-waste is through the primary and secondary Cu smelting processes. During these processes, the trace elements are distributed in different phases, i. e. in metal/matte, slag and gas. Different elements have different thermodynamic properties that govern the partitioning behaviour during the process. There has been a number of studies on the distribution behaviour of the trace elements relevant to primary Cu smelting (extraction of metals from virgin ores). However, there are only limited thermodynamics data relevant to secondary Cu smelting (extraction of metals from secondary/recycled sources). This paper reviews the thermodynamics data relevant for recovering the trace valuable elements from the primary Cu as well as secondary Cu smelting. These data and knowledge provide the basis for determining the optimum conditions favourable for recovering the trace valuable elements in e-waste through the industrial Cu <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>processing...</b>|$|E
