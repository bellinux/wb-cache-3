500|$|The Villard circuit, due to Paul Ulrich Villard, {{consists}} simply of {{a capacitor}} and a diode. While {{it has the}} great benefit of simplicity, its output has very poor ripple characteristics. Essentially, the circuit is a diode clamp circuit. The capacitor is charged on the negative half cycles to the peak AC voltage (Vpk). [...] The output is the superposition of the input AC waveform and the steady DC of the capacitor. [...] The effect of the circuit is to shift the DC value of the waveform. [...] The negative peaks of the AC waveform are [...] "clamped" [...] to 0V (actually −VF, the small forward bias voltage of the diode) by the diode, therefore the positive peaks of the output waveform are 2Vpk. The <b>peak-to-peak</b> ripple is an enormous 2Vpk and cannot be smoothed unless the circuit is effectively turned {{into one of the}} more sophisticated forms.

2500|$|Different {{waveforms}} can be {{used for}} different electrosurgical procedures. [...] For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. [...] Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V <b>peak-to-peak)</b> the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone {{at the edges of the}} lesion. Open circuit voltage in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300–10,000 V <b>peak-to-peak.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A bang-bang {{charge pump}} phase {{detector}} must {{always have a}} dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector detects no phase error. For this reason, bang-bang phase detectors [...] are associated with significant minimum <b>peak-to-peak</b> jitter, because of drift within the dead band. However these types, having outputs consisting of very narrow pulses at lock, are very useful for applications requiring very low VCO spurious outputs. [...] The narrow pulses contain very little energy and are easy to filter out of the VCO control voltage. [...] This results in low VCO control line ripple and therefore low FM sidebands on the VCO.|$|E

2500|$|This {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of a minimum of 20% delta waves ranging from 0.5–2Hz and having a <b>peak-to-peak</b> amplitude >75 μV.

This is the stage in which parasomnias such as night terrors, nocturnal enuresis, sleepwalking, and somniloquy occur. Many illustrations and descriptions still show a stage N3 with 20–50% delta waves and a stage N4 with greater than 50% delta waves; these have been combined as stage N3.|$|E
2500|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There {{is a large}} AC ripple voltage component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier. [...] Ripple voltage is usually specified <b>peak-to-peak.</b> Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a reservoir capacitor or smoothing capacitor), choke, resistor, zener diode & resistor, or voltage regulator placed at {{the output of the}} rectifier. [...] In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce ripple voltage to a level tolerable by the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Rogue {{waves are}} an open water phenomenon, in which winds, currents, {{non-linear}} phenomena such as solitons, and other circumstances cause a wave to briefly form {{that is far}} larger than the [...] "average" [...] large occurring wave (the significant wave height or 'SWH') of that time and place.

However, ripple voltage is also commonly expressed as the <b>peak-to-peak</b> value.

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{usefulness}} {{in carrying out}} power calculations, listed voltages for power outlets (e.g., 120 V in the USA, or 230 V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values.

Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120 × √2, or about 170 volts. The <b>peak-to-peak</b> voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts.
