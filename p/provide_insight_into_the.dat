5|$|Norcross was afforded {{a privileged}} {{education}} {{that was not}} available to many young ladies of her generation. At 16 years of age, she graduated from Fitchburg High School, and, beginning in 1870, she attended Wheaton Female Seminary, now Wheaton College. When she was 16 and 17 years old she wrote essays for Rushlight, the school's literary journal. The nature of her essays <b>provide</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woman she would become: one who would successfully operate in a male-oriented society, {{had an interest in}} bettering the plight of others, and appreciated historical things. She graduated in 1872. Frances Vose Emerson was a classmate at Wheaton, good friend from childhood, and ultimately a trustee for the Fitchburg Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|The Gedi ruins {{were first}} {{discovered}} by colonialists in 1884 after a British resident of Zanzibar, Sir John Kirk, visited the site.

Initial excavations at Gedi began in the late-1940s, and the site today {{remains one of the}} most intensely studied Swahili Coast settlements. The significance of the ruins has been largely used to assess the sites role within the region in association with other sites to <b>provide</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> development of Swahili culture, the organization of Indian Ocean trade, the introduction and spread of Islam, and the political and economic ties between Swahili communities through their cultural remains and their spatial relationships.|$|E
5|$|Hampton National Historic Site, in the Hampton area {{north of}} Towson, Baltimore County, Maryland, USA, {{preserves}} {{a remnant of}} a vast 18th-century estate, including a Georgian manor house, gardens, grounds, and the original stone slave quarters. The estate was owned by the Ridgely family for seven generations, from 1745 to 1948. The Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in America when it was completed in 1790 and today {{is considered to be}} one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the U.S. Its furnishings, together with the estate's slave quarters and other preserved structures, <b>provide</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> life of late 18th-century and early 19th-century landowning aristocracy. In 1948, Hampton was the first site selected as a National Historical Site for its architectural significance by the U.S. National Park Service. The grounds were widely admired in the 19th century for their elaborate parterres or formal gardens, which have been restored to resemble their appearance during the 1820s. Several trees are more than 200years old. In addition to the mansion and grounds, visitors may tour the overseer's house and slave quarters.|$|E

25|$|A model {{organism}} is a non-human {{species that}} is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, {{with the expectation}} that discoveries made in the organism model will <b>provide</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.|$|E

Representative samples were collected by the various operational units of the Project and laboratory deformation experiments were performed in Eni and in NorskHydro mechanical laboratories.|$|E

25|$|In fact, {{some of the}} theories, {{like the}} social {{learning}} theory and theory of planned behaviour, were developed as attempts to improve health education.

Although health education is still the area in which behavioural change theories are most often applied, theories like the stages of change model have begun to be applied in other areas like employee training and developing systems of higher education.|$|E
25|$|Military mail is mail {{associated}} {{with any of the}} armed services or peacekeeping forces, or formed around any particular military campaign, like the First and Second Opium Wars, Spanish Civil War, World War I and II, or even the recent conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq. Covers mailed from navy vessels are also widely sought, the cover usually having a distinctive postmark bearing the ship's name and date of mailing, the date often being of particular historical significance and interest.

25|$|Viral control efforts {{can also}} impact {{the rate at}} which virus populations evolve, thereby {{influencing}} phylogenetic patterns. Phylodynamic approaches that quantify how evolutionary rates change over time can therefore <b>provide</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of control strategies. For example, an application to HIV sequences within infected hosts showed that viral substitution rates dropped to effectively zero following the initiation of antiretroviral drug therapy. This decrease in substitution rates was interpreted as an effective cessation of viral replication following the commencement of treatment, and would be expected to lead to lower viral loads. This finding is especially encouraging because lower substitution rates are associated with slower progression to AIDS in treatment-naive patients.|$|E
