5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{the wake}} of the {{newspaper}} stories regarding the murder, the Viscount was reminded of the theft and demanded a search for the jewels in Marie's room in Le Glandier. When the jewels turned up during the search, some newspapers believed her and <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> blame on the Viscountess. However, when she was put on trial for theft, the court was not so persuaded. Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle.|$|E

25|$|Another ancient flood myth is the Hindu {{story of}} Matsya the fish. According to this story, the god Vishnu {{takes the form}} of a fish and warns the {{ancestor}} Manu about a coming flood. He tells Manu to <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> creatures of the earth into a boat. Unlike the Biblical and Mesopotamian floods, however, this flood is not a unique event brought on by a divine choice; instead, it's one of the destructions and recreations of the universe that happen at regular intervals in Hindu mythology.|$|E

After the City of Miami started a study of Southern Bell telephone rates, the Florida Public Service Commission ordered major reductions in those rates. High also led a fight to force the Florida East Coast Railway to pay the arrears in its assessed property taxes. While High was Mayor, Miami adopted a $10,000 spending limit for city elections.|$|E

Daniel Christian was termed as million dollar baby as he was hardly known to the world cricket at that point of time. Chargers did pick very good players in Cameron White, JP Duminy, Ishant Sharma, Dale Steyn and skipper Kumar Sangakkara. But at the same time Chargers lost many of Indian players such RP Singh and Rohit Sharma as well as Australians Andrew Symonds and Adam Gilchrist.|$|E

25|$|Athelstan's {{court had}} been an {{intellectual}} incubator. In that court were two young men named Dunstan and Æthelwold who were made priests, supposedly {{at the insistence of}} Athelstan, right {{at the end of his}} reign in 939. Between 970 and 973 a council was held, under the aegis of Edgar, where a set of rules were devised that would be applicable throughout England. This <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> monks and nuns in England under one set of detailed customs for the first time. In 973, Edgar received a special second, 'imperial coronation' at Bath, and from this point England was ruled by Edgar under the strong influence of Dunstan, Athelwold, and Oswald, the Bishop of Worcester.|$|E
25|$|The {{eldest of}} eight children, Laine {{grew up in}} the Old Town {{neighborhood}} (first at 1446 N. North Park Avenue and later at 331 W.

He later attended Lane Technical High School, where he helped to develop his lung power and breath control by joining the track and field and basketball teams. He realized he wanted to be a singer when he missed time in school to see Al Jolson's current talking picture, The Singing Fool. Jolson would later visit Laine when both were filming pictures in 1949, and at about this time, Jolson remarked that Laine was going to <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other singers out of business.|$|E
25|$|On {{all their}} {{projects}} since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer Wolfgang Volz. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately {{when we were young}} because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E

25|$|Eventually {{a man was}} sighted who {{approached}} the settlement shouting. When near enough to be heard, he cried that Menéndez had taken the French fort and <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> French to the sword. A procession was formed to go forth and meet the victor. Soon after his triumphant reception in the fort, Menéndez heard of Ribault's party having been wrecked, and learned that a detachment had {{made its way to}} Matanzas Inlet. After an ineffective interview and an offer of 100,000 ducats ransom, the Huguenots surrendered to Menéndez, and met the same fate as their comrades at Fort Caroline. A second party, with Ribault himself, were also slain {{at the hands of the}} Spanish. A few, however, who belonged to the Catholic faith, were spared. The Indians, who had been particularly friendly with the French, resented the Spanish invasion and the cruelty of Menéndez, and led by their chief Saturiwa, made war upon the Spanish settlers. The latter were running short of provisions and mutinied during the absence of Menéndez, who had gone back to Cuba for relief, and who finally had to seek it from the King in person in 1567.|$|E
