5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E

50|$|A {{local court}} later came down {{heavily on the}} Calangute <b>police</b> <b>saying</b> that they {{exercised}} their power of arrest arbitrarily against four staff members of Fabindia's Candolim outlet who were held late on April 3.|$|R
25|$|The common {{denominator}} for {{people on a}} special police list is being or married to a Romani person. A register of 4029 Romani people is kept by police. The <b>police</b> <b>say</b> the document is a register of criminal people and their associates used for fighting crime in Skane despite people being on it that have no connection with Skane or any association with criminal people.|$|E

Police went to Ichihashi's apartment after Lindsay's flatmates had indicated she had gone there to teach an English lesson, but the suspect managed to escape. He was captured in Osaka on 10 November 2009.|$|E
25|$|After the accident, {{the vehicle}} fled {{the scene and}} {{proceeded}} without stopping to the U.S. Consulate, jettisoning items outside Faletti's Hotel. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> they included four magazines containing 100 bullets, various battery cells, a baton, scissors, a pair of gloves, a compass with knife, a black coloured mask/blindfold, {{and a piece of}} cloth bearing the American flag.

5000|$|In a {{judgement}} in December 2008, the European Court of Human Rights {{ruled that}} two British men {{should not have}} had their DNA and fingerprints retained by <b>police</b> <b>saying</b> that retention [...] "could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society".|$|R
25|$|On 15 May 2014, {{the captain}} and three crew members were charged with murder, while the other 11 members of the crew were indicted for abandoning the ship. An arrest warrant was also issued for Yoo Byung-eun, the owner of Chonghaejin Marine, which {{operated}} Sewol, {{but he could not}} be found despite a nationwide manhunt. On 22 July 2014, police revealed that they had established that a dead man found in a field 415 kilometres south of Seoul was Yoo. Foul play was ruled out, but <b>police</b> <b>say</b> they have yet to establish the cause of Yoo's death.|$|E
25|$|Police {{allege that}} Gaines, though not {{actively}} affiliated with any specific anti-government group, identified and behaved as a ‘free person’ {{who does not}} recognize governmental authority. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> there have been multiple threats to police following the incident, and have called for patience while the incident is being investigated. Because of threats against officers, police have opted not to identify the officer who killed Gaines during the incident, though the department’s standard procedure is to release the names of officers involved in shootings about 48 hours after such an incident. In a county report, the officer {{is described as a}} 46-year-old white male.|$|E
25|$|In December, 1997, several Canadian {{police forces}} formed a {{joint task force}} to manage their {{investigation}} into sniper attacks against three Canadian doctors, Romalis of Vancouver; Hugh Short of Ancaster, Ontario; and Jack Fainman of Winnipeg, Manitoba. On the joint task force were representatives of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the police forces of Vancouver, Hamilton, and Winnipeg. The <b>police</b> <b>say</b> that sniper attacks against Canadian physicians are terrorist acts and that {{the hunt for the}} attackers deserves a coordinated national effort. In 2001, James Kopp was charged with the shooting of Dr. Hugh Short and is suspected of committing the other two shootings. Kopp is currently in prison in the USA for the 1998 sniper-style murder of Barnett Slepian, an American physician from Amherst, New York who performed abortions.|$|E
5000|$|A 23-year-old {{woman in}} Faisalabad made public accusations against the <b>police,</b> <b>saying</b> {{her husband had}} been arrested for {{creating}} forged documents; she alleges she was raped on the orders of the chief of police for her actions. The officer was suspended but not arrested.|$|R
5000|$|Foote denied {{making the}} claim that Duggan had fired at <b>police,</b> <b>saying</b> he was [...] "surprised" [...] that early reports of the {{incident}} described a [...] "shoot out". The IPCC later conceded it had misled journalists shortly after the shooting by saying that shots were exchanged.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2015, the High Court in Wellington {{declared}} the warrant used to search Hager's house [...] "fundamentally unlawful". The judge criticised the <b>police</b> <b>saying</b> the way detectives went about obtaining the warrant was [...] "not {{the type of}} facilitation that I consider the Search and Surveillance Act anticipates".|$|R
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E
25|$|Some {{news outlets}} have called into {{question}} why the Baltimore County Crisis Intervention Team was not deployed. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> trained negotiators were involved but could not respond {{as to why the}} unit was not dispatched. Others suggest there are deficiencies in the way law enforcement attempt to deescalate interactions in minority communities, suggesting that Gaines' interactions with police may have been shaped by attitudes and beliefs regarding police and the justice system in urban black communities. According to Vox Media reports, legally, the police officers only must reasonably believe that their lives were in immediate danger, but are not required to ascertain whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat, however, activists maintain the police should have sought other means of resolving the conflict. Others have called for the hiring of more female police officers, arguing that policewomen {{would be less likely to}} use lethal force to resolve conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Police {{telephone}} logs {{had been}} entered as evidence during the trial, {{but had not}} been noticed by Bamber's lawyers. Bamber's new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the radio log that, they say, shows Neville called police that night to say his daughter had [...] "gone berserk" [...] {{with one of his}} guns. A separate log of a police radio message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> the officers simply made a mistake.|$|E
50|$|On July 11, 2007, K.D. made a {{complaint}} to the <b>police,</b> <b>saying</b> that the activity was not consensual, although she later recanted her statement. J.A. {{was charged with}} aggravated assault, sexual assault, attempting to render a person unconscious in order to sexually assault them, and breaching a probation order.|$|R

500|$|Nitin Ganatra {{who plays}} Masood Ahmed {{explains}} to Digital Spy Masood's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away. [...] "Masood goes crazy over this!" [...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The <b>police</b> <b>say</b> that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Experts {{say that}} sexting poses a serious problem, partly because teens do not {{understand}} that the images are permanent and can be spread quickly. [...] "It does not click that what they’re doing is destructive, let alone illegal." [...] "Once they are out there, it spreads like a virus," [...] <b>police</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... {{organized}} by Sumoud at the El Salon cafe, {{when he was}} arrested by Montreal police. Reports conflict as to what happened exactly. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> they were responding to an allegation of assault reported by a [...] "taxi driver" [...] outside the cafe. They say they attempted to question Singh about the alleged assault and pursued him inside the cafe to do so, but that many of the 70 people in attendance attempted to obstruct them. Singh says the man who <b>police</b> <b>say</b> was a taxi driver was wearing a suit and driving an unmarked SUV. He says that the man pushed him after Singh asked him what he was doing parked {{on the side of the}} road wearing an earpiece. Police ended up charging Singh and one other person with obstruction, and three others were given municipal fines.|$|E

50|$|Proetta {{had given}} a {{statement}} to the <b>police,</b> <b>saying</b> that she was washing dishes when she looked out her kitchen window and witnessed the killings.

50|$|In the {{criminal}} trial {{which took place in}} July 1871, however, the judge ordered that Jane’s last words, in which she identified Pook, were inadmissible as they were hearsay. Secondly, the judge chastised the <b>police,</b> <b>saying</b> that they were after a quick arrest and hounded Pook with no real evidence. Pook was found not guilty.|$|R
2500|$|Both CNN and The Times {{reported}} that the armed police at University College Hospital were pursuing a suspected bomber who fled into the building following a chase on foot down Tottenham Court Road. Witnesses reported shots being fired as the man led police on the chase from Warren Street tube station. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> the [...] "gunshots" [...] may have actually been detonators going off.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{initially}} {{believed that}} Álvarez decided {{to kill himself}} that day, but that {{he changed his mind}} immediately before the train hit his vehicle, jumping {{out of the car and}} observing as the collision took place. He was charged with, and subsequently convicted of, 11 counts of murder with [...] "special circumstances". <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> following investigations indicate Álvarez may have intended to cause the crash without committing suicide. Authorities filed additional charges against him for murder with intent.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Police</b> <b>say</b> {{that no one}} {{was injured}} in this action, but MTI (the {{official}} Hungarian News Agency) reported [...] "men with bloody heads".

The indignant crowd was not willing to end protesting; many of them wanted to go back when the security check was finished, but the police started to crowd them out. When this news spread, the crowd began to multiply.|$|E
