Experimental and analytical studies were conducted focusing on an Indonesian earthquake-damaged building due to the 2007 Sumatra earthquakes. Structural details of the building are summarized herein. A brick wall was extracted from the earthquake-damaged building and transported to Japan from Indonesia to experimentally evaluate its <b>seismic</b> <b>performance.</b> Two R/C single-bay frame specimens were constructed, and the imported wall was installed {{in one of the}} specimens. Comparing the <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of specimens with and without the brick infill through quasi-static cyclic loading tests, the effects of infill on the overall frame performance were quantitatively evaluated. Moreover, the <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of the earthquake-damaged building was evaluated numerically considering the findings of the tests.

30|$|Many seismic {{assessment}} {{methods for}} buildings {{have been developed}} in recent years (ATC 1996; FEMA 1998, 2000); however, those methods seldom mention re-evaluating the seismic residual of earthquake-damaged buildings. Di Ludovico et al. (2013) proposed the experiment-based expressions of modification factors for stiffness, strength and displacement capacity {{as a function of}} the rotational ductility demand. Additionally, the proposed expressions can be introduced to modify the moment-rotation plastic hinges of RC columns in the buildings of Mediterranean regions with design characteristics non-conforming to present-day seismic provisions. However, how to apply the modification factors for stiffness, strength and displacement capacity in the <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> assessment is not mentioned clearly in the paper. The guidelines developed by JBDPA (2001, 2015) for evaluating the residual <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of earthquake-damaged buildings can be used to determine the damage class of a building; however, the procedure is only suitable for the preliminary <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> assessment. Restated, a preliminary <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> assessment does not provide sufficient data for engineers or users to make decisions on earthquake-damaged buildings. Additionally, for the detailed <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> assessment of low-rise RC building structures in Taiwan, engineers need to use the nonlinear static analysis method, which is different with the method proposed in the JBDPA guidelines (2001, 2015). Therefore, a post-earthquake detailed assessment method of <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> is needed to evaluate the residual <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of an earthquake-damaged RC building for the post-earthquake maintenance strategy.|$|R

To {{study the}} effect of damping on <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of steel frame, using the pseudo dynamic test by {{inputting}} damping and no damping to analyze the <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of semi-rigid steel frame. Analysis was focused on {{the effect of}} damping on the panel zone strain, story drift and interlayer force. The conclusion was that under the more severe earthquake, the structural damping had effects on the <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of semi-rigid steel frame. Intruduction Damping was a kind of features during free vibration which was due to external influence or structural effect that decreased amplitude of structure {{and was one of the}} important characteristics that formed the <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of structure. In the process of the amplitude decreasing, vibration system dissipated energy through different mechanisms of action. When researchers analyzed the <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of steel frame, they often idealized the damping through setting linear viscous dampers or shock absorber in the steel frame that could’t reflect the real implication of the damping to the structure.

Firstly, MSPA enables each <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> requirement to be verified using a single earthquake record, and secondly by applying the earthquake records for the different performance criteria in an increasing severity order, all <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> requirements can be verified using a single specimen.

For this purpose, comparative nonlinear time history (NLTH) analyses of single and multiple storey CBFs with and without FVDs are conducted using NF ground motions with various velocity pulse periods scaled to have small, moderate and large intensities.
