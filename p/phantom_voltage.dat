2500|$|Ungrounded metal objects {{close to}} {{electric}} field {{sources such as}} neon signs or conductors carrying alternating currents can have measurable voltage levels caused by capacitive coupling. [...] Since voltages detected by high-impedance instruments disappear or become greatly reduced when a low impedance is substituted, the effect is sometimes called [...] <b>phantom</b> <b>voltage</b> (or ghost voltage). The term is often used by electricians, and might be seen, for example, when measuring the voltage at a lighting fixture after removing the bulb. [...] It is not unusual to measure phantom voltages of 50–90 volts when testing the wiring of ordinary 120V circuits with a high-impedance instrument. While the voltage produced may read almost to the full supply voltage, the capacitance or mutual inductance between the wires of building wiring systems is typically quite low and incapable of supplying significant amounts of current.|$|E

Neurology interns and novice medical staff need repetitive training to improve their skills in performing the exam. However, no training systems are able to reproduce multiple pathological conditions to simulate real needle electromyogram exam. For the development of a robotic simulator, three components need to be realized: physical modeling of upper limb morphological features, position-dependent electromyogram generation, and needle localization; the latter is the focus of this study. Our idea is to couple two types of sensing mechanism in order to acquire the needle-tip position with high accuracy. One is to segment the needle from camera images and calculate its insertion point on the skin surface by a top-hat transform algorithm. The other is voltage-based depth measurement, in which a conductive tissue-like phantom was used to realize both needle-tip localization and physical sense of needle insertion. For that, a pair of electrodes was designed to generate a near-linear voltage distribution along the depth direction of the tissue-like phantom. The accuracy of the needle-tip position was investigated by the electric field potential and camera hybridization. The results showed that the needle tip could be detected with an accuracy of 1. 05 ± 0. 57 mm.

The {{classifier}} creation on {{the base}} of discrete normal orthogonal transformation to access the advisability of inverse Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) solving is proposed.

40|$|Abstract — {{scattered}} radiation {{is an important}} source of artifacts in x-ray CT imaging and its detrimental effects have become much stronger in 64 -slice CT scanners with extended detector aperture. The magnitude and spatial distribution of the scatter component should be corrected for before or during the reconstruction process. Thorough knowledge of scatter distribution is essential for development of scatter correction algorithms. In this study a novel approach based on using dedicated blockers is proposed to efficiently calculate scatter profiles and scatter to primary ratio (SPR) in different detector rows in a CT scanner with 64 -slice capability. The influence of different parameters such as tube <b>voltage,</b> <b>phantom</b> size and phantom off-centering on the scatter profile and SPR was quantitatively measured based on the developed method. The SPR decreases from 219. 9 to 39. 9 when the tube voltage increases from 80 kVp to 140 kVp in 21. 5 cm water phantom. The proposed method is easy to use and straightforward and can be used for any measurement...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{search for}} the tube voltage which results in the highest {{clinical}} image quality per effective dose unit for chest and pelvis radiography respectively, using image plates. Methods: Two anthropomorphic phantoms were imaged with several different tube voltages. For the chest <b>phantom,</b> the tube <b>voltage</b> was varied between 70 and 150 kV, and for the pelvis phantom between 50 and 102 kV. The mAs settings were chosen so that the effective dose to the phantom was the same, regardless of the tube voltage, for the two examinations respectively. The clinical image quality of the resulting images was evaluated {{by a panel of}} experienced radiologists with visual grading analysis of defined anatomical structures taken from the European Image Criteria. Images produced with the standard tube voltage settings (125 kV for chest and 70 kV for pelvis) were used as reference. These two kV settings were previously used for screen film radiography.

40|$|PURPOSE: The consummate 64 -slice CT scanner that spawns a new {{generation}} of non-invasive diagnostic tool, however revolutionary, brings with it the incidental by-product that is scattered radiation. The extended detector aperture capability in the 64 -slcie CT scanner allows the effects of scattered radiation to be more pronounced and therefore demands that the magnitude and spatial distribution of scatter component be addressed during the imaging process. To this end, corrective algorithms need to be formulated on a basis of a precise understanding of scatter distribution. Relative to a 64 -slice CT scanner, here now a unique solution is based upon dedicated blockers operative within various detector rows, calculating scatter profiles and scatter to primary ratios (SPR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single dimension blocker array was installed beneath the collimator, and the extrapolated shadow area on the detectors revealed the scatter radiation after exposure. The experiment was conducted using a 64 -slice CT scanner manufactured by GE Healthcare Technologies. RESULTS: Variables such as tube <b>voltage,</b> <b>phantom</b> size and phantom-off centring on the scatter profile and the SPR was measured using the dedicated blocker method introduced above. When tube voltage is increased from 80 kVp to 140 kVp in a 21. 5 cm water phantom, the SPR is found to reduce from 219. 9 to 39. 9 respectively.

40|$|In present PET/CT scanners, PET {{attenuation}} correction {{is performed}} {{by relying on}} the information given by CT scan. In the CT-based attenuation correction methods, dual-energy technique (DECT) is the most accurate approach, which has been limited due to the increasing patient dose. In this feasibility study, we have introduced a new method that can implement dual-energy technique with only a single energy CT scan. The implementation was done by CT scans of RANDO <b>phantom</b> at tube <b>voltages</b> of 80 kVP and 140 kVP. The acquired data was used to obtain conversion curves (which scale CT numbers at different kVP to each other), in three regions including lung tissue (HU&lt;- 100), soft tissue (- 100 &lt;HU&lt; 200) and bone tissue (HU&gt; 200) for the combination of 80 kVP / 140 kVP. Therefore, with having the CT image in one energy, we generate the CT image at the second energy (from now we call it virtual dual-energy technique) using these kVP conversion curves. The attenuation map at 511 keV was generated using bilinear (the most commonly used method in commercially available PET/CT scanners), real dual-energy and virtual dual-energy technique in a polyethylene phantom. In the phantom study, the created attenuation map using mentioned methods are compared to the theoretical values calculated using XCOM cross section library. The results in the phantom data show 10. 1 %, 4. 2 % and 4. 3 % errors for bilinear, dual-energy and virtual dual-energy techniques respectively.

Both the VGAS (visual grading analysis score) and SNR increase with decreasing tube voltage in both chest PA and pelvis AP examinations, indicating superior performance if lower tube voltages than used today are employed in digital radiology.

Simulated microcalcifications with an approximate diameter of 250 – 350  μm were positioned on the phantom. Groups of six microcalcifications were arranged in one of two patterns, a line cluster 1  cm long or a hexagonal cluster 4  mm wide. One of the six microcalcifications was removed to create a negative control. Each cluster was placed on 25 different points. Four levels of milliampere-second (mAs) values were applied: 100 %, 50 %, 25 %, and 12. 5 %. Five staff radiologists participated in an observer performance test. All observers used a workstation with a 3 -megapixel monochrome LCD monitor.
