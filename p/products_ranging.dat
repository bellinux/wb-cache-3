40|$|AbstractWe study {{operators}} {{acting on}} a tensor product Hilbert space and investigate their <b>product</b> numerical <b>range,</b> <b>product</b> numerical radius and separable numerical range. Concrete bounds for the <b>product</b> numerical <b>range</b> for Hermitian operators are derived. <b>Product</b> numerical <b>range</b> of a non-Hermitian operator forms {{a subset of the}} standard numerical range containing the barycenter of the spectrum. While the latter set is convex, the <b>product</b> <b>range</b> needs not to be convex nor simply connected. The <b>product</b> numerical <b>range</b> of a tensor product is equal to the Minkowski <b>product</b> of numerical <b>ranges</b> of individual factors...|$|R

25|$|Several factors {{combine to}} make the New England economy unique.

New England exports food <b>products,</b> <b>ranging</b> from fish to lobster, cranberries, Maine potatoes, and maple syrup. The service industry is important, including tourism, education, financial and insurance services, plus architectural, building, and construction services.

25|$|Their {{real estate}} {{transactions}} probably made very little {{difference to the}} increasing number of settlers homesteading on Mount Desert Island. By 1820, when Maine separated from Massachusetts and became a separate state, farming and lumbering vied with fishing and shipbuilding as major occupations. Settlers converted hundreds of acres of trees into wood <b>products</b> <b>ranging</b> from schooners and barns to baby cribs and hand tools. Farmers harvested wheat, rye, corn, and potatoes. By 1850, the familiar sights of fishermen and sailors, fish racks and shipyards, revealed a way of life linked to the sea. Quarrying of granite, which could be cut from hills close to deep water anchorage for shipment to major cities on the east coast, was also a major industry.|$|E
25|$|On November 11, 2003, the WTO {{came out}} against the steel tariffs, saying {{that they had not}} been imposed during a period of import surge—steel imports had {{actually}} dropped a bit during 2001 and 2002—and that the tariffs therefore were a violation of America's WTO tariff-rate commitments. The ruling authorized more than $2 billion in sanctions, the largest penalty ever imposed by the WTO against a member state, if the United States did not quickly remove the tariffs. After receiving the verdict, Bush declared that he would preserve the tariffs. In retaliation, the European Union threatened to counter with tariffs of its own on <b>products</b> <b>ranging</b> from Florida oranges to cars produced in Michigan, with each tariff calculated to likewise hurt the President in a key marginal state. The United States backed down and withdrew the tariffs on December 4.|$|E
25|$|RCA {{inherited}} American Marconi's {{status as}} a major producer of vacuum tubes, which were branded Radiotron in the United States.

RCA's strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which {{were significantly higher than}} in Europe, where Lee de Forest had allowed a key patent issued to him to lapse. RCA was responsible for creating a series of innovative <b>products,</b> <b>ranging</b> from octal base metal tubes co-developed with General Electric before World War II, to miniaturized Nuvistor tubes used in the tuners of the New Vista series of TV sets. The Nuvistor tubes were a last major vacuum tube innovation, and were meant to compete with the newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the cathode ray tube (CRT) picture tube.|$|E
