Organizations tendering out aerial <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> projects will need information about new sensors {{on the market and}} their characteristics. There are big differences in accuracy, image quality and data format. Camera buyers have the challenge to select the right sensor which will address their business model the best. Independent and objective sensor comparisons are rare.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For city {{planning}} and security services {{the combination of}} vertical and oblique images like from Pictometry and Multivision recently became very popular. For larger cities {{a high number of}} such image combinations are even included in Microsoft Virtual Earth. The geo-reference of the image combinations usually is based on direct sensor orientation – the combination of GPS and inertial measurement units. The images are taken by camera systems like Track’Air MIDAS, equipped with 5 Canon EOS cameras, each with 4992 x 3328 pixels. The Canon EOS is not really a metric camera; it keeps the inner and the system orientation only stable during one <b>photo</b> <b>flight.</b> The images are also used for simple measurement purposes as well as the generation of 3 D-city models. If object information without disturbing loss of accuracy against the direct sensor orientation is required, a system calibration during the day of the <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> has to be done. The method of calibration and achieved accuracy is described as well as the characteristics and potential of the image combinations. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mapping {{today is}} a data {{acquisition}} for Geo Information Systems (GIS). Maps are just one form of {{the output of the}} geoinformation. Geoinformation are important as basic information for any planning purpose, nevertheless the term mapping is used for such data acquisition. Without such information no modern administration of a country is possible. In several developing countries no actual geoinformation and no regular update exists. Classical, the data acquisition is based on aerial images, but not in all countries <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> equipment is available and foreign <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> companies can enter some countries only with extreme bureaucratic effort, causing a delay of photo flights and raising the price. The problem of control point determination for mapping purposes today is solved by GPS-positioning, which can be improved by world wide satellite reference systems like Omnistar to absolute accuracy up to 30 cm. With the high and very high resolution optical satellites a competition to aerial images exist. The highest resolution system operational now is WorldView- 1 with 50 cm distributed ground sampling distance (GSD) corresponding to a photo scale of approximately 1 : 20 000. For topographic maps not in every case the highest resolution is required. Based on long time experience, satellite images with 5 m GSD can be used for mapping in the scale 1 : 50 000 or approximately 0. 1 mm GSD is required in the map scale. For three-dimensional point determination stereo pairs are required. From th...|$|E
40|$|The Fraunhofer Institute of Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation (IOSB) {{deals with}} the {{interoperability}} of stationary and mobile sensors {{and the development of}} assistance systems, which optimize and simplify the operation of such systems. One focus is research on swarms with airborne miniature drones and their applications. The <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> presented in this paper is one of the applications developed to bring the advantages of a swarm into a realistic scenario. With the aim to support rescue or security forces in action, the <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> generates an immediate up-to-date situation picture by using an autonomous swarm of miniature drones. If the videos taken from these swarms are georeferenced, a significantly better coordination and distribution of missions and tasks can be achieved. Therefore, the ability of geo-referencing in unknown terrain is highly demanded. In the absence of an onboard internal navigation system, an imagebased approach is proposed. It consists of registration of video frames or even whole sequences stemming from different UAVs into a common coordinate system and matching with an orthophoto. These processes are called quasi-intrasensorial and intersensorial registration. For image-based georeferencing, a differentiation must be made between scenes with negligible spatial depth (2 D situation) and those where the depth cannot be neglected any longer (2. 5 D situation). Several applications of geo-referenced UAV-borne videos as well as ideas how the task of image-based geo-referencing can be accelerated for online processing are presented...|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the new aerial digital mapping cameras, the operational aspects for aerial <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> projects will change. New task, like digital image data handling and data copy in the filed will be implemented into the workflow. Instead of a film, digital data will be shipped and archived. The camera operators and the crew have to get familiar with the new work steps. The Z/I Imaging DMC Digital Mapping Camera System is used as an example to explain the operational procedures and the data workflow. To set up a proper mission planning the required GSD ground sampling distance has to be determined. Referring to the traditional film camera, this is a combination of photo scale and scanning resolution. After a <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> mission the digital film has to be developed. The airborne mass storage device with the raw image data will be removed from the aircraft to the office, where the image data post processing will take place. If the crew is away from the home base on an outbound mission and has no access to the post processing workstation, the image data will be copied from the airborne mass storage device to a different media, like removable hard disk drives or tapes. The handling of this process has to be full automatic to reduce time and costs and to reduce the stress for the crew. To get the camera ready for the next mission as quickly as possible is an important factor. The data copy can either be done in the aircraft or in the hangar or hotel room. The digital cameras are offering new possibilities for on-site quality checks. A first image data quality evaluation can be done in the air during the mission. Especially for areas with air space restrictions this will be a big time and cost saver. 1...|$|E

40|$|A high {{resolution}} <b>photo</b> <b>flight</b> with the UltraCamD {{has been made}} by the Bosporus Engineering Consultancy Services Inc (BIMTAS) over the city area of Istanbul for the generation of maps with the scale 1 : 1000. The used 9 cm ground sampling distance (GSD) can be compared with the information contents of a photo scale 1 : 2700 taken by analogue cameras. The resolution satisfies any requirement for mapping in the scale 1 : 1000. The narrow angle of the UltraCam is optimal in the city area with high buildings and narrow streets. The mapping requires an accuracy of 0. 25 mm in the mapping scale or 25 cm, corresponding to 3 GSD. This is a low demand for the block adjustment. Nevertheless quite better accuracy is possible with the digital images. The optimal results only can be achieved with self calibration by additional parameters. The block adjustment is investigated in detail and the influence of the systematic image errors to the mapping is analysed. 1...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to legal}} restrictions, the German hard coal mining company Deutsche Steinkohle AG (DSK) {{is obliged to}} conduct a {{monitoring}} on surface changes (subsidence) caused by mining activity (e. g. topographic surface, groundwater, water, flora and fauna, soil). To fulfill legal demands and to do this effectively, process chains by use of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Geo Information Systems (GIS) have been established. Photogrammetric methods are used to generate high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from which in combination with subsidence data geometric changes at the topographic surface are deduced. For mine site areas from about 100 km to 200 km DEMs have to be handled on digital photogrammetric stereo workstations with a height standard deviation of ± 10 cm. This accuracy up to now could be obtained with analogue wide angle cameras at an image scale of 1 : 4000 and 80 % end lap together with {{a high number of}} ground control points (GCP). More and more digital aerial frame cameras like Intergraph DMC and Vexcel UltraCamD are available for mapping application.
