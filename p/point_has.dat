40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{randomization}} for $(t,m,d) $-nets: Owen scrambling and random digital shift. In the previous paper [{Uniform Distribution Theory}, {&# 92;bf 2 } (2007), 93 - 105], we introduced a class of functions for which any Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>have</b> zero integration error, whereas Owen scrambling of Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>has</b> the same variance of integration error as that of simple Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, by using the same functions as the paper mentioned above, we construct an example of functions for which any Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>have</b> zero integration error, whereas not only Owen scrambling but also random digital shift of Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>have</b> variance of integration error no smaller than that of simple Monte Carlo methods...|$|R
5|$|In normal untransformed cells, EFS {{acts as a}} SRC family kinase {{substrate}} in neurite outgrowth, {{a process}} that is dependent on activity of SRC kinases. Reciprocally, EFS activates SRC signaling through c-CRK and RAP1. Further, SRC directly phosphorylates residues Y576 and Y577 tyrosine sites on the EFS, enhancing targeting FAK, and eventually the solubility and/or stability of the complex. Through SRC, EFS may also negatively regulate expression of E-cadherin at adherens junctions, a function that has been reported for other CAS proteins (NEDD9 and BCAR1); however, this <b>point</b> <b>has</b> not been directly established for EFS.|$|E
5|$|Though {{football}} {{may receive}} {{a lot of}} media attention due to its annual rivalry game, West <b>Point</b> <b>has</b> a long history of athletics in other NCAA sports.

Riley, Jr. was the hockey coach at West Point for more than 35 years. Every year, Army faces the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) Paladins in the annual West Point Weekend hockey game. This series, conceived in 1923, is the longest-running annual international sporting event in the world.|$|E
5|$|Zones. The {{object of}} this mode is to capture various control {{points on the}} map. Each control <b>point</b> <b>has</b> 3 levels for each team, and a neutral level. A player can do this in other game modes (except deathmatch) to earn points for yourself, but in Zones, their team gains points {{for the number of}} zones the player has, and how many levels each one has. The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or {{captured}} by their team.

5|$|Blakeney Point (designated as Blakeney National Nature Reserve) is a National Nature Reserve {{situated}} near to {{the villages}} of Blakeney, Morston and Cley next the Sea on the north coast of Norfolk, England. Its main feature is a 6.4km (4mi) spit of shingle and sand dunes, but the reserve also includes salt marshes, tidal mudflats and reclaimed farmland. It has been managed by the National Trust since 1912, and lies within the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Ramsar listings. The reserve is part of both an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and a World Biosphere Reserve. The <b>Point</b> <b>has</b> been studied {{for more than a}} century, following pioneering ecological studies by botanist Francis Wall Oliver and a bird ringing programme initiated by ornithologist Emma Turner.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney <b>Point</b> <b>has</b> a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney <b>Point</b> <b>has</b> been {{designated}} {{as one of}} the most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000, perhaps due to predation. Sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eightper cent of the British population. The 2,000 pairs of black-headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like red foxes. Other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of Arctic terns and a few Mediterranean gulls in the tern colony, ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the salt marsh. The waders' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls, weasels and stoats, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously. The pastures contain breeding northern lapwings, and species such as sedge and reed warblers and bearded tits are found in patches of common reed.|$|E

5|$|Cedar <b>Point</b> <b>has</b> had a {{cultural}} influence on American society as evidenced {{in many forms}} of media such as books, television, and film. In the 1940 biographical film Knute Rockne, All American documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar Point is featured at a pivotal point in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar Point, {{where he and his}} college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar Point, would revolutionize the sport and the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 2004, an independently-produced film, Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar Point. Dick Kinzel, CEO of Cedar Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fnd1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fn+1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f126d17s2 configuration over the 5f137s2 configuration for mendelevium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number. Thermochromatographic studies with trace quantities of mendelevium by Zvara and Hübener from 1976 to 1982 confirmed this prediction. In 1990, Haire and Gibson estimated mendelevium metal to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 134 and 142kJ·mol−1. Divalent mendelevium metal should have a metallic radius of around (194±10)pm. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic mendelevium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Mendelevium's melting <b>point</b> <b>has</b> been estimated at 827°C, the same value as that predicted for the neighboring element nobelium. Its density is predicted to be around 10.3±0.7g·cm−3.|$|E

The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number: an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent, unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides. In 1986, nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126kJ·mol−1, a value close to the values for einsteinium, fermium, and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic nobelium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197pm.
