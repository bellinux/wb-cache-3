Mixed blood leukocytes principally composed of granulocytes or granulocytes purified by density gradient sedimentation did not accumulate malonyldialdehyde during incubations with these particles, but did when ingesting particles containing linolenate. The phospholipid fatty acid composition of monocyte-enriched and purified granulocyte preparations from the same donors were compared. The molar fraction of arachidonate (20 : 4) in phospholipids from monocyte-rich preparations was 62 % {{greater than that of}} purified granulocytes. The findings indicate that human monocytes, possibly because of a greater content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes, <b>peroxidize</b> a greater quantity of endogenous lipids than granulocytes during endocytosis. Normal human granulocytes have the capacity to <b>peroxidize</b> ingested lipids. However, mixed leukocytes from two patients with chronic granulomatous disease produced little malonyldialdehyde when engulfing linolenate-containing particles.

50|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to {{high level of}} nitrogen dioxide results in the allosteric inhibition of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase, {{both of which are}} important enzymes found in the mucous membrane antioxidant defense system, that catalyse nucleophilic attack by reduced glutathione (GSH) on non-polar compounds that contain an electrophillic carbon and nitrogen. These inhibition mechanisms generates free radicals that causes peroxidation from the lipids in the mucous membrane leading to increased <b>peroxidized</b> eyrthrocyte lipids, a reaction that proceeds by a free radical chain reaction mechanism that result in oxidative stress. The oxidative stress on the mucous membrane causes the dissociation of the GSTp-JNK complex, oligomerization of GSTP and induction of the JNK pathway, resulting in apoptosis or inflammation of the bronchioles and pulmonary alveolus in mild cases.On migrating to the bloodstream, nitrogen dioxide poisoning results in an irreversible inhibition of the erythrocite membrane acetylcholinesterase which may lead to muscular paralysis, convulsions, bronchoconstriction, the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles) and death by asphyxiation. It also causes a decrease in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase which may results in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency known as favism, a condition that predisposes to hemolysis (spontaneous destruction of red blood cells).Acute and chronic exposure also reduces glutathione reductase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH), which is a critical molecule in resisting oxidative stress and maintaining the reducing environment of the cell.|$|E

Mitochondrial pore transition (MPT) is considered as an important step in this process. In this work, the effect of <b>peroxidized</b> cardiolipin on MPT induction and cytochrome c release in rat heart mitochondria was investigated. Treatment of mitochondria with micromolar concentrations of cardiolipin hydroperoxide (CLOOH) resulted in a dose-dependent matrix swelling, ΔΨ collapse, release of preaccumulated Ca 2 + and release of cytochrome c. All these events were inhibited by cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid, indicating that <b>peroxidized</b> cardiolipin behaves as an inducer of MPT.

Together, these results indicate that <b>peroxidized</b> cardiolipin lowers the threshold of Ca 2 + for MPT induction and cytochrome c release. This synergistic effect of Ca 2 + and <b>peroxidized</b> cardiolipin on MPT induction and cytochrome c release in mitochondria, might be important in regulating the initial phase of apoptosis and also may have important implications in those physiopathological situations, characterized by both Ca 2 + and <b>peroxidized</b> cardiolipin accumulation in mitochondria, such as aging, ischemia/reperfusion and other degenerative diseases...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} for {{vegetable}} oils to be supplemented to livestock diets to improve the energy density of the feed. Vegetable oils, however, have high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Due to this increased unsaturation, they are predisposed to lipid damage through lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a dynamic free radical chain reaction that can be initiated by thermal processing {{in the presence of}} oxygen. This reaction progresses based on duration and intensity of thermal processing to produce a wide range of potentially oxidative and toxic compounds. Lipid peroxidation products of interest include peroxide value (PV) which measures hydroperoxides formed, and p-anisidine value (AnV) which {{is a measure of the}} molecular weight of aldehydes. Two key aldehydes are also formed including 2, 4 -decadienal (DDE) and 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE), are formed from the peroxidation of linoleic acid and are of interest because of their reactiveness with lipids, proteins, and DNA. Oils from ethanol, rendering or the restaurant industries may be an economical energy source compared to fresh oil, but at the expense of oil quality as they may be thermally <b>peroxidized.</b> Consumption of these <b>peroxidized</b> oils may induce increased oxidative stress and antagonize livestock performance. Oxidative stress occurs in the event that oxidative compounds such as free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelm the antioxidant defense system. Enzymatic antioxidants including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) function in detoxifying (reducing) oxidative compounds to protect the body from oxidative stress. Oxidative compounds can bind to lipids, proteins, and DNA to stabilize resulting in tissue or cellular damage. Commonly, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and F 2 -isoprostanes (ISP) are measured as indicators of lipid damage, protein carbonyls (PC) are measured as an indicator of protein damage, and 8 -hydroxy- 22 ̆ 7 -deoxyguanosine (8 -OH- 2 dG) is measured as an indicator of DNA damage. However, there is a poor understanding of the effects of feeding <b>peroxidized</b> oils on growth performance, digestibility, and oxidative status in livestock. Therefore, the overall objectives of this thesis were to determine the impact of feeding <b>peroxidized</b> oils on growth and digestibility parameters, and whole body oxidative status in growing pigs and poultry. To accomplish these objectives, a series of experiments were conducted and are outlined in three chapters (Chapter 2, 3, and 4). In Chapter 2, an experiment was conducted feeding variable levels of <b>peroxidized</b> soybean oil (SO) on growth, digestibility, and intestinal integrity parameters in growing pigs. In Chapter 3 oxidative stress markers associated with lipid, protein, and DNA damage along with enzymatic antioxidants, were measured in pigs fed variable levels of dietary <b>peroxidized</b> soybean oil. The final chapter (Chapter 4) assessed the effects of feeding multiple fresh and <b>peroxidized</b> oil sources on growth performance and markers of oxidative stress in broilers. The data herein indicate that thermally processing oils at 90 oC for 72 h yielded the most harmful lipid peroxidation products as exhibited by reduced overall growth performance and feed efficiency in swine and poultry. Pigs fed thermally <b>peroxidized</b> SO (heated at 90 oC for 72 h, 90 oC SO) had reduced ADG, energy and lipid digestibility, and whole body N retention (Chapter 2). Further, these pigs also had increases in liver weight as a percentage of BW and generally had increased oxidative stress as measured by serum PC and GPx, urine ISP, and liver 8 -OH- 2 dG (Chapter 3). To build on Chapters 2 and 3, Chapter 4 evaluated the effects of feeding fresh and <b>peroxidized</b> palm, soybean, flaxseed, and fish oils on performance and oxidative status in poultry. An interaction between oil source and peroxidation status was noted for ADFI, ADG, G:F, and plasma GPx in broilers where peroxidation status reduced each of these variables in birds fed palm, soybean, and flaxseed oil, apart from birds fed fish oil. In general, oil unsaturation increased plasma TBARS, PC and 8 -OH- 2 dG; furthermore, broilers fed <b>peroxidized</b> oils had increased plasma 8 -OH- 2 dG. An interaction was noted in liver TBARS where broilers fed <b>peroxidized</b> palm oil had increased liver TBARS compared to fresh palm oil, while the opposite was true in broilers fed soybean oil, and no change was noted in broilers fed flaxseed oil and fish oil. An interaction was also noted for liver PC where broilers fed palm, flaxseed, and fish oil had similar liver PC regardless of peroxidation status while broilers fed <b>peroxidized</b> soybean oil had increased liver PC compared to the fresh soybean oil diet. Generally speaking, the unsaturation content of the dietary oil increased liver 8 -OH- 2 dG and CAT activity and peroxidation status increased liver SOD activity. In summary, this thesis reported that formulating diets for pigs and poultry containing thermally processed oils (5 - 10...|$|E

The crosslinking depended on the presence of intact hydroperoxide groups on the protein, on their number, and on the duration of the interaction with DNA. All DNA samples tested, pBR 322, pGEM, lambda/HindIII and pUC 18, formed crosslinks with the <b>peroxidized</b> BSA. Sodium chloride and formate prevented the crosslinking if present during incubation of the <b>peroxidized</b> protein and DNA, but had no effect once the crosslinks had formed. The gel shift of the crosslinked DNA was reversed by proteolysis, indicating that the DNA mobility change was due to attachment of protein and that the crosslinking did not induce DNA strand breaks. The metal chelators Desferal and neocuproine reduced the extent of the crosslinking, but did not prevent it. Scavengers of free radicals did not inhibit the crosslink formation. The DNA-protein complex was not disrupted by vigorous agitation, by filtration or by non-ionic detergents. These observations show that the crosslinking of DNA with proteins mediated by protein hydroperoxides is spontaneous and probably covalent, and that it may be assisted by transition metals. It is suggested that formation of such crosslinks in living organisms could account for some of the well-documented forms of biological damage induced by reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress...|$|E

Supplemental lipids and lipid rich ingredients with {{high concentrations of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids may peroxidize during processing and storage. Exposure to heat, air, moisture, and other pro-oxidants accelerate peroxidation, and peroxidation is impeded by antioxidants. Metabolic oxidative stress occurs when pro-oxidants overload the antioxidant capacity of an animal. This dissertation explores the impact of lipid peroxidation in DDGS and corn oil on the growth performance, health, and metabolic oxidative status of young pigs. An extensive summary of published research revealed that feeding <b>peroxidized</b> lipids to pigs and broilers reduced growth, feed intake, and gain efficiency by 11. 2, 7. 5, and 4. 3 %, respectively, and resulted in metabolic oxidative stress. Similar, negative effects were confirmed in 2 additional experiments which evaluated increasing dietary levels of <b>peroxidized</b> corn oil. Our findings suggest the magnitude of reduction in growth depends on the conditions used to peroxidize corn oil. However, in a separate experiment, the dietary inclusion of a highly <b>peroxidized</b> source of DDGS {{did not affect the}} growth performance of nursery pigs. Numerous compounds are produced and degraded during peroxidation, and some of these products have been associated negatively animal health and performance. The dynamic nature of peroxidation creates a challenge for nutritionists and formulators assessing the feeding value of dietary lipids. An in vitro experiment was conducted to compare several indicators of peroxidation when heating refined corn oil at either 185 °C or 95 °C. Results suggest that thermal processing and storage conditions should be considered when selecting indicators of peroxidation, but this information is seldom available. An additional experiment was conducted to assess peroxidation in distillers corn oil and DDGS during storage in {{the presence or absence of}} antioxidants. Peroxidation increased during 28 d of storage at 38 °C and 90 % relative humidity. However, peroxidation was attenuated partially by antioxidants. Our results clearly demonstrate negative effects of dietary <b>peroxidized</b> lipids on the growth performance and metabolic oxidative status of nursery pigs. Future research is necessary to develop an accurate model for predicting reductions in growth performance and metabolic oxidative status when feeding diets containing <b>peroxidized</b> lipids...|$|E

An activity red/orange band appeared in midbrain tissue lanes, similarly to the lane where commercial horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was present as control of peroxidative activity. The second set of gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, showed other, not enzymatically active protein bands. Mass spectrometry analysis of the bands containing the activity and the corresponding Coomassie Blue bands revealed the presence of proteins that {{may play a role}} in neurodegenerative disease, highlighting a possible functional link among dopamine/dopaminochrome redox cycle and protein metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to study the {{possibility}} of the occurrence of radical-type lipid peroxidation of the lipid constituents on biomembranes, in compressed monolayers, having lipoidal benzophenone photosensitizers incorporated. The triplets of the photosensitizer abstract allylic and doubly-allylic hydrogen atoms from anticonjugated moities of the lipid molecules. The results simultaneously confirmed the occurrence of H-abstraction (and so the initiation of the <b>peroxidizing</b> chain mechanism), and the absence of the formation of lipid peroxides. The reason lies in "cage effect": the highly restricted spacial area of compressed lipid monolayers limits the mobility of the created radicals (lipid radicals and ketyl radicals) and leads to their recombination, thus preventing the propagation step of the chain mechanism. With certain reservations it may be concluded that these results have a clear implication on real biomembranes: the structure of which is one of themain factors preventing the spread of the chain reaction, and the formation of lipid peroxides...|$|R
40|$|Cultured {{rabbit and}} bovine aortic endothelial cells {{generated}} chemotactic activity for mouse resident peritoneal macrophages, demonstrable in the conditioned medium. This chemotactic activity was heat stable {{and was not}} extracted into chloroform/methanol. It was inhibited by addition of endothelial cell-modified low density lipoprotein (EC-modified LDL), a form of LDL shown previously to contain <b>peroxidized</b> lipids, increased lysophosphatidylcholine, and partially degraded apoprotein B. The chemotactic activity was also inhibited by LDL previously oxidized {{in the absence of}} cells with 5 microM Cu 2 +. Inhibitory activity was present in the lipid extract of EC-modified LDL but not in that of native LDL, presumably representing <b>peroxidized</b> lipid components. EC-modified LDL also inhibited the chemotactic activity of zymosan-activated serum. Because EC-modified LDL is taken up in part by way of the acetyl-LDL receptor, the effects of acetyl-LDL were tested. Rather than inhibiting chemotaxis, acetyl LDL showed intrinsic positive chemotactic activity as did also fucoidin and polyinosinic acid, both of which also interact with the acetyl-LDL receptor. These studies suggest mechanisms by which macrophages may be recruited into the subendothelial space by endothelial cell-derived chemotactic factors or by natural polyanions structurally related to fucoidin or polyinosinic acid and then become "trapped" there because of the inhibitory effects of <b>peroxidized</b> lipid components in modified forms of LDL...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} improve the {{mechanical}} properties of hydrogels by grafting them to a <b>peroxidized</b> polypropylene surface has been developed. It is shown that the grafting occurs due to the peroxidation of the polymer surface via the preliminary grafting of heterofunctional peroxide macromolecules and water soluble polymer chains to it...|$|E

40|$|Ceriporiopsis subvermispora is a white-rot fungus used in biopulping {{processes}} {{and seems to}} use the fatty acid peroxidation reactions initiated by manganese-peroxidase (MnP) to start lignin degradation. The present work shows that C. subvermispora was able to <b>peroxidize</b> unsaturated fatty acids during wood biotreatment under biopulping conditions. In vitro assays showed that the extent of linoleic acid peroxidation {{was positively correlated with}} the level of MnP recovered from the biotreated wood chips. Milled wood was treated in vitro by partially purified MnP and linoleic acid. UV spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that soluble compounds similar to lignin were released from the milled wood. SEC data showed a broad elution profile compatible with low molar mass lignin fractions. MnP-treated milled wood was analyzed by thioacidolysis. The yield of thioacidolysis monomers recovered from guaiacyl and syringyl units decreased by 33 % and 20 % in MnP-treated milled wood, respectively. This has suggested that lignin depolymerization reactions have occurred during the MnP/linoleic acid treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|AbstractPast {{work has}} shown that the {{extracellular}} manganese-dependent peroxidases (MnPs) of ligninolytic fungi degrade the principal non-phenolic structures of lignin when they <b>peroxidize</b> unsaturated fatty acids. This reaction is likely to be relevant to ligninolysis in sound wood, where enzymes cannot penetrate, only if it employs a small, diffusible lipid radical as the proximal oxidant of lignin. Here we show that a non-phenolic β-O- 4 -linked lignin model dimer was oxidized to products indicative of hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer by three different peroxyl radical-generating systems: (a) MnP/Mn(II) /linoleic acid, (b) arachidonic acid in which peroxidation was initiated by a small amount of H 2 O 2 /Fe(II), and (c) the thermolysis in air of either 4, 4 ′-azobis(4 -cyanovaleric acid) or 2, 2 ′-azobis(2 -methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride. Some quantitative differences in the product distributions were found, but these were attributable to the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents on the peroxyl radicals derived from azo precursors. Our results introduce a new hypothesis: that biogenic peroxyl radicals may be agents of lignin biodegradation...|$|R
40|$|Hepatoma {{cells have}} a below-normal content of {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids; this reduces lipid peroxidation {{and the production}} of cytotoxic and cytostatic aldehydes within the cells. In proportion to the degree of deviation, hepatoma cells also show an increase in the activity of Class- 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme important in the metabolism of lipid peroxidation products and also in that of several drugs. When hepatoma cells with different degrees of deviation were enriched with arachidonic acid and stimulated to <b>peroxidize</b> by ascorbate/iron sulphate, their growth rate was reduced in proportion to the quantity of aldehydes produced and to the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Therefore, 7777 cells, less deviated and with low Class- 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, were more susceptible to lipid peroxidation products than JM 2 cells. It is noteworthy that repeated treatments with prooxidant also caused a decrease in mRNA and activity of Class- 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase, contributing to the decreased growth and viability. Thus, Class- 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase could be considered relevant for the growth of hepatoma cells, since it defends them against cell growth inhibiting aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation...|$|R
