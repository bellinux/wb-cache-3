5000|$|The French <b>perchman</b> is {{equivalent}} to the U.S. boom operator in film production, also called the sound assistant or boomer, but differs regarding attributions. The <b>perchman</b> is the production sound mixer's assistant and {{is in charge of the}} microphone placement, typically using a light and telescopic pole also called a fish pole or boom.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, the <b>perchman</b> {{places and}} moves the {{microphone}} [...] "in real time" [...] {{in order to}} pick up the voices of each actor during filming. Being a <b>perchman</b> involves providing the best sound quality possible to the sound mixer while at the same time, not causing shadows or entering the camera frame. To accomplish this, the <b>perchman</b> works in collaboration with the camera operator and the cinematographer (who directs the camera movements and lights the scenes) and the gaffer. Other duties include the hiding of miniature wireless microphones (radio mics) on the actors, the placement of hidden auxiliary microphones, and the controlling of sound reflections by the use of furniture blankets and carpet. He readies the equipment {{at the beginning of each}} day and stores the gear when the day is [...] "wrapped", or finished. The <b>perchman</b> manages the technical contingencies allowing the production sound mixer to concentrate on the artistic side of sound recording.|$|E
5000|$|The boom operator, first {{assistant}} {{sound or}} [...] "1st AS", {{is responsible for}} utilising microphones {{on the end of}} boom poles (lightweight telescopic poles made of aluminium, or more commonly, carbon fibre) held above actor's heads during a scene to capture dialogue. It is also their responsibility to relay information from the [...] "floor" [...] back to the production sound mixer regarding upcoming shots, troublesome noises that the mixer will need to be made aware of if they can't be silenced, and for mounting radio microphones on actors. In France, the boom operator is called the <b>Perchman.</b>|$|E
