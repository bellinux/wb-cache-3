25|$|As {{previously}} stated, the C-Terminal {{domain of}} casein kinase 1 epsilon behaves as a pseudosubstrate when phosphorylated, inhibiting kinase activity. The C-Terminal domain {{has also been}} shown to be dephosphorylated by phosphatases such as <b>Protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>1</b> (PP1) in vitro and cell culture, which regulates levels of active casein kinase in vivo. Current theory of circadian rhythms hypothesizes that this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of casein kinase 1 epsilon is important in modulation of the period of circadian rhythms in the cell, with increased phosphorylation decreasing casein kinase 1 epsilon activity (and subsequently increasing active CRY and PER) and dephosphorylation of casein kinase 1 epsilon resulting in a more active kinase (and lower levels of active CRY and PER).|$|E

2500|$|... 14-3-3 {{proteins}} {{also contribute}} to the autoinhibition. As 14-3-3 proteins are all known to form constitutive dimers, their assemblies have two binding sites. Thus the dimer acts as a [...] "molecular handcuff", locking their binding partners at a fixed distance and orientation. When the precisely positioned twin 14-3-3 binding motifs are engaged by a single 14-3-3 protein dimer (such as 14-3-3 zeta), they become locked into a conformation that promotes autoinhibition and does not allow the disengagement of the autoinhibitory and catalytic domains. This [...] "lockdown" [...] of c-Raf (and other Rafs as well as KSRs) is controlled by motif phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated 14-3-3 associating motifs do not bind their partners: they need to get phosphorylated on conserved serines (Ser 259 and Ser 621) first, by other protein kinases. The most important kinase implicated in this event is TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and the enzymes dedicated for removal of these phosphates are the <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>1</b> (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5 and its yeast homologue, <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> T <b>1,</b> are serine/threonine <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> of {{approximately}} 60 -kDa that share 42 % sequence identity. Protein phosphates 5 and T 1 contain a C-terminal catalytic region related to <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> <b>1,</b> 2 A and calcineurin. Unlike these <b>phosphatases,</b> however, <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5 and T 1 also contain an extended N-terminal region consisting of three tetratricopeptide repeats. Tetratricopeptide repeats, {{found in a}} variety of unrelated proteins, are 34 amino acid consensus sequence motifs that are believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions. While the in vivo functions of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5 and T 1 are not known, evidence suggests that <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5 may be involved {{in a variety of}} cellular processes including the regulation of ion channels, steroid signaling and the cell cycle. In vitro studies suggest that <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5 may be regulated by unsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid or its metabolites. The major objective of this report was to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5, and potentially <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> T <b>1,</b> may be stimulated by lipids. ^ This report suggests that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain and C terminus of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5 act to suppress catalysis. However, upon lipid interaction with the TPR domain, both of these regions release their inhibition in a coordinated manner resulting in increased phosphatase activity. Modulation of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5 activity by the tetratricopeptide repeat domain and C terminus suggests that these regions themselves may be targets for in vivo regulation. Investigation of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> T <b>1</b> suggests that this enzyme is regulated in a manner distinct from that of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5. This conclusion is supported by the finding that lipids do not activate <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> T <b>1</b> toward all substrates and that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain did not appear to inhibit <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity. Also the C terminus of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatase</b> T <b>1</b> was not required for lipid activation and it did not suppress phosphatase activity. It is striking that two such closely related phosphatases appear so different in their regulation, however, the significance of this difference in vivo is yet to be understood. ...|$|R

We have examined the effect of okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of phosphoserine- and-phosphothreonine-specific <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> <b>1</b> and 2 A, on type I collagen gene expression by fibroblasts in culture. Treatment of human skin fibroblasts with OA potently reduced type I and type III collagen mRNA levels, maximally by over 90 %. The inhibitory effect of OA on type I and III collagen mRNA abundance was not prevented by cycloheximide, and was not affected by simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone or retinoic acid. OA also abrogated the enhancing effect of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on type I and III collagen mRNA levels. Treatment of transiently transfected NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblasts with OA suppressed the activity of a 3. 5 kb human pro alpha 2 (I) collagen promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct maximally, by 70 %. In addition, OA treatment of NIH- 3 T 3 cells abrogated enhancement of pro alpha 2 (I) collagen promoter activity by TGF-beta. These results indicate that <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> <b>1</b> and 2 A {{have an important role}} as positive regulators of type I and III collagen gene expression.

40|$|Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation {{processes}} {{are known to}} control the activity of several transcription factors. The nutrition-dependent expression of sucrase-isomaltase and Na+/glucose co-transporter 1, two proteins implicated in the intestinal absorption of glucose, {{has been shown to}} be closely related to modifications of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF 1) activity. This study was conducted to determine whether phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes could control HNF 1 activity. We show that expression of the gene encoding sucrase-isomaltase is inhibited in the enterocytic Caco- 2 clone TC 7 by okadaic acid at a concentration that is known to inhibit <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> <b>1</b> / 2 A and that does not affect cell viability. At the same concentration, phosphorylation of the HNF 1 alpha and HNF 1 beta isoforms is greatly enhanced and their DNA-binding capacity is decreased. The phosphorylation state of HNF 1 beta isoforms directly affects their DNA-binding capacity. In contrast, the decreased DNA-binding activity of the HNF 1 alpha isoforms, which was observed after the inhibition of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> <b>1</b> / 2 A, is due to a net decrease in their total cellular and nuclear amounts. Such an effect results from a decrease in both the HNF 1 alpha mRNA levels and the half-life of the protein. This is the first evidence for the implication of <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> <b>1</b> / 2 A in the control of the activity of HNF 1 isoforms. Moreover, these results emphasize a physiological role for the balance between phosphatases and kinases in the nutrition-dependent regulation of HNF 1 -controlled genes...|$|R

Although most {{transcriptional}} events appear to be modulated by reversible protein phosphorylation, {{little is known about}} the role of this regulatory system during the development of mammalian organs. Here we have studied the serine/threonine <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> (PP) <b>1</b> and 2 A in the early embryonic rat kidney with regard to expression and effects on growth and differentiation. All isoforms of PP- 1 and PP- 2 A were ubiquitously expressed in 15 -day embryonic (E 15) kidneys (in situ hybridization studies). In contrast, mRNA for inhibitor- 1 (I- 1), an endogenous inhibitor of PP- 1, was detected only in undifferentiated stem cells in the outer cortical area. I- 1 is a novel marker for these cells. The abundance of the PP- 1 protein, confirmed with immunoblotting, was high in the embryonic kidney. In organ culture of E 13 kidneys, okadaic acid (OA), an exogenous inhibitor of PP- 1 and PP- 2 A, dose-dependently inhibited growth and nephron formation (apparent half-maximal effect at 6 nM). OA 10 nM had little effect on the growth of cultured E 15 kidneys, whereas nephron formation was disturbed and morphological evidence of apoptosis was seen. In summary, this study points towards important roles for <b>protein</b> <b>phosphatases</b> <b>1</b> and/or 2 A in regulation of mitogenic activity in the early embryonic kidney...|$|R
