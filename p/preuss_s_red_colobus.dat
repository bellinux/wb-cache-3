50|$|The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus tephrosceles) is an {{endangered}} species of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey, recognised as a distinct species since 2001. There is disagreement however over taxonomy with many considering the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> to be a subspecies (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles). The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is an Old World monkey which is found in 5 different locations across Uganda and Tanzania.|$|R
50|$|The Uzungwa <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus gordonorum), {{also known}} as the Udzungwa <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> or Iringa <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to {{riverine}} and montane forest in the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has {{two main}} predators: the common {{chimpanzee}} and the crowned eagle. There are many primate species in Kibale National Park but chimpanzees rarely hunt any species {{other than the}} Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Each year in Ngogo, part of Kibale National Park, up to 12% of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population is killed by chimpanzees. Chimpanzees do not hunt Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> all year round, instead they tend to go through bouts of heavy hunting. In response to attacks by a chimpanzee, all members of a Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group gather together and males assemble to aggressively try and deter the attacking chimpanzee.|$|R
50|$|The Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> Procolobus kirkii, {{population}} on Zanzibar, represents {{a population of}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> that {{is believed to have}} been isolated on the island after sea levels rose toward the end of the Pleistocene epoch. Furthermore, it is suggested through mitochondrial analysis, that phylogenetic groups within the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> have been genetically isolated from another since the Pliocene.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In this 3 -year {{investigation}} we documented {{patterns of}} density, diet, and activity of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Procolobus tephrosceles) in six areas {{in or near}} Kibale National Park, Uganda and related these patterns to availability of food resources. There were large differences in the density and behavior of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> among the sites. For example, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> at one site with a diverse plant community of more than 61 tree species, had a diet that included at least 42 species. In contrast, at a second site <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent 92 % of their feeding time eating from one species that dominated the tree community. The density of important <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> food trees varied among sites from 32 trees/ha to 204 trees/ha, and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density ranged from 0. 70 groups/km 2 to 7. 41 groups/km 2. Among sites, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density {{was related to the}} cumulative DBH of important food trees, when one apparently anom-alous site was excluded, and populations with more plant species in their diets tended to be those that were found at higher densities. Activity budgets of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations varied markedly among sites. For example, feeding time ranged among sites from 29 to 55 %, and traveling varied from 5 to 20 %. When faced with increased foraging demands, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> reduced the time spent resting, while the time spent socializing remained fairly constant. Comparative socioecological studies typically contrast species epa-rated by large geographical distances to ensure there is sufficient variation in the environment to detect behavioral responses. The marked ifferences in ecological conditions and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> behavior we docu-mented over short geographical distances, uggests that small-scale contrasts are a useful tool to examine ecological determinants of behavior and community structure...|$|R
50|$|Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Piliocolobus badius waldronae) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> native to West Africa. It has not been officially sighted since 1978 and was considered extinct in 2000. However, new evidence suggests that {{a very small number}} of these monkeys may be living in the southeast corner of Côte d'Ivoire. The IUCN Red List notes Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as critically endangered.|$|R
50|$|Pennant's colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1838 by George Robert Waterhouse, {{curator at the}} Zoological Society of London's museum, and was named in honour of the naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant.Three subspecies of this <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> are traditionally recognized: The Bioko <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii pennantii), the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii epieni) and Bouvier's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii bouvieri). However, Groves (2007) raised P. p. epieni, and P. p. bouvieri to Piliocolobus epieni and Piliocolobus bouvieri, respectively (this nomenclature has been followed here). Ting agreed that preliminary genetic evidence supported elevating P. epieni at least.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys, including the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here). [...] However, other authors consider Piliocolobus to be a subgenus of Procolobus.|$|R
50|$|According to sources, Kirk first drew zoologists' {{attention}} to the Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> which is also commonly known as Kirk's <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> This species, Procolobus kirkii, which is endemic to Zanzibar, is named after him.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius), {{also known}} as the rust <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of Old World monkey found in West African forests from Senegal to Ghana. All other species of red colobuses have {{formerly}} been considered subspecies of P. badius. It is often hunted by the common chimpanzee. In 1994, western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys infected many chimpanzees with Ebola virus when they were hunted and eaten by the chimpanzees.|$|R
50|$|The Tana River <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus), {{also called}} the eastern <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a highly {{endangered}} species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to a narrow zone of gallery forest near the Tana River in southeastern Kenya.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not certain}} why the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> forms these {{associations}} with other species but protection from predators is the most accepted reason. The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is less vigilant, looking out for predators less often, when associated with the red-tailed monkey. It also forms these associations more readily when there are {{a large number of}} young in the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group which implies it may be more protected when with the other species.|$|R
40|$|Chimpanzees across Africa {{include some}} meat in their diet 1. In most {{communities}} where chimpanzees {{have been studied}} over the long term, primate prey is apparently preferred over other animal prey, with <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Piliocolobus badius) comprising the most common monkey species eaten 2. At Fongoli, Senegal, {{it is likely that}} chimpanzees have never had access to <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys at this hot, dry and open site, although the range of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (P. b. temminckii) in Senegal and adjacent countries in West Africa has diminished 3. Fongoli chimpanzees are currently not sympatric with <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> although they eat vertebrate prey of various types, including a number of primate species...|$|R
40|$|Primate {{gastrointestinal}} microbial {{communities are}} becoming increasingly appreciated for their relevance to comparative medicine and conservation, but the factors that structure primate “microbiomes ” remain controversial. This study examined a community of primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to assess {{the relative importance of}} host species and location in structuring gastrointestinal microbiomes. Fecal samples were collected from primates in intact forest and from primates in highly disturbed forest fragments. People and livestock living nearby were also included, as was a geographically distant population of related <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> in Kenya. A culture‐free microbial community fingerprinting technique was used to analyze fecal microbiomes from 124 individual <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus), 100 individual black‐and‐white colobus (Colobus guereza), 111 individual red‐tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius), 578 human volunteers, and 364 domestic animals, including cattle (Bos indicus and B. indicusB. taurus crosses), goats (Caprus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and pigs (Sus scrofa). Microbiomes sorted strongly by host species, and forest fragmentation did not alter this pattern. Microbiomes of Kenyan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> sorted distinctly from microbiomes of Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> but microbiomes from these two <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations clustered more closely with each other than with any other species.

50|$|Another {{remarkable}} behavior {{occurs when}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys reach their restless and somewhat nomadic adolescence. This period {{is when the}} young monkeys leave their natal troops and look for another troop to join. This is not easy, as most troops are very suspicious and can get deadly when new monkeys try to join. The <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys have adapted their behavior by joining troops of green monkeys that are near the potential <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> troops that they wish to join, and living amongst {{them in order to}} spy on their potential new families. In one notable case, an adolescent male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent two years with a green monkey troop in order to spy in safety on a prospective troop in this manner.|$|R
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{is potentially}} confusing. Procolobus foai has, together {{with all other}} red colobuses, been considered a subspecies of Procolobus badius. When considered a separate species, the scientific name Procolobus oustaleti (Trouessart, 1906) {{has been used for}} the Central African Red Colobus, but this is incorrect, as the taxon foai precedes oustaleti by 7 years. Additionally, the taxon tephrosceles has been considered a subspecies of the Central African <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> but following Groves (2001) it is here recognized as a separate species, the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} the Central African <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus. As here defined, the Central African <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has 5 subspecies, although these are variable and hard to separate: ...|$|R

It is found south of Congo River and west of Lomami River. It had once been {{considered}} a subspecies of the P. badius. It was recognised as a distinct species by Dandelot in 1974, and this was followed by Groves in 2001, while others have suggested it should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus.|$|R

50|$|Fruit, {{seeds and}} foliage provide the primary food source of Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> The western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{frequently}} is hunted and eaten by larger carnivores, including common chimpanzees (specifically western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, {{in the range}} of P. b. waldronae), leopards, pythons, eagles and humans.|$|R
50|$|The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is a folivore so {{the main}} {{component}} of its diet is leaves. It {{is not limited}} to any tree species in particular and different groups in the same forest have shown preferences for different tree species. Although not particularly fussy about which species of tree it eats, the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> does have a preference for eating young leaves or the petioles of more mature leaves. Although uncommon the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has been observed eating bark, seeds and fruits, thought to be an important source of nutrients.|$|R

40|$|Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) hunt various primates, but {{concentrate}} on <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Piliocolobus spp.) wherever {{the two species}} are sympatric. The extraordinarily large Ngogo chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, preys heavily on the local population of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (P. tephrosceles). Census data showed a steep decline in this population {{in the center of}} the chimpanzees’ home range between 1975 and 2007 [Lwanga et al., 2011; Teelen, 2007 b]. Given no obvious change in food availability, predation by chimpanzees was the most likely cause [ibid.; Teelen, 2008]. However, census data from other parts of the home range raised the possibility that the decline was restricted to this central area [Teelen, 2007 a] We present data from 1998 to 2012 on the rate of encounters between chimpanzees and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> that provide a chimpanzee‐centered estimate of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density, thus of predation opportunities, throughout the home range. These corroborate census data by showing a long‐term decline in encounters near the center. They also show that encounters become relativelymore common at increasing distances from the center, but encounter rates have decreased even in peripheral areas and, by implication, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population has declined throughout the study area. These data corroborate Teelen’s [2008] conclusion that chimpanzee predation on <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> during the 1990 s and early 2000 s was unsustainable. Hunting rates and prey offtake rates have also declined markedly; whether this will allow the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population to recover is unknown. In contrast, rates at which chimpanzees encountered redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius) and grey‐cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) did not decrease.
