25|$|Beyond {{the elastic}} limit, <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> will occur. The elastic limit is {{therefore}} the lowest stress at which <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> can be measured. This requires a manual load-unload procedure, and the accuracy is critically {{dependent on the}} equipment used and operator skill. For elastomers, such as rubber, the elastic limit is {{much larger than the}} proportionality limit. Also, precise strain measurements have shown that plastic strain begins at low stresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{yield point}} determines {{the limits of}} {{performance}} for mechanical components, since it represents the upper limit to forces {{that can be applied}} without <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> In structural engineering, this is a soft failure mode which does not normally cause catastrophic failure or ultimate failure unless it accelerates buckling.|$|E
25|$|Hooke's law {{is only a}} first-order linear {{approximation}} to the real response of springs and other elastic bodies to applied forces. It must eventually fail once the forces exceed some limit, since no material can be compressed beyond a certain minimum size, or stretched beyond a maximum size, without some <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> or change of state. Many materials will noticeably deviate from Hooke's law well before those elastic limits are reached.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for ice strengthened tankers. This {{is driven by the}} growing oil exports from Russia, environmental impacts due to increased traffic, recent harsher ice conditions in Baltic Seas, and the accelerated IMO single hull tanker phase-out schedule. As a result, it has become very important to design ice strengthening side structures that are more producible while maintaining adequate safety and integrity. Plastic deformation theory has been successfully used in design formulations for ice impact loads. Although ice strengthening design standards have accepted a certain level of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations</b> to the side shell, the allowable <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations</b> are not explicitly identified. The latest advances in computer technology and computational software have made it possible to explicitly calculate the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations</b> of structures, which forms the basis for more rational designs.

This leads to a lot of tension and cracks in the panel and <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> Applying a cradle to the back of a panel painting almost always leads to more severe structural problems depending on the climate in which the painting is kept and the way the planks of the panel were saw.

25|$|SAO {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in the gene encoding the erythrocyte band 3 protein. There is a deletion of codons 400-408 in the gene, leading to a deletion of 9 amino-acids at the boundary between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of band 3 protein. Band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of ankyrin, spectrin, actin, and band 4.1. Ovalocyte band 3 binds more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 anion transporter. These qualitative defects create a red blood cell membrane that is less tolerant of shear stress and more susceptible to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In all these, {{a process}} is defined for loading the indenter, {{measuring}} the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers {{that are consistent with}} our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E

In this study, an innovative and integrated optimization procedure for multi-objective optimization of an on-road bicycle frame is presented. The multiple objectives are to reduce the bicycle frame’s <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations</b> and to decrease the bicycle frame’s mass. First, uniform design of experiments is applied to create a set of sampling points in the design space of control factors. Second, three-dimensional solid models of bicycle frames are constructed and <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations</b> of bicycle frames under dropping-mass and dropping-frame impact test simulations are measured by ANSYS and ANSYS/LS-DYNA. Third, Kriging interpolation is used to transform the discrete relations between input control factors and output measures to continuous surrogate models. Fourth, compromise programming and mixture uniform design of experiments are used to integrate the multiple-objective functions into one compromise objective function. Finally, generalized reduced gradient algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem. After executing the innovative optimization procedure, an optimized on-road bicycle frame is obtained. Comparing with the original design, the frame’s <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations</b> and mass are reduced. Therefore, both consolidation and lightweight of on-road bicycle frame are achieved...|$|R

40|$|Ruttings are {{the most}} {{essential}} damge of asphalt pavements at the time. Up to now the only measure to avoid ruttings is to use asphalt material with high resistance against <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations.</b> A first try to calculate the danger potential of several pavements referring ruttings in consideration of the stress-strain behaviour is the content of this presentation. First results demonstrate that especially pavements with thick asphalt layers and pavements with base courses with high stiffness have a high danger potential referring ruttings. But a background to judge the calculated strains is not known. So for these pavements we are only able to point at asphalt material with high resistance against <b>permanent</b> <b>deformations</b> again.
