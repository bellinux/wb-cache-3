40|$|An {{airscrew}} windmill {{has been}} designed {{for use in the}} north east trade wind regime of the Caribbean, which is shown to be particularly favourable for agricultural irrigation purposes. The high-speed fixed-pitch airscrew incorporates the most recent aerodynamic theory and is manufactured from fibre-glass reinforced epoxy resin. To compete with conventional prime movers high efficiency, low cost and long life are maintained by the use of standard industrial and automotive transmission components. The strength of the blades and supporting structure has been confirmed by structural proof tests. Field tests, in which the windmill was connected to a standard deep-well turbine <b>pump</b> <b>for</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation, have been made to determine the aerodynamic integrity of the airscrew design. The detailed performance characteristics obtained over an extended operating range provide a guide <b>for</b> wind <b>pumping</b> performance prediction purposes in water resource development programmes in the Caribbean and elsewhere...|$|R
50|$|Common mode failure, or common cause, failure {{has a more}} {{specific}} meaning in engineering. It refers to events which are not statistically independent. That is, failures in multiple parts of a system caused by a single fault, particularly random failures due to environmental conditions or aging. An example is {{when all of the}} <b>pumps</b> <b>for</b> a fire <b>sprinkler</b> system are located in one room. If the room becomes too hot <b>for</b> the <b>pumps</b> to operate, they will all fail at essentially the same time, from one cause (the heat in the room). Another example is an electronic system wherein a fault in a power supply injects noise onto a supply line, causing failures in multiple subsystems.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{emergency}} lights, {{emergency lighting}} {{is not a}} type of light fixture; it is a pattern of the building's normal lights that provides a path of lights to allow for safe exit, or lights up service areas such as mechanical rooms and electric rooms. Exit signs, Fire alarm systems (that are not on back up batteries) and the electric motor <b>pumps</b> <b>for</b> the fire <b>sprinklers</b> are almost always on emergency power. Other equipment on emergency power may include smoke isolation dampers, smoke evacuation fans, elevators, handicap doors and outlets in service areas. Hospitals use emergency power outlets to power life support systems and monitoring equipment. Some buildings may even use emergency power as part of normal operations, such as a theater using it to power show equipment because [...] "the show must go on." ...|$|R
30|$|An {{availability}} and reliability analysis of active protection systems {{is needed to}} assess the likelihood of failure of the system. Availability refers to if the system is in operational mode when the fire starts (compare to the first box in Figure  3), e.g. the system is unavailable if it has inadvertently {{been left out of}} service after maintenance (SFPE 2007). The system reliability on the other hand considers that the system does not always perform as designed or intended, e.g. if a component is failing during operation or if the fire hazard for some reason is greater than the design of the system, say an antagonistic attack. Another issue is whether the system is affected by the initiating event or not, as asked in Figure  3, this has mainly to do with if the system is isolated from the event, e.g. a separate <b>pump</b> house <b>for</b> the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>pumps</b> and risers presents a fairly isolated system compared to a sprinkler room within the building the system is protecting. In order to facilitate evaluation of an active system {{for the purpose of this}} method Table  6 has been developed.|$|R

Gravestock noted that where information on distribution shape is unknown, but upper and lower bounds are known, a uniform distribution may be appropriate which assigns equal probability to all potential values within the bounds. If the upper and lower bounds are known and a value of maximum probability is known, a triangular or PERT distribution may be more appropriate. Gravestock recommended using a mean effectiveness of 90 % <b>for</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems in apartments and 95 % <b>for</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems in offices, with lower bounds ranging from 46 % to 89 % and upper bounds ranging from 97 % to 99 %.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of soil erosion from irrigated and rainfed lands are similar. Soil particles are detached, transported and deposited. However, {{there are some}} systematic differences between irrigation and rainfall erosion. Electrolyte concentrations in irrigation water, for example, are almost always greater than in rain water. Differences between rainfall and irrigation are more prominent for surface irrigation than <b>for</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation. <b>For</b> instance, rainfall wets the soil before runoff begins, but water initially flows onto dry soil in irrigation furrows. Furthermore, furrow flow rate decreases with distance and increases with time, while the opposite tends to occur with rainfall. <b>For</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems, travel direction and slope aspect interact, so runoff can flow within the irrigated area or from the irrigated area onto dry or wet soil. Thus, a sprinkler-irrigation erosion model must consider both the rainfall-runoff situation and the furrow flow situation. These differences in soil and water interactions must be considered before computer models can accurately simulate irrigation-induced soil erosion...|$|R
40|$|Suitable areas <b>for</b> sub{{irrigation}} and <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation {{were identified}} in Richelieu and St-Hyacinthe counties. Land suitable for subirrigation includes uniform sandy textured profiles deeper than 1 m, with hydraulic conductivities greater than 0. 5 m/d and lying on a clay layer at approximately 2 m from the surface, and with slopes less than 0. 5 % and little or no microrelief.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to select the appropriate concentrations of Aquasorb gel-conditioner suitable <b>for</b> <b>sprinkler</b> infiltration, without causing surface sealing and the resulted water ponding. The first one was conducted on sandy soil columns treated uniformly with Aquasorb at four concentrations (Q: 0. 0, 0. 3, 0. 6 and 0. 9 % (on dry weight basis) under ponded infiltration. The purpose of this experiment was to test the absorbing and retention power of the conditioner especially at high concentration (0. 9 %). The second ex¬periment was carried out using sandy soil columns treated uniformly with the high concentrations of Aquasorb, namely 0. 6 and 0. 9 % under different sprinkler water application rates (R). The ponded infiltration experiment revealed that Aquasorb condi¬tioner possesses a high super absorbing and retention power for water especially at high concentration (0. 9 %). While the sprinkler infiltration experiment revealed that the concentration of Aquasorb was the main dominant variable affecting surface sealing rather than the kinetic energy at the soil surface. Thus {{it was suggested that}} the maximum Aquasorb concentration to be used is 0. 6 % conjugated with 20 cm depth as a maximum treated upper layer depth <b>for</b> <b>sprinkler</b> infiltration...|$|R
