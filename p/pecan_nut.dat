Since purchasing the 430 ha town, the community has added 7000 ha of agricultural land to the town. A pumping station on the Orange River, financed and built by the town's residents, provides water for agricultural use. The station is connected to a 9 km pipeline.|$|E
50|$|Pecan {{nuts are}} now a {{commercial}} crop in Australia with in excess of 100 growers in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. It is difficult to establish a direct link between the Acclimatisation society's work on pecan nuts and the present commercial crop.

However, the <b>pecan</b> <b>nut</b> trees at Lawnton are the only pre-World War II Acclimatisation Society plantings, known to be extant, that are related to commercial crops.

40|$|This study’s aims are: (1) to {{find out}} citizen’s social economy at each sub-district ini Southern Region of Deli Serdang Regency, (2) to analyse {{superior}} commodities in Southern Region of Deli Serdang Regency and their distribution at each sub-district, (3) to identify the number of agribussiness and settlement’s facilities at each sub-district in Southern Region of Deli Serdang Regency, and (4) to analyse and determine the sub districts which becames the center and agropolitan development area unit in Southern Region of Deli Serdang Regency. The {{study was conducted in}} seven sub-districts which belongs to Southern Region of Deli Serdang Regency. The data used in this study are society’s demography, production of agricultural commodities in 2009 - 2013, and also the number of agribussiness and settlement’s facilities. This study used description analysis, Location Quotient (LQ), Shift Share, and scalogram. The result of LQ and Shift Share analysis showed that there were seventeen superior commodities in Southern Region such as corns, cassavas, red chilis, tommatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, melons, bananas, zalaccas, petais, <b>pecan</b> <b>nuts,</b> cloves, kulit manis, beef cattles, buffaloes, goats, and pigs.

50|$|During {{some thirty}} years of {{operation}} at Lawnton, the society continued to assist Queensland's agricultural industry. In its research, the society worked with the Department of Agriculture and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (now the CSIRO). Plants introduced and researched at Lawnton included cotton, castor oil plants, avocados, pecan nuts, citrus fruits, macadamia nuts, custard apples, mangoes, pineapples, soy beans and fodder canes. The society contributed to making avocados, pecan nuts and grape fruit commercially viable crops in Queensland. The Allsopp variety of avocado, named after the society's overseer, was developed at the Lawnton gardens. The <b>Pecan</b> <b>Nut</b> grove was located at {{the northern end of}} the gardens on the present Bray Road. It was still flourishing when the gardens were sold.|$|E
50|$|A later {{experiment}} {{also conducted}} at the Vienna Goffin Lab by Prof. Auersperg and her team broadly adapted the Stanford marshmallow experiment for the Tanimbar corella, to investigate whether the birds were capable of self-control and of anticipating a delayed gain. The corellas were {{given the opportunity to}} exchange a favoured food item (in this case a <b>pecan</b> <b>nut)</b> for an even more desirable nut (a cashew), if they were only able to hold the first nut {{for a period of time}} and then return it to the human researcher's hand uneaten - at which point the nuts would be exchanged. Although pecan nuts are normally consumed instantly, it was discovered that the corellas could resist the temptation to eat the nut for periods of time for up to 80 seconds once aware that a cashew was also on offer. This behaviour (having also previously been demonstrated in corvids) further disproves the previous belief that birds are incapable of self-control.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pecan</b> <b>nuts</b> {{might become}} {{contaminated}} with foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella and E. coli., through birds and other {{potential sources of}} contamination {{that can lead to}} serious illness or even death, as well as financial losses. For example, the outbreak of Salmonella in pecan products in Texas caused major product recalls in 2010. Irradiation with electron beams could be an effective method of preventing potential outbreaks without changing the pecans' taste, color and flavor and without causing any risk of recontamination before the product reaches the consumer. However, when irradiation is applied alone, the shelf life of the product is decelerated because of the detrimental effect of lipid oxidation. Therefore, to extend the shelf of the pecans while assuring their safety, irradiation of pecans under modified atmosphere packing (MAP) conditions could be a viable option. This research showed that when treated with electron beams, surrogates of Escherichia coli (a cocktail of BAA- 1427, BAA- 1428, and BAA- 1430), and Salmonella (S. Typhimurium LT 2) were more resistant to ionizing radiation (higher D 10 values) when packed under vacuum (VP) than under air or other MAP conditions. This research also showed that lipid oxidation in pecans (due to exposure to ionizing radiation) shows a lag phase, probably due to the antioxidants present in <b>pecan</b> <b>nuts.</b> The lag phase represents a delay period before the <b>pecan</b> <b>nuts</b> start to get rancid (increase in PV formation), and it is best described by a modified Gompertz model. Kinetic evaluation of the lipid oxidation reaction suggests that the dose level has a more drastic effect in PV formation than the type of package used during the irradiation treatment, e. g., vacuum packed versus nitrogen-packed. Moreover, accelerated shelf life studies (4 weeks at 48. 9 oC) showed that vacuum-packed (VP) pecans can be stored at - 25 degrees C up to three years, while irradiated (at 3. 0 kGy) VP pecans can be stored only for eight months, without the detrimental effects of lipid oxidation. Therefore, irradiation of pecans under air at 3. 0 kGy reduces the shelf life of the nuts in terms of rancidity, but vacuum-packaging can be used to extend their shelf-life. Irradiation in oxygen packaging increases rancidity and the oxidation reaction rate accelerates with increasing dose. Irradiation under nitrogen packaging requires lower doses to achieve the almost same number of log reductions in microbial population. The use of nitrogen packaging also inhibits the oxidative reaction leading to rancidity in pecans. Although there are some drawbacks to the application of nitrogen packaging in an irradiation plant (special machinery and packaging films (permeability specifications for N 2 gas)), the savings induced by avoiding recalls may make this technology worthy of consideration...|$|R
