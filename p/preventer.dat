25|$|A ram blowout <b>preventer</b> {{is a large}} valve {{that can}} seal off a {{wellhead}} by using ram-types employing steel cut off rams to seal the borehole. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. In 1922, James Smither Abercrombie collaborated with Harry S. Cameron {{with the idea of}} creating a mechanically operated ram-type blowout <b>preventer.</b> A patent was issued in January 1926.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{pressure}} containing equipment {{at the surface}} of the well where casing strings are suspended and the blowout <b>preventer</b> or Christmas tree is connected.|$|E
25|$|An annular blowout <b>preventer</b> {{is a large}} valve {{that uses}} a wedge to seal off a wellhead. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an {{elastomeric}} packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. The annular blowout <b>preventer</b> was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9, 1952.|$|E
50|$|After graduating, England formed Bad Lib Theatre Company {{with fellow}} ex-Footlights Morwenna Banks, Robert Harley, Neil Mullarkey, Paul Simpkin and David Tyler, co-writing, {{performing}} and directing {{a number of}} comedy plays and shows. These included Feeling The Benefit, Get Your Coat, Dear, We’re Leaving..., The <b>Preventers</b> and The Return of the New <b>Preventers.</b> The latter two shows subsequently formed part of the BBC radio series Fab TV, and a one-off comedy, The <b>Preventers,</b> for ITV.|$|R
50|$|Blowout <b>preventers</b> were {{developed}} to cope with extreme erratic pressures and uncontrolled flow (formation kick) emanating from a well reservoir during drilling. Kicks {{can lead to a}} potentially catastrophic event known as a blowout. In addition to controlling the downhole (occurring in the drilled hole) pressure and the flow of oil and gas, blowout <b>preventers</b> are intended to prevent tubing (e.g. drill pipe and well casing), tools and drilling fluid from being blown out of the wellbore (also known as bore hole, the hole leading to the reservoir) when a blowout threatens. Blowout <b>preventers</b> are critical to the safety of crew, rig (the equipment system used to drill a wellbore) and environment, and to the monitoring and maintenance of well integrity; thus blowout <b>preventers</b> are intended to provide fail-safety to the systems that include them.|$|R

25|$|Riser Angle Monitoring. On drillships, riser angle {{monitoring}} can be {{fed into}} the DP system. It may be an electrical inclinometer or based on USBL, where a riser angle monitoring transponder is fitted to the riser and a remote inclinometer unit is installed on the Blow Out <b>Preventer</b> (BOP) and interrogated through the ship’s HPR.|$|E
25|$|Colby also {{focused on}} {{internal}} reforms within the CIA {{and the intelligence}} community. He attempted to modernize what he believed to be some out-of-date structures and practices by disbanding the Board of National Estimates {{and replacing it with}} the National Intelligence Council. In a speech from 1973 addressed to NSA employees he emphasised the role of free speech in USA and moral role of CIA as defender, not <b>preventer</b> of civil rights. He also mentioned a number of reforms intended to limit excessive classification of governmental information.|$|E
25|$|Samgyetang is a Korean {{chicken soup}} with Korean ginseng, dried jujube fruits, garlic, ginger, glutinous rice, and {{sometimes}} other medicinal herbs. It is {{held to be}} not only a cure for physical ailments but a <b>preventer</b> of sickness. Baeksuk, which is the Korean counterpart to the chicken noodle soup of Western culture, is also popular among Koreans for its power to cure minor illnesses such as a cold. While the chicken noodle soup, as the name suggests, has some noodles in it, quite often Baeksuk does not contain any noodles.|$|E

50|$|The {{bronchodilators}} {{are divided}} in short- and long-acting groups. Short-acting bronchodilators {{are used for}} relief of bronchoconstriction, while long-acting bronchodilators are predominantly used as <b>preventers.</b>|$|R

25|$|A further ten cars, {{numbered}} 116 to 125, {{were obtained}} {{during the year}} and during their life proved popular with the crews. They were top-covered, with normal stairs, and bodies built by the United Electric Car Company of Preston. They were fitted to Brill 21 E trucks and had two 40 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors with Dick, Kerr controllers and equipment, and B.T.H. magnetic slipper brakes. In May, one of these, no. 121, was demonstrated to the Committee, showing {{the action of the}} “run back” <b>preventer</b> and of the combined magnetic and mechanical track brake. At a later date this car was involved in an incident. It was foggy at the time, and both driver and conductor alighted near the top of Derby Road to find their whereabouts. On returning to their car they found that it had run away backwards down the hill to Gregory Street, where it collided with another car, knocking the latter into some gardens.|$|E
500|$|Deepwater Horizon was a fifth-generation, RBS-8D design (i.e. model type), deepwater, {{dynamically}} positioned, column-stabilized, semi-submersible mobile {{offshore drilling}} unit, designed to drill subsea wells for oil {{exploration and production}} using an , [...] blowout <b>preventer,</b> and a [...] outside diameter marine riser.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} Thailand in 2008, without injuries. In June 2008, a cesium-137 {{sealed radioactive source}} was found among scrap metal sold to a scrap dealer in Ayutthaya Province. The dealer recognized the trefoil symbol, and notified the OAP, which responded and found no leak of radiation or contamination. It could not, however, determine {{the origins of the}} equipment. In August, a recycling factory in Chachoengsao Province notified the OAP after a piece of scrap [...] metal set off its gate detector alarm. The OAP found that the piece of metal contained radium-226 sources, and concluded that it originated from unlicensed use in a lightning <b>preventer.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} free will is deeply linked with the causal {{relevance}} of mental events. The causal exclusion argument claims that, {{in order to be}} causally relevant, mental events must be identical to physical events. However, Gibb has recently criticized it, suggesting that mental events are causally relevant as double <b>preventers.</b> For Gibb, mental events enable physical effects to take place by preventing other mental events from preventing a behaviour to take place. The role of mental double <b>preventers</b> is hence similar to what Libet names free won’t, namely the ability of vetoing an action initiated unconsciously by the brain. In this paper I will propose an argument against Gibb’s account, the causal irrelevance argument, which claims that Gibb’s proposal do not overcome the objection of systematic overdetermination of causal relevance, because mental double <b>preventers</b> systematically overdetermine physical ones, and therefore mental events are causally irrelevant...|$|R

500|$|During its {{lifetime}} the rig received 5 citations for non-compliance, 4 {{of which}} were in 2002 (safety, including the blowout <b>preventer)</b> {{and the other in}} 2003 (pollution). A sixth citation in 2007 related to non-grounded electrical equipment was later withdrawn when the equipment was determined to be compliant with regulations. Overall the Deepwater Horizon safety record was [...] "strong" [...] according to a drilling consultant reviewing the information. In 2009 the Minerals Management Service [...] "herald the Deepwater Horizon as an industry model for safety". According to AP's investigation [...] "its record was so exemplary, according to MMS officials, that the rig was never on inspectors' informal 'watch list' for problem rigs".|$|E
500|$|At [...] CDT on 20 April 2010, {{during the}} final phases of {{drilling}} the exploratory well at Macondo, a geyser of seawater erupted from the marine riser onto the rig, shooting [...] into the air. [...] This was soon followed by the eruption of a slushy combination of drilling mud, methane gas, and water. The gas component of the slushy material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited {{into a series of}} explosions and then a firestorm. An attempt was made to activate the blowout <b>preventer,</b> but it failed. The final defense to prevent an oil spill, a device known as a blind shear ram, was activated but failed to plug the well.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Preventer,</b> is cordage {{attached}} {{to the end of}} the boom and fixed to (or running through a block) on the rail athwart or forward of the mast. [...] Its most common purpose is to prevent potentially dangerous movement of the spar in an accidental gybe.|$|E

5000|$|Blowout <b>Preventers</b> often {{contain a}} stack of independently-operated cutoff mechanisms, so there is {{redundancy}} in case of failure, {{and the ability to}} work in all normal circumstances with the drill pipe in or out of the well bore. The BOP used in the Deepwater Horizon, for example, had five [...] "rams" [...] and two [...] "annular" [...] blowout <b>preventers.</b> [...] The rams were of two types: [...] "pipe rams" [...] and [...] "shear rams". If the drill pipe is in the well, the pipe rams slide perpendicular to the pipe, closing around it to form a tight seal. The annular <b>preventers</b> also close around the pipe, but have more of a vertical motion, so they loosen slightly if the drill pipe is being pushed downward, as might be necessary in a [...] "snubbing" [...] or [...] "well kill" [...] operation. [...] Shear rams may be used as a last resort to cut through the drill pipe and shut off everything, including whatever might be coming up inside the drill pipe.|$|R

60|$|Hans nodded. There was no {{time for}} talk, for orders were given for getting <b>preventer</b> stays on the foremast. The jib, having done its work, had been hauled down the instant the ship payed off; and a small storm sail set, in its place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. James," [...] {{the captain}} shouted, [...] "we must get <b>preventer</b> stays, at once, upon the fore mast. The main mast may go, if it likes, and at present {{we shall be}} all the better without it, but the {{foremast}} we must keep, if we can." ...|$|E
50|$|A blowout is the {{uncontrolled}} {{release of}} crude oil and/or natural gas from an oil well or gas well after pressure control systems have failed. Modern wells have blowout <b>preventers</b> intended to prevent such an occurrence.|$|R
50|$|If the blowout <b>preventers</b> and mud do not {{restrict}} the upward pressures of a kick, a blowout results, potentially shooting tubing, {{oil and gas}} up the wellbore, damaging the rig, and leaving well integrity in question.|$|R
5000|$|Blowout <b>preventers</b> {{are used}} on land wells, {{offshore}} rigs, and subsea wells. Land and subsea BOPs are secured {{to the top}} of the wellbore, known as the wellhead. BOPs on offshore rigs are mounted below the rig deck. Subsea BOPs are connected to the offshore rig above by a drilling riser that provides a continuous pathway for the drill string and fluids emanating from the wellbore. In effect, a riser extends the wellbore to the rig. Unfortunately, blowout <b>preventers</b> do not always function correctly. An example of this is the Deepwater Horizon blowout, where the pipe line going through the BOP was slightly bent and the BOP failed to cut the pipe.|$|R
60|$|During {{the most}} violent shocks of the Typhoon, {{the man at the}} Pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though <b>preventer</b> tackles had been {{attached}} to it-- for they were slack--because some play to the tiller was indispensable.|$|E
