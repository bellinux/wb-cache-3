5|$|The {{skeleton}} (catalogue number QG24) {{has been}} found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface exponation and plant roots. It includes the pelvis and sacrum, most of the left hind limb and foot, a right thigh bone, and twelve anterior tail vertebrae. These remains <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> a single individual as they were all found articulated (still connected together). Additionally, several disarticulated bones were found, including the right forearm and some metacarpalia and phalanges from both {{the right and left}} forefeet, probably also pertaining to this individual. Later, the site was revisited by the scientists Geoffrey Bond and Michael Cooper, who were able to collect additional remains including a scapula (specimen QG152, a shoulder blade) and a fragment of a neck vertebra. These remains show that more than one individual was present, and it is possible that they do not <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> Vulcanodon at all. Today, the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the rocks}} in which Carnotaurus was found were {{assigned}} to {{the upper part of the}} Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or Cenomanian stage).

The teeth would have been the only preserved elements of the skull. However, as shown by Cooper (1984), these teeth do not <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass.|$|E

5|$|The Edmontonian land {{vertebrate}} age {{is defined}} by the first appearance of Edmontosaurus regalis in the fossil record.

Edmontosaurus regalis is known from the lowest of five units within the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, but is absent from at least the second to the top.
