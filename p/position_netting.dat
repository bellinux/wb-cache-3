40|$|The {{objectives}} {{and functions of}} payments systems in centrally planned economies are described and analyzed. These are compared to those of payments systems in market economies and to the characteristics of an ideal payments system. The dominant {{role of the state}} in the centrally planned economies meant that the state underwrote virtually all payments risk. With the withdrawal of the state, however, participants became exposed to credit, liquidity, and operational risks. In the transition, the central bank has a key role to play in payments systems. Areas where rapid improvements are possible are: accounting, clearing, settlement, netting and standardization.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> by type of trader on return volatility in six foreign currency futures markets using the weekly Commitments of Traders (COT) data. When <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> are decomposed into expected and unexpected components, we find that expected <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> by type of trader generally do not co-vary with volatility. However, volatility is positively associated with shocks (in either direction) in <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> of speculators and small traders, and negatively related to shocks (in either direction) in <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> of hedgers. This evidence suggests that changes in speculative positions destabilize the market. Consistent with dispersion of beliefs models and noise trading theories, hedgers appear to possess private information, whereas speculators and small traders are less informed in these markets. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{founders of}} the Bretton Woods System 60 years ago were {{primarily}} concerned with orderly exchange rate adjustment in a world economy that was characterized by widespread restrictions on international capital mobility. In contrast, the rapid pace of financial globalization during recent years poses new challenges for the international monetary system. In particular, large gross cross-holdings of foreign assets and liabilities mean that the valuation channel of exchange rate adjustment has grown in importance, relative to the traditional trade balance channel. Accordingly, this paper empirically explores some of the interconnections between financial globalization and exchange rate adjustment and discusses the policy implications.

By buying on 1 August for settlement on 14 August (depending on the market and asset but the norm would be 3 August) the investor has locked into the 1st of August price without having to pay for it for two weeks.

It provides a simple accounting framework that disentangles the factors driving {{the accumulation of}} external assets and liabilities (such as trade imbalances, investment income flows, and capital gains) for major external creditors and debtors. It also examines the factors driving the foreign asset portfolio of international investors, with a special focus on the weight of U.

Finally, it relates the empirical evidence to the current debate about the roles of portfolio balance effects and exchange rate adjustment in shaping the external adjustment process.

40|$|International {{financial}} integration has greatly increased the scope {{for changes in}} a country''s <b>net</b> foreign asset <b>position</b> through the valuation channel, namely capital gains and losses on external assets and liabilities. We examine this valuation channel in a dynamic equilibrium portfolio model with international trade in equity.

Specifically, we disentangle the roles of excess returns, capital gains, and portfolio adjustment for consumption risk sharing when financial markets are incomplete.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{external adjustment}} in the United States, Japan and Germany {{from the perspective}} of <b>net</b> foreign asset <b>positions.</b> It asks two questions: What are, in the long run, the determinants of net foreign asset equilibrium? and: What are, in the short run, some of the adjustment mechanisms sustaining that equilibrium? An analysis of post-war data produces two insights. First, using a cointegration approach, the existence of long-run net foreign asset equilibrium can be identified: it is a function of demographic variables and public debt. Second, deviations from long-run equilibrium give rise to feedback through different components of domestic absorption in the three countries.

A variety of indicators suggest that Mozambique has recently lost external price competitiveness with respect to its major trading partners. Consistent with these indicators, an exchange rate assessment indicates that the metical is overvalued by 26 to 41 percent in real effective terms. If sustained, an overvaluation of this magnitude {{has the potential to}} retard economic growth and jeopardize external stability, calling for an adjustment of monetary policy to gradually restore external price competitiveness.
