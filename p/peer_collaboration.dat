Markov chains are used to model applications and realistically capture the behavior of practical systems. The model is first analytically investigated, and then data persistence is measured using an erasure coding redundancy scheme.

Although problem-solving skills can be learned, enhanced, studied and mastered, these skills are still not sufficiently exposed and trained to students at the moment. Realizing the huge potential of social networking sites (SNS) that may serve as a promising learning platform, this paper discusses the potential of using Facebook as an informal alternative learning tool to enhance problem-solving skills among school students.

50|$|Literature circles {{combine the}} best {{practices}} of collaborative learning and student-directed learning. They {{are not to}} be confused with book discussion clubs, currently popular in some circles. While both book clubs and literature circles focus on discussion of books in small group settings, book clubs have a more loosely structured agenda for discussions and are not usually tied into literary analysis such as thematic or symbolic analysis. Furthermore, literature circles are the domain of the classroom, both at the elementary and secondary level, and involve various types of assessment (including self-assessment, observations and conferences) and evaluation (portfolios, projects and student artifacts) by both the teacher and the student. Literature circles are a pedagogically sound alternative to teacher-centered discourse. They can be used at all grade and ability levels, and are often credited with instilling a love of reading and discussion in students. Furthermore, current research indicates that <b>peer</b> <b>collaboration</b> has a positive effect on student learning and performance in Language Arts (Fall et al., 2000), increases student learning, and also improves reading comprehension and content-knowledge (Klinger, Vaugn and Schumm, 1998, cited in Daniels, 2002).|$|E
