5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The <b>prothallus</b> is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
50|$|In {{ferns and}} their allies, {{including}} clubmosses and horsetails, the conspicuous plant {{observed in the}} field is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid spores develop in sori {{on the underside of the}} fronds and are dispersed by the wind (or in some cases, by floating on water). If conditions are right, a spore will germinate and grow into a rather inconspicuous plant body called a <b>prothallus.</b> The haploid <b>prothallus</b> does not resemble the sporophyte, and as such ferns and their allies have a heteromorphic alternation of generations. The <b>prothallus</b> is short-lived, but carries out sexual reproduction, producing the diploid zygote that then grows out of the <b>prothallus</b> as the sporophyte. For further information, see Fern: Life cycle.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} all ferns, T. boschianum {{exhibits}} a gametophyte stage in its life cycle (alternation of generations) and develops a haploid reproductive <b>prothallus</b> {{as an independent}} plant. In contrast to the typical heart-shaped fern <b>prothallus,</b> T. boschianum gametophytes are filamentous and resemble colonies of green algae or moss protonemata.|$|E

50|$|In most ferns, {{gametophyte}} is a photosynthetic free {{living organism}} called a <b>prothallus.</b> For example, in the leptosporangiate fern Dryopteris, the gametophyte is a free-living, autotrophic <b>prothallus</b> that produces gametes and maintains the sporophyte during its early multicellular development. However, in some groups, notably the clade that includes Ophioglossaceae and Psilotaceae, the gametophytes are subterranean and subsist by forming mycotrophic relationships with fungi.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gametophyte}} produces gametes (often both {{sperm and}} eggs {{on the same}} <b>prothallus)</b> by mitosis.|$|E
5000|$|C. venosum is at {{no threat}} of {{worldwide}} extinction, but extreme events like large-scale wildfires can reduce population sizes and exacerbate {{the effect of}} anthropogenic disturbances. Due to its heavy reliance on D. antartica the species has a limited dispersion rate which can be halted by dry landscapes acting as geological boundaries.Like other ferns, C. venosum undergoes alteration of generations which consists of two sexual stages - the diploid sporophyte and the haploid gametophyte. The sporophyte stage of C. venosum consists of adult ferns which release a numerous amount of spores. These spores then settle on the trunks of D. antartica in a moist and sheltered habitat. Spores germinate {{within a few days}} and form a one cell layer thick, heart-shaped <b>prothallus.</b> In ferns, the time required for the <b>prothallus</b> to sexually mature may require several months to several years of development. The male antheridia matures and releases its gametes earlier than the female archegonia in an effort to avoid self fertilisation. The <b>prothallus</b> can reproduce asexally through the release of gemmae which on germination produce rhizoids, filaments and antheridia or more gemmae. The <b>prothallus</b> can also reproduce itself vegetatively by regeneration. Once established, C. venosum spreads to surrounding substrate through its extensively creeping rhizomes.|$|E
50|$|Spore-bearing plants, {{like all}} plants, {{go through a}} {{life-cycle}} of alternation of generations. The fully grown sporophyte, what is {{commonly referred to as}} the fern, produces genetically unique spores in the sori by meiosis. The haploid spores fall from the sporophyte and germinate by mitosis, given the right conditions, into the gametophyte stage, the <b>prothallus.</b> The <b>prothallus</b> develops independently for several weeks; it grows sex organs that produce ova (archegonia) and flagellated sperm(antheridia). The sperm are able to swim to the ova for fertilization to form a diploid zygote which divides by mitosis to form a multicellular sporophyte. In the early stages of growth, the sporophyte grows out of the <b>prothallus,</b> depending on it for water supply and nutrition, but develops into a new independent fern, which will produce new spores that will grow into new prothallia etc., thus completing the life cycle of the organism.|$|E
5000|$|A spore grows into a haploid {{gametophyte}} by mitosis (a {{process of}} cell division which maintains {{the number of}} chromosomes). The gametophyte typically consists of a photosynthetic <b>prothallus.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Areolate lichens are crustose lichens (that is, lichens {{that grow}} like a crust of paint) {{that appear to}} be broken up into {{somewhat}} polygonal pieces like old cracked paint. The pieces are called aereolas (areaeolae). The appearance is similar to the island-like pieces of dried-cracked mud in a dry lakebed. The areaolae [...] "islands" [...] are connected by an underlying <b>prothallus</b> to make a single lichen organism. The <b>prothallus</b> is often dark and not noticeable, whereby the different aereolae appear to be disconnected. Sometimes the aereolae curl up at the edges and continue growing at the edges so that they overlap, which is called being squamulose.|$|E
5000|$|Its <b>prothallus</b> {{contains}} glandular trichomes. It {{usually has}} 32 spores per sporangium, but many with only 16 have been observed, produced from eight 2n mother cells. [...] It is diploid and has 60 chromosomes in its root tip cells.|$|E
5000|$|Aspicilia cyanescens (bluish sunken disk lichen) is a rough surfaced, bluish-tinged pale gray rimose to areolate crustose lichen, {{endemic to}} California. It mostly grows on rock. It is unique among California members of its genus {{in that it}} can {{sometimes}} be found on growing on bark or wood, especially incense cedar and sometimes on white fir or giant sequoias in the central Sierra Nevada range and southern California mountains. It has a black or bluish or greenish <b>prothallus.</b> The <b>prothallus</b> is usually absent when growing on rock. Each areole commonly has 1-7 roundish to angular apothecia that are [...]1 - 1.3 mm in diameter. Apothecia have black to blue-black, concave to flat discs, without pruina. Lichen spot tests are all negative.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prothallus</b> {{is either}} absent or vestigial, with areoles {{sometimes}} being contiguous and sometimes scattered. The 0.5-1 mm wide areaolas may be irregular to round, with edges that are sometimes raised (squamulous), and thickened where they raise up. Coastal forms are more pale yellowish green than gray.|$|E
50|$|A prothallium, or <b>prothallus</b> (from Latin pro = {{forwards}} and Greek θαλλος (thallos) = twig) {{is usually}} the gametophyte stage {{in the life of}} a fern or other pteridophyte. Occasionally the term is also used to describe the young gametophyte of a liverwort or peat moss as well.|$|E
5000|$|Drynaria lends {{its name}} to {{a certain type of}} prothallial germination, the 'Drynaria type', {{observed}} in several other ferns. In this type, the spores germinate into a germ filament composed of barrel-shaped chlorophyllous cells with one or more rhizoids at the base cell. The tipmost cell divides repeatedly by cross-walls, forming a broad spatulate (spoon-shaped) prothallial plate. One of the cells at the top margin of the <b>prothallus</b> then divides obliquely when it has 5, 10, or more cells across its width. This results in an [...] meristematic cell. Division by this type of cell is parallel to each other and perpendicular {{to the rest of the}} cells, forming rows. This eventually results in the formation of a notch at the anterior edge of the <b>prothallus,</b> giving it a roughly heart-shaped appearance (cordate).|$|E
5000|$|... (2) Synthesising 13 F1 hybrids in 4 fern genera (an {{achievement}} in itself judged against {{the chances of}} self-fertilisation in a fern <b>prothallus</b> bearing both antheridia and archegonia) and which do not lend themselves to emasculation and, therefore, ensure self-fertilisation) and meiotic analysis of these hybrids, have led him to postulate: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetative}} {{body of the}} lichen, the thallus, is {{orange or}} orange-red in colour and may be continuous or fragmented. When fragmented the thallus looks lumpy under a hand lens; when continuous it is areolate and the margins may be ill-defined with almost no lobes; it is never powdery or pruinose. A light coloured <b>prothallus</b> may be visible in well-developed specimens.|$|E
50|$|Like other spore-bearing plants, Drynaria {{exhibits}} metagenesis or the alternation of generations. One generation {{being the}} diploid multicellular sporophyte (the phase where {{the plant is}} most familiar), and the other being the haploid multicellular gametophyte (the phase where the plant {{is known as a}} <b>prothallus).</b> Gametophytes develop from spores released by mature sporophytes; while sporophytes, in turn, develop from the fusion of gametes produced by mature prothalli.|$|E
5000|$|It is verrucose (grows like a warty crust) or areolate (broken up on {{the surface}} into [...] "areoles" [...] that look like the {{polygonal}} mud [...] "islands" [...] in a dry lakebed), with small convex areolas or verrucae (warts), and is without a <b>prothallus</b> (the body part under the areola [...] "islands" [...] that connects them). The areoles are small and convex to warty, verrucose).|$|E
50|$|Caloplaca albovariegata (variegated orange lichen) is a gray, blue-gray, or {{dark green}} crustose areolate lichen that grows on rocks {{in areas of}} western North America such as Arizona and California. It is common in the Mojave Desert. It has no <b>prothallus.</b> It is in the Caloplaca fungus genus of the Teloschistaceae family. It is similar to Caloplaca peliophylla, which has lighter brown apothecia discs and more narrow spore isthmus.|$|E
50|$|The cordate <b>prothallus</b> {{are usually}} smaller with thinner midribs {{than that of}} other members of Polypodiaceae. They are also usually more sparsely haired, with some prothalli rarely having {{multicellular}} hair. They mature after six to nine months, and finish their life cycle at around a year. The gametophytes produce male (antheridium), and female (archegonium) gametes. The gametes fuse, forming the diploid sporophyte, the 'fern' part of the life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|In {{seedless}} vascular {{plants such}} as ferns and lycopodiophyta, the term [...] "sporeling" [...] refers to the young sporophyte growing on the gametophyte. These sporelings develop via an embryo stage from a fertilized egg inside an archegonium and depend on the gametophyte for their early stages of growth before becoming independent sporophytes. Young fern sporelings can often be found with the <b>prothallus</b> gametophyte still attached {{at the base of}} their fronds.|$|E
50|$|Caloplaca nashii is {{an orange}} crustose lichen found on {{calcareous}} rocks in northern Mexico, southern California, and Baja California. It {{is the most}} common of many members of the Caloplaca genus found on rocks in Joshua Tree National Park. It may sometimes be slightly endolithic (growing inside solid rock). It does not have elongated lobes like some other crustose lichens. It has no <b>prothallus.</b> It is in the Caloplaca fungus genus of the Teloschistaceae family.|$|E
5000|$|Just as with {{seed plants}} and mosses, {{the life cycle}} of pteridophytes {{involves}} alternation of generations. This means that a diploid generation (the sporophyte, which produces spores) is followed by a haploid generation (the gametophyte or <b>prothallus,</b> which produces gametes). Pteridophytes differ from mosses and seed plants in that both generations are independent and free-living, although the sporophyte is generally much larger and more conspicuous. The sexuality of pteridophyte gametophytes can be classified as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|In its diploid phase, a carpospore can {{germinate}} {{to form a}} filamentous [...] "conchocelis stage", {{which can}} also self-replicate using monospores. The conchocelis stage eventually produces conchosporangia. The resulting conchospore germinates to form a tiny <b>prothallus</b> with rhizoids, which develops to a cm-scale leafy thallus. This too can reproduce via monospores, which are produced inside the thallus itself. They can also reproduce via spermatia, produced internally, which are released to meet a prospective carpogonium in its conceptacle.|$|E
5000|$|It has short, {{inflated}} looking elongate 1-2 mm and [...]3-.1 mm wide lobes {{that have}} an abrupt margin at the edge, and no <b>prothallus.</b> It lacks isidea or soredia. Apothecia may be immersed in the thallus or adnate to it, with rims of thallus-like tissue (lecanorine) with orange, flat, [...]4-1 mm wide epruinose discs. Aptohecia develop near the lobe tips. C. ignea and C. impolita are similar but bigger, and have apothecia that form near the thallus center.|$|E
50|$|Flat {{to almost}} convex areoles are angular to irregular, and 0.2 - 2 mm in diameter. They are {{contiguous}} but clearly separated by well defined cracks. It usually lacks a <b>prothallus.</b> It may be rimose toward the outer edges. Each areole has 1 - 10, round to angular or irregular, 0.1 -1.6 mm apothecia {{that may be}} confluent when numerous. Apothecia have usually black concave discs, with exciple margins of thallus tissue. Asci are club shaped (clavate), with 8 ellipsoid ascospores.|$|E
50|$|The {{gametophyte}} of L. obscurum is disc shaped <b>prothallus,</b> measuring {{an average}} of 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) in diameter. It closely resembles other gametophytes of genus Lycopodium, so it cannot be identified by gametophyte alone. Doing so would be difficult nonetheless, as this type of gametophyte grows only underground, years after a disturbance has taken place. Therefore, the compact soil caused by repeated human traffic would disturb these areas, causing L. obscurum spores not to germinate and existing gametophyes to be damaged or killed.|$|E
5000|$|Bellemerea alpina (brown sunken disk lichen) is a {{white to}} pale tan, thick crustose areolate lichen that grows on rock in the {{mountains}} worldwide. It grows in arctic-alpine habitats in Eurasia, North America (south to California and Arizona), Australia, and New Zealand. Areoles are sometimes contiguous and sometimes dispersed. It often has very visible black <b>prothallus.</b> The brown to tan apothecia have a purplish tinge and are grayed by a pruinose coating, and embedded in the areoles, giving a similar appearance {{to members of the}} genus Aspicilia.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} all ferns, H. tunbrigense {{exhibits}} a gametophyte stage in its life cycle (alternation of generations) and develops a haploid reproductive <b>prothallus</b> {{as an independent}} plant. Information about the gametophyte is scarce but {{it is likely to}} be inconspicuous with a narrow ribbon-like thallus. The gametophyte may be able to reproduce itself vegetatively by gemmae in the absence of the sporophyte. Gametophytes of the related Killarney fern (Trichomanes speciosum) have been found outside the geographical range of the sporophyte and this may prove to be true of Hymenophyllum tunbrigense.|$|E
50|$|The {{germination}} of the gametophyte {{corresponds to}} the Cyathea genus, giving rise to short strands of from two to six cells in both varieties. The <b>prothallus</b> development is of the Adiantum type. When raised in the laboratory, gametophytes of the quadripinnata variety are always chordates, however gametophytes of the contracta variety possess three morphs, depending on the density of spores that are developed (Dyer 1979). At low density, they are long spatulates with a central meristem and a slightly more developed wing than the other; at medium densities they are cordiforms and at high densities are band-like with {{a large amount of}} antheridia.|$|E
5000|$|Aspicilia confusa (***) is a pale gray (sometimes brownish) crustose areolate lichen {{that grows}} mostly on rock in {{southern}} and central California mountains, from 250 to 3170 m. Areoles may be contiguous or dispersed. It has a dark, fringed <b>prothallus.</b> Each areole commonly has 1-4 round to angular aspicilioid apothecia that are 0.1-1.5 mm in diameter, sunken into it. Each apothecia has a usually concave, black disc. Lichen spot tests are all negative. It grows on rock in chaparral or forests {{in central and}} southern California, including the Sierra Nevadas, {{but not in the}} southeastern deserts of California.|$|E
