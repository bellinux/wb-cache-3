5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the National Security Council (NSC) {{meeting on}} September 6, it was agreed that the <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> to obtain more {{information}} on the situation in Vietnam. US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara proposed sending Marine Corps Major General Victor Krulak on an immediate fact-finding trip. The NSC agreed that Joseph Mendenhall—a Foreign Service Officer with Vietnam experience—would accompany him and the pair began the mission later that day.|$|E

For these the superchargers were {{modified}} single-stage units and the engine was re-engineered for use in a marine environment. Some 70 engines were converted before <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> given to producing aero engines.|$|E

At building C of the Faculty of Engineering University of Riau supply of electricity from PLN and genset. Genset installed in the building currently only supplies {{the third floor of}} the building. So if the energy supply of PLN is dead then the second floor and the first floor does not get supply of electrical power from the genset. This study discussed about the needs and USAge scheme automatically loads. Analysis of load USAge based on need. Results of analysis are used to determine the priority use of the power generator.

5000|$|In ICPP, a task's <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> {{immediately}} raised when it locks a resource. The task's <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> set to {{the priority}} ceiling of the resource, thus no task that may lock the resource is able to get scheduled. This ensures the OCPP property that [...] "A task can only lock a resource if its dynamic <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks".|$|R
5|$|Prior to the cup final, Napoli were {{in third}} place in Serie A and {{therefore}} in the last position {{to qualify for the}} Champions League, eight points ahead of Fiorentina with nine points left to play for. Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella said before the game that his <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> to finish fourth and win the Coppa Italia. His Napoli counterpart, Rafael Benítez, warned his players not to expect to win solely based on their league position.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy and Air Force {{had been}} {{depleted}} during World War II. They {{were unable to}} deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees. This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees to travel on trains from outlying districts to Hanoi and Haiphong, as their <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> evacuating their military personnel and equipment. France asked Washington for assistance, so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to mobilise an evacuation task force.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> given to {{the completion of the}} western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E

In early 1946, {{the conversion of the}} LNER line from Mill Hill East to Edgware was scheduled by the LPTB for completion between January 1947 and June 1948. No work was carried out as maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds.

5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, {{even though they had}} not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> thought to be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, top <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{given to}} the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E

50|$|In OCPP, a task X's <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> raised when a higher-priority task Y {{tries to}} acquire a {{resource}} that X has locked. The task's <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> then raised to the priority ceiling of the resource, ensuring that task X quickly finishes its critical section, unlocking the resource. A task is only allowed to lock a resource if its dynamic <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks. Otherwise the task becomes blocked, waiting for the resource.|$|R
5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} to redeploy to the Mariana Islands. The Command ceased its {{attacks on}} Japan and East Asia, {{for which it}} used bases in China to refuel the B-29s en route to their targets, and instead focused on targets in Southeast Asia that could be reached from Kharagpur. As there were few industrial targets within range of Kharagpur, the highest <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> given to attacking shipping in major ports such as Rangoon, Bangkok and Singapore as well as smaller harbours. Attacks were conducted through both conventional bombing and laying naval mines. As part of the transition, LeMay departed for the Mariana Islands on 18 January {{and was replaced by}} Brigadier General Roger M. Ramsey.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
50|$|In Operating systems, aging (US English) or ageing is a {{scheduling}} {{technique used}} to avoid starvation. Fixed <b>priority</b> scheduling <b>is</b> a scheduling discipline, in which tasks queued for utilizing a system resource <b>are</b> assigned a <b>priority</b> each. A task {{with a high}} <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> allowed to access a specific system resource before a task with a lower <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> allowed to do the same. A disadvantage {{of this approach is}} that tasks assigned with a lower <b>priority</b> may <b>be</b> starved when a large number of high <b>priority</b> tasks <b>are</b> queued. Aging is used to gradually increase the priority of a task, based on its waiting time in the ready queue.|$|R
30|$|Every cell has a {{shifting}} <b>priority,</b> which <b>is</b> used {{to indicate the}} processing order of the corresponding cell, i.e., the cell with higher shifting priority can prioritize its TDD frame configuration. The cell shifting <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> composed of two parts: the interference priority part and the service priority part. The interference <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> defined as the worst SINR deviation from the SINR threshold (it should be ensured that the worst SINR of a cell should be greater than the SINR threshold). The higher the interference <b>priority</b> <b>is,</b> the easier it can {{meet the requirements of}} the interference conditions and the greater it can contribute to the cell shifting priority. The service priority indicates how close the radio frame configuration is to the traffic; the higher the service <b>priority</b> <b>is,</b> the easier it can satisfy the requirement of the traffic and the greater it can contribute to the cell shifting priority.|$|R

5|$|Leopold's <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> to {{rest his}} leg. Wolfgang passed {{the time by}} {{composing}} a short minuet, K.122/73t, and a Miserere in A minor, K.85/73s. Meanwhile, the libretto for the Milan opera arrived; Leopold had been expecting Metastasio's La Nitteti, but it was Mitridate, re di Ponto, by Vittorio Cigna-Santi. According to the correspondence of Leopold, the composer Josef Mysliveček was a frequent visitor to the Mozart household while they were staying in Bologna. The musicologist Daniel E. Freeman believes that Mozart's approach to the composition of arias changed fundamentally at this time, bringing his style into closer alignment with that of Mysliveček.|$|E
5|$|Much of Alvarado Canyon Road from San Diego to La Mesa was {{originally}} built between 1947 and 1950, a bypass {{of the old}} US 80 routing along El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard. Work began to convert the original US 80 divided highway into a freeway in 1960, and the freeway was complete west of El Cajon by April 1962. <b>Priority</b> <b>was</b> given to planning US 80 in 1962 by the California Chamber of Commerce. In 1964, I-8 was officially designated by the California State Legislature, and the US 80 designation was removed. By 1965, I-8 from Fairmount Avenue to El Cajon Boulevard {{was one of the}} first freeway stretches in the county to have a center barrier installed in the median.|$|E
5|$|Mumma {{arrived back}} in the United States in December 1945, and {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> to develop nuclear propulsion for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul F. Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear-powered ship.|$|E

5|$|Norving (previously Varangfly) started {{offering}} {{flights to}} the closed-down military airport in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander. The background was a landing at the airfield to transport {{a baby to}} Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration stated {{that they were not}} opposed to building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> constructing a network of regional airports. The service started off with a daily round trip ordered by the district physician; patients had priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. After a month a second daily round trip was introduced.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May the Dutch {{commander}} General Winkelman {{was faced}} with two priorities. First of {{all he wanted to}} eliminate the German airborne troops. Though the strategic assault had failed, he feared a further enemy build-up via Waalhaven and saw the German possession of the Moerdijk bridges as a serious impediment to the movement of allied reinforcements to the Fortress Holland. The second <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> closely related to the first: enabling the French army to build up a strong defensive line in North Brabant, to connect the Fortress Holland with the Allied main force in Belgium. As he had withdrawn most of his troops from the area, Winkelman had only limited means available to influence this process, largely leaving the task to local commanders.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich {{to solve}} the railway crisis in 1935. Kaganovich first prioritised {{bottleneck}} areas over other less-traveled areas; his second <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> investing in heavy traffic lines, and thirdly, the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves. Another problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by the authorities. The industrialisation {{proved to be a}} heavy burden on the railways, and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress. Even so, the Soviet Government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany, which became reality in 1941.|$|E
