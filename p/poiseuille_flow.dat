40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{show the}} {{existence}} of real-analytic stationary Navier-Stokes flows with isotropic streamlines in all latitudes in some simply-connected flow re-gion on a rotating round sphere. We also exclude the possibility of having a <b>Poiseuille’s</b> <b>flow</b> profile {{to be one of}} these stationary Navier-Stokes flows with isotropic stream-lines. When the sphere is replaced by a 2 -dimensional hyperbolic space, we also give the analog existence result for stationary parallel laminar Navier-Stokes flows along a circular-arc boundary portion of some compact obstacle in the 2 -D hyperbolic space. The existence of stationary parallel laminar Navier-Stokes flows along a straight bound-ary of some obstacle in the 2 -D hyperbolic space is also studied. In any one of these cases, we show that a parallel laminar <b>flow</b> with a <b>Poiseuille’s</b> <b>flow</b> profile ceases to be a stationary Navier-Stokes flow, due to the curvature of the background manifold...|$|R

40|$|For ultra-thin gas lubrication, the surface-to-volume ratio {{increases}} dramatically when {{flow geometry}} is scaled {{down to the}} micro/nano-meter scale, where surface roughness, albeit small, may {{play an important role}} in gas slider bearings. However, the effect of surface roughness on the pressure and load capacity (force) in gas slider bearings has been overlooked. In this paper, on the basis of the generalized Reynolds equation, we investigate the behavior of a gas slider bearing, where the roughness of the slider surface is characterized by the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal function, and the mass flow rates of Couette and <b>Poiseuille</b> <b>flows</b> are obtained by deterministic solutions to the linearized Bhatnager-Gross-Krook equation. Our results show that the surface roughness reduces the local mass flow rate as compared to the smooth channel, but the amount of reduction varies for Couette and <b>Poiseuille</b> <b>flows</b> of different Knudsen numbers. As a consequence, the pressure rise and load capacity in the rough bearing become larger than the smooth bearing in the slip and early transition flow regimes, e. g. a 6 % roughness could lead to an increase of 20 % more bearing load capacity. However, this situation is reversed in the free-molecular flow regime, as the ratio of mass flow rate between Couette and <b>Poiseuille</b> <b>flows</b> is smaller than that in the smooth channel. Interestingly, between the two extremes, we have found a novel "rarefaction cloaking" effect, where the load capacity of a rough bearing equals to that of a smooth bearing at a certain range of Knudsen numbers, as if the roughness does not exist...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe study {{reported}} here deals with elastohydrodynamic (EHD) point contacts and it {{is focused on the}} influence of contact ellipticity. In five velocity-load reference cases, ellipticity was varied from slender to wide configurations, including the circular contact. For each case, Hertzian pressure, Hertzian area, load, and entrainment velocity were kept constant while the ellipticity was varied by changing the curvature radii. In this context, the maximum central film thickness did not occur for the infinitely wide contact, but for a slender configuration close to the circular case. Moreover, the minimum film thickness reached its optimum for a wide but finite elliptical contact. For low ellipticity ratios, specific film thickness features were obtained. In particular, very high central/minimum film thickness ratios are found. The cause of these behaviors was found in the change of the convergent shape. When the ellipticity was varied, the <b>Poiseuille</b> <b>flows</b> parallel and transverse to the entrainment direction were significantly modified and these modifications were quantitatively analyzed for the different cases. The competition between the Couette and the <b>Poiseuille</b> <b>flows</b> was totally different between the narrow and the wide elliptical contact, and this change was responsible for the film thickness variations with ellipticity. Ellipticity also had an effect on friction as it influenced the maximum pressure which in turn impacts the fluid viscosity...|$|R
