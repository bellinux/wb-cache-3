50|$|Despite {{these efforts}} the ship made its fatal {{collision}} {{at an estimated}} 37 seconds after the iceberg had been sighted.

Furthermore, the United States was committed to helping supply its allies. By 1942 American tank production had soared to just under 25,000, almost doubling the combined British and German output for that year.

50|$|The impact {{created a}} hole, {{estimated}} at 1 to 2 ft in diameter, in the Terminator’s aft lazarette area (a storage space between decks). The incoming water flooded the shaft alley. The watertight door between the shaft alley and main engine compartment was permanently affixed open. A cutting torch was needed {{before the door}} could be secured. This process took 20 minutes and only slowed the water coming into the engine room. Pumps to de-water the vessel operated only intermittently. There was no eductor (a type of water pump).

The <b>peak</b> of Japanese <b>tank</b> production was in 1942, but declined afterwards owing to aircraft and warship priorities, along with material shortages. By 1944, total production of tanks and AFV's had fallen to 925 and for 1945, only 256 were produced. Japan developed many experimental and operative armored vehicles, tanks and tank-destroyer types throughout the war; but largely held them in reserve, for home-land defense.|$|R

The 81 mm combination mortar mounted on the rear deck was not a gravity firing mortar as used by the Army and Marine Corps, in which the falling projectile's primer struck the fixed firing pin {{at the base of}} the mortar tube, but a unique lanyard firing weapon in which the projectile was still loaded into the muzzle.

Concurrently with this yard work, she conducted a tender availability with Piedmont (AD-17) to prepare her for visits to Australia and New Zealand during the forthcoming {{celebration of the}} 25th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Repairs and availability completed, she stood out of Subic Bay on 24 April in company with McKean (DD-784). En route to Melbourne, the two ships stopped at Manus in the Admiralty Islands and at Brisbane, Australia. The ship reached Melbourne on 8 May; and, while she remained there until the 13th, her crew enjoyed Australian hospitality {{in the city and}} replied in kind on board. Between 13 and 17 May, she made a rough transit of the Tasman Sea and arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, on the latter date for the second phase of her Coral Sea celebration. She remained in Auckland until 22 May at which time she and McKean put to sea to return to the United States. After a stop at Pago Pago, American Samoa, the two ships rejoined Gridley (DLG-21) and Maddox on 26 May to reconstitute DesRon 19 for the voyage home. After a brief fueling stop at Pearl Harbor on 2 June, the warships arrived in Long Beach on the 8th. Between June and September, Turner Joy went through a month of post-deployment standdown followed by training operations in the waters off southern California.

Storage tanks after {{earthquake}} disaster {{may create}} the serious consequence, so their anti-seismic problems have drawn greater attention, and their seismic response {{become the focus}} of research. Considering the liquid-solid coupling and the interaction between foundation and storage tanks，three different volumes of storage tanks that have different liquid height were simulated under the earthquake using the software ADINA. The liquid sloshing wave height, <b>peak</b> acceleration of <b>tank</b> wall and hydrodynamic pressure were analyzed. The results show that the peak sloshing wave height shows a rising trend basically with the increase of liquid height, and the roofs of large tanks are more easier to be destroyed by liquid sloshing. With the increase of liquid height and tank volume, the response of peak acceleration is greater. The hydrodynamic pressure increases with the decrease of liquid height. Near the bottom of tank wall the value of hydrodynamic pressure is relatively large, so elephant foot buckling is easier to happen in that area...|$|R

40|$|The current {{demand in}} {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) encour-aged the design of various concepts for floating LNG (FLNG) liquefaction or regasification facilities. With increasing trans-port distance, e. g. from remote marine locations to the onshore gas supply net, gas pipelines become uneconomic compared to shuttle carriers for LNG (LNGC). Due to its high energy density, offshore transfer from processing terminals to carriers and from carriers back to receiving terminals has to be analyzed in detail. During the transfer period, free fluid surfaces occurring in the cargo tanks of the LNGC are leading to a significant decrease of the initial intact stability and altered motion behavior. This paper focusses {{on the influence of}} resonant tank sloshing on the LNGC’s roll and surge motions. Analyses of transverse and lon-gitudinal sloshing yield a surprising phenomenon: the frequency shift ∆ω between the theoretical natural frequency of the tank alone and the respective motion peak for a vessel with four tanks mounted to the hull. Force measurements between tank and hull reveal a <b>peak</b> at the <b>tank’s</b> natural frequency that causes strong liquid motions with related forces and moments on the hull but no increased vessel motions.

40|$|Three {{analytical}} {{studies for}} the seismic response of base-isolated ground supported cylindrical liquid storage tanks under recorded earthquake ground motion are presented. The continuous liquid {{mass of the}} tank is modelled as lumped masses referred as sloshing mass, impulsive mass and rigid mass. Firstly, the seismic response of isolated tanks is obtained using the modal superposition technique and compared with the exact response to {{study the effects of}} non-classical damping. The comparison of results with different tank aspect ratios and stiffness and damping of the bearing indicate that the effects of non-classical damping are insignificant implying that the response of isolated liquid storage tanks can be accurately obtained by the modal analysis with classical damping approximation. The second investigation involves the analysis of base-isolated liquid storage tanks using the response spectrum method in which the <b>peak</b> response of <b>tank</b> in different modes is obtained for the specified response spectrum of earthquake motion and combined with different combination rules. The results indicate that the peak response obtained by the response spectrum method matches well with the corresponding exact response. However, specific combination rule should be used for better estimation of various response quantities of the isolated tanks. Finally, the closed-form expressions for the modal parameters of the base-isolated liquid storage tanks are derived and compared with the exact values.

The response obtained from the above approximate method was found to be in good agreement with the exact response. © Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|Under certain {{accident}} conditions, waste {{tanks in}} the In-Tank Processing (ITP) facility may contain significant concentrations of benzene and hydrogen. Because these gases are flammable, a safety analysis {{was required to}} demonstrate that the risk posed by the possible combustion of these gases is acceptable. In support of this analysis, the MELCOR/SR computer code was modified to simulate the combustion of benzene-hydrogen mixtures. MELCOR/SR was developed originally to analyze severe accidents that may occur in the SRS production reactors but many of its modules can be used also for non-reactor applications such as combustion and aerosol and radionuclide transport. The MELCOR/SR combustion model (package) was originally configured for the deflagration analysis of hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixtures. With minor changes to the coding in the combustion package subroutines, and the addition of benzene thermodynamic and transport properties to the input decks, MELCOR/SR was modified to analyze deflagrations in benzene-hydrogen gas mixtures. A MELCOR/SR model was created consisting of two control volumes connected by flow paths. One volume represents a type III waste tank; the other, the environment. The flow paths represent vents that open during the deflagration. Choked flow and radiative heat transfer from the hot gas to the cooling coils and tank walls are phenomonalogical aspects accounted for in the model.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{water supply}} network {{has a single}} water supply reservoir supplying a neighbourhood of households via a reticulation network designed for <b>peak</b> flows. Storage <b>tanks</b> at each household (distributed storage) can be utilised to act as buffers between continuous supply of average flows and intermittent demand of peak flows. This results in the water supply infrastructure needing to cater for average flows only. This research project examines potential savings {{that can be made}} to water supply infrastructure when distributed storage (household tanks) is utilised. An isolated network is modelled for both the traditional design scenario and a design incorporating water tanks at each point of supply. The water supply network is modelled using Pipes++ software package. The reticulation layout is identical for both designs and hydraulic conditions, such as pressure available at the water supply source, are kept the same to isolate differences to those between peak and average flows only. Comparison is made in terms of required pipe sizes and costs. Pipe diameters and construction costs of the distributed storage network are between 50 % and 60 % less than that required for the traditional network. The larger percentage of savings were made in the single distribution main linking the subject site to the source of water supply approximately 1. 2 kilometres away. The costs of water tanks and pumps for each household outweigh the savings made by reduction of reticulation pipes. When tanks and pumps are already provided for re-use of rainwater, the distributed storage network provides significant savings. The prospective merits justify and highlight the need to investigate other characteristics and aspects of distributed storage networks including incorporating water tanks for reuse of rainwater, water quality, minimum pressure requirements, energy use, clustered networks, fire fighting requirements and different sized communities. ...|$|R
40|$|A single {{prolonged}} milking interval (PMI), such {{as might}} be associated with technical failures in automatic milking systems, leads to a subsequent somatic cell count (SCC) <b>peak</b> in bulk <b>tank</b> milk. Increased SCC indicates mastitis in cows. It is generally correlated with reduced milk yield and quality, and is often used as a criterion for milk payment. Whether the transient SCC peak after a single PMI affects yield and quality is not known. The short duration of the inflammatory reaction after a PMI and its nonpathological history {{raise questions about the}} underlying immunological mechanisms and possible role of immunocompetent natural milk components. It is important to learn more about this kind of physiological inflammation to improve the interpretation of SCC and the general understanding of udder immunology. This thesis investigated the inflammatory reaction after a single PMI of 24 h at both the cow and the quarter level, and how it influences milk yield and quality. The PMI appeared to induce temporarily impaired epithelial integrity but no epithelial damage. Even so,milk yield per cow was reduced with 0. 75 kg/day after the PMI, notably for up to the 10 days studied. Thus, based on the long-lasting reduction in yield and a possibly reduced milk payment due to the SCC peak, a PMI is of significant economic concern for the farmer although milk quality itself was shown not to be afflicted. The PMI caused a two-fold increase in the SCC, which then remained elevated for 2 days and was associated with an increased proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in milk. The most pronounced SCC reaction after the PMI was not seen until the udder had been emptied once. The initiation of inflammation occurred first during the PMI and elicited a systemic acute phase response of serum amyloid A (SAA), observed in blood prior to its appearance in milk. The milk showed consistently high chemotactic activity in vitro, although no increased content of the cytokines IL- 1 β and IL- 8 was detected. The PMI induced significant alterations in the content of α-lactalbumin (ALA) and prolactin (PRL), in relation to the PMN reaction. ALA inhibited and PRL stimulated PMN migration, when tested in vitro. Based on the findings in this thesis, it is probable that SAA {{played a significant role in}} the inflammatory reaction after a PMI but it cannot be excluded that ALA and PRL might also have been contributing factors...|$|R
40|$|Zur Erschließung {{maritime}}r Gaslagerstätten in großen Wassertiefen werden sogenannte Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) Konzepte entwickelt. Eine schwimmende Terminalbarge fördert und verflüssigt Erdgas, welches regelmäßig an Flüssiggastanker übergeben wird. Während dieser 18 bis 24 Stunden dauernden Verladeprozedur muss das Transfersystem den aus den vorherrschenden Umweltbedingungen resultierenden Relativbewegungen zwischen Terminal und Tanker standhalten. Insbesondere das Bewegungsverhalten des Tankers wird hierbei durch die sich kontinuierlich ändernden Füllstände und freien Flüssigkeitsoberflächen in den Ladetanks signifikant beeinflusst. Bisher veröffentlichte Ergebnisse und Methoden zur hydrodynamischen Analyse von Offshore-Verladeprozessen gehen von idealisierten Bedingungen aus (zweidimensionale Betrachtungen, Modellversuche mit Wasser anstelle von LNG). Relevante hydrodynamische Phänomene werden teilweise beobachtet, ohne jedoch deren Einfluss auf die Extrapolation von Ergebnissen auf die Großausführung vollständig zu verstehen. Dadurch sind viele der durch heutige Standardverfahren ermittelten Resultate unbrauchbar bzw. unvollständig. Mit dieser Arbeit liegt erstmals ein validiertes, ganzheitliches numerisches Verfahren vor, welches die relevanten hydrodynamischen Aspekte, die während des Verladevorgangs auftreten, vollständig berücksichtigt. Vertiefende Untersuchungen auf Basis dieses Verfahrens tragen zum grundlegenden Verständnis der auftretenden Effekte bei, wodurch eine fehlerfreie Ergebnisextrapolation vom Modell auf die Großausführung ermöglicht wird. Die vorgestellte Methode in Kombination mit dem erlangten Hintergrundwissen kann als vertrauenswürdige Ausgangsbasis für Machbarkeitsstudien und Einsatzgrenzenbestimmungen von FLNG-Projekten herangezogen werden. Es zeigt sich, dass das gewählte lineare, auf Potentialtheorie beruhende Verfahren sowohl im Hinblick auf die Bewegungscharakteristika unter Einfluss von freien Flüssigkeitsoberflächen als auch auf die Fluidauslenkungen in den Tanks hervorragende Ergebnisse liefert. Vertiefende numerische Untersuchungen zeigen erstmals, dass die Differenzen zwischen Tankresonanzfrequenzen und den durch internes Sloshing verursachten Maxima der entsprechenden Bewegungsübertragungsfunktionen vom Verhältnis der Festkörpermasse zur hydrodynamischen Masse des Schiffes abhängen. Die wichtigste Schlussfolgerung aus dieser Beobachtung ist, dass Ergebnisse aus Modellversuchen oder Simulationen mit Wasser in den Ladetanks entgegen des oftmals praktizierten Vorgehens nicht auf den realen Betrieb mit LNG extrapoliert werden können. Durch umfassende dreidimensionale Analysen kann außerdem erstmals gezeigt werden, dass bei Flüssiggastankern aufgrund von Asymmetrien resonantes Tanksloshing und dadurch induzierte Starrkörperbewegungen senkrecht zur Angriffsrichtung der erregenden Wellenkräfte auftreten. Diese Beobachtung lässt den Schluss zu, dass durch eine idealisierte, zweidimensionale Betrachtung der Problemstellung keine vollständigen Aussagen über das Bewegungsverhalten von Schiffen mit teilgefüllten Tanks zu treffen sind. Developing maritime gas {{fields in}} deep water by Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) concepts poses demanding technical challenges. So far, no systems are in operation but projects in the design or construction phase are characterized by a floating terminal barge that produces, liquefies and stores natural gas at the offshore location. Frequently operating shuttle tankers are moored either alongside (side-by-side) or at {{the stern of the}} terminal (tandem) to receive the cryogenic liquefied cargo. During the offloading procedure, which takes 18 to 24 hours in changing environmental conditions, the transfer system has to tolerate the occurring relative motions between the terminal and the tanker. Gradually changing filling levels and free surface effects inside the tanks significantly influence the seakeeping behavior of the LNG carrier. Methods and research results published so far encompass experimental and numerical analyses of individual aspects of the complex hydrodynamic problem related to offshore LNG transfer. Well known work includes the determination of pressure <b>peaks</b> on <b>tank</b> walls caused by violent sloshing or exemplary reproductions of coupling effects between resonant internal fluid motions and wave-induced vessel motions. However, available results are mostly based on idealized conditions (two-dimensional setups, model testing with fresh water instead of LNG) where relevant hydrodynamic effects are observed to some extend but their consequences on the extrapolation of data to full scale operations is not fully comprehended. Due to these restrictions, most of the results obtained by current standard approaches are defective or at least incomplete. In this thesis, the first validated holistic numerical method, which captures all hydrodynamic aspects that are relevant during offloading operations is presented. By in-depth studies {{on the basis of this}} approach, the background of the occurring phenomena can be fully comprehended, which allows accurate extrapolation of results from model scale to full scale. Combining the introduced method and the gained background knowledge is a critical prerequisite for the conduction of trustworthy feasibility studies and the determination of operational ranges for FLNG projects. The selected linear potential theory based procedure is capable to excellently reproduce seakeeping characteristics as well as internal fluid motions. The entire calculation process is exemplarily demonstrated for the MPLS 20 system in the Haltenbanken region. By detailed numerical investigations, it is revealed for the first time that the differences between natural tank modes and sloshing-related maximum values in the respective motion response amplitude operators (RAO) are attributed to the ratio of rigid body mass to added mass. Here, hydrodynamic coupling of different degrees of freedom are a crucial factor. The most important consequence from this finding is that – in contrast to the well-established practice – results obtained from model tests with fresh water filling inside the tanks cannot be extrapolated to full scale operations with LNG. Comprehensive three-dimensional analyses reveal for the first time that for LNG carriers, significant fluid sloshing and body motions occur perpendicular to the direction of excitation. This phenomenon is caused by asymmetries of the submerged hull geometry as well as asymmetric mass distribution. This observation leads to the conclusion that commonly published idealized two-dimensional approaches are inadequate for the prediction of the motion behavior of vessels with partially filled tanks...|$|R
