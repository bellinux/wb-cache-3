40|$|The {{effect of}} deep HF etching {{on the surface}} quality and figure of fused silica optics has been {{investigated}} systematically. Fused silica samples (100 mm in diameter x 10 mm thick) were manufactured using the conventional grinding and polishing process. These processed samples are etched with different removal depth. Initially, the surface quality of fused silica samples is characterized in terms of surface roughness and surface defects. Many digs not more than 1 mu m deep are emerged which originates from the micron grinding cracks and crack pits. These digs worsened the surface roughness and frosted the sample. While submillimeter subsurface damage exposed through etching appear as sparkling dots under the high <b>power</b> <b>lamp.</b> The average total length of millimeter scratches on single surfaces is over 200 mm. Not all millimeter scratches could be exposed until removal depth of up to 2 mu m. Finally, the surface figure behavior during deep etching has also been figured out. Etching {{on the edge of}} the upper surface of samples placed horizontally went faster than on the inside parts. The surface of samples placed vertically assumed a more complicated removal distribution, which can be both explained in terms of "fringe tip effect". For the change of surface figure PV, the initial surface figure feature plays an important role as well as the etching removal distribution...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a fibre optic based system for the measurement of organic pollution in natural waters is reported. This system was designed to monitor organic pollution levels to warn of possible threats {{to the health of}} natural waters used as amenities and sources of drinking water. An experimental system was constructed to investigate fluorescence as a possible basis for an organic pollutant sensor. A systematic study was performed on laboratory prepared polluted water samples in order to identify the appropriate excitation and detection wavelengths. These measurements were compared and correlated with standard methods of analysis for gross organic pollution. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded on standard laboratory spectrofluonmeters. In addition measurements were made on a fibre optic based sensor characterization system. It was found that a linear relationship existed between organic pollution concentration and detected fluorescence when excited and detected at appropriate wavelengths Fluorescence detection was identified as a method for the measurement of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentration in water. A correlation co-efficient of 0 994 was achieved between TOC concentration and detected fluorescence signal for excitation at 340 nm and collection at 420 nm Limitations in the experimental system such as the expense and nature of the equipment meant that the experimental system was not suitable as a basis for a portable organic pollutant detection system. On the basis of this systematic study a dedicated optical fibre pollutant sensor for monitoring natural waters was constructed. This system used a higher <b>power</b> <b>lamp,</b> filters of appropriate wavelengths instead of a monochromator and high quality UV transmitting fibre. The performance of the prototype system was characterised in terms of range, resolution and response time...|$|E

How does the different technologies for light generation work {{and what are}} the advantages and disadvantages? The various technologies limitations and characteristics provides the opportunities for the LEDs. This report describes a test-construction built to examine what practical arrangements can be built with modern light emitting diodes, in order to show some of the possibilities. The construction consists of three different applications, a high <b>power</b> <b>lamp</b> based on cold white LEDs, one based on warm white LEDs for the evaluation of the light characteristics and a RGB-LED based lamp able to mix any colors quickly and seamlessly. The test construction also contains the essential peripherals including control-electronics, optics and a custom built watercooling solution. The potential for LEDs is huge but it is complicated to build LED based applications due to the limitations which mainly includes the electronics and the neccesary cooling. If LEDs {{are going to have a}} high impact in general lighting there are some requirements to be met. Either light emitting diodes able to run directly from 230 VAC has to be developed or the the control electronics has to be compact enough to squeeze in light emitting diodes in existing luminaires. Both of these solutions are becoming more available on the market right now, but the cost is still high. For special applications such as torches, diving torches, battery powered emergency lighting and stage lighting for concerts and theaters, LEDs are already in common use. These applications are driving up production volumes for LEDs, making them cheaper and more available. This in turn allows for the development of even higher volumes, making the cost of the light emitting diode to spiral downward...|$|E

Introduction: German manufacturers are producing a lamp for which they claim a longer life with greater efficiency than the ordinary carbon lamp possesses. Only {{a few of these}} have been introduced into this country and these chiefly for testing purposes. If these tantalum filament lamps are all that is claimed for them there would result a great saving. To compare the relative merits of these a carbon lamp, one new tantalum and a tantalum that had burned 300 hours are tested at stated intervals. The old tantalum was burned 1000 hours. The instruments used were as follows: Weston Direct Current Voltmeter. No. 13520 (0 - 150); Jewell Direct Current Ammeter No. 1476 (0 - 1. 5) (0 - 15); Standard lamp No. 902 (16 candle power at 108. 4 volts). The tests were all made on a Queen Standard Photometer fitted with a Lummer Brodhun screen. The scale extends the full length of the photometer bar, and is arranged to read in centimeters from each end and also when the standard is a 16 candle <b>power</b> <b>lamp</b> to read directly in candle power. The Lummer Brodhun screen was devised by two German electricians for use in the Reichsanstatt laboratory. The screen is of plaster of Paris, receiving light from either side. It is diffused upon mirrors {{on each side of the}} screen and from there it passes through two prisms to a lens where it is observed by the eye. One lamp will throw a circle in the center while around it with well defined edges the other lamp will throw its light. When the two shades are equal the spot will almost disappear and the relative intensity of the two lights will be inversely as the squares of their distances from the screen. The standard lamp used was No. 902 giving 16 candle power at 108. 4 volts. It was burned no longer than was necessary so that the candle power of it would not fall. Almost ideal current was furnished for the lamp by the use of a storage battery of 60 cells. The voltage was adjusted by means of rheostats placed in series with the lamps. The accompanying curves show clearly the relation between the two lamps. For the new carbon lamp only the greatest candlepower in maximum position are plotted...|$|E

40|$|In textile field {{a lot of}} {{finishing}} processes {{were developed}} to improve fabrics properties and dyeability. Dyeing processes, in particular, involve the use of many chemical substances that are typically difficult to purify, increasing {{the environmental impact of}} textile industry waste waters. Moreover, the relatively high temperature of these processes can weaken the wool fiber structure and consequently impart detrimental chemical and mechanical properties to the fabrics. The present work focused on the possibility of improving wool dyeing in terms of kinetics and final dye bath exhaustion, with good fastness of dyed materials, at lower temperatures than those used in conventional processes, by a simple pre-irradiation of wool with ultraviolet rays. Ecofriendly aspects of radiation processes are well known: energy savings (low-temperature process), low environmental impact with no VOC emissions, simple, cheap and small equipment, high treatment speed. The effect of different radiation times (30 s, 2, 5, 20 min) and lamp powers (providing about 50 mW/cm 2 or 900 mW/cm 2 radiation on the substrate) were investigated in order to optimize the process. First, the treated samples were characterized by SEM and FTIR-ATR analysis revealing a surface modification of wool fibers without affecting their morphology. UV light, coupled with the ozone formed in contact with air, oxidized mainly the cuticular region of wool fibre, increasing the OH external groups and forming cystine oxides and cysteic acid. As consequence, lower values of water contact angle were measured on treated fabrics with respect to untreated ones, denouncing an increased hydrophilicity. No effect was revealed by bursting test on mechanical properties of treated fabrics, confirming that the fibers modification is confined to the surface, not involving the bulk, while Datacolor measurements showed some yellowing, more pronounced for high power and longer times treated samples. For what concerns the dyeability, it was tested differently treated and untreated samples with an acid dye at 70 °C, 80 °C and 90 °C. At each temperature, the radiated samples showed better results in terms of kinetics and final bath exhaustion reached. Of relevance was the comparison between the dyeing of the radiated sample at 80 °C with the untreated sample at 90 °C: in the first case higher final bath exhaustion and faster kinetics were found. It means the real possibility to reduce dyeing temperature and times. Datacolor measures on dyed samples confirmed a coloration more intense on radiated samples, in good agreement with bath exhaustion evaluations. Moreover fastness tests to dry and wet rubbing and to domestic laundering showed best results on radiated samples, confirming also an improved adhesion of dye molecules to wool fibers. Finally, also a pilling test was carried out with good results. UV exposure makes surface fibers weaker, so no anchor fibers are available to secure pills to the fabric surface. Hence {{it was found that the}} UV treatment can also prevent pilling in knitwear, without severe loss in weight and strength of the fabric. In conclusion, UV radiation can be indicated as a valid ecofriendly pretreatment to confer peculiar properties to wool fabrics. In particular treating wool for just 5 minutes with the low power or 30 s with higher <b>power</b> <b>lamp,</b> it can be dyed at 80 °C, at least a 20 °C lower temperature than conventional dyeing, with a fast kinetic, reaching the total bath exhaustion and good fastnes...|$|E
