Since the corrosive attack is the main contributor that leads to failure, the characterization and identification of the various corrosion product phases that can form under certain gaseous/ catalyst conditions will be examined. As a result of both the ability to accurately predict the susceptibility of corrosive attack and an understanding of the failure mechanism, certain protective measures can be taken.

40|$|LecturePg. 49 - 54 A nickel-base {{superalloy}} for FCC <b>power</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>turbine</b> rotors was developed, {{which shows}} excellent sulfidation-corrosion resistance, high temperature strengths, and hot workability. To investigate {{the influences of}} the alloying elements of AISI 685 on the sulfidation behavior, nickel-base alloys containing each of chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, titanium, and aluminum (the major components of AISI 685), and alloys containing multiple such elements were produced and corroded in sulfidizing gas atmospheres at 600 ?C. It {{was found that the}} sulfidation behavior, especially the penetrating behavior into the alloys, was greatly influenced by aluminum, and that the resistance could be improved by increasing the aluminum content in the alloys. Six types of alloys, in which aluminum had been increased to improve the sulfidation resistance of AISI 685 and titanium decreased by the same proportion to maintain the high temperature strengths of AlSI 685, were forged to test their sulfidation behavior and high temperature strengths. As a result, the alloy with 1. 5 percent titanium and 3. 0 percent aluminum showed only half the sulfidation depth of AISI 685, for the tensile characteristics at 538 ?C, and at 850 ?C through 1100 ?C, equivalent or better than those of AISI 685. This means that the alloy with 1. 5 percent titanium and 3. 0 percent aluminum has twice more sulfidationcorrosion resistance than AISI 685, in addition to equal or higher high temperature strengths and hot workability. A simulation expander rotor disk of 500 mm in diameter was manufactured with the newly developed alloy. The disk was successfully produced without shear cracking or buckling problems.

40|$|In {{rural areas}} of many countries, the supply of {{electricity}} has always been scarce due to the relative isolation from the national electricity distribution system. In New Zealand for example, many high country farm houses rely almost entirely on diesel generating sets for power. This method of power generation costs more than urban electricity supply. However, a recent advance in control technology, and a new turbine concept have shown that very small hydro power schemes also known as microhydro, can now produce urban quality electricity at a cost not much greater than urban supply. Through research and testing a 5 kW microhydro generating set was developed. The design of the micro hydro generating set involves the utilisation of the latest control technology, and proprietary components. The single most important contribution {{to the development of}} the microhydro generating set was the use of an electronic load governor with the run-of-the-river principle which results in constant flow operation of the turbine. This eliminates the need for a precision speed governor and accurate turbine flow control and thus greatly simplifies the turbine design. A malfunction protection system and a load management system have also been incorporated to allow maximum utilisation of the power output without risk of damage to the generating equipment. The use of a Delphi electronic load governor in conjunction with a brushless, self excited and self regulated synchronous generator have produced a stable electrical output of 5 kW at 230 V, 50 Hz, AC, when using an appropriate flywheel to provide shaft inertia to dampen out electrical transients. It was found that shaft inertia of four times that recommended by the governor manufacturer, was required. One of the simplest turbines is a centrifugal pump operating in the reverse mode. Tests have shown that centrifugal pumps perform exceptionally well as <b>power</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>turbines,</b> with efficiencies similar or in some cases even greater than that for the pumping case without any modification. Consequently, the combination of well established mechanical and control hardware, simplifies the design and installation of a microhydro scheme to a technical task rather than one requiring the expertise of a design engineer.

40|$|AbstractPraxair is {{developing}} an Advanced Zero Emission Coal Fired Power Plant (Advanced Power Cycle) that enables carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) at a “levelized” {{cost of electricity}} below the U. S. Department of Energy’s target for CO 2 capture from coal fired power plants. The power cycle utilizes a gasifier, partial oxidation units, <b>power</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>turbines</b> and an oxygen fired boiler to yield a process that meets the DOE’s goal of < 35 % increase in cost of electricity with CCS. Through the use of Praxair’s reactively driven Oxygen Transport Membrane (OTM) technology, the parasitic load of the oxygen supply system to both the partial oxidation reactors and boiler is reduced by approximately 75 %. The Advanced Power Cycle uses coal gasification to produce a gaseous fuel that is then combusted in an oxygen fired supercritical boiler. Low cost oxygen is made available by integrating Praxair’s OTMs into the boiler and, depending on the gasifier selected, into a post gasification partial oxidation system to convert tars and methane to CO and hydrogen. Praxair has completed a detailed techno-economic analysis {{of the performance of}} the Advanced Power Cycle (APC) and achieved significant breakthroughs in the OTM architecture and gas separation layer chemistry to achieve the commercial flux targets under phase 1 of a cooperative research agreement with the United States Department of Energy (DOE). Phase 2 of this agreement, currently underway, is focused on developing a detailed cost estimate of key components of the cycle as well as developing fabrication cost estimates of the membranes. While the APC is targeted at coal based CCS, the key components of the APC can offer benefits to integrated gasification fuel cell cycles, natural gas combined cycle plants as well as other processes. These additional processes represent opportunities to demonstrate key components of the APC prior to demonstrating the technology in its entirety. These opportunities not only allow investment dollars to be leveraged for additional benefits but also allow critical performance and reliability to be gained at commercial scale in an industrial environment–a critical hurdle that must be crossed for any new technology to be implemented at utility scale. Praxair is encouraged by the progress made to date and believes that great {{progress has been made in}} the area of materials and cycle development. The newly developed materials and membrane architecture have met commercial flux targets while demonstrating robust performance.
