40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of using a}} high-power travelling-wave tube as a superregenerative <b>pulse</b> <b>repeater</b> for deceptive jamming is investigated experimentally. Operating parameters predicted from results obtained with lower-power tubes are verified, although some additional problems are introduced. The importance of using a travelling-wave tube with minimum internal delay time is confirmed, {{and the results of}} laboratory experiments made with several different types of quenching circuit are given.

40|$|A simple, {{economic}} and successful design for distance and cable length detection is presented. The measurement system {{is based on}} the continuous repetition of a pulse that endlessly travels along the distance to be detected. There is a <b>pulse</b> <b>repeater</b> {{at both ends of the}} distance or cable to be measured. The endless repetition of the pulse generates a frequency that varies almost inversely with the distance to be measured. The resolution and distance or cable length range could be adjusted by varying the repetition time delay introduced at both ends and the measurement time. With this design a distance can be measured with centimeter resolution using electronic system with microsecond resolution, simplifying classical time of flight designs which require electronics with picosecond resolution. This design was also applied to position measurement...|$|E

50|$|The digipeater {{is used in}} {{channels}} that transmit data by binary digital signals, in which the data {{is in the form}} of pulses with only two possible values, representing the binary digits 1 and 0. A digital repeater amplifies the signal, and it also may retime, resynchronize, and reshape the <b>pulses.</b> A <b>repeater</b> that performs the retiming or resynchronizing functions may be called a regenerator.|$|R
