Polish copyright law did not exist and Iwiński, in high school, sold cracked copies of Western video games at a Warsaw marketplace.

5|$|Research has disproved {{some common}} misconceptions about the brain. These include both {{ancient and modern}} myths. It is not true that neurons are not {{replaced}} {{after the age of}} two; nor that only ten per cent of the brain is used. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific {{to one side of the}} brain or the other. Akio Mori coined the term game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> <b>games</b> harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.|$|E
5|$|Through Steamworks, Steam {{provides}} a means of server browsing for multiplayer games that use the Steam Community features, allowing users to create lobbies with friends or members of common groups. Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve's proprietary anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature called Game Guides, where users can upload text and images detailing games and game strategies {{in the same manner}} as GameFAQs was added.

5|$|Swords and Sorcery is {{presented}} in a first person top-down perspective and contains elements of dungeon crawling, a common trait of role <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> <b>games.</b> The game {{is set in a}} fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective is to explore its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character. Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as lock picking, sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as body armour and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is dragon's teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment.|$|E

25|$|Performance {{in mental}} {{rotation}} and similar spatial tasks {{is affected by}} gender expectations. For example, studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better, or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women, will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite. Experiences such as <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> <b>games</b> also increase a person's mental rotation ability. A study from the University of Toronto showed that differences in ability get reduced after <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> <b>games</b> requiring complex mental rotation. The experiment showed that playing such games creates larger gains in spatial cognition in females than males. However, male participants still performed superior to female participants {{both before and after}} training.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine if <b>video</b> <b>game</b> usage was {{influenced}} by family structure. Family structure was measured in two ways; the first, the amount of time one spends with their family, and second, family disruption. The amount of time one spends with their family was measured with specific amounts of time; for example, the number of weekly days one would engage with his or her family. Family disruption was broken into four categories; parental marriage, parental divorce, adoption, and guardian death. <b>Video</b> <b>game</b> usage was measured in two categories; weekly days one <b>plays</b> <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> and daily hours one <b>plays</b> <b>video</b> <b>games.</b> The evidence from the 701 surveys suggests there is no correlation between <b>video</b> <b>game</b> usage and the amount of time one spends with their family.

The gender issue in <b>video</b> <b>games</b> {{is not a new}} topic, with texts such as 2 ̆ 7 From Barbie to Mortal Combat 2 ̆ 7 edited by Cassell and Jenkins being publishing in 1998. However, the question of 2 ̆ 7 do females actually <b>play</b> <b>video</b> <b>games</b> 2 ̆ 7 is still apparent, and with the rapid changes in technological development in gaming (with the introduction of consoles such as the Nintendo Wii) the subject of females game playing habits is in need of constant dialogue.
