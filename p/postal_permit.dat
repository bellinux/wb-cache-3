5000|$|Thompson Cigar Company is a {{cigar and}} cigar {{accessories}} retailer located in Tampa, Florida. Thompson Cigar {{is the oldest}} mail order cigar company in the United States. Originally located in Key West, Florida, Thompson Cigar first opened in 1915. In 1920, after hurricanes decimated most of the cigar factories in Key West, original owner M.A. Thompson moved his factory to Ybor City, located in Tampa, Florida, known as [...] "Cigar Capital of the World." [...] Thompson acquired <b>Postal</b> <b>Permit</b> #1 {{in the city of}} Tampa, which it still holds today. In 1934, M.A. Thompson moved his factory to Bartow, Florida where it would remain until 1960.|$|E

5000|$|Although most <b>postal</b> {{regulations}} <b>permit</b> {{the exclusion}} of [...] "objectionable" [...] pictures on the stamps, in 2004 The Smoking Gun managed to create personalised stamps featuring the Rosenbergs, Jimmy Hoffa, Ted Kaczynski, Monica Lewinsky's dress, Slobodan Milošević and Nicolae Ceauşescu using the service offered by stamps.com. The firm subsequently revised its policies.|$|R

50|$|The limited {{scope of}} the {{collection}} --doing a few specific things well combined with Dr. Scheer's personal knowledge of transportation and <b>postal</b> history, <b>permits</b> better responses to user queries than many other non-specialized organizations can provide. The RMS Library also participates in inter-library loans or will provide photo- reproductions of items at five cents per page. Inquiries pertaining to RMS Library holdings or persons seeking research assistance should contact Dr. Scheer, at the library.|$|R
50|$|In 1936, Eugène Vaillé, a {{civil servant}} at the French posts' library, {{convinced}} Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones Georges Mandel to relaunch the project. By 1937, establishment in the Choiseul-Praslin hôtel was studied. Although {{the economic crisis}} of the 1930s and World War II prevented any actual opening, a semi-postal stamp was issued on 6 July 1939 and a ruling council was instituted in 1943 with Vaillé as president. After the war, finance and an inventory by Vaillé of the <b>postal</b> archives <b>permitted</b> the inauguration in 1946.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to cancel}} to order is postmarked to order which {{occurs when the}} stamps are {{purchased}} at full value, placed {{on a piece of}} mail, and then cancelled by the clerk on request. The mail then is handed back to the customer instead of traveling through the post. This is sometimes called favour cancellation, or hand-back,. Some countries' <b>postal</b> regulations <b>permit</b> this and others forbid it. It is misleading because the cancelled envelope appears to have gone through the mails though it has not. For instance, it is missing additional postal markings typically applied to real mail.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to stamps, postage franking {{can be in}} the form of printed or stamped impressions made in an authorized format and applied directly by a franking machine, postage meter, computer generated franking labels or other similar methods ("Postage Evidencing Systems"), any form of preprinted [...] "postage paid" [...] notice authorized by a <b>postal</b> service <b>permit</b> ("Indicia"), or any other marking method accepted by the postal service and specified by its regulations, as proof of the prepayment of the appropriate fees. Postal franking also includes [...] "Postage Due" [...] stamps or markings affixed by a postal service which designate any amount of insufficient or omitted postage fees to be collected on delivery.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, the Republicans {{contended that}} King County was three days past its federally {{mandated}} due date of October 10 {{to send out}} its absentee ballots to overseas military personnel, widely considered more likely to vote Republican. The United States <b>Postal</b> Service Bulk <b>Permit</b> #1455 was used to mail 1,605 ballots on October 2, and 28,000 on October 13. The Republicans claimed that the delay may have prevented military service people from voting, thereby skewing the results in King County. On air, local talk radio host Bryan Suits claimed that his vote in particular was not counted while he performed military service in Iraq.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{significance}} of counting communication skills {{in one of the}} earliest societies to achieve mass literacy. The Millennium Development Goals in education reflect structures of practice and thinking rooted in the 19 th century. The notion of a goal itself, the measurable output of official endeavour, belongs to the founding of the modern state. Literacy as an early performance indicator of public expenditure embodied a construction of an opposition between ignorance and knowledge, a disaggregation of social structures and a dismissal of informal education. It sustained the rise of the performance orientation of schooling, which subordinated the role of users. Despite their cultural limitations, the literacy and <b>postal</b> statistics <b>permitted</b> long-run quantitative analysis. There remains a question, to which historians do not have a privileged answer, as to whether education in its fullest sense is a goal that can ever be consistently measured over time and across space. The contemporary shifts in the meaning of literacy threaten to disconnect the term from history and disable our capacity fully to understand the dynamics of change. ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the evening}} of the 24th drew on apace, and the {{ordinary}} pressure of the evening mail began {{to be added to the}} extraordinary pressure of the day, the real tug of war began! The demand for extra service throughout the country began to exercise a reflex influence on the great centre. Mails came from the country in some instances with the letters unsorted, thus increasing the difficulties of the situation. The struggle was all the more severe that preparations for the night despatch were begun with a jaded force, some of the men having already been twenty-six and twenty-eight hours at work. Moreover, frost and fog prevailed at the time, and that not only delayed trains and the arrival of mails, but penetrated the building so that the labour was performed in a depressing atmosphere. To meet the emergency, at least in part, the despatch of the usual eight o'clock mail was delayed for that night fifty minutes. As in actual war an hour's delay may be fraught with tremendous issues for good or ill, so this brief <b>postal</b> delay <b>permitted</b> the despatch of an enormous amount of correspondence that would have otherwise been left over to the following day.|$|R
5000|$|The border search {{exception}} permits searches at {{the border}} of the United States [...] "or its functional equivalent." [...] (United States v. Montoya De Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 538 (1985)). The idea here is that the United States as a sovereign nation has a right to inspect stuff entering or exiting the country as a way of protecting its sovereign interests, and that the Fourth Amendment permits such searches. Courts have applied the border search exception in cases of PCs and computer hard drives; if you bring a computer into or out of the United States, the government can search your computer for contraband or other prohibited items at the airport or wherever you are entering or leaving the country. See, e.g., United States v. Ickes, 393 F.3d 501 (4th Cir. 2005) (Wilkinson, J.)...At the same time, I don't know of a rationale in the case law for treating data differently than physical storage devices. The case law on the border search exception is phrased in pretty broad language, so it seems at least plausible that a border search exception could apply to monitoring at an ISP or telephone provider as the [...] "functional equivalent of the border," [...] much like airports are the functional equivalent of the border in the case of international airline travel...the most persuasive case on point: United States v. Ramsey, held th{{at the border}} search exception applies to all international <b>postal</b> mail, <b>permitting</b> all international <b>postal</b> mail to be searched.|$|R
50|$|The {{locality}} {{is required}} only where its absence would cause ambiguity, for example where a post town or postcode district includes two streets {{with the same}} name. Royal Mail specifies that post towns should be written in block capitals. Until 1996 a <b>postal</b> county (or <b>permitted</b> abbreviation) was required after the post town, unless {{it was a special}} post town, for example London. The post town and postcode should each be on a separate line. Historically, each line of an address ended with a comma and was indented from the previous line. Royal Mail discourage this usage and specify that all lines should start from the same point and not be staggered or aligned to the centre. The postcode identifies, from left to right, increasingly smaller units of the postal delivery system. The first half of the postcode, known as the outward code, contains the postcode area and postcode district. The second half, known as the inward code, contains the postcode sector and postcode unit.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{election}} of 1906, which now <b>permitted</b> <b>postal</b> voting, Watson increased Labour House seats to 26. Though they had more seats than the Protectionist Party with 16, Labour supported Deakin as Prime Minister. Watson resigned as leader in 1907 and was succeeded by Andrew Fisher. Fisher withdrew its support of the Deakin government on 13 November 1908 and formed a minority government. The Fisher government passed {{a large number of}} its legislation. A scandalised establishment, believing an anti-socialist alliance was necessary to counter Labor's growing electoral dominance, pressured Deakin and Anti-Socialist Party's new leader, Joseph Cook, to begin merger talks. The main body of Protectionists, including Deakin and his supporters merged with the Anti-Socialist Party in May 1909 to become the Commonwealth Liberal Party, popularly known as [...] "the Fusion", with Deakin as leader and Cook as deputy leader. The more liberal Protectionists defected to Labour. Deakin now held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Fisher government fell in a vote on 27 May 1909. Fisher failed to persuade the Governor-General Lord Dudley to dissolve Parliament and Deakin formed Australia's first majority government in June 1909, under the CLP banner, which governed less than a year until the 1910 federal election, held in April of that year.|$|R
40|$|Citrulline is a nonessential free amino acid, {{detectable}} {{in various}} biological fluids such as plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. The plasma citrulline concentration is increasingly {{considered to be}} a reliable biomarker of enterocyte function. Current analysis usually involves lengthy HPLC separations as a part of classical amino acid profiling, or mass spectrometry usually in combination with derivatization. We employed UPLC-HILIC-tandem mass-spectrometry (MS/MS) of acetonitrile-derived supernatants from plasma samples of control subjects and of patients who had received myeloablative chemotherapy. Detection was achieved by the selected reaction monitoring of transitions: m/z 176 [...] > 70 and 180 [...] > 74 (for the deuterated standard), respectively. The method was precise and accurate with inter-day CV< 3. 9 % (n= 30), recoveries ranging from 98. 0 to 100. 3 % and high linearity from 0. 3 to at least 2, 000 micromol/L. The results for 202 plasma samples agreed well with those obtained by the classical HPLC-fluorescence method. By a simple protein precipitation/extraction step and the UPLC separation the result can be available within 30 min of receipt with a capacity of at least 12 assays per hour. Citrulline in blood and plasma or serum was stable for at least 2 days at room temperature which would <b>permit</b> <b>postal</b> transport to the laboratory. The UPLC-MS/MS method for measuring plasma citrulline concentrations is fast and robust and is therefore an ideal tool for monitoring the intestinal enterocyte capacity of patients with various pathological conditions...|$|R
