40|$|This paper applies {{input-output}} {{techniques to}} estimate industrial emissions resulting from export oriented activities in Brazil {{in the period}} 1985 - 96. The analysis {{is based on an}} input-output model which associates emissions to final demand categories. The emission parameters were extracted from two different data sets. Local pollutant emissions were estimated using the Industrial Pollution Projection System (IPPS, developed by the World Bank), including both water parameters (BOD and heavy metals) and air parameters (particulate matter, SO 2, NOx and HC). Fossil fuel emissions that contribute to the global warming problem were calculated using CO 2 emission estimates provided by the Brazilian Greenhouse Gases Inventory, covering the 1990 - 94 period. The input-output matrices were directly obtained from the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE). Despite {{the differences between the two}} sets of emission coefficients, the results in both cases clearly show that export oriented activity chains (considered from an input-output perspective) are more intensive in emissions than the average of the Brazilian economy. This is related to the expansion of resource intensive sectors at the bottom of the export oriented production chains (for example, metallurgy, chemicals, pulp and paper, footwear). Therefore, these results suggest that, at least in the Brazilian experience, there is an association between the efforts to expand exports at any cost (given the balance of <b>payments</b> <b>restrictions)</b> and the worsening of environmental standards, which is another empirical evidence of the hypothesis that developing tend to specialise in “dirty” industrial activities...|$|E
40|$|This {{background}} note {{outlines the}} available evidence in relation to income management in the Northern Territory, Cape York and Western Australia, and concludes that the evidence for or against it is inconclusive. Income management (also known as ‘welfare quarantining’) refers to a policy under which {{a percentage of the}} welfare payments of certain people are set aside to be spent only on ‘priority goods and services’ such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care. Income management was introduced by the Howard Government in 2007 as part of the legislation for the Northern Territory Emergency Response (NTER). At this time, income management schemes were also established as part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial for situations of child neglect and non- enrolment and/or non-attendance at school. In addition to these compulsory income management schemes, provisions were also introduced for people to have their income managed voluntarily. Since then, the Rudd and Gillard Governments have expanded the scheme so that it now applies throughout the Northern Territory and other designated ‘disadvantaged areas’ throughout Australia. Income management has been a controversial part of the Australian Government’s welfare reform agenda in recent years. While various conditions have always been applied to eligibility for welfare <b>payments,</b> <b>restrictions</b> on how payments may be spent are a new development that has been criticised by some as paternalist and stigmatising. Much of the debate surrounding income management has related to the question of evidence. That is, does a sufficient body of evidence exist to justify the policy of compulsory income management? Alternatively, is there evidence of policy failure or harmful consequences arising from income management? In other words, is income management working? There are several reasons why these questions are important. First, income management has been justified by its supporters {{on the grounds of the}} potential benefit it can bring to individuals and their families. Second, the Government has stated that further expansion of income management will be informed by evidence of how well it is working and how it might be improved. Finally, the Government has consistently emphasised the importance of evidence-based policy. For example, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has spoken of her ‘unshakeable belief in the power of responsive, evidence-based policy to drive progressive reform at many different levels’. This Background Note is intended as a brief guide to the evidence about the efficacy of income management. It outlines what income management is and what it is intended to do. It also highlights the substantial difficulties associated with evaluating the effectiveness of income management, including the limitations of {{the available evidence}}. The Background Note then outlines the available evidence in relation to income management in the Northern Territory, Cape York and Western Australia. The Background Note concludes that, thus far, the evidence provided for or against income management is inconclusive. At best, the evidence has only partially clarified particular aspects of a complex situation...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyExecutive Summary The {{global economy}} is {{experiencing}} a recession, which originated in the United States and is affecting developed and developing economies alike. Between {{the second and third}} quarter of 2001, the United States GDP growth rate decreased from 2. 6 per cent to 1. 2 per cent. For the same period, the European Union's GDP growth rate declined from 2. 4 per cent to 1. 7 per cent. For Latin America and the Caribbean the growth will fall from 4 per cent in 2000 to 1 per cent in 2001. A central issue regarding the current recession is whether it will be short lived or rather a protracted one. Identifying the nature of the recession will determine the type of macroeconomic policy to deal with this phenomenon. The type of macroeconomic policy advocated to deal with the current recession is mainly countercyclical. This involves the reduction in tax cuts and interest rates to stimulate spending and investment. Exchange rate movements have been stable and have responded, so far, to leading macroeconomic indicators. For its part, the terms of trade variations are registering the decline in non-oil and oil commodity prices. For the majority of developing economies the decline in non-oil commodity prices adds a further constraint to their potential economic performance. In the same vein, a decline in oil prices for non producer countries provides a respite in the efforts required to maintain the current account balance and, in some cases, a true Â'buffer stock' mechanism for the government budget. The recession is taking place as important institutional arrangements are being negotiated or implemented. The extension of the market access preferences of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to garments under the Law of Commerce and Development may serve to develop textile industry and exports to the United States. At the same time the granting of the trade promotion authority to the executive branch of the United States government will erode part of the positive effects of the Law of Commerce and Development. The fourth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference (Doha, Qatar, 9 - 14 November 2001) addressed several pressing issues for developing economies. Among the most relevant for Caribbean countries are the implementation of special and differential treatment, the small economies issue, the extension of export subsidies for developing economies, and the extension of a waiver to the European Union to maintain a preferential and discriminatory trading regime with African, Caribbean, Pacific (ACP) countries. The impact of the recession on the Caribbean will depend on a number of factors. These include the length and depth of the economic slump in these major markets and other markets; the impact of the slowdown on capital and trade flows, particularly tourism receipts. The effect on commodity prices, the extent of countries' scope for adjustment based on reserves and other variables and the dexterity in economic policy-making and management will also be crucial determinants of performance. Most likely, by hardening the balance of <b>payments</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the recession will force a tightening of the fiscal stance for Caribbean economies. This, in turn, may mean an increase in unemployment rates and decreases in output growth...|$|E

The model has a unique and globally stable steady state with factor price equalization. Along the adjustment path international debt serves the purpose of increasing efficiency. In the long run holding foreign equity shares can bridge the gap between two possibly conflicting goals: efficiency requires similar factor endowments whereas different consumer preferences establish the need of an uneven income distribution.

Zimbabwe dollarized in 2009 by legalising {{the use of a}} basket of currencies, of which the United States Dollar (US Dollar) has emerged as the principal currency in use. Dollarization in Zimbabwe initially resulted in a period of significant growth, this has however slowed, and dollarization seems to be amplifying institutional weaknesses in the banking sector, with various challenges being faced including cash shortages and foreign <b>payment</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to utilise qualitative methods to gain insights into the viability of Zimbabwe joining the South African Rand Common Monetary Area, as a means to transition out of utilising the US Dollar is the primary currency in use in the country. The choice of the South African Rand was based on South Africa being Zimbabwe's largest trading partner, and therefore the possibility of forming an optimal currency area where Zimbabwe would benefit from the reduction of transaction costs and liquidity support. The results of the study showed that joining the Common Monetary Area would improve the competitiveness of Zimbabwe's industries, strengthen the institutions, improve monetary policy and fiscal discipline, which would also lead to the government regaining the trust and confidence of the public. Joining the Common Monetary Area would however also have its shortcomings, the main ones being the loss of monetary policy autonomy.

We find that the planting restriction has crowded out fruit and vegetable acreage nationally, and most notably in selected Sunbelt states, a region that specializes in horticultural crop production. The key policy implication is that the removal of the planting restriction may have a nontrivial impact on U. S. fruit and vegetable production...|$|R

If the signals are restricted to be perfectly correlated (public), only two possible signals are needed to achieve the highest bidder payoffs.

We consider and analyse {{the potential impact of}} the Convention in the fight against inequality and discrimination against women, and the research examined CEDAW Committee decisions critically to find out its potential impacts and relevance to African women. This mini-dissertation analyses specific forms of discrimination in three selected African states and, found that: (1) women still suffer discrimination in access to education through low female enrolment and, the restriction on particular areas of study, (3) that in employment, women are discriminated against through inequality in <b>payment,</b> <b>restriction</b> of women from some sectors of the economy and; in lower opportunities for women as compared to men, (4) that in relation to politics and public life, women still are discriminated against and; they cannot easily access public office and are, underrepresented in parliament, cabinet and in the private sector, except in Rwanda where women are well represented, (5) that women are discriminated against in access to health care services including reproductive care which is characterized by lower female life expectancy, lower access to health care services especially in rural areas and; high mortality rate amongst female infants, (6) and that women in marriages and families are still not treated equally with men on issues of divorce proceedings, child support, polygamy and early marriage. We discuss and analyse the instruments protecting women against discrimination at the global and regional levels. We illustrated that the instruments effectively protects women against discrimination but were, inadequately implemented or utilised by women. We concluded as follows; (1) that the instruments effectively protected women from discrimination in education, employment, health care services, family and marital life and; in politics and public life. The issue is the implementation of the instruments by states parties and, (2) that in terms of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women, that the problem of reservations by states parties have greatly affected the effectiveness of the Convention. As to the CEDAW Committee jurisprudence, we discovered: (1) that the CEDAW Committee has done enough to protect women against discrimination in all spheres of life with groundbreaking decisions and; all that is required now is proper implementation of decisions, (2) that there are presently no communications to the CEDAW Committee from African women yet, (3) that most communications submitted to the Committee have been declared inadmissible for reasons ranging from non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to the facts occurring prior to the entering into force of the Optional Protocol in the state party complained against and, that most cases were lost on procedural errors, (4) that the Committee is very strong in cases of domestic violence and discrimination in access to health care services. In conclusion, the research identifies a number of weaknesses in the Convention and proposes a range of amendments that would facilities the use of the CEDAW Committee by African women. We also identified the implications of the CEDAW Committee jurisprudence on Africa. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Centre for Human Rightsunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Linked Data (LD) {{is a set}} of best {{practices}} for publishing and connecting structured data on the web. LD and Linked Open Data (LOD) are often conflated to the point where there is an expectation that LD will be free and unrestricted. The current research looks at deriving commercial value from LD. When there is both free and paid for data available the issue arises of how users will react to a situation where two or more options are provided. The current research examines the factors that would affect choices made by users, and subsequently created prototypes for users to interact with, in order to understand how consumers reacted to each of the different options. Our examination of commercial providers of LD uses Ordnance Survey (OS) (the UK national mapping agency) as a case study by studying their requirements for and experiences of publishing LD, and we further extrapolate from this by comparing the OS to other potential commercial publishers of LD. Our research looks at the business case for LD and introduces the concept of LOD and Linked Closed Data (LCD). We also determine that {{there are two types of}} LD users; non-commercial users and commercial users and as such, two types of use of LD; LD as a raw commodity and LD as an application. Our experiments aim to identify the issues users would find whereby LD is accessed via an application. Our first investigation brought together technical users and users of Geographic Information (GI). With the idea of LOD and LCD we asked users what factors would affect their view of data quality. We found 3 different types of buying behaviour on the web. We also found that context actively affected the users decision, i. e. users were willing to pay when the data was to make a professional decision but not for leisure use. To enable us to observe the behaviour of consumers whilst using data online, we built a working prototype of a LD application that would enable potential users of the system to experience the data and give us feedback about how they would behave in a LD environment. This was then extended into a second LD application to find if the same principles held true if actual capital was involved and they had to make a conscious decision regarding payment. With this in mind we proposed a potential architecture for the consumption of LD on the web. We determined potential issues which affect a consumers willingness to pay for data which surround quality factors. This supported our hypothesis that context affects a consumers willingness to pay and that willingness to pay is related to a requirement to reduce search times. We also found that a consumers perception of value and criticality of purpose also affected their willingness to pay. Finally we outlined an architecture to enable users to use LD where different scenarios may be involved which may have potential <b>payment</b> <b>restrictions.</b> This work is our contribution to the issue of the business case for LD on the web and is a starting point...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the failure of}} the private market to fully insure long-term care. I argue that the failure is a result of large intertemporal variability in the cost of long-term care. Unlike variability in cross section use, variability in the cost of care affects everyone in a pool and therefore cannot be diversified within a cohort. Further, since costs are serially correlated, the cost risk cannot be diversified across cohorts. Estimates suggest that the standard deviation of cost uncertainty is on the order of 4 to 14 percent for an average long-term care policy. In response to this cost risk, most long-term care policies do not insure real benefits. Policies generally pay a fixed nominal amount for care, which is updated using predetermined nominal rules. Many policies also have lifetime maximum <b>payments</b> and other <b>restrictions</b> on aggregate risk bearing by the insurer. The lack of complete long-term care insurance may be one explanation for the low rate of purchase of long-term care policies. ...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Diner's Club payment card in 1949, the means of exchange have progressed well beyond traditional instruments such as notes, coins and cheques. I use institutional economics to analyse historical data on the evolution of recently-developed retail payment systems in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. The framework I create yields insights into the incentives faced by the users of payment instruments and the payment networks that provide them. It also provides a means to assess the role of government in the evolution of retail payment systems. Ceteris paribus, consumers and merchants will prefer low transaction cost payment instruments. In order to complete a transaction, a consumer will proffer an instrument {{that may or may not}} be accepted by the merchant. Together, merchants and consumers will choose the payment instrument that generally reduces demand-side – i. e. consumer and merchant – transaction costs, relative to other available instruments. Consumer irreversible costs of adoption enhance the importance of network effects. To help overcome these, I argue payment networks need to make acceptance of their instrument attractive to merchants, which I find to be supported by analysis of the pricing of payment instruments. It distinguishes recently-developed payment instruments from other new technologies – the most technologically advanced instrument will not likely be adopted unless it is first acceptable to merchants. In workably competitive conditions, profit-seeking payment networks will attempt to provide an instrument that gets used while it at least recoups its costs of supply from fees paid by users. I argue this suggests a process of institutional adaption for profit-seeking payment networks. Network effects mean the use of an instrument grows disproportionately faster, the greater the number of people using it. For instrument supply, this means profit-seeking payment networks have an incentive to increase participation. In the presence of potential inter-network competition, a payment network will likely experience greater participation if, ceteris paribus, it offers an instrument that generally reduces demand-side transaction costs to a greater degree than competing networks' instruments and provides it with lower costs of supply. Governments play two key roles in retail payment system development. First, they can affect the development of systems by how well they protect property rights and enforce contracts. Although this role is performed relatively well in my sample countries, my analysis suggests that the use of recently-developed retail payment systems would fall, substantially, were it not so. Second and more importantly in my sample countries, governments impose restrictions on the freedom of contract for <b>payment</b> networks. If <b>restrictions</b> on this freedom are such that they prevent the trading of property rights, they risk reducing either the demand or the supply of <b>payment</b> instruments. Such <b>restrictions</b> might reduce demand if the instrument that would have been used no longer generally reduces demand-side transaction costs. They might reduce supply in two ways: by impeding payment networks' attempts to offer instruments that reduce these transaction costs or by reducing inter-network competition. In summary, I find that it is government restrictions on the freedom of contract that cause the substantial differences in the use of newly-developed retail payment systems between my sample countries.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} empirically {{the impact}} of the dramatic 1991 trade liberalization in India on the industry wage structure. The empirical strategy uses variation in industry wage premiums and trade policy across industries and over time. In contrast to earlier studies on developing countries, we find a strong, negative, and robust relationship between changes in trade policy and changes in industry wage premiums over time. The results are consistent with liberalization-induced productivity increases at the firm level, which get passed on to industry wages. Since tariff reductions were proportionately larger in sectors that employ a larger share of unskilled workers, the increase in wage premiums in these sectors implies that unskilled workers experienced an increase in their relative incomes. Thus, our findings suggest that trade liberalization has led to decreased wage inequality in India.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of allocating a single item {{repeatedly}} among multiple competing agents, {{in an environment where}} monetary transfers are not possible. We design (Bayes-Nash) incentive compatible mechanisms that do not rely on payments, with the goal of maximizing expected social welfare. We first focus on the case of two agents. We introduce an artificial payment system, which enables us to construct repeated allocation mechanisms without payments based on one-shot allocation mechanisms with <b>payments.</b> Under certain <b>restrictions</b> on the discount factor, we propose several repeated allocation mechanisms based on artificial payments. For the simple model in which the agents’ valuations are either high or low, the mechanism we propose is 0. 94 -competitive against the optimal allocation mechanism with payments. For the general case of any prior distribution, the mechanism we propose is 0. 85 -competitive. We generalize the mechanism to cases of three or more agents. For any number of agents, the mechanism we obtain is at least 0. 75 -competitive. The obtained competitive ratios imply that for repeated allocation, artificial payments may be used to replace real monetary payments, without incurring too much loss in social welfare.

The Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program was created in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008. The program is intended to help offset years of low market revenues for agricultural producers. However, those who enroll in ACRE must forego portions of traditional payments. This study was conducted to determine what types of farms are good candidates for the ACRE program and the sensitivity of those results to input parameters and program provisions. These objectives were accomplished by creating four model farms representing typical, full-time operations. This resulted in representative farms in the following counties: McLean, Illinois; Sumner, Kansas; Hale, Texas; and Boliver, Mississippi. One thousand stochastic prices and yields were generated for each crop on each representative farm. Correlations were imposed on the variables to create the appropriate interactions between prices and yields. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations show that cotton producers are unlikely to benefit from the ACRE program, as the payments foregone to enroll in this new program are very high. Additionally, states with lower price/yield correlation tend to receive ACRE payments more often. Furthermore, 2009 is shown to be the best year to enroll under the assumed price path. Altering the price path can change the ACRE enrollment decision as demonstrated in the analysis. Likewise, the optimal producer decision is shown {{to be sensitive to the}} base acres on each representative farm. Finally, the analysis reveals that ACRE benefits are dependent on the program's <b>payment</b> rate <b>restrictions...</b>|$|R

The treaty had been dictated by the victorious Allies of World War I; it forced Germany to assume sole responsibility for the war, reduced the area of Germany and imposed reparation <b>payments</b> and military <b>restrictions</b> on the nation. In early 1919, {{the strength of the}} Reichswehr, the regular German army, was estimated at 350,000, with more than 250,000 men enlisted in the various Freikorps (free corps), volunteer paramilitary units, largely consisting of returning soldiers from the war. The German government had repeatedly used Freikorp troops to put down Communist uprisings after the war. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which came into effect on 10 January 1920, Germany was required to reduce its land forces to a maximum of 100,000 men. The initial deadline was set for 31 March 1920 (later extended {{to the end of the}} year). Freikorps units were expected to be disbanded. Since the reason for their creation—internal repression—had become obsolete with the crushing of the leftist uprisings, they were becoming a threat to the government. Some senior military commanders had started discussing the possibility of a coup as early as July 1919.|$|R
40|$|Road use {{charging}} means {{charging a}} price {{for the use of}} scarce road space. It is a method of charging {{for the use of the}} road at the point and time of use to reflect the economic policy objective that vehicles should cover the full costs of their use. There are two distinct types of road use charging – congestion charging and tolling. Congestion charges are designed to be levied in cities; vehicles are charged as they cross a cordon on the outskirts of the city – or through a series of zones within a city. Singapore and Norway use electronic road pricing for this purpose. However, they could be used anywhere that congestion imposes unacceptable environmental costs eg, (1) at the Barcelona Olympic Games a <b>payment</b> plus <b>restriction</b> of access system was used to relieve traffic congestion, (2) the Lake District National Park could use it in the Summer months. Tolling is generally used on motorways or major highways or bridges and the motive for its use is usually the raising of revenue to finance road infrastructure costs rather than the relief of traffic congestion. A fee is charged for the use of a motorway and charging is usually on a distance basis. Where bridges and tunnels are concerned, tolling is done on a “point ” or single charge, basis. Tolling will be covered in a future Network Management note. Why use Congestion Charging? The aim of using congestion charging is to charge a price sufficiently high to promote modal shift and achieve transport policy objectives such as reducing congestion and encouraging a shift to public transport. Within this economic rationale sits the principle that the polluter pays. The aim may be to charge the economic price for the road space in order to promote the most efficient use of the facility and parallel facilities. This concept dates from the 1920 s and was the basis for the Smeed report on road pricing, published in 1967. It is still cited today as the economic justification for road use charging, and is the basis of the road user charging projects currently bein...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{relevance}} of fossil fuels in the electricity matrix in Spain, the electrical sector {{plays a crucial role}} in mitigation policies such as carbon taxes. Increased prices of electricity can act as an incentive to enhance energy efficiency contributing to CO 2 abatement. This paper evaluates a tax on electricity consumption (ECT). Focusing on energy efficiency commitments for Spain as established by EU Authorities for Horizon 2020 (H 2020), a pricing model was created to assess economic impacts and its effectiveness in meeting this commitment. The analysis was performed by considering two scenarios, without (Scenario 1) and with (Scenario 2) tax recycling between the new tax and employer-paid social security benefits or contributing to price stability. In Scenario 2, the tax reform is achieved with tax recycling, offsetting the introduction of the ECT by reducing employer-paid social security <b>payments.</b> Two alternative <b>restrictions</b> on the tax reform were considered for the simulation of Scenario 2. In the first case, a restriction was imposed to ensure revenue neutrality (2 -I). In the second case, the restriction ought to maintain price stability (2 -II). Results from different scenarios offer an important range of possibilities for policy decisions. The results show that with a tax rate equal to 1 %, there is a remarkable reduction of CO 2 emissions from the electricity sector, and the same happens with other sectors that the literature identifies as drivers of such emissions.

40|$|In recent years, {{scholarly}} {{attention on}} the complementary role of monetary integration to further economic integration in developing countries has tended to emphasise the direct and indirect benefits of 'limited monetary integration' while neglecting considerations of those benefits likely to accrue from adopting a common currency or fixed rates of exchange between their national currencies. However, {{the decision by the}} Heads of State and Government of the 16 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in May 1983 requesting a study of proposals leading {{to the creation of a}} single ECOWAS monetary zone has given a new scope and dimension of interest in the economics of common currencies. The West African countries in their efforts to integrate and achieve higher growth and development are increasingly frustrated by a number of internal and external factors including their dependent, disintegrated and inefficient patterns of domestic production, trade and currency systems, in particular, the continuing weakness and increasing precariousness of their national currencies, and a succession of global monetary and financial crises. These constraints, together with the payments and adjustment problems they have occasioned, and the relative unsuccessful experiences in currency management, <b>payments</b> and exchange <b>restrictions</b> within the West African Clearing House (WACH) and the exclusively francophone West African Monetary Union (WAMU or UMOA), have created a need for extending and deepening the scope for monetary and economic cooperation in the region. The Study advocates principally an all-embracing monetary union by means of a common currency as a strategic catalyst and timely element of realism that would create an impulse for national development and regional economic integration. Using basic propositions concerning aspects of monetary integration, stressing in particular the foundations of optimum currency areas, the Study tries to present a comprehensive and analytic discussion of the feasibility, processes, beneficial effects and constraints involved in achieving currency unification in the broader setting of West Africa's disparate economic and socio-political developments...|$|R
40|$|This study report {{assesses the}} free {{availability}} of scholarly publications during the 1996 to 2013 period. It {{is the largest}} scale measurement of open access availability performed to date: a sample of one-quarter of a million records was used to study the historical evolution of open access (OA) between 1996 and 2013 and a larger, one million records sample was used to perform an in-depth assessment of the proportion and scientific impact of OA between 2008 and 2013 in different types of OA, for different scientific fields of knowledge, and for 44 countries, the EU 28, ERA, and the world. Compared to previous studies done {{on the availability of}} OA, the present study presents the following characteristics: (1) it used the Scopus database, which currently covers a broader range of journals from various countries and scientific disciplines than other comprehensive databases; (2) it uses a simple definition of OA—freely available online to all (no money had to be paid, no registration to a service or website had to be made); (3) it used huge samples to maximise statistical precision; (4) it made careful and extensive efforts to harvest papers wherever they could be downloaded for free, without restriction, rather than restricting the approach to a search engine (in order to obtain a high 2 ̆ 7 recall 2 ̆ 7 rate, that is, the capacity to retrieve {{a large part of the}} relevant records, while, in addition, carefully minimising the number of false records collected (that is, the approach maximised retrieval precision); and (5) it carefully characterised the strengths and weaknesses of the measurement instrument in order to apply a correction that would provide a truer measure based on an Adjusted OA score. This study also provided a series of rational definitions of access, open access, and ideal open access. The definitions provided examine aspects such as <b>restrictions,</b> <b>payment,</b> delay, transiency, and legitimacy. Because of the limited means (time and budget) available for this project, it was necessary to use operational definitions of OA which do not provide all the details one may wish to obtain. Though it was easy to obtain a clear and easily operational definition of Gold OA by stating that it referred to papers published in Gold OA journals listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals, defining and measuring Green OA was more challenging. The operational definition restricted Green OA to researchers 2 ̆ 7 self-archived papers in institutional and some thematic repositories listed in OpenDOAR and ROAR. This left a sizeable residual number of papers that could still be downloaded for free; these were classified as Other OA. This comprises, for example, Gold OA papers from subscription-based journals, which are made available through article processing charges (APC). Other OA also include papers available in large repositories such as PubMed Central and aggregator sites such as CiteSeerX. There are also Robin Hood OA or Rogue OA papers, that is, papers that infringe on copyrights by making them accessible to the public despite licenses that restrict them to being behind pay walls...|$|R
