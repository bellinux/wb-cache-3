25|$|Although the dye {{is highly}} {{efficient}} at converting absorbed photons into free electrons in the TiO2, only photons {{absorbed by the}} dye ultimately produce current. The rate of <b>photon</b> <b>absorption</b> depends upon the absorption spectrum of the sensitized TiO2 layer and upon the solar flux spectrum. The overlap between these two spectra determines the maximum possible photocurrent. Typically used dye molecules generally have poorer absorption in the red part of the spectrum compared to silicon, which means that fewer of the photons in sunlight are usable for current generation. These factors limit the current generated by a DSSC, for comparison, a traditional silicon-based solar cell offers about 35 mA/cm2, whereas current DSSCs offer about 20 mA/cm2.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{electron}} penetration through a resist {{is essentially a}} stochastic process; there is a finite probability that resist exposure by released electrons can occur quite far {{from the point of}} <b>photon</b> <b>absorption.</b> Increasing the dose increases the number of far-reaching electrons, resulting in more extended resist loss. A leading EUV chemically amplified resist exposed to 80 eV electrons at a dose up to 80 uc/cm2 showed up to 7.5 nm resist thickness loss. For an open-source resist exposed near 200 uC/cm2 by 80 eV electrons, the resist thickness lost after post-exposure bake and development was around 13nm, while doubling the dose resulted in increasing the loss to 15nm. On the other hand, for doses >500 uc/cm2, the resist begins to thicken due to crosslinking.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} in 1926 in Transactions of the Faraday Society, James Franck {{was concerned with}} the mechanisms of photon-induced chemical reactions. The presumed mechanism was the excitation of a molecule by a photon, followed by a collision with another molecule during the short period of excitation. The question was whether {{it was possible for}} a molecule to break into photoproducts in a single step, the absorption of a photon, and without a collision. In order for a molecule to break apart, it must acquire from the photon a vibrational energy exceeding the dissociation energy, that is, the energy to break a chemical bond. However, as was known at the time, molecules will only absorb energy corresponding to allowed quantum transitions, and there are no vibrational levels above the dissociation energy level of the potential well. High-energy <b>photon</b> <b>absorption</b> leads to a transition to a higher electronic state instead of dissociation. In examining how much vibrational energy a molecule could acquire when it is excited to a higher electronic level, and whether this vibrational energy could be enough to immediately break apart the molecule, he drew three diagrams representing the possible changes in binding energy between the lowest electronic state and higher electronic states.|$|E

We demonstrate that when helium is exposed to subfemtosecond or attosecond pulses, both peaks move and their displacement is a signature of the time needed by the He+ orbital to relax after the ejection of the first electron.
