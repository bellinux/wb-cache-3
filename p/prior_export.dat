We use the micro-data from two waves of Swedish Community Innovation Survey (CIS) to provide empirical evidences to test our argument concerning this interrelation between innovation, productivity, and export.

The authors find evidence of diversification followed, {{in the last years of}} the sample period (post- 2000), by a slight re-concentration. This re-concentration is entirely explained by the growing importance of Chinese products in OECD imports. They also find evidence of relatively more volatile concentration levels for differentiated goods, consistent with a simple model of adverse selection and screening of suppliers by OECD buyers. Finally, they find that"accession"to OECD markets occurs directly (rather than after acquiring <b>prior</b> <b>export</b> experience on other markets) for more than half of the (extra-OECD) exporter/product pairs, but that one to eight years of experience enhances subsequent survival on OECD markets.

Aggregate data does not tell us if a sector is geographically diversified because there are many exporting firms, each of which specialises in a separate destination, or if the firms themselves are selling their exports in many markets.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} the export-supply response of plants in Indonesian manufacturing during the 1997 / 98 economic crisis. It {{is motivated by}} the findings of other studies which highlight the weak export performance of the crisis-affected countries, despite the increase in competitiveness from the sharp exchange rate depreciation during the crisis. It shows {{a picture of the}} response and investigates which characteristics determined the success of plants in responding to the crisis in terms of export. The empirical analysis points to the characteristics of firms and industry as the determinants of the firm success in their export response. The descriptive in particular shows a strong trend for plants that were non-exporters before the crisis to remain so during and after the crisis. The econometric analysis reveals the significant role of sunk-costs into exporting activities in determining the export response. Some variables which are related to sunk-costs- such as exporting history, an industry’s export intensity, and an industry’s <b>prior</b> <b>export</b> competitiveness- are positively related to the probability to export during and after the crisis. In addition to the sunk-costs, the ability to compete in international markets and foreign ownership are the other important determinants. In particular, non-exporters before the crisis found it easier to become exporters in the crisis period if they are more efficient, able to produce goods to international standards and have some foreign ownership share. Finally, the analysis reveals that access to credit is important for successful switching by non-exporters...|$|E
40|$|Exports respond unpredictably to {{a change}} in real {{exchange}} rates, suggests evidence from the 1980 s. Recent theoretical work explains this {{as a consequence of the}} sunk costs associated with breaking into foreign markets. Sunk costs include the cost of packaging, upgrading product quality, establishing marketing channels, and accumulating information on demand sources. The authors use micro panel data to estimate a dynamic discrete-choice model of participation in export markets, a model derived from the Krugman-Baldwin sunk-cost hysteresis framework. Applying the model to data on manufacturing plants in Colombia (1981 - 89), they test for the presence of sunk entry costs and quantify the importance of those costs in explaining export patterns. The econometric results reject the hypothesis that sunk costs are zero. The results, which control for both observed and unobserved sources of plant heterogeneity, indicate that <b>prior</b> <b>export</b> market experience has a substantial effect on the probability of exporting, but its effect depreciates fairly quickly. The reentry costs of plants that have been out of the export market for a year are substantially lower than the costs of a first-time exporter. After a year out of the export market, however, the reentry costs are not significantly different from the entry costs. Plant characteristics are also associated with export behavior: large old plants owned by corporations are more likely to export than other plants. Variations in plant-level cost and demand conditions have much less effect on the profitability of exporting than variations in macroeconomic conditions and sunk costs do. It appears especially difficult to break into foreign markets during periods of world recession.

40|$|Focusing on {{the timing}} and {{geographical}} scope of import and export activities of Belgian small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), the paper analyzes the importance, structural features and performance implications of firms that recently started to export following the geographical configuration of their international trade operations and their year of establishment. The analysis allows us to separate firms that started to export in the period 1998 - 2005 into four distinct groups: born internationals, i. e. firms which were established {{less than five years}} before their first year of exporting and exporting to less than five countries in the same region (regional focus), born globals; young firms but with a more internationally diversified export portfolio, born again globals, i. e. firms similar to born globals but established longer than five years before their first exports and traditional internationalizers, firms established more than five years before their first export operations characterized by a narrow geographical scope of their exports. We find SME export growth to be driven by a small group of born global firms, accounting for 60 per cent of the total increase in SME exports between 1998 and 2005. Analyzing the structural feature of the different types of firms, we find born globals to be more productive and characterized by a higher R&D spending and intangible asset intensity compared to other types of traders. We next test if the typology matters for the observed export performance differences across firms over time. We find that born globals grow faster in terms of export sales, have a stronger commitment to export markets {{and are more likely to}} continue exporting. Born globals also have the highest failure rate, traditional internationalizers the lowest. These findings suggest strong risk/return tradeoffs among the strategies chosen by the different types of firms. Performing a dynamic analysis of changes in trade configurations of firms over the observation period, we investigate how these changes have an impact on performance. Specific attention is paid to firms that stop importing/exporting. Especially firms that move from being exporters to become two-way traders, i. e. also starting to import goods from other countries show the most marked increases in turnover and productivity. The final part of the study analyzes the relationship between export and import activities to particular countries following the sequence in which they occur. We find that the probability to start importing from a country is 4 times higher for firms already exporting to that country than for trading SMEs without <b>prior</b> <b>export</b> experience in that country. ...|$|E
40|$|As the {{exchange}} rate, foreign demand, and production costs evolve, domestic producers are continually faced with two choices: whether {{to be an}} exporter and, if so, how much to export. We develop a dynamic structural model of export supply that characterizes these two decisions. The model embodies plant-level heterogeneity in export profits, uncertainty about the determinants of future profits, and market entry costs for new exporters. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain estimator, we fit this model to plant-level panel data on three Colombian manufacturing industries. We obtain profit function and sunk entry cost coefficients, {{and use them to}} simulate export responses to shifts in {{the exchange}}-rate process and several types of export subsidies. In each case, the aggregate export response depends on entry costs, expectations about the exchange rate process, <b>prior</b> <b>exporting</b> experience, and producer heterogeneity.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the link between}} firm {{productivity}} and exporting using three firm level datasets of 1323 Tunisian manufacturing firms from 2004 to 2006. In particular, we examine whether more productive firms self-select into export markets, and whether exporters achieve productivity improvements through learning by exporting effects. We then explore the link between innovation (as a channel linking productivity to exporting) and exporting. The analysis has been conducted on two clusters of firms. The first cluster distinguishes exporters from non-exporters and the second distinguishes fully exporting firms from others. The results suggest that fully exporting firms self-select more often into export markets and, therefore, have much less to gain from exporting because of their likely longer <b>prior</b> <b>exporting</b> experience. The analysis has been extended to deal with sectoral studies. The study finds that, in the long run, fully exporting firms in sectors characterized by subcontracting regimes, such as the textile and electronics industries, experience a distinct decline in the scope for learning by exporting.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} countries {{exports to the}} OECD and obtains several important results on export dynamic, linking exports experience and exports survival.

The effect of experience depreciates however rapidly with time: gaining experience {{for more than two years}} is worthless. Moreover, a break in <b>export</b> experience <b>prior</b> to entering the OECD reduces the benefit on survival. Geographic export dynamic reveals that experience is acquired in neighbor, easy to access markets before reaching more distant, richer partners and ultimately serving the OECD. PTAs among developing countries thus help exporters finding partners where to learn about their export potential. Finally, exporters may acquire experience directly within the OECD market through a process of trial and error. By facilitating this process, PTAs between developing countries and the OECD help boosting survival in the long run...|$|R
