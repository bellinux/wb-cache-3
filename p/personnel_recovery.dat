25|$|On 22 October 2012, the USAF {{issued an}} RFP {{for up to}} 112 Combat Rescue Helicopters (CRH) to replace the HH-60G with the primary mission of <b>personnel</b> <b>recovery</b> from hostile territory; other {{missions}} include civil search and rescue, disaster relief, casualty and medical evacuation. It {{had to have a}} combat radius of , a payload of 1,500lb (680kg), and space for up to four stretchers. The AgustaWestland AW101 was one entrant. By December 2012, competitors AgustaWestland, EADS, Boeing, and Bell Helicopter had withdrawn amid claims that the RFP favored Sikorsky and did not reward rival aircraft's capabilities. The USAF argued that the competition was not written to favor Sikorsky, and that the terms were clear as to the capabilities they wanted and could afford. Sikorsky was the only bidder remaining, with subcontractor Lockheed Martin supplying mission equipment and the electronic survivability suite. Sikorsky and the USAF extensively evaluated the proposed CRH-60, a variant of the MH-60 special operations helicopter; the CRH-60 differed from the MH-60 by its greater payload and cabin capacity, wider rotor blades, and better hover capability.|$|E

Decontamination techniques and materials are then discussed. Graphs and simple calculations are presented for determining safe work limits and radiation doses under varied conditions. A list of typical sources for radiological supplies and a brief bibliography are also included...|$|R

500|$|On 5 January 2015, the Navy and Marines {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding (MOU) to buy the V-22 for the COD mission, and was confirmed in the Navy's FY 2016 budget. Initially designated HV-22, four aircraft would be bought each year from 2018–2020. It incorporates an extended-range fuel system for an [...] unrefueled range, a high-frequency radio for over-the-horizon communications, and a public address system to communicate with passengers; the range increase comes from extra fuel bladders through larger external sponsons, the version's only physical difference from other Osprey variants. Its primary mission is long-range aerial logistics, but other conceivable missions include <b>personnel</b> <b>recovery</b> and special warfare. In February 2016, the Navy officially designated it as the CMV-22B. The Navy's program of record originally called for 48 aircraft, but it later determined that only 44 were required. Production of the CMV-22 will begin in FY 2018 and start deliveries in 2020. Bell and Boeing have pitched the V-22 as a Navy platform for various missions, such as communications, electronic warfare, or aerial refueling; the Navy has a known gap in tactical aerial refueling. Other roles include search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
