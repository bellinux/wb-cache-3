Currently, producing a good painted metal surface involves a lengthy and costly process. The metal surface is degreased, conversion coated, painted, and finally dried. The conversion coating is necessary when ordinary paints are used. An ordinary paint does not adhere very well to the bare metal surface. An ordinary paint does adhere to a conversion coating. The process for applying the conversion coating is time consuming, energy wasting, and often involves toxic compounds which are detrimental to the environment. A process which eliminates the use of a conversion coating is desirable. A novel technique of in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> coatings is a possible alternative coating process. A single-step in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> coating (ISPC) is formulated by predispersing a <b>phosphatizing</b> reagent into the paint. Ideally, the in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> reagent (ISPR) reacts with the metal surface and simultaneously bonds with the paint film. An ISPC is formulated differently than an ordinary paint. Therefore, it adheres to a meted surface without the use of a conversion coating. The ISPR is acidic by nature. Polyester-melamine coatings are catalyzed by an acid catalyst. In a polyester-melamine coating the ISPR serves a dual purpose. First, the ISPR <b>phosphatizes</b> the metal surface. Second, the ISPR catalyzes the cross-linking reaction between polyester polyol and melamine in a polyester-melamine coating. The polyester-melamine ISPC is successfully applied to aluminum and steel. A comparison is made between the ISPC and the regular polyester-melamine coating which is catalyzed with p-toluenesulfonic acid. The resulting coatings are compared using electrochemical methods, thermal methods, and standard accelerated corrosion tests. The electrical equivalent circuits are also compared. The adhesion of the ISPC is far superior to the adhesion of the control on both the steel and the aluminum. The results suggest that polyester-melamine coatings can be altered into an ISPC. Also, the ISPR is able to catalyze the cross-linking reactions needed to cure the paint...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [174]- 177). The up-to-date industrial pretreatment for metals can {{be categorized}} as a multistep coating process. This process is {{designed to protect the}} metal against corrosion by exposing the metal to a phosphating bath. The result is the formation of an insulating layer of metal phosphates. This normally precedes the application of an organic coating. The phosphate conversion is a successful state-of-the-art technique, yet it has certain disadvantages. Disadvantages include human exposure to toxic compounds, excessive waste generation, energy consumption, and labor. Recently, a novel metal surface pretreatment technique, in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> coating (ISPC), has been developed in our laboratory. The main goal of ISPC is to form a metal phosphate layer on the metal in-situ while an organic coating is applied. Dispersing an in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> reagent (ISPR) into the paint formulation forms the ISPC. The formation of a metal phosphate layer is verified through FT-IR and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The performance of the dry paint film is evaluated using several analytical techniques. The corrosion resistance of the organic coating is studied with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Adhesion properties are measured with cathodic delamination and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) tests. The viscosity o f the wet paint is determined with a Brookfield digital rheometer. The t selection of an efficient <b>phosphatizing</b> reagent is a challenging task that needs to be performed. Our research focused on selecting three compounds to be studied as potential <b>phosphatizing</b> reagents. The ISPRs are nitrilotris(methylene) -triphosphonic acid, phenylphosphonic acid, and 4 -phosphono benzoic acid. The coating formulation (referred to as the control paint) adopted in this study is a volatile organic compounds (VOC) -free thermoset acrylic latex system from the Sherwin-Williams Company. Results on the performance properties of these potential ISPC formulations were obtained. Based on the data obtained, the ISPC that was superior compared to the control in terms of protecting the metal against corrosion was the one in which phenylphosphonic acid was used. M. S.

A single step in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> organic coating (ISPC) can be achieved by pre-dispersing an optimal amount of in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> reagents (ISPRs) into the coating formulation. At the time this coating is being thermally cured, these reagents are designed to diffuse to and react with the metal substrate surface to form insulating phosphate products to inhibit corrosion development. On the other hand, ISPRs are also designed {{to take part in the}} coating's film-forming polymerization reactions. It can thus provide metals a coating with enhanced adhesion properties by generating chemical linkages between the polymer film and the substrate. Pursuing in-depth knowledge of the phosphating chemistry involved in this ISPC technique, the dissertation research investigated the functionalities responsible to the in-situ metal <b>phosphatizing</b> reactions. It is elucidated that the metal phosphatization is induced via an acid-base type of interaction between the P-O functionality in the ISPRs and the substrate surface. In the meantime, systematic studies have been carried out to examine the influence of ISPRs toward the polymer chemistry in the coatings, and guidelines have been drawn for the formulation optimization for ISPC systems. On the basis of these fundamental investigations, the ISPC technique is successfully applied into three commercial paint systems representative of the new generation coatings which are environmental friendly. For all three systems, advanced corrosion protective performance and adhesion properties of the coatings are recorded through various electrochemical approaches, as well as industrial standard accelerated corrosion resistance measurements. The results suggest that the ISPC technique not only can be used as an alternative to the environmentally hazardous chromate post-treatments, but can also be a possible candidate to substitute for the multi-step pre-treatment/coating metal pre-treatment process, thus saving labor, energy and chemical resources...|$|R

This research focuses on environmentally friendly coatings to replace current coating practices. This work additionally focuses on the analysis of metal alloys by Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for composition and characterization. A hybrid organic-inorganic conductive primer for application on medium density fiberboard was created in this work. The substrate is a non-conducting wood product and with current powder coating practices requires temperatures above 100 °C to increase the conductivity enough for the powder coating to adhere. With the conductive primer developed in this research, the powder coating process has reduced the temperature requirements to room temperature. The conductive primer was designed to cure at room temperature and seal and protect the substrate. In industrial tests the conductive primer outperformed commercially available primers currently in use. The pretreatment of metal surfaces with in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> reagents developed in this work have been used on cold-rolled steel and galvanized steel. The in-situ phosphate reagents (ISPR) are the network structures of phosphate silicate composites. The steel substrates in this research were test panels and screws or bolts. The coatings in this research were designed to compete against a coating named ClimasealRTM. This coating is an aluminum-filled polyester that contains hexavalent chromium as an additive and as a pretreatment step. The developed coatings incorporated silicon nanoparticles and in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> reagents developed in this lab.

The copper content in tap water was investigated by LIBS once the copper ions were collected on an ion-exchange membrane.

The current metal coating process is a multi-step process. The surface is cleaned, primered, dried and then painted. The process is labor intensive and time consuming. The wash primer is a conversion coating, which prepares metal surface for better paint adhesion. The wash primers currently used often contain hexavalent chromium (Cr 6 +), which seals the pores in the conversion coating. The presence of hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) make waste disposal expensive and pose dangers to workers. The novel technique of in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> coating (ISPC) is a single-step, chrome-free alternative to the present coating practice. Formulation of an ISPC involves predispersal of an in-situ <b>phosphatizing</b> reagent (ISPR) into the paint system to form a stable formulation. The ISPR reacts with the metal surface and bonds with the paint film simultaneously, which eliminates the need for a conversion coating. In acid catalyzed paint systems, such as polyester-melamine paints, the ISPR also catalyzes cross-linking reactions between the melamine and the polyester polyols. ISPCs are formulated using commercially available coating systems including: polyester-melamine, two-component epoxy, polyurethane and high-hydroxy content polyester-melamine coil coating. The ISPCs are applied to metal substrates and their performances are evaluated using electrochemical, thermal and standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing methods. In addition, ISPCs were designed and formulated based on: (1) phosphate chemistry, (2) polymer chemistry, (3) sol-gel chemistry, and (4) the ion-exchange principle. Organo-functionalized silanes, which serve as excellent coupling and dispersion agents, are incorporated into the optimized ISPC formula and evaluated using standard ASTM testing methods and electrochemical spectroscopy. Also, an ion-exchange pigment, which leads to better adhesion by forming a mixed metal silicate surface, is dispersed into an ISPC and the performance of the final coating formulation is evaluated. Successful ISPCs formulated for multiple coating systems exhibited excellent adhesion, hardness and gloss, which supports their suitability as a chrome-free, single-step alternative for aerospace, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and coil coating applications...|$|R
50|$|Somewhat {{analogous}} to the improved manganese phosphating process improvements discovered by Baker and Dingman, a similarly improved method was found for an improved zinc phosphating process as well. This improvement was discovered by Darsey of the Parker Rust Proof Company, who filed a patent in February 1941, which was granted in August 1942, , that improved upon the zinc <b>phosphatizing</b> (Parkerizing) process further. He discovered that adding copper reduced the alkalinity requirement over what had been required, and that also adding a chlorate to the nitrates that were already used would additionally permit running the process {{at a much lower}} temperature in the range of 115 to 130 F, reducing the cost of running the process further. With these process improvements, the end result was that a low-temperature (energy-efficient) zinc phosphating (Parkerizing) process, using strategic materials to which the United States had ready access, became the most common phosphating process used during World War II to protect American war materials such as firearms and planes from rust and corrosion.|$|R
