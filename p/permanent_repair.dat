25|$|In 1989, the Federal City Council {{issued a}} report castigating the {{government}} of the District of Columbia for allowing the city's roads to deteriorate. The report noted that the city spent just $5 million a year on road repair, which it used almost exclusively for temporary patches rather than <b>permanent</b> <b>repair,</b> upgrades, and maintenance. The report identified a $1.6 billion backlog in street maintenance projects. The backlogs led the city to separate its road maintenance, repair, and construction functions from the District of Columbia Department of Public Works, creating a new District Department of Transportation in 2002.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1983, C-5A 70-0446 {{crashed on}} landing at Shemya, Alaska. The C-5 {{approached}} below the glide slope, hit an embankment {{short of the}} runway and bounced back into the air before coming {{to rest on the}} runway. Structural damage was extensive and the two aft main landing gear bogies were sheared from the aircraft. There were no fatalities. A joint USAF/Lockheed team made repairs enabling a one-time ferry flight from Shemya to the Lockheed plant in Marietta, Georgia. There, the aircraft was quickly christened Phoenix II and <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> efforts got under way. In addition to the structural repairs, Phoenix II also received an improved landing gear system (common to the then-new C-5B), wing modification, and a color weather radar upgrade. The aircraft was returned to service.|$|E
500|$|After a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> to her port {{propeller}} at Manus from 28 February to 19 March, she rejoined Task Force 54 at Ulithi on 22 March {{in preparation for}} the invasion of Okinawa. Joined by , , and West Virginia, the fleet of battleships began its bombardment of Okinawa on 27 March. Providing shore bombardment, and later naval artillery support for ground forces, New York was on station for 76 consecutive days, during which she expended 4,159 rounds of 14-inch ammunition and 7,001 rounds of 5-inch ammunition. She was subjected to a kamikaze attack on 14 April which destroyed one spotting plane on its catapult, but the Japanese aircraft crashed [...] from the ship and New York received only superficial damage, suffering two men injured. She was detached on 11 June, her gun barrels having been worn out by fire, and proceeded to Pearl Harbor to have her guns relined {{in preparation for the}} invasion of mainland Japan. She stopped by Leyte on 14 June and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 July. She was in the harbor on 15 August, the end of the war.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{completion}} of <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs</b> at Charleston, South Carolina, Tanager {{was assigned to}} the U.S. Pacific Fleet in December 1919. She was reclassified AM-5 on 17 July 1920.|$|R
25|$|By January 2006, the Army Corps of Engineers {{announced}} that temporary repairs of the Industrial, London Avenue, and 17th Street Canals had been finished. A project for more <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs</b> started.|$|R
5000|$|In Odessa port {{the ship}} was sign on Sakhalin State Shipping Company, passed <b>permanent</b> <b>repair,</b> {{received}} bunker supply. In September 1946, Лиза Чайкина sailed from Odessa in September and visited following ports during the voyage: ...|$|E
5000|$|......to provide salvage repair;" [...] - {{simply put}} --- the {{refloating}} of practically every conceivable type of sailing craft: sampans, small boats, barges, dredges, riverine men o'war, tugs, freighters, ad infinitum, and making temporary repairs to those craft {{in preparation for}} transit to a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> facility.|$|E
50|$|The eastern arch was demolished, by William Kirkcaldy of Grange in January 1560, {{to hamper}} French troops during the regency of Mary of Guise {{the mother of}} Mary, Queen of Scots. The French {{commander}} Henri Cleutin improvised a bridge using timbers {{from the roof of}} the nearby Tullibody Old Kirk, and carried on from Fife to Stirling. A more <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> was made in 1560.|$|E
50|$|On 17 November, Seal {{was ordered}} to start for Pearl Harbor. She arrived on 30 November, and after {{temporary}} repairs, continued on to the Mare Island Navy Yard for <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following {{temporary}} patching at Oran, Roe {{returned to}} New York for <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs.</b> In mid-September, she resumed transatlantic convoy duty and completed two runs to North Africa {{before the end}} of the year.|$|R
50|$|Bache {{arrived at}} New York Navy Yard 13 July 1945 for <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs</b> {{and then went}} to Charleston, S.C., for inactivation. On 4 February 1946, Bache went out of {{commission}} in reserve at Charleston.|$|R
5000|$|... (Startbahnbombe): Bomb {{to destroy}} runways. The first shaped charge explodes on impact, {{creating}} a channel under the surface. An additional charge creates an explosion under the concrete runway {{to make a}} crater with heaved sides (large jagged, uprooted edges), making {{it much more difficult}} to repair than a simple crater because the large jagged pieces have to be broken off, removed, and edges smoothed before a temporary or <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> can be effected.|$|E
5000|$|However, some {{manufacturers}} of CO/ALR devices recommend periodically checking/tightening the terminal screws on these devices {{which can be}} hazardous for unqualified individuals to attempt, and there is criticism of their use as a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> as some CO/ALR devices have failed in tests when connected to [...] "old technology" [...] aluminum wire. [...] Furthermore, just installing CO/ALR devices (switches and receptacles) doesn't address potential hazards associated with other connections such as those at ceiling fans, lights and equipment.|$|E
50|$|However, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) {{currently}} only recommends two {{alternatives for}} a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> using the pig-tailing method. The more extensively tested method uses special crimp-on connectors called COPALUM connectors. As of April 2011, the CPSC has also recognized miniature lug-type connectors called AlumiConn connectors. The CPSC considers {{the use of}} pigtails with wire nuts a temporary repair, and even as a temporary repair recommends special installation procedures, and notes that there can still be hazards with attempting the repairs.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{temporary}} repairs {{were made}} in Portland, and Robert Young was back in service by 4:30p.m. on Saturday afternoon, February 1, 1930. [...] <b>Permanent</b> <b>repairs</b> were made the next week at the Portland Shipbuilding Company.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, {{steps on}} the section of wall between Morgan's Mount and Northgate Bridge {{were found to be}} moving and had to be propped up. In April 2016, the section was closed for <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs,</b> with the closure likely to take up to six months.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of 1 October 1944, she {{underwent}} two severe strafing attacks while on picket duty off the Palaus. Damage was extensive, 9 men were killed and 16 wounded. Following emergency repairs Bailey proceeded to Mare Island for <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs,</b> arriving 25 October.|$|R
50|$|In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy {{washed out}} and damaged {{a portion of}} the road at the S-curves north of Rodanthe on the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge. Emergency ferry service was {{established}} from Rodanthe to Stumpy point ferry terminals. As in 2011, the ferry service became the lifeline for Hatteras Island. Noreasters and storms repeatedly caused breaches since the road was repaired in December 2012. A state of emergency was declared and $20.8 million of emergency federal funding was secured to construct a more <b>permanent</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
50|$|On July 1, 2014, a storm with straight-line winds {{tore the}} eastern half of the roof off the church, dumping the debris onto the lawn and an {{adjacent}} corn field. Several tombstones were also toppled or broken off. Volunteers placed a tarp over the structure until a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> could be made. Repairs were delayed because the St. John's Cemetery Association had been legally dissolved in 2009. Papers were finally signed on October 1, 2014 to give Harrison Township ownership. The township planned to obtain donations and grants to effect the repairs.|$|E
50|$|The AlumiConn {{miniature}} {{lug connector}} {{can also be}} used for a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair.</b> The only special tool required for an electrician installing them is a special torque screwdriver that should be readily available to qualified electrical contractors. Proper torque on the connectors set screws is critical to having an acceptable repair. However, use of the Alumiconn connectors is a relatively newer repair option for older aluminum wiring compared to other methods, and use of these connectors can have some of the same or similar problems with limited enclosure space as the COPALUM connectors.|$|E

50|$|The bridge reopened for {{bicycle and}} {{pedestrian}} traffic on June 1, 2012, with temporary support structures in place. New plates were designed, and {{the bridge was}} closed once more between September 23, 2012, and November 19, 2012, {{to allow them to}} be retrofitted as <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The road {{extended}} {{only slightly}} beyond the bridge when the Good Friday earthquake of 1964 halted construction and severely damaged the Million Dollar Bridge, collapsing the north span. Temporary repairs were made, and the bridge {{continued to be}} used. <b>Permanent</b> <b>repairs</b> were not completed until 2005.|$|R
50|$|The village manor is a late-15th- to early-16th-century {{building}} of Purbeck and Portland stone with courses of flint. It {{was built in}} the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and is a Grade I listed building. It has mullioned windows and a gabled staircase turret on the west side. Nearby is a sixteenth century tithe-barn with a hammerbeam roof, also a listed building but falling into disrepair. In 2008, Historic England funded the erection of scaffolding and temporary repairs to the structure, but by 2016, a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> had not been made.|$|E
50|$|Speed tape is an {{aluminum}} pressure-sensitive tape {{used to do}} minor repairs on aircraft and racing cars. It {{is used as a}} temporary repair material until a more <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> can be carried out. It has an appearance similar to duct tape, for which it is sometimes mistaken, but its adhesive is capable of sticking on an airplane fuselage or wing at high speeds, hence the name. It can either be soft aluminum with an adhesive layer such as 3M 425, or a laminate of aluminum and cloth such as Nitto Permacel P12L.|$|E

50|$|Leaving Yokosuka astern 18 March 1952, Castor {{ran into}} a fierce storm which damaged her engines and left her {{dead in the water}} for 22 hours until she could be towed back to Japan for {{emergency}} repairs. She arrived at San Francisco 25 April for overhaul and <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|While patrolling off the Malay coast, 13 June 1945, she {{was damaged}} aft by an allied naval mine {{explosion}} {{and forced to}} retire to Subic Bay, Luzon, for emergency repairs, arriving 17 June. Proceeding home for <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs,</b> she arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 4 August 1945.|$|R
2500|$|Temporary repairs {{were made}} in April by the ship's crew and men from the {{destroyer}} tender [...] and the repair ship [...] Renshaw then proceeded under her own power from the forward area to the Todd Pacific Shipyard in Tacoma, Washington, where <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs</b> were completed early in October 1945.|$|R
50|$|Some repairs {{need the}} {{specialist}} equipment {{of the workshop}} and some form of improvised repair is needed to return the component to a suitable repair workshop. A temporary repair, usually {{in the form of}} a patch, can be fixed to the component to ensure safety until the component can be repaired at a later date. For a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> all the approved general guidelines for laminate and sandwich repairs should be followed. These repair operations should be carried out in controlled workshop areas to ensure high quality. Operating in a controlled environment and attention to the detail will ensure success.|$|E
5000|$|In many cases, {{an endless}} chain cannot be {{replaced}} easily {{since it is}} linked into {{the frame of the}} machine (this is the case on the traditional bicycle, amongst other places). However, in some cases, a joining link with horseshoe clip cannot be used or is not preferred in the application either. In this case, a [...] "soft link" [...] is used, placed with a chain riveter and relying solely on friction. With modern materials and tools and skilled application this is a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair</b> having almost the same strength and life of the unbroken chain.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of funding in recent years, {{sections}} of important routes have fallen into disrepair causing damage to vehicles and has also led, to a lesser extent, to minor accidents. The repair of roads in Scotland is slow, sporadic and by European standards it uses somewhat antiquated techniques.For example, clusters of small potholes on main roads are filled up locally with hot tar or low quality asphalt instead of repaving the entire road section. In many instances this method is used as a <b>permanent</b> <b>repair.</b> Another method is repaving either small areas or short stretches of carriageway where damage is most severe making for treacherous, uneven surfaces.|$|E
50|$|While {{returning}} to Espiritu Santo on 22 January 1944, Cache was {{struck in the}} port side by a submarine torpedo. One man was killed, and Cache was severely damaged, but {{was able to make}} port under her own power. After temporary repairs, she sailed for San Pedro, California, for <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{extensive}} {{nature of the}} damage, temporary transmission towers were sent by Western Power; these towers can reach a height of 58 metres and take only one day to erect. It is expected that the towers will remain in use for 6 to 12 months while the <b>permanent</b> <b>repairs</b> are made.|$|R
