50|$|The {{formation}} of the zinc acetylide proceeds via the intermediacy of a dialkynyl zinc (functional group exchange). Catalytic processes have been developed such as Merck’s ephedrine process. <b>Propargylic</b> alcohols can be synthesized from zinc acetylides.

5000|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{are also}} used as coupling partners {{and can be used}} with a large range of organostannane, even alkyl-tin reagents, to produce ketones (see example below). [...] However, it is sometimes difficult to introduce acyl chloride functional groups into large molecules with sensitive functional groups. An alternative developed to this process is the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling reaction, which introduces the carbonyl group via carbon monoxide insertion.Allylic, benzylic, and <b>propargylic</b> halides can also be coupled. While commonly employed, allylic halides proceed via an η3 transition state, allowing for coupling with the organostannane at either the α or γ position, occurring predominantly at the least substituted carbon (see example below). [...] Alkenyl epoxides (adjacent epoxides and alkenes) can also undergo this same coupling through an η3 transition state as, opening the epoxide to an alcohol. While allylic and benzylic acetates are commonly used, <b>propargylic</b> acetates are unreactive with organostannanes.|$|E
50|$|The {{instability}} toward Bergman cyclization-reduction decomposition pathways poses a {{major threat}} to any proposed synthesis of enediynes. Myers and co-workers addressed this liability by late-stage dehydrative installation of the olefin. Without this unsaturation linking the two alkynyl bridges, synthetic intermediates are not disposed toward Bergman-type decomposition, and risk of decomposition is mitigated. In this case, dehydration of a <b>propargylic</b> alcohol was induced by treatment with Martin sulfurane.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, William Okamura and Richard Gibbs {{reported}} an enantioselective synthesis of (+)-sterpurene that featured a remarkable intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction of an allene. The 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement of the thiophenyl group {{to give the}} sulfoxide as below proceeded enantiospecifically due to the predefined stereochemistry of the <b>propargylic</b> alcohol. In this way, the single allene isomer formed could direct the Diels-Alder to occur on only one face of the generated ‘diene’.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, a one-pot coupling-isomerization-Stetter-Paal Knorr {{sequence}} was reported. This procedure first utilizes palladium cross-coupling chemistry {{to couple}} aryl halides with <b>propargylic</b> alcohols to give α,β-unsaturated ketones, which can then undergo a Stetter reaction with an aldehyde. Once the 1,4-dicarbonyl compound is formed, heating {{in the presence}} of acid will give the furan, while heating {{in the presence of}} ammonium chloride and acid will give the pyrrole. The entire sequence is performed in one-pot with no work-up or purification between steps.|$|E
50|$|The methylalumination of alkynes in the {{presence}} of Cp2ZrCl2 is employed for the synthesis of stereodefined trisubstituted olefin fragments, a common substructure in terpene and polyketide natural products. The synthesis of (E)-4-iodo-3-methylbut-3-en-1-ol shown below is a typical application of this reaction:For terminal alkynes, the reaction generally proceeds with good regioselectivity (>90:10 rr) and complete syn selectivity, even in {{the presence}} of <b>propargylic</b> or homopropargylic heteroatom substituents. Unfortunately, extension of the zirconocene-catalyzed methylalumination to alkylalumination with higher alkyls results in lower yields and poor regioselectivities.|$|E
50|$|In one {{experimental}} {{setup the}} hydrophobic matrix is RP silica gel (C18) and the anchor is acridone. Acridone is N-alkylated and the terminal alkene group is converted into an aldehyde by ozonolysis. This compound is bonded to RP silica gel and {{this system is}} subjected to a tandem sequence of organic reactions. The first reaction is a Barbier reaction with <b>propargylic</b> bromide in water (green chemistry) and the second reaction is a Sonogashira coupling. Substrates may vary in these sequences {{and in this way}} a chemical library of new compounds can be realized.|$|E
50|$|While {{tertiary}} alcohols {{are typically}} not effected by Fétizon's reagent, tertiary <b>propargylic</b> alcohols {{have been shown}} to oxidize under these conditions and results in the fragmentation of the alcohol with an alkyne leaving group.Halohydrins that possess a trans stereochemistry have been demonstrated to form epoxides and transposed products in the presence of Fétizon's reagent. Halohydrins possessing a cis-stereochemistry seem to perform a typical Fétizon's oxidation to a ketone.1,3 diols have a tendency to eliminate water following the monooxidation by Fétizon's reagent to form an enone.Under differing structural conditions, 1,2 diols can form diketones in the presence of Fétizon's reagent. However, oxidative carbon-carbon bond cleavage may also occur.|$|E
50|$|Enes are π-bonded {{molecules}} that contain {{at least one}} active hydrogen atom at the allylic, <b>propargylic,</b> or α-position. Possible ene components include olefinic, acetylenic, allenic, aromatic, cyclopropyl, and carbon-hetero bonds. Usually, the allylic hydrogen of allenic components participates in ene reactions, {{but in the case}} of allenyl silanes, the allenic hydrogen atom α to the silicon substituent is the one transferred, affording a silylalkyne. Phenol can act as an ene component, for example in the reaction with dihydropyran, but high temperatures are required (150-170 °C). Nonetheless, strained enes and fused small ring systems undergo ene reactions at much lower temperatures. In addition, ene components containing C=O, C=N and C=S bonds have been reported, but such cases are rare.|$|E
50|$|Monofluorinated (MOFO) and difluorinated (DIFO) cyclooctynes {{were created}} to {{increase}} the rate through the addition of electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents at the <b>propargylic</b> position. Fluorine is a good electron-withdrawing group in terms of synthetic accessibility and biological inertness. In particular, it cannot form an electrophilic Michael acceptor that may side-react with biological nucleophiles.DIBO (dibenzocyclooctyne) was developed as a fusion to two aryl rings, resulting in very high strain {{and a decrease in}} distortion energies. It was proposed that biaryl substitution increases ring strain and provides conjugation with the alkyne to improve reactivity. Although calculations have predicted that mono-aryl substitution would provide an optimal balance between steric clash (with azide molecule) and strain, monoarylated products {{have been shown to be}} unstable.|$|E
5000|$|Under mildly acidic or neutral conditions, oxoammonium salts such as TEMP=O+BF4− {{are able}} to oxidize allylic, benzylic, <b>propargylic,</b> or {{aliphatic}} alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones. Secondary alcohols react faster than primary ones, although selectivity is low. A convenient experimental protocol allows for recycling of the oxoammonium salt.(7)Amines, benzylic ethers, and alkenes are oxidized more rapidly than unactivated alcohols; thus, selective stoichiometric oxidation of unactivated alcohols {{in the presence of}} these functional groups is not possible. Alcohols with β-nitrogen or β-oxygen substituents react sluggishly under acidic conditions. Allylic and benzylic alcohols can be selectively oxidized under these conditions(8)Under basic conditions, two equivalents of oxidant are needed because of competitive comproportionation between reduced nitroxide and unreacted oxoammonium (see equation (3) above). Pyridine is usually employed as the base. These are the most common conditions for nitroxide oxidations in the stoichiometric mode.(9) ...|$|E
50|$|Gregory Fu {{and colleagues}} have {{developed}} a methodology utilizing a chiral DMAP analogue to achieve excellent kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Initial studies utilizing ether as a solvent, low catalyst loadings (2 mol %), acetic anhydride as the acylating agent, and triethylamine at room temperature gave selectivities ranging from 14-52, corresponding to ee's of the recovered alcohol product as high as 99.2%. However, solvent screening proved {{that the use of}} tert-amyl alcohol increased both the reactivity and selectivity.With the benchmark substrate 1-phenylethanol, this corresponded to 99% ee of the unreacted alcohol at 55% conversion when run at 0 °C. This system proved to be adept at resolution of a number of arylalkylcarbinols, with selectivities as high as 95 and low catalyst loadings of 1%, as shown below utilizing the (-)-enantiomer of the catalyst. This resulted in highly enantioenriched alcohols at very low conversions, giving excellent yields as well. In addition, the high selectivities result in highly enantioenriched acylated products, with a 90% ee sample of acylated alcohol for o-tolylmethylcarbinol, with s=71.In addition, Fu reported the first highly selective acylation of racemic diols (as well as desymmetrization of meso diols). With low catalyst loading of 1%, enantioenriched diol was recovered in 98% ee and 43% yield, with the diacetate in 39% yield and 99% ee. The remainder of the material was recovered as a mixture of monoacetate.The planar-chiral DMAP catalyst was also shown to be effective at kinetically resolving <b>propargylic</b> alcohols. In this case, though, selectivities were found to be highest without any base present. When run with 1 mol% of the catalyst at 0 °C, selectivities as high as 20 could be attained. The limitations of this method include the requirement of an unsaturated functionality, such as carbonyl or alkenes, at the remote alkynyl position. Alcohols resolved using the (+)-enantiomer of the DMAP catalyst are shown below.Fu also showed his chiral DMAP catalyst's ability to resolve allylic alcohols.Effective selectivity was dependent upon the presence of either a geminal or cis substituent to the alcohol-bearing group, with a notable exception of a trans-phenyl alcohol which exhibited the highest selectivity. Using 1-2.5 mol% of the (+)-enantiomer of the DMAP catalyst, the alcohols shown below were resolved in the presence of triethylamine.While Fu's DMAP analogue catalyst worked exceptionally well to kinetically resolve racemic alcohols, it was not successful in use for the kinetic resolution of amines. A similar catalyst, PPY*, was developed that, in use with a novel acylating agent, allowed for the successful kinetic resolution acylation of amines. With 10 mol% (-)-PPY* in chloroform at -50 °C, good to very good selectivities were observed in the acylation of amines, shown below. A similar protocol was developed for the kinetic resolution of indolines.|$|E
