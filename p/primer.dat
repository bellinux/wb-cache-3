50|$|Other {{explosives}} used in <b>primers</b> {{can include}} lead azide, potassium perchlorate, or diazodinitrophenol (DDNP). New {{on the market}} in the late 1990s are lead-free primers(see green bullet), to address concerns over the lead and other heavy-metal compounds found in older <b>primers.</b> The heavy metals, while small in quantity, are released {{in the form of a}} very fine soot. Some indoor firing ranges are moving to ban <b>primers</b> containing heavy metals due to their toxicity. Lead-free <b>primers</b> were originally less sensitive and had a greater moisture sensitivity and correspondingly shorter shelf life than normal noncorrosive <b>primers.</b> Since their introduction, lead-free <b>primers</b> have become better in their performance compared to early lead free <b>primers,</b> as reported by AccurateShooter.com in October 2011. Tests comparing lead-free <b>primers</b> to lead-based <b>primers</b> conducted by the US Department of Defense (approx 2006), exposed some significant differences in accuracy between the two <b>primers</b> when used in 7.62×51mm. In these tests, lead-free <b>primers</b> were proven to be not as accurate as lead-based <b>primers.</b> The lead-free <b>primers</b> exhibited poor performance as far as peak blast pressure, which consequently leads to poor ignition. Popularity is still minimal, as accuracy is paramount. Most lead-free <b>primers</b> are sourced through Russia (MUrom?)or South Korea (PMC).|$|R
40|$|In our {{comparative}} study of L 1 consensus <b>primers</b> with E 6 type-specific <b>primers</b> for detection of human papillomavirus (HPVs) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 35 cases of cervical neoplasia, the detection rate by E 6 <b>primers</b> (54 %; 19 / 35) {{was significantly higher than}} that by L 1 <b>primers</b> (25 %; 9 / 35) (p < 0. 01). And all specimens HPV-positive with L 1 <b>primers</b> were also positive by E 6 <b>primers.</b> HPV DNA could be amplified in 36 % (9 of 25) of tissue by L 1 consensus <b>primers</b> from which beta-globin gene was amplified as compared with 64 % (16 of 25) of tissue by E 6 type-specific <b>primers.</b> With the L 1 consensus <b>primers,</b> 8 cases were positive for HPV- 16 and 1 case was positive for HPV- 33. These results show that the L 1 consensus <b>primers</b> have inferior sensitivity to the E 6 type-specific <b>primers</b> for the detection of HPV by PCR. But the L 1 consensus <b>primers</b> have great value in making simultaneous detection of various HPV types in a single tube reaction, thus they permit reduction of time and the economic burden of the experiment...|$|R
40|$|Six {{pairs of}} species-specific <b>primers</b> were {{designed}} from the {{alignment of the}} sequences of the SS rRNA gene obtained from the Genbank database for Babesia bigemina (accession number X 59604) and for B. bovis (accession number U 06105). Three pairs of <b>primers</b> were designed specifically for B. bigemina and another 3 sets of <b>primers</b> for B. bovis. All oligonucleotide sequences selected as <b>primers</b> were examined for similarities to other organisms through the Genbank Blast procedure and these 6 sets of <b>primers</b> demonstrated high level of specificity. The synthetic oligonucleotides were also tested for specificity by PCR assay using genomic DNA extracted from 40 isolates of B. bigemina and 30 from B. bovis, obtained in six different States of Brazil. All 6 sets of <b>primers</b> were validated as 100 % specific for the respective parasite. The PCR amplified the expected fragments for each set of <b>primers,</b> as follows: a) B. bigemina: <b>primers</b> GAU 5 forward/GAU 6 reverse with amplicon of 1, 124 bp; <b>primers</b> GAU 5 forward/GAU 8 reverse with amplicon of 458 bp; <b>primers</b> GAU 7 forward/GAU 6 reverse with amplicon of 685 bp; b) B. bovis: <b>primers</b> GAU 9 forward/GAU 10 reverse with amplicon of 541 bp; <b>primers</b> GAU 9 forward/GAU 13 reverse with amplicon of 883 bp; <b>primers</b> SOGIN forward/ GAU 10 with amplicon of 1211 bp...|$|R

Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should be fairly credited.

Partial sequencing of products demonstrated that alphoid and Alu sequences were indeed contiguous in some newly synthesized DNA fragments. While Alu or LINEs <b>primers</b> generate smears of DNA fragments on total human DNA, the alphoid-nonalphoid repeat combinations generated electrophoretically distinguishable bands of DNA when the template was total DNA.
