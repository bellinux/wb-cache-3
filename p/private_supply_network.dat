40|$|Because the <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> of an {{enterprise}} should be {{flexible enough to}} capture and overcome market dynamics, {{one of the major}} concerns of global enterprises is to make their <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> reconfigurable. Although many strategies for flexible management of a <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> have been proposed, especially for mitigating <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> risks, it still remains unclear how to apply the strategies to a <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> and how to reconfigure the <b>supply</b> <b>network.</b> This paper examines the influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market environment on the structure of <b>supply</b> <b>network,</b> and proposes a method of reconfiguring the <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> of {{an enterprise}} to cope with its flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> model is proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical indices of strategies are defined. In the proposed model, each business actor is defined as a network node and each node has its own goal. A node optimizes its goal to reduce and overcome the risk of market environments.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a further study on Dai and Zhang’s (2008) <b>supply</b> <b>networks,</b> which are Cost Saver, Adapter, and Multiple Driven. This concept is centred on hub or focal firm {{which is the}} core of the <b>supply</b> <b>networks,</b> built on Miles and Snow’s (2003) strategic typology. In Cost Saver <b>supply</b> <b>network,</b> the hub firm is ‘Defender’; for Adapter <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> it is ‘Prospector’, while in Multiple Driven <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> it is ‘Analyser’. This study explores the interrelationship between the hub and supplier’s configuration and its effect on organisational performance. A comprehensive literature review is carried out with reference to supply chain (SC), <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> (SN) and <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> management (SNM). It stretches to describing Dai and Zhang’s (2008) novel <b>supply</b> <b>networks,</b> its association with Miles and Snow’s theory, the <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> configuration concept, and further expatiates on the need for appropriate supplier configuration for improved performances within the <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> The key performance indicators (KPI) adopted for this work, the variables considered in the simulation modelling were evaluated. Usable data were collected from a sample of 630 suppliers, and 15 hub firms. This is accompanied by Hypotheses testing, Case study and Simulation experiments to fulfil the aims and objectives of this research. From the findings of this study, it is confirmed that organisations can be grouped as either the Defender, Prospector, Analyser or Reactor type according to the Miles and Snow typology. The investigation identified that for Multiple Driven, Adapter and Cost Saver <b>supply</b> <b>networks,</b> performances are most improved with an increase in the existence of suppliers of the same typology with the hub organisation within the <b>supply</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R
40|$|A <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> is the {{combination}} of elements that starts with the procurement of raw materials from a supplier {{or a group of}} suppliers, and ends by delivering the finished product to the end consumer. Some of these elements can be called Knowledge-rich critical elements; because of the amount of knowledge presented and level of competency that a given element contains within the network. The core objective of <b>Supply</b> <b>Network</b> Management is to increase the market share and the performance of its <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> members while increasing the operational efficiency and profitability of the company.

40|$|Supply chain systems often face disruptions, {{which may}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the whole system. In this paper, we study {{robustness}} of supply chains from the perspective of complex network topologies. Using a military <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> as a case study, we propose taxonomy of <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> robustness metrics that reflect the heterogeneous roles (e. g. supply, demand) of entities in <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> We also design a novel hybrid <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> growth mechanism called DLA that combines degree-based and locality-based preferential attachment. Moreover, it can be tuned to provide balanced robustness against different disruption scenarios. Using agent-based simulations, we compare the robustness of several <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> topologies.

40|$|The "Networked Economy" {{describes}} alliances {{of firms}} that manage globally distributed <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> In {{the best of}} all worlds, this interactive flow of information among member firms will result in efficient and effective balance of supply and demand. Unfortunately, <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> suffer from poor and inexact information, and, in the worst case, information is unavailable where and when it is needed. Such entropy creates errors and limits responsiveness of processes leading to situations where there is {{too much or too little}} inventory at a given stage in a <b>supply</b> <b>network.</b> These complications are exacerbated across transnational <b>supply</b> chain <b>networks.</b> This paper offers theoretical perspectives, a case study, and outline of a research proposal to help address these challenges and develop insights into the best practices of transnational digital <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> High level questions include: What are the defining characteristics of high performing digital <b>supply</b> <b>networks?</b> How does information sharing impact the error and responsiveness of <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> processes and, consequently, <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> performance? How do international outsourcing practices affect network outcomes? These questions are theoretically examined and used to formulate specific hypotheses. An initial investigation of this theoretical formulation is conducted using a case study approach of a global plastics <b>supply</b> <b>network.</b> We propose a program of follow-up empirical work based on a broad field study of high performing <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> After a rigorous process for developing the instrumentation through semi-structured interviews, we expect to gather information about over 300 network configurations. As initial empirical evidence for going beyond dyadic exploration of <b>supply</b> <b>networks,</b> we present a case analysis of a plastic industry <b>supply</b> <b>network,</b> the Omnexus electronic trading network. In this analysis, we show how network externalities lead to more efficient flows of information and to more dynamic responses. The overall performance of all firms participating in this network should be enhanced over time. The major contribution of these ongoing studies will be new theoretical and empirical insights into the pathologies and metabolism of global digital <b>supply</b> <b>networks.</b> Specifically, we intend to delineate externalities of <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> that are not embraced by exclusively dyadic perspectives, as well as the salient factors that complicate the interaction of <b>supply</b> <b>network</b> behavior across national boundaries. We will develop, test and measure novel constructs such as networked organizational performance and error amplification, unveiling systematic knowledge about the relationships between these factors across socio-geographic regions.

However, most existent literatures in <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> do not pay much attention to the topological characteristics, which, as revealed by Complex Networks, have close relations with their behaviors in various complex systems. This paper introduces a novel topological structure evolving model of complex <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> from the perspective of Complex <b>Networks.</b> After investigating <b>supply</b> <b>networks</b> typical structural characteristics and formation mechanisms, Complex <b>Supply</b> <b>Networks</b> Evolving Model (CSNEM) are proposed to mimic these structural characteristics.
