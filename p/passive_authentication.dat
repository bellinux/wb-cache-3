5000|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>Authentication</b> (PA). PA {{is aimed}} at {{identifying}} modification of passport chip data. The chip contains a file (SOD) that stores hash values of all files stored in the chip (picture, fingerprint, etc.) and a digital signature of these hashes. The digital signature is made using a document signing key which itself is signed by a country signing key. If a file in the chip (e.g. the picture) is changed, this can be detected since the hash value is incorrect. Readers need access to all used public country keys to check whether the digital signature is generated by a trusted country. Using PA is mandatory. According to a September 2011 United States Central Intelligence Agency document released by Wikileaks in December 2014, [...] "Although falsified e-passports {{will not have the}} correct digital signature, inspectors may not detect the fraud if the passports are from countries that do not participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Public Key Directory (ICAO PKD). As of January 2017, 55 of over 60 e-passport-issuing countries belong to the PKD program.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>Authentication</b> (PA). In 2006 Lukas Grunwald {{demonstrated}} {{that it is}} trivial to copy passport data from a passport chip into a standard ISO/IEC 14443 smartcard using a standard contactless card interface and a simple file transfer tool. Grunwald used a passport that did not use Active Authentication (anti-cloning) and did not change the data held on the copied chip, thus keeping its cryptographic signature valid. In 2008 Jeroen van Beek {{demonstrated that}} not all passport inspection systems check the cryptographic signature of a passport chip. For his demonstration Van Beek altered chip information and signed it using his own document signing key of a non-existing country. This can only be detected by checking the country signing keys {{that are used to}} sign the document signing keys. To check country signing keys the ICAO PKD can be used. Only 5 out of 60+ countries are using this central database. Van Beek did not update the original passport chip: instead an ePassport emulator was used. Also in 2008, The Hacker's Choice implemented all attacks and published code to verify the results. The release included a video clip that demonstrated problems by using a forged Elvis Presley passport that is recognized as a valid US passport.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{cryptographic}} methods {{are applied to}} protect the security of digital data by using encryption keys. Without the correct key, illegal attackers cannot acquire the original data. However, encryption and decryption procedures are time-consuming processes, and they are thus not suitable for high-volume multimedia data [7], digital images, and videos. Image authentication [7, 8] {{is one of the}} techniques for protecting the content integrity of digital images from malicious and unauthorized modification. Image authentication technology can detect and indicate any changes or tampered regions in a tampered image. Image authentication schemes are classified into two categories: active authentication [8 – 18] and <b>passive</b> <b>authentication</b> [19 – 21] schemes. The active authentication scheme involves extracting particular features of the image beforehand and then concealing them within the image itself, whereas the <b>passive</b> <b>authentication</b> scheme entails authenticating images with no prior information requirement. The active image authentication approach is also called fragile watermarking [12], which involves hiding a watermark in an image. The hidden watermark is highly sensitive to any modifications in the image such that it becomes fragile and even unrecognizable when the image is modified. Hence, specific locations that have been illegally modified can easily be indicated using these broken areas.|$|E

Nonetheless, several studies have investi-gated the vulnerabilities a face biometrics system might face. Therefore, many researches are investigating the countermeasures to these spoof attempts. Unlike <b>passive</b> <b>authentication</b> methods that were profoundly studied, interaction was broadly examined as a potential robust spoofing prevention approach. In this paper, we present our collected dataset, propose an interactive authenti-cation method, evaluate and compare its robustness to the best known static anti-spoofing detection approach under realistic conditions.

40|$|The {{electronic}} passport (ePassport) {{is composed of}} a classical passport booklet and a passive contactless smartcard, where the chip and antenna are integrated in a page or cover. The technical specifications of ePassports are standardized by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation - {{a part of the}} UN) in the Standard number 9303 (currently in its 6 th edition). This document refers to many ISO standards. The communication with the ePassport is based on ISO 14443 (on the low communication level) and 7816 (on the higher communication level). The data stored in the ePassport are organised in 16 data groups (DG 1 -DG 16) and 2 - 3 metafiles (EF. COM, EF. SOD, EF. CVCA). The presentation will cover the following authentication aspects related to {{electronic passport}}s: -	ICAO Mandatory -	<b>Passive</b> <b>authentication</b> (authenticity of data) -	ICAO Optional -	Basic Access Control (limits remote readability) -	Active Authentication (authenticity of chip) -	European Extended Access Control -	Chip Authentication (authenticity of chip) -	Terminal Authentication (authorization to read biometric data) -	Holder Authentication -	Facial image, Fingerprint, Iris -	Signature Further on the presentation will give some indication on related standardization and on practical interoperability issues.

40|$|Abstract. Image {{splicing}} detection {{has been}} considered {{as one of the}} most challenging problems in <b>passive</b> image <b>authentication.</b> In this paper, we propose an automatic detection framework to identify a spliced image. Distinguishing from existing methods, the proposed system is based on a human visual system (HVS) model in which visual saliency and fixation are used to guide the feature extraction mechanism. An interesting and important insight of this work is that there is a high correlation between the splicing borders and the first few fixation points predicted by a visual attention model using edge sharpness as visual cues. We exploit this idea to develope a digital image splicing detection system with high performance. We present experimental results which show that the proposed system outperforms the prior arts. An additional advantage offered by the proposed system is that it provides a convenient way of localizing the splicing boundaries. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{artifacts}} by JPEG recompression {{have been}} demonstrated to be useful in <b>passive</b> image <b>authentication.</b> In this paper, {{we focus on the}} shifted double JPEG problem, aiming at identi-fying if a given JPEG image has ever been compressed twice with inconsistent block segmentation. We formulated the shifted double JPEG compression (SD-JPEG) as a noisy convolu-tive mixing model mostly studied in blind source separation (BSS). In noise free condition, the model can be solved by directly applying the independent component analysis (ICA) method with minor constraint to the contents of natural im-ages. In order to achieve robust identification in noisy condi-tion, the asymmetry of the independent value map (IVM) is exploited to obtain a normalized criteria of the independency. We generate a total of 13 features to fully represent the asym-metric characteristic of the independent value map and then feed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experi-ment results on a set of 1000 images, with various parameter settings, demonstrated the effectiveness of our method...|$|R
30|$|Some {{researchers}} have proposed digital watermarking as an image/video content authentication technique [1 – 3]. However, {{these kinds of}} ‘active authentication’ methods have not been widely used because most images on the Internet {{are not required to}} be watermarked. Moreover, there is also the challenge of how to guide against hostile attacks in watermark-based approaches. Recently, a variety of ‘passive authentication’ methods [4 – 7] have been proposed which perform image content authentication by detecting certain cues produced during creation and modification of the image, such as double compression, light abnormality, re-sampling, and photo response non-uniformity noise (PRNU). Compared with the active approach, the <b>passive</b> or blind <b>authentication</b> approach does not require additional watermarks or signatures and could have broader applications in image forensics.|$|R

Such facility generates easy installation of adhoc network and provides node mobility without loss of connection. In such facility packet dropping {{is a serious}} challenge for quality performance of adhoc network. Adhoc network suffered some security attack such attacks are black hole attack, malicious attack and worm hole attack that attack occurred a packet dropping problem in adhoc network. For the minimization of attack and packet droping various authors built various method such method is node <b>authentication,</b> <b>passive</b> feedback scheme, ack-based scheme, reputation based scheme and incentive based scheme, ack-based scheme suffered a problem of huge overhead due to extra Acknowledgment packet and also suffered decision ambiguity if the requested node refuse to send back Acknowledgment.

40|$|Abstract — The data {{security}} in cloud computing {{is the core}} problem. Single security method cannot solve the security problem in cloud computing. To advance cloud computing measures to ensure security is important. The solution is the data encryption. Before storing it at virtual location, encrypt the data with keys. User selects the public key to encrypt data and upload the encrypted data to the cloud. This Paper introduces a strong cryptography algorithm that provides {{the security of the}} data in cloud computing. The proposed algorithm is based on encryption algorithm the hill cipher which was analyzed to be easily breakable if the matrix is known due to its short key length and does not provide any message integrity. So there is the need to make it more typical for the intruder to break it. To make data secure we implement a new security system using the strong secured algorithm Dynamic Hill Cipher With Message Digest Concatenation which ensure message authentication, confidentiality and integrity of the data. Confidentiality provides protection of transmitted data from <b>passive</b> attacks. The <b>authentication</b> service assures that a communication is authentic. The data integrity is the assurance that data contain no modification...|$|R

Security {{analysis}} of PAS (Predicate-based Authentication Service) [...] 4. Security analysis of CHC (Convex Hull Click) [...] 5. Protocol construction 1 : Kangaroo Hopping [...] 6. Protocol construction 2 : Counting Edges [...] 7. Fixed-parameter intractable problems in human identification protocols [...] 8. Conclusion {{and future research}} directions. Human identification protocols are authentication protocols that enable a human using an insecure terminal to authenticate to a remote server. The goal of such protocols is to ensure secure authentication {{in the presence of}} an adversary who can not only view the user's inputs, and the internal computations and display of the terminal, but also eavesdrop on the communication link between the terminal and the server. An active adversary can in addition actively interfere with this communication link. However, protocols secure against active adversaries fall well short of usability. As a result, the focus of recent research has been on security against <b>passive</b> adversaries. Traditional <b>authentication</b> methods such as password-based authentication are not secure under this model, since the adversary can impersonate the user by learning the user's password after observing a single authentication session. [...] Since the introduction of the problem by Matsumoto and Imai in 1991, there have been sporadic attempts at constructing secure human identification protocols. However, to date there is no accepted solution, mainly because such protocols require mental computations from humans, and therefore the tradeoff between security and usability is huge. State-of-the-art protocols take between one to three minutes for authentication, but guarantee stronger security than traditional authentication methods. While this authentication time is not acceptable for most practical purposes, many interesting new mathematical problems and ideas have resulted in search for usable protocols. [...] This thesis aims to further the research in human identification protocols by focusing on the mathematical and analytical aspects of such protocols. We generalize some aspects of these protocols by analyzing their general structure. We give detailed security analysis of two protocols from literature, showing that without a thorough security analysis, these protocols are vulnerable to simple but innovative attacks. We also give the construction of two protocols with detailed security analysis and clearly defined design goals. Finally, we analyze the link between fixed-parameter intractability and human identification protocols. It is suggested that problems that are fixed-parameter intractable can be natural candidates for primitives in human identification protocols.
