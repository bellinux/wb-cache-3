In May 2012, the Clearfield Area School Board approved a new three-year contract with Clearfield Education Association that calls for a <b>pay</b> <b>freeze</b> in the first year and a 1.8 percent increase in years two and three.|$|E
50|$|Kiplinger also {{believes}} that the pain of difficult times should be broadly shared {{by all of the}} company’s stakeholders, starting first with owners and senior management (by trimming or eliminating dividends and executive bonuses), before resorting to <b>pay</b> <b>freezes</b> or layoffs of rank-and-file employees.

25|$|In May 2011, the {{administration}} and teachers agreed to a <b>pay</b> <b>freeze</b> for one year. It was to save the district over $579,000. The freeze {{was part of an}} effort to close a $3.7 million deficit in the proposed budget. In June 2011, the board adopted a $30.18 million budget. The board also eliminated the adult agriculture education program and furloughed the coordinator. They set a 4-day work schedule for the summer months, expecting to save $10,000 on utilities.|$|E

During the same year, {{as part of their}} plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile, which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year <b>pay</b> <b>freeze,</b> a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.|$|E
25|$|Remuneration for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong {{is among}} the highest in the world for a {{political}} leader, and second only to that of the Prime Minister of Singapore. The pay level took a cue from the handsome amounts paid to the city's colonial governors – worth $273,000 per annum plus perks in 1992 – and is 25 times more than that of Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. In 2005, then-CE CH Tung received some HK$3million ($378,500). From 2009 until the end of 2014, the salary for the job stood at HK$4.22million. In January 2015, CY Leung reversed a <b>pay</b> <b>freeze</b> imposed in 2012, resulting in its increase to HK$4.61million ($591,000).|$|E
50|$|In a study {{performed}} by Baron and Neuman, researchers found pay cuts and <b>pay</b> <b>freezes,</b> use of part-time employees, change in management, increased diversity, computer monitoring of employee performance, reengineering, and budget cuts were all significantly linked to increased workplace aggression.

50|$|Concern at {{exchequer}} deficits of over €20 billion, {{resulting from}} {{the collapse of the}} construction speculative bubble, dominated political discourse and over two decades of social corporatism was continuously questioned during 2009. Increasing unemployment—rising from 4% to 12% in two years—fuelled public questioning of pay rates in the public sector and its allied security of employment, compared with the <b>pay</b> <b>freezes</b> and increased redundancies experienced in the private sector.|$|R
50|$|Wales {{attracted}} {{controversy in}} 2010 by being awarded a 4% pay rise, taking his salary to £80,029, {{at a time}} when the government called for public-sector wage restraints and job losses and <b>pay</b> <b>freezes</b> at Newham council. Wales stated that he would be giving his pay rise to charity, however, his pay has increased 40% from £58,500 since 2002. Newham Council defended this pay increase stating that it reflected the responsibilities of his position.|$|R
25|$|Six {{months after}} the pension deal was reached, however, Governor Paterson {{announced}} he would seek to prevent PEF members from receiving their scheduled 4 percent salary increase and seek furloughs of state workers to help close yet another budget deficit. Paterson raised the issues of furloughs in mid-August, just two {{months after the}} pension deal was reached. PEF countered once again by arguing that the state spent $3 billion a year on 23,000 consultants at a cost that was 62 percent higher than hiring a permanent worker. On April 1, 2010, Paterson demanded that PEF forgo its scheduled wage hike, but PEF refused to do so. About a week later, Paterson withheld the pay increase unilaterally, leading to strong denunciations by the union. Two weeks later, Paterson announced he would seek to furlough half the state's workforce one day a week {{for the rest of the}} year in addition to the wage freeze, and the state legislature appeared ready to agree to the plan. PEF began a legislative lobbying effort, but the legislature approved the furloughs. PEF and other unions sued to overturn the <b>pay</b> <b>freeze</b> and furloughs, and a federal district court temporarily prevented the state from implementing the furlough plan on May 11, 2010. The court also ordered the state to restore the wage increase. The court made the injunction permanent about two weeks later.|$|E
500|$|On 9 December, in {{his final}} pre-Budget report before the 2010 general election, Chancellor Alastair Darling said that the {{recession}} had been deeper than predicted during the Budget in April, and that the government's programme of quantitative easing had made a [...] "real difference" [...] to families and businesses. He also announced measures to help economic recovery, including a public sector <b>pay</b> <b>freeze,</b> a levy on bank bonuses and a package of measures to help the unemployed. He said the country must choose [...] "between securing the recovery or wrecking it". Darling {{also said that the}} UK's total net debt would continue to rise until the financial year 2014–15. Borrowing would reach 56% of GDP in 2009–10 and peak at 78% in 2014–15; later than previously forecast and in line with other G7 economies.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reporting}} {{losses of}} €22million {{for the first}} half of the year, in October 2008, Aer Lingus announced a €74million cost saving plan. This was to involve up to 1,500 job cuts including the loss of cabin crew bases in Shannon and Heathrow. The plan included scaled back ground operations in Cork and Shannon Airports; outsourcing check-in, baggage handling, cargo and catering services in Dublin; reduction in transatlantic services and replacing staff with US-based cabin crew; and a <b>pay</b> <b>freeze</b> through the end of 2009. This met with a largely negative response particularly from trade unions. [...] These cutbacks have since been cancelled, and new cutbacks including lower pay and a change in working conditions for ground staff have been implemented.|$|E
40|$|Chapter 4 : The {{consequences}} of the crisis for public sector industrial relations Public sector employees in virtually all countries {{have been affected by}} the crisis as governments seek to reduce the size and scope of the public sector. Adjustments have included <b>pay</b> <b>freezes,</b> <b>pay</b> cuts and reductions in staffing levels, although countries generally seem to fall into two clusters — those that have been severely affected and have put into place austerity measures, and those that have been affected to a lesser extent.

30|$|When {{calculating the}} {{rigidity}} measure, we {{take account of}} the fact that the different numbers of pay days across years may result in some freezes being recorded as increases or decreases. In particular, we use the observed frequency of workers in small bins either side of − 1.9 % and + 1.9 % to impute the predicted frequency in the affected bin. The difference between the observed and predicted frequencies is added to the <b>pay</b> <b>freezes</b> in Table 1 when calculating the rigidity measure.|$|R
50|$|For the 2012-13 {{school year}} {{the board of}} Education is {{considering}} 30 alternatives {{to deal with a}} large budget shortfall. Cuts include eliminating full-day kindergarten, negotiating <b>pay</b> <b>freezes</b> with the professional and support staff, eliminating activity buses, eliminating driver's education and reducing the number of credits required to graduate. The district expects the retirement of 15 professional staff, seven support staff and two administrators for 2012-13 which would save an estimated $1 million. The elimination of 37 non-tenured teaching staff is also under consideration.|$|R

40|$|One {{argument}} against {{a policy to}} achieve absolute price stability is that workers resist pay cuts. We examine several Canadian microdata sources and corroborate earlier evidence of pay-cut resistance, particularly recently as inflation has approached zero. We then use data on industrial sectors to estimate that pay-cut resistance reduced employment growth by from 0. 6 to 1. 5 percent per annum from 1993 to 1995. We also estimate a model of wage settlements, treating <b>pay</b> <b>freezes</b> and <b>pay</b> cuts as censored data, which implies that pay-cut resistance may have increased the annual unemployment rate {{by as much as}} 2 percent during the same period. In view of these results, the case for very low inflation targets should be reexamined. ...|$|R
