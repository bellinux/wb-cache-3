40|$|Trapping by {{specific}} sex pheromones initiated in 2009 to monitor three pests, peach twig borer (Anarsia lineatella), oriental fruit moth (Cydia molesta) and <b>plum</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> (Grapholita funebrana) revealed the greater importance of peach twig borer {{in comparison to}} the others. The results of monitoring the development of larval stages over time and the accumulated degree-days from biofix show that the pest develops five generations per year, one of which undergoes a diapause. In 2009 and 2010 chemical control based on tolerance threshold of 10 males/trap/ 2 weeks showed unsatisfactory results. With this method, the percentage of affected fruits increased from 6. 8 % in 2009 to 18. 6 % in 2010 despite the application of four treatments of organophosphate-based insecticides in 2009 and the application of four treatments in 2010 using active ingredients from different chemical families (pyrethroid, organophosphate and chlorinicotinyl). On the other hand, management of the peach twig borer by the degree-days method tested and planned {{on the basis of a}} bifenthrin treatment between 150 to 204 degree-days accumulated from biofix, gave interesting results where the percentage of affected fruits hardly exceeded 0. 5 % over the four years of stud...|$|E

40|$|Pheromone traps were {{deployed}} in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County (Hungary) between 1982 and 1988, in 1990 and also between 1993 and 2013. These traps attracted 8 Microlepidoptera species: Phyllonorycter blancardella, P. corylifoliella, Anarsia lineatella, Eupoecilia ambiguella, Lobesia botrana, Grapholita funebrana, G. molesta and Cydia pomonella. We examined the trapping data {{of these species}} {{in the context of}} lunar phases and polarized moonlight. Catches of the European Vine Moth (Lobesia botrana) and the Codling Moth (Cydia pomonella) were higher in the First Quarter, whereas catches of Peach Twig Borer (Anarsia lineatella), Vine Moth (Eupoecilia ambiguella), <b>Plum</b> <b>Fruit</b> <b>Moth</b> (Grapholita funebrana) and Oriental Fruit Moth (Grapholita molesta) were larger in the Last Quarter. Catches of the other two species, the Spotted Tentiform Leafminer (Phyllonorycter blancardella) and Hawthorn Red Midget Moth (P. corylifoliella), were higher in both the First and Last Quarters. When using pheromone traps, insects do not fly to a light source, so moonlight does not modify either the catching distance or flight activity. However, at high levels of polarized moonlight, pheromone trap catches will increase, {{as in the case of}} light-trap catches. The results are comprehensible when one considers that the target species can fly both during the daytime and also at night...|$|E
40|$|The Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV), {{a member}} of the family Baculoviridae, is {{effectively}} used worldwide for controlling C. pomonella (codling moth) larvae in apple orchards. Although CpGV is known to be highly specific thus not affecting non-target organisms, a few studies have shown that CpGV can infect other Cydia spp. and species in the family Tortricidae, in particular if viral dosages are substantially increased. The <b>plum</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Cydia funebrana is regarded as one of the key pests of plum in Europe, with biological control being severely hold back mainly due to a lack of available and efficient control agents. To test if infection of plum moth larvae by CpGV is in principal possible, viral suspensions of different CpGV isolates were sprayed at a concentration of 107 occlusion bodies/ml on mature plums in the laboratory. Sterile water was used as a control. Freshly hatched C. funebrana larvae were allowed to feed and to bore into these fruits and were assessed for mortality within a period of 3 - 14 days. A substantial number of dead and liquefied larvae were present in the virus treatments and absent in the control. Presence of CpGV in the cadavers was confirmed with CpGV specific primers in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and subsequent sequence analysis of obtained PCR products. This result opens up new possibilities for C. funebrana control in organic plum production...|$|E
40|$|The {{codling moth}} (Cydia pomonella L.) is a {{problematic}} pest across the world, {{as well as}} in the eastern parts of Norway. The adult emerges in mid to late spring, after having overwintered as a fifth instar larvae, and the females begin to lay eggs a few days after. The larva damages crops in apple orchards by digging into the fruit and eating the seeds. In pest management it is critical to target the larvae before it can enter the fruit. Two forecasting models are used to find the oviposition and hatching timing in Norway: the traditional model and RIMpro-Cydia. The <b>plum</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> (C. funebrana) is a smaller relative of the codling moth, and has been reported to have a similar phenology, but has no warning system in place for alerting growers. The aim of this study was to test how good these two models are for forecasting attacks of Cydia pomonella in Norwegian apple orchards, in order to improve pest management for growers. Fieldwork was conducted in apple orchards in eastern Norway. The flight period was monitored using sex pheromone baited delta traps, placed in each of the orchards. Larvae feeding inside of apples were collected, and measurements of the width of their head capsules were used to estimate the time of oviposition and hatching, and compared with the output from the traditional model and RIMpro. Damage from codling moth larvae was recorded at harvest to examine the relationship with pheromone trap catches. The flight period of C. funebrana was also monitored, in order to compare with the flight period of codling moth, from both pheromone traps and the forecast from RIMpro. RIMpro was found to give a good simulation of the codling moth flight period, given that the delay between male and female emergence is taken into account and that the orchard has a large population of codling moth. When compared to estimations made from collected larvae, the traditional model and RIMpro appear to be equally competent at forecasting the start of oviposition, while which model best predicted the start of hatching varied with orchard. A moderate correlation was found between codling moth catches and the damage found at harvest, but because of the low percentage of damage found, this might not be reliable. Comparing trap data of C. funebrana with trap data of C. pomonella and the RIMpro simulation shows the two species have similar flight activity in the first month after adult emergence...|$|E

40|$|Infection of non-wounded {{and freshly}} wounded {{detached}} <b>plum</b> <b>fruit</b> by airborne Monilinia laxa conidia on dry, humid and wet <b>plum</b> <b>fruit</b> surfaces, and by conidia and germlings {{that had been}} established on fruits under these wetness regimes, was investigated. <b>Plum</b> <b>fruit</b> (cv. Laetitia) were dusted with dry conidia in a settling tower at pit hardening, 2 weeks before harvest, at harvest and after 28 days cold storage. Non-wounded immature and mature fruit remained mostly asymptomatic, whereas non-wounded cold-stored fruit decayed readily. Wounding drastically increased infection by airborne conidia. Immature fruits were less susceptible to wound infection by airborne conidia than mature fruits. Conidia that were dispersed freshly were more successful in infecting fresh wounds than conidia that were deposited, or germlings that established, on fruits 4 days prior to wounding. This decrease in infectivity was especially pronounced on humid-incubated fruit and on wet-incubated fruit. This study clearly showed {{that in order to}} reduce the incidence of brown rot, inoculum levels on fruit approaching maturity should be reduced by sanitary practices and fungicides.
