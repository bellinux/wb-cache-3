5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{can be used}} to generate tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive <b>profile</b> <b>and</b> breathing gas mixtures. The usual procedure is to generate schedules for the intended <b>profile</b> <b>and</b> for the most likely contingency profiles, such as slightly greater depth, delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E

This paper has implemented a method to recover the pulse <b>profiles</b> <b>and</b> the PPA curves of five pulsars which have obvious scattered pulse profiles at lower frequency. It reports a simulation to show the scattering and descattering of pulse <b>profiles</b> <b>and</b> PPA curves. As a practical application, lower-frequency <b>profiles</b> <b>and</b> PPA curves of PSR 1356 - 60, PSR 1831 - 03, PSR 1838 + 04, PSR 1859 + 03, PSR 1946 + 35 are obtained.

However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E

Another new work was Tippett's Byzantium, an orchestral song-cycle, premiered by Solti and the orchestra with the soprano Faye Robinson.

In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E

5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing <b>profile</b> <b>and</b> positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
