When Sam Warner decided to make The Jazz Singer a musical with the Vitaphone, he knew that Jolson was the star he needed to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b> He told Jessel {{that he would have}} to sing in the movie, and Jessel balked, allowing Warner to replace him with Jolson. Jessel never got over it and often said that Warner gave the role to Jolson because he agreed to help finance the film.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{found the}} film's length to be [...] "somewhat overlong" [...] and lacking [...] "the snap and concision {{that would have}} <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> the top as a bang-up entertainment, but it's closer in spirit to a vintage Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power swashbuckler than {{anything}} that's come out of Hollywood in quite some time." [...] In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers criticized the casting choices for the Mexican roles, which included Banderas, a Spaniard, as well as Hopkins and Zeta-Jones, who are both Welsh. Disappointed with the film's entertainment value, Travers also expected the film to be a failure with audiences. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli compared the tone and style of The Mask of Zorro to producer Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. [...] "While The Mask of Zorro isn't on the same level, it's not an altogether ridiculous comparison. Even though Zorro doesn't feature the non-stop cliffhanger adventure of Raiders," [...] Berardinelli continued, [...] "there's still plenty of action, tumult, and derring-do." [...] He was undecided whether the film would be a box office success, {{and that it would}} depend on the on-screen chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones. In one of the film's most popular scenes, Alejandro renders El√©na topless with a flurry of sword slashes. One critic placed it on his list of [...] "Erotic [...] Scenes in the 90s".|$|E

50|$|Early World War I gases were unreliable, as {{they could}} easily be blown back on the troops that {{deployed}} them. There were three main agents used: mustard gas, chlorine, and phosgene.
