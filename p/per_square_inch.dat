5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand pounds <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E

5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board.

5|$|An Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to allow a}} wrought iron {{suspension}} bridge to be built instead of stone, and tolls levied to recoup the cost. A company was formed and funds raised {{during the first few}} months of 1830, but the money raised was not sufficient for the construction. Despite this, the act received Royal Assent in May 1830. Brunel produced a new proposal costing £10,000 less than Telford's design and gained support for it in the local press. James Meadows Rendel, William Armstrong and William Hill also submitted new, cheaper proposals, complaining that the committee had not set a budget. In 1831 a second competition was held, with new judges including Davies Gilbert and John Seaward examining the engineering qualities of the proposals. Thirteen designs were submitted; Telford's was the only one in which the chains achieved the weight <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> required by the judges but it was rejected as being too expensive. The winner was declared to be a design by Smith and Hawkes of the Eagle Foundry in Birmingham. Brunel had a personal meeting with Gilbert and persuaded him to change the decision. The committee then declared Brunel the winner and he was awarded a contract as project engineer. The winning design was for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers. In 2010, newly discovered letters and documents revealed that, in producing his design, Brunel had taken advice from his father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The elder Brunel had recommended including a central support for the bridge, as he did not believe a single-span bridge of such length could be constructed. His son chose to ignore his advice.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the flameholding capabilities of aerodynamic jets at afterburner operating conditions. Stability data {{for a number of}} aerodynamic flameholders were obtained in a 5 - by 5 -inch test section at inlet-air reference velocities up to 600 feet per second, an inlet-air temperature of 1250 F, and a combustor-inlet pressure of 15 inches of mercury absolute. Combustion efficiency and stability data of the more promising combinations were then obtained in a 10 - by 12 -inch test section at the same test conditions. Both air and stoichiometric mixtures of fuel and air were used in the jets; mixture flow rates were approximately 1 percent by weight of the total air-flow rate. Injection pressures were limited to values that might be available from compressor-bleed air. At a reference velocity of 600 feet per second, aerodynamic flame-holders alone were unable to maintain a stable flame at injection pressures up to 70 pounds <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>inches</b> large reductions in velocity were required to achieve flame stabilization. When the aerodynamic jets were used in combination with a V-gutter flameholder with approximately a 30 percent blocked area, flame stabilization was attained at a velocity of 600 feet per second; however, the combustion efficiencies of the various combinations were no greater than that obtained with the V-gutter alone...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} ectoparasitic infestation of cattle {{in and around the}} Bhawal forest area in Gazipur district in Bangladesh, an epidemiological investigation was carried out during the period from November 2008 to October 2009. Of 206 cattle examined, 132 (64. 07 %) were found to be infested with several species of ticks and lice. The prevalence rate was highest in case of Boophilus microplus (45. 63 %) followed by Rhipicephalus sanguineus (36. 89 %), Linognathus vituli ((23. 30 %), Haematopinus euysternus (17. 96 %), Hemaphysalis bispinosa (16. 50 %), and Damalinia bovis (8. 25 %). Results revealed that, older cattle aged> 8 years are more (71. 11 %) susceptible than that of adults aged> 2 - 8 years (67. 74 %), and young aged ≤ 2 years (47. 05 %). In females, prevalence of ectoparasitic infestation was observed significantly (p< 0. 005) higher than that of male. Prevalence of ectoparasitic infestation was significantly (p< 0. 005) higher in animal reared under free range system than that of semi-intensive system and cattle with malnourished and poor health status were found to be significantly more vulnerable to such parasitic infestation than normal healthy cattle. Seasonal prevalence showed that, significantly (p< 0. 001) higher prevalence occurred in summer season (78. 46 %), followed by winter (62. 85 %) and rainy season (52. 11 %).
