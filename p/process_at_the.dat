5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the criticality of the initial ascent phase. Bubbles associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site. There is a growth <b>process</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the ascent that may last for several cycles until the bubbles have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level. It is postulated that the production of a shower of small arterial bubbles during the first minutes of the initial ascent is a precursor for DCS symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Both {{strontium}} and strontianite {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian <b>process).</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass.

Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the <b>process.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E

5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous <b>process</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|The {{centrifuge}} process {{was regarded as}} the only promising separation method in April 1942.

5|$|The skull looks delicate. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrow and}} hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is smooth; both lack conspicuously {{developed}} ridges and shelves. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are poorly developed. The incisive foramina (openings {{in the front}} part of the palate) are short and narrow. The bony palate ends {{at the level of}} the back of the third upper molars. The alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone at the back of the skull separating two foramina, or openings) is absent. The strut is present in most Eliurus, but absent in some specimens of E.grandidieri. The subsquamosal fenestrae (openings in the squamosal bone) are fairly large. The auditory bullae are small. The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange. The root of the lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular <b>process</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the mandible (lower jaw), a feature shared only with E.grandidieri among species of Eliurus.|$|E

5|$|The upper incisors have orange enamel and are opisthodont, {{with the}} cutting edge of the tooth {{inclined}} backwards. The root of the lower incisors extends though the mandible (lower jaw) to a low capsular <b>process</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the jawbone. The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear distinct cusps. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots. The molars are quite similar to those of Macrotarsomys, and differ only in minor details.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a <b>process</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Rainier's main {{priorities}} {{remained the}} protection of trade, but his command came under increasing interference from London, in particular the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas. Dundas was insistent throughout 1799 and 1800 that the priority for Rainier should be the invasion and capture of Java, thus eliminating the Dutch East Indies entirely. Contradictory orders came from Lord Mornington, who was instructing Rainier to plan an invasion of Île de France, while Rainier himself wished to resurrect the abandoned operation against Manila. So confused was the command structure that in September 1800 Rainier threatened to resign, but in October 1800 a renewed threat from Egypt redirected the focus of his squadron to the Red Sea and {{only a handful of}} minor operations against Dutch posts on Java were carried out by a small force under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball, capturing a few merchant ships but losing more than 200 men to disease in the <b>process.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope, a gale on 5 December 1799 caused severe damage to shipping in Table Bay: among the wrecks were HMS Sceptre with 290 crew, the Danish ship of the line Oldenburg and several large American merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Some historians, such as Chandler and Weller, {{assert that}} the British heavy cavalry were {{destroyed}} as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Barbero states that the Scots Grey were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses. Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts, describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge. The heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable services. They countercharged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades), halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only), were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades). This service was rendered {{at a very high}} cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades. At 6 o'clock in the afternoon the whole Union Brigade could field only 3 squadrons, though these countercharged French cavalry, losing half their number in the <b>process.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the fighting the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster one squadron.|$|E
