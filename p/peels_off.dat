5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot of an {{airplane}} flying surrounded by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with blond hair dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight man {{to the bathroom and}} seduces him. She <b>peels</b> <b>off</b> the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped {{into the back of a}} Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) <b>peels</b> <b>off</b> in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E
5|$|A {{recently}} built sabha-mandapa (assembly-hall) has idols of god Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi. It {{leads to}} central hall {{built by the}} Patwardhan Rulers of Kurundwad. The ceiling of this hall is formed from a single stone. The garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) has a central image of Ganesha as Mayureshwar or Moreshwar, facing the North. The Ganesha image is depicted in a seated posture with its trunk turning to the left, four arms and three eyes. He holds a noose (pasha) and elephant goad (ankusha) in his upper hands, while his lower right rests on his knee {{and the other one}} holds a modaka (a sweet). The navel and the eyes are embedded with diamonds. A cobra hood raised over Ganesha's head, shelters the Lord. The image is actually smaller than it looks as it is smeared with a thick level of saffron-coloured Sindoor (vermillion), which <b>peels</b> <b>off</b> once every century. It last fell off in 1882, and prior to that in 1788. Ganesha is flanked by idols of his consorts Riddhi and Siddhi sometimes called Siddhi and Buddhi. These idols are made of an alloy of five metals or of brass. The deities are covered with crafted silver and gold. Like all Ashtavinayaka shrines, the central Ganesha image is believed to be svayambhu (self-existent), naturally occurring {{in the form of an}} elephant-faced stone. In front of the central image, the vahanas of Ganesha – the mouse and the peacock are placed. To the left outside the garbhagriha is an image of Nagna-Bhairava.|$|E
30|$|Adhesion {{test was}} {{performed}} on the films as per ASTM-B 905 standard after bending. The scotch tape <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> test was conducted on the deposited thin film on the PI substrate via spray pyrolysis, using transparent adhesive tape. The tape was adhered to the ITO deposited PI film and was <b>peeled</b> <b>off</b> from it. The SEM micrographs of the samples were collected before and after the <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> test. No significant change in the surface morphology of the deposited film was observed after the <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> test which suggests that the bonding was fairly strong. These results can be explained {{on the basis of the}} van der Waal’s interaction between the metal oxide film and the PI substrate [41].|$|R

25|$|Symptoms {{of toxic}} shock {{syndrome}} {{vary depending on}} the underlying cause. TSS resulting from infection with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus typically manifests in otherwise healthy individuals via signs and symptoms including high fever, accompanied by low blood pressure, malaise and confusion, which can rapidly progress to stupor, coma, and multiple organ failure. The characteristic rash, often seen early in the course of illness, resembles a sunburn, and can involve any region of the body including the lips, mouth, eyes, palms and soles. In patients who survive the initial phase of the infection, the rash desquamates, or <b>peels</b> <b>off,</b> after 10–14 days.|$|E

25|$|In {{hopes of}} {{stealing}} a victory, Amber Holland opts {{to utilize the}} four rock rule, by having lead Heather Kalenchuk place a high centre line guard on her first rock. Jones responds by having lead Dawn Askin throw a rock in the rings to have the possible winning point. Holland calls for Kalenchuk to throw a tight guard to utilize the four rock rule once again, but she is heavy and it lands in the 12ft, in front of Askin's rock. This gives Canada the permission to remove it, which Jones asks Askin to do. However, Askin flashes her stone, missing everything entirely. Tammy Schneider then places a tight guard for Saskatchewan. At this point, Canada can start removing guards, and Jill Officer can now remove the high guard, which she <b>peels</b> <b>off.</b> Tammy Schneider then replaces it, and it is once again removed by Officer. Kim Schneider then puts up another high centre line guard, but it is removed Kaitlyn Lawes. Kim Schneider on her second rock comes a bit heavy, ending up as a halfway guard. Jones opts to have Lawes remove it as well. At this point, Amber Holland decides to make her move by coming around the tight guard placed by Tammy Schneider. Her rock has good weight, {{but it is too}} far outside, and the entire rock is visible for Jennifer Jones to remove, and even roll in for shot. Jones does remove the stone, but instead rolls out to the 12ft. On her final stone, Holland makes a perfect come around, landing on the button. This leaves Jones with a double run back on to it for the win. Jones almost makes the shot, but the Canada rock rolls further than the Saskatchewan rock, giving the title to Saskatchewan {{for the first time since}} 1997.|$|E

At first, {{everyone}} thinks Bob has escaped prison, but Walt's short feet (which was also used as a clue in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] to clear Krusty's name for robbing the Kwik-E-Mart) reveal his true identity. Walt explains that he and Bob were cellmates and, prior to Walt's release, Bob drugged him and performed a transplant to switch their faces. The transplant left Walt unable to talk properly, and his garbled speech led the guards {{to put him in}} the padded cell. He wrote his message on the wall as a warning, but it was misinterpreted as a threat. Walt and the Simpsons immediately go after Bob, knowing that Bart's life is in danger. Meanwhile, a waitress at a roadside diner becomes infatuated with Bob-as-Walt until Bob's new face <b>peels</b> <b>off.</b> Amidst a distraction outside the diner, Homer, Marge, and Lisa travel to Mexico in search of Bart while Walt gets away and continues to the Five Corners to save Bart.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{those of}} some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.quadrifidum are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in {{response}} to changes in humidity. Generally, the rays are broad, but they may seem narrow as their edges are often rolled inwards. The width of the exoperidium (when still attached to the mycelial cup) is , when fully expanded about [...] The pseudoparenchymatous layer when fresh is about 1–2mm thick, initially whitish, later turning beige to brownish (sometimes over reddish tints), and dark brown when old. In newly expanded specimens this layer {{is covered with a}} thin layer of crystals and hyphae, sometimes forming a pseudoparenchymatous cup or collar that often <b>peels</b> <b>off</b> in patches, when dry shrunken and hard. The fibrous layer is papery to leathery. The inner side, when free from pseudoparenchymatous remnants, is almost white, in age becoming dirty grayish-white and sometimes greenish due to algae; the outer side is initially whitish, somewhat glossy, but in age becomes grayish-white and dull. The mycelial layer has a whitish inner side and is strongly attached to the litter on its outer side. It persists for a long time (1–2-year-old fruit bodies with intact mycelial cups have been found).|$|E
2500|$|The {{commercialization of}} amate paper has had {{negative}} environmental effects. In pre-Hispanic times, bark was taken {{only from the}} branches of adult trees, allowing for regeneration. Ficus trees should be optimally no younger than 25 years old before cutting. At that age the bark almost <b>peels</b> <b>off</b> by itself and does less damage to the tree. Other trees such as mulberry {{do not have to}} mature as much. [...] The pressure to provide large quantities of bark means that it is taken from younger trees as well. This is negatively affecting the ecosystem of northern Puebla and forcing harvesters to take bark from other species as well as from a wider range, moving into areas such as Tlaxco.|$|E

2500|$|The first 16 {{episodes of}} the fifth series begin with Peel {{receiving}} a call-to-duty message from Steed: [...] "Mrs Peel, we're needed." [...] Peel was conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). The messages were delivered by Steed in increasingly bizarre ways as the series progressed: in a newspaper Peel had just bought, or on traffic lights while she was out driving. On one occasion Steed appeared on her television set, interrupting an old science-fiction movie (actually clips from the series four episode [...] "The Cybernauts") to call her to work. Another way Steed contacted her was {{in the beginning of}} episode 13, [...] "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station" [...] when she enters her flat and sees a Meccano Percy the Small Engine going around a circular track with a note on one of the train cars that says [...] "Mrs. Peel" [...] in bold letters, she then walks over to Steed who says, [...] "You're needed." [...] At the start of [...] "The Hidden Tiger" [...] Peel is redecorating her apartment (wearing a jumpsuit and drinking champagne); she <b>peels</b> <b>off</b> a strip of wallpaper, revealing the words [...] "Mrs Peel" [...] painted on the wall beneath. She turns to see Steed in the apartment removing another strip of wallpaper, revealing [...] "We're needed" [...] painted underneath on another wall. In another instance Emma enters Steed's flat to find he has just fallen down the stairs, and he painfully gasps, [...] "Mrs Peel, you're needed." [...] Often the episode's tag scene returned to the situation of the [...] "Mrs Peel, we're needed" [...] scene. [...] "The Hidden Tiger" [...] returns to the partially redecorated apartment where Steed begins painting a love heart and arrow and the initials of two people on the wall, but paints over the initials when Peel sees his graffito.
