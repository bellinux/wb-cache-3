5|$|With costs {{much higher}} than anticipated, work ceased in June 1811. After much deliberation, {{it was decided to}} {{continue}} construction, and to obtain a third Act of Parliament to authorise increased charges for carriage of goods. By 1812, progress was being made, but was hampered by the need for rock cuttings at Holcombe Rogus. Leakage also meant that some sections needed to be lined with <b>puddle</b> <b>clay.</b> Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials, which can still be seen beside the canal, close to the Waytown Tunnel. Fenacre Bridge and Fossend Bridge were constructed at Burlescombe, where culverts were also needed to manage the streams. At a total cost of £244,505, the canal was opened on 25 August 1814, when the first boat travelled from Lowdwells to Tiverton, laden with coal.|$|E
25|$|Timber coffer dams were constructed; {{they were}} 76ft 6in by 29ft with two skins, {{the space between}} being filled with <b>puddle</b> <b>clay.</b> James Nasmyth had a novel design of steam pile driver; it had first been used in Devonport Docks in 1845; it could deliver 60 to 70 blows a minute; the cycle time with the hand {{operated}} pile drivers formerly in use was four minutes. The drop weight was 1½ tons and its stroke was 2ft 9in; one was purchased from Nasmyth.|$|E
25|$|Leakage was {{affected}} by springs breaking through the clay lining of the canal bed. In summer when the springs receded, water was lost through these holes at a rate greater than the available supply. In one of the attempts to rectify this problem, {{the size of the}} locks was reduced which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance. In a further attempt to prevent water loss, at King's Reach, the section immediately east of Sapperton Tunnel, the canal was lined with concrete rather than <b>puddle</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cob {{material}} is known by many names including adobe, lump <b>clay,</b> <b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> chalk mud, wichert, clay daubins, swish (Asante Twi), torchis (French), bauge (French), bousille (French mud with moss), and cat and clay.|$|R
50|$|In soils which lack natural clay, {{additional}} {{water loss}} to drainage and permeation is prevented by a liner. Pond liners are PVC or EPDM foils that are placed between {{the soil of}} the pond bed and the water. Liners can also be made from <b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> and ponds on free-draining soils can even be self-sealing with fine sediments washed into the pond.|$|R
50|$|The {{excavated}} {{sides were}} almost perpendicular. To form the inverted arch or U-shape and prevent water permeating, the sides were constructed of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> lined with concrete mixed with rubble then altars (steps {{in the dry}} dock wall) of Lockyer Creek freestone. The 1887 excavation to extend the dock required only limited lining and the base was not concreted until 1901.|$|R
500|$|As the {{population}} of Sheffield increased, Sheffield Corporation bought [...] of land at Blackburn Meadows, {{on which to build}} a sewage treatment works. In August 1884, William Bissett and Son won the contract for its construction, which was overseen by Thomas West, who acted as Clerk of Works. [...] of standard gauge railway track connected the limeshed to a junction with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Bissetts had completed their work by January 1886, and although £2,462 had been spent on extras, their final bill came to £23,933, which was £27 cheaper than the original contract value. Savings were made by using concrete for the foundations and bottoms of tanks, rather than brick and <b>puddle</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Crosley {{reduced the}} number of {{reservoirs}} from five to two, and these were built at Bosley and Sutton. According to the Courier, the overall length of the canal had been reduced by some [...] as a result of [...] "the skillful management of Mr Crosley". There were problems with the Trent and Mersey length, with water seeping up and dislodging the <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> which made the canal watertight. This was eventually overcome by covering a short section with stone, to hold the clay in position. The committee made another inspection in June 1829, when good progress was reported on most fronts, although there were issues with the embankments at Bollington and Dane-in-Shaw, and with the aqueduct which carried the canal over the River Dane at Bosley. In the autumn of 1829, Telford also inspected the works. He highlighted a few minor problems, but was generally impressed by the quality of the workmanship. The annual meeting for 1830 was delayed, as King George IV had died, and his funeral was held on the day the meeting was scheduled. The aqueduct over the River Dane was completed on 23 October 1830, and contained [...] of stone, with the main semi-circular arch spanning [...]|$|E

50|$|John Warner, {{brother of}} Patrick Warner of Ardeer {{supervised}} the construction. As developed by James Brindley and practiced elsewhere later, <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> {{was used to}} seal the canal; it brought in with difficulty by cart and took four months to build and cost the Stevenston Coal Company £4857/4s. The transport of coal along it cost 3d per ton and the transfer from barge to cart to boat cost a further 8d per ton.|$|R
500|$|The dam extends [...] {{below ground}} to the solid rock {{underlying}} the valley. It was built of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> with a central concrete core and faced with granite on the lake side. A [...] diameter pipe through the dam leads to the pumping station while a larger one is used to remove silt collecting against the dam. A flow of water is maintained in the River Yeo through a compensation channel and an overflow weir and spillway take flood water downstream.|$|R
50|$|At the {{geographical}} centre of Acton lies Acton Park, {{the location of}} the former Acton Hall. The central feature of the park is the lake. It was originally constructed using <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> in the 18th century but during the 1970s, the pond was drained and butyl lined. Fishing is popular on the lake with platforms provided for anglers. (The lake is closed for fishing during the Wildfowl nesting period). A wetland area exists and supports a diverse range of wildlife.|$|R

50|$|The name Barra da Tijuca can {{be roughly}} {{translated}} as 'Swamp Sandbank'. Barra means port entrance or sandbank, and Tijuca {{is a word}} originally from the Tupi ty-yúc and means putrid water, mud, swamp, <b>puddle,</b> <b>clay</b> or clay-pit.|$|E
50|$|The dam extends 175 ft {{below ground}} to the solid rock {{underlying}} the valley. It was built of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> with a central concrete core and faced with granite on the lake side.

A flow of water is maintained in the River Yeo through a compensation channel and an overflow weir and spillway take flood water downstream.|$|R
50|$|Poured and <b>puddled</b> adobe (<b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> piled earth) today called cob, is made {{by placing}} soft adobe in layers, rather than making by {{individual}} dried bricks or using a form. Puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand based material worked into a dense, plastic state. These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and then later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.|$|R
50|$|They {{are usually}} shallow, saucer-shaped and lined with <b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> chalk or marl on an {{insulating}} straw layer over a bottom layer of chalk or lime. To deter earthworms from their natural tendency of burrowing upwards, {{which in a}} short while would make the clay lining porous, a layer of soot would be incorporated or lime mixed with the clay. The clay is usually covered with straw to prevent cracking by the sun and a final layer of chalk rubble or broken stone to protect the lining from the hoofs of sheep or cattle.|$|R
5000|$|Puddling is {{both the}} {{material}} {{and the process of}} lining a water body such as a channel or pond with <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> (puddle, puddling) - a watertight (low hydraulic conductivity) material based on clay and water mixed to be workable, ...|$|E
50|$|Brindley's {{technique}} minimised {{the amount}} of earth moving by developing the principle of contouring. He preferred to use a circuitous route that avoided embankments, and tunnels rather than cuttings. Though this recognised the primitive methods of earth-moving available at the time, it meant that his canals were often much longer than a more adventurous approach would have produced. But his greatest contribution was the technique of puddling clay to produce a watertight clay-based material, and its use in lining canals. <b>Puddle</b> <b>clay</b> was used extensively in UK canal construction in the period starting shortly after his death. Starting about 1840 <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> was used more widely as the water-retaining element (or core) within earthfill dams, particularly in the Pennines.|$|E
50|$|The idea of damming the Ord {{was first}} {{mentioned}} over 100 years ago, when the Western Australia Commissioner of Tropical Agriculture, Adrian Despeissis, suggested, Substantial wooden dams constructed on a double row of jarrah piles {{driven into the}} bed of the river, with a core wall of <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> between, would appear to form suitable weirs.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} occupies 350 acre {{and holds}} 3,493 million imperial gallons (15,880,000 m3). Its maximum height above the {{original ground level}} is 56 ft. Like the other Lower Thames reservoirs, it is of traditional earthen dam construction, with a <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> core supported by ballast embankments built from materials excavated on site. It is entirely man-made, as the area had no natural topographical features that could be dammed off to create a reservoir. To make inspecting {{the integrity of the}} reservoir easier, Thames Water maintains a commercial flock of sheep on the reservoir banks to keep the grass on the reservoir banks close-cropped.|$|R
5000|$|From the 30 January 1867 until 5 November {{that year}} hourly checks were made {{until it was}} deemed safe to reopen the pit. Tomlinson {{describes}} a visit he made to the pithead during this time: [...] One shaft was filled up - chokeful of earth and rubbish the other had a wooden scaffold suspended by wire ropes, and let down about twenty yards. Upon this cage was first piled straw, &c., and then <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> so that, except a small aperture from a temporary iron pipe (which contains a valve to close or open the orifice at will), this shaft, also, was sealed up.|$|R
60|$|After lunch Jim {{crossed the}} marsh with Jake and stopped where a ridge of higher ground broke {{off at the}} edge of a muddy creek. In the corner, partly {{sheltered}} by a bank of gorse, stood a small white house with a roof of rusty iron where the thatch had been. The whitewash had fallen off in places, exposing a rough, granulated wall, for the house was a dabbin, built of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b> A window was broken and the door hung crookedly. Except for a few rows of withered potatoes, the garden was occupied by weeds. Three or four shellducks, hatched from wild birds' eggs, paddled about the creek.|$|R
50|$|It is 445 ft long, {{with four}} arches of 50 ft span, and 62 ft {{high above the}} surface of the river. According to {{measurements}} by John Rennie as the canal was nearing completion, there was around 3 ft of <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> {{at the bottom of the}} canal. The aqueduct was designed to carry a depth of 8 ft of water.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was formed}} by {{the construction of a}} continuous embankment on the floodplain of the River Lea at Chingford. An earth embankment divides the reservoir into two compartments that are connected by three large diameter culverts. The external grassed embankment consists of a central <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core with shoulder filling comprising a mixture of river terraced gravels and alluvial deposits.|$|E
50|$|By 1812, {{progress}} {{was being made}} {{with the construction of}} the Grand Western Canal, but it was hampered by rock cuttings at Holcombe Rogus, from which springs of water gushed, and there was a need to line some sections with <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> to prevent leakage. Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials, which can still be seen beside the canal, close to the Waytown Tunnel.|$|E
60|$|A dairy {{was first}} to be made. This was {{partially}} {{cut out of the}} side of the slope, and lined with sun-baked bricks. Against the walls, which projected above the ground, earth was piled, to make them of a very considerable thickness. Strong beams were placed across the roof; over these rafters was nailed felt, whitewashed upon both sides to keep out insects. Upon this was placed a considerable thickness of rushes, and, over all, <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> was spread a foot deep. Ventilation was given by a wide chimney rising behind it, and light entered by two windows in front. The whole of the interior was whitewashed.|$|R
50|$|Close to Milefortlet 21 are {{the remains}} of the Elizabethan salt pans. It is thought that they were begun around 1630 and leased to Richard Barwise in 1634. On the beach was a water tank on a wooden scaffold, whose {{footings}} remain, from which sea water ran onto the Sleech in the Kinch. Sleech is the sand from the beach; the Kinch where it was piled up is the large pond, sealed by <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b> The remains of these salt pans can be clearly seen to date. The strong brine from the Kinch trickled down to the south. The brine was then boiled in iron pans to produce salt, which crystallised out of the brine.|$|R
60|$|To be sure, the {{primitive}} savage, unversed {{as he was}} in pastes and glazes, in moulds and ornaments, did not pass his life entirely devoid of cups and platters. Coconut shell and calabash rind, horn of ox and skull of enemy, bamboo-joint and capacious rhomb-shell, all alike, no doubt, supplied him with congenial implements for drink or storage. Like Eve in the Miltonic Paradise, there lacked him not fit vessels pure; picking some luscious tropical fruit, the savoury pulp he chewed, and in the rind still as he thirsted scooped the brimming stream. This was satisfactory as far as it went, of course, but it was not pottery. He couldn't boil his joint for dinner in coco-nut or skull; he had to do it with stone pot-boilers, in a rude kettle of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|R
50|$|The reservoir's dam was {{completed}} in 1904. It is an earth fill embankment dam, 22.5 m high, which required some 500,000 LT of earth to build. There is a vertical <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core supported by zoned earth fill shoulders. The higher part of the upstream shoulder is faced in dry rubble pitching about 60 centimetres (2 ft) thick. The crest and downstream shoulder are grassed.|$|E
50|$|The Barton Aqueduct of 1761, and {{subsequent}} canal aqueducts in the United Kingdom, used {{large quantities of}} masonry and puddling to obtain watertightness. After the success of The Iron Bridge in 1789, however, cast iron was used by Telford on aqueducts such as Chirk and Pontcysyllte. Aqueducts built {{in the early part}} of the 19th century use either <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> or an iron trough in no particular pattern.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is formed}} by a continuous earthen embankment that encloses the basin. The embankments {{consist of a}} central <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core with a selected material adjacent to the core forming a filter. The core is a maximum of 12 ft wide at the base and tapers to 5 ft wide at the crest. The core typically extends 3 ft into the London Clay to form a watertight cut off.|$|E
50|$|Burrator Reservoir was {{completed}} in 1898, and the reservoir was expanded in 1929. The reservoir was built {{under the supervision of}} Edward Sandeman (1862-1959), the Water Engineer for Plymouth. The reservoir has two dams, the Burrator Dam, which is built across the River Meavy at Burrator Gorge at the south-western end, and the Sheepstor Dam built on a dividing ridge between the Meavy and Sheepstor Brook at the south-eastern end. The Burrator Dam {{was the first of the}} two to be built, with construction starting on 9 August 1893. It is the more massive of the two dams, constructed of concrete faced with granite blocks. The Sheepstor Dam was built in 1894 and is an earth embankment with a core wall of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> above the original ground level, with a concrete section below ground. The reservoir was officially opened on 21 September 1898.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} mound at Long Swamp {{was constructed}} in three distinct episodes with ten separate layers during the Etowah Phase occupation. The location started as a circular structure, that {{was used as a}} burial site. Above this a 55 cm mound was constructed, with another structure gracing its summit. This building measured 6.8 m in diameter and had a <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> floor and hearth. On top of this layer was another layer and circular structure. Above this layer was a third layer of mound fill, which reached a final height estimated to have been between 3 m and 4 m, although by the time of archaeological investigations the summit had been too damaged to determine if it also had an accompanying structure. Sometime after the final layer was added to the mound the entire site was flooded leaving a layer of silt blanketing the area. No additional layers were added to the site during the second occupation.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{the dock}} began in 1846, to the designs of Rendel, with Adam Smith as {{resident}} engineer. Contractors for the dock works were Hutching, Brown and Wright. The initial main work was construction of a large cofferdam surrounding the worksite. The dam was constructed of three rows of wooden piles of Baltic yellow pine (Memel fir.), 6 and 7 ft apart, between 18 and 15 in square, piledriven until hard clay was reached. Piles were between 45 and 55 ft with some longer - the outer row was inclined to the vertical at 1 in 24. The inner space was filed with chalkstone and clay for the first 5 ft then with <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b> The inside of the dam was buttressed by additional rows, spaced every 25 ft of wall, of closely piled wooden piles extending back 18 ft; the intermediate space of wall was supported by horizontal diagonal struts from the inner walls to buttresses. The embankments {{to the east and}} west of the dam with were made with piled stones and clay.|$|R
