The first is material that is considered offensive or indecent; such media are placed on the [...] "Index" [...] and restricted in their publication, and distribution to minors is illegal.The second is material that is considered anti-constitutional, dangerous to the state. The underlying concept is [...] "streitbare Demokratie" [...] (self-defending democracy) that legally hinders the rise of all anti-constitutional and thus undemocratic movements. The media concerned are banned outright, with criminal <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringements.</b> An example is the outright ban on material which supports National Socialism.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringements</b> in the ruck by the Kiwis, gave Australia {{an early}} two points from a Johnathan Thurston kick. The Kangaroos then {{mirrored}} this, conceding consecutive penalties that allowed Stacey Jones' goal {{a few minutes}} later to even the scores at 2 all. In the tenth minute Australia had the ball in the centre of the field and passed it out to Mark Gasnier who made a break down the right then passed to his winger Brent Tate to finish. Thurston's conversion was successful, so the home side led 8 - 2. Another penalty in the ruck in the twenty-first minute led to a minor scuffle and a goal from Thurston, extending the Kangaroos' lead to 10 - 2. Five minutes later New Zealand were ten metres into the Australians' half when Stacy Jones put a little chip kick {{over the heads of the}} Kangaroos for Brent Webb to run through and catch before drawing the defence and passing it on to Frank Pritchard who diver over untouched in the left corner. Jones missed the difficult conversion attempt, leaving the score 10 - 6 in favour of Australia. In the remaining ten minutes of play before half-time no more points were scored.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{theoretically}} the relationship between explicit and implicit/relational contracting distinguishing between the ex-ante decision to sign an explicit contract and the ex-post decision wheter to actually apply it. We show, among other things, that the relational efficient explicit contract tends to display overcontracting on tasks or qualitative requirements (A) that are verifi-able but apparently of little use for the principal. The ex-post (non) implementation of such explicit contract can then be discretionally exchanged against the pro-vision of non contractible tasks (B) that are highly valuable for the principal. An empirical implication of the result, consistent with casual observation in pro-curement, is that <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringements</b> established by explicit contracts are seldom exercised, even though violations take place and are easy to monitor and verify. ...|$|E

In the Dniester Basin have been concentrated the majority of water resources, of urban, industrial and agricultural centers. Thus, this basin holds over 90 % of water consumption, most of which are captured from surface sources and used by industrial enterprises from the left bank of Dniester, especially by Thermoelectric Plant (TEP) from Dnestrovsk. On the right bank of Dniester it is noted communal enterprises, agricultural and food industry, and in most of the localities water is captured from groundwater sources.

50|$|The {{criminal}} <b>penalties</b> imposed <b>for</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> vary {{between the}} copyright laws of different jurisdictions. However, the justifications for {{the imposition of}} criminal penalties are common {{in the sense that}} certain kinds of copyright violations are considered as egregious enough to warrant state interference. These kinds of copyright violations are seen as having a negative consequence affecting the entire community. A criminal conviction <b>for</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> is also more punitive compared to a civil penalty and this increases the value of the punishment as a deterrent to prevent such violations in the future. For these reasons, criminal <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> are considered to be effective sanctions against violations.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} optimal {{copyright protection}} strategies {{from the government}} and producer perspectives. Our model assumes that the government sets the <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringement,</b> and that the producer is responsible for monitoring illegal activity. We find that depending on the production cost of the goods, the government should set copyright penalties either to zero or to a level that makes the producer's profit zero. We also show that the social surplus is greater under a civil law scheme than a criminal law scheme when the production cost of the goods is high. On the other hand, it is better to apply penalties under criminal law when the production cost is low. ...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] “Intellectual {{property}} rights are neither protected nor enforced in strict uniformity throughout the world. However, {{it can be}} said that in most developed countries, intellectual property is preciously guarded, as evidenced by a plethora of intellectual property statutes, <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringement,</b> and consistent attempts to convince less developed nations to adopt strong—or stronger—intellectual property protections. Despite continued vigilance by developed countries in bringing about increased international harmony among intellectual property regimes, some developing countries sustain questionable enforcement policies. What the driving force is behind intellectual property enforcement policies—or more appropriately, the lack thereof—is a matter of disagreement. In order to predict whether or not a country that is currently not enforcing its laws will enforce them in the future, it is undoubtedly necessary to understand the factors driving a country’s current enforcement policy. For instance, cultural, economic, or political factors, or a combination thereof, may result in stricter enforcement practices, while others may discourage or delay them. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1880 Bowling Park (Bowling Park, Bradford) {{opened with}} its north gate in Hall Lane only {{two hundred yards}} from Broomfields. In his {{invaluable}} article Russell describes the movement for [...] "rational recreation". Its aim was to replace traditional working class leisure activities, spontaneous, unorganized, boisterous and sometimes disorderly, with activities less threatening to the middle classes and more in keeping with their values. Russell notes {{the opening of the}} Mechanics Institute in 1837 as an early victory for rational recreation. The municipal parks were a major victory.Bowling Park was beautifully landscaped with flower gardens, conservatories, promenades, a drinking fountain and band concerts. Enjoyment of the facilities was regulated by detailed bylaws, with fines and <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringement.</b> The bylaws laid down opening and closing times, prohibited football, meetings, dogs, alcohol and any form of unseemly behaviour. Despite the restrictions the park became very popular and well used. Sunday afternoon band concerts were very well attended - to the dismay of sabbatarians.|$|R

The report had stated that regulations relating to boat licensing [...] "date from the Victorian era", and were wholly inadequate in modern conditions. The Falmouth harbourmaster told the enquiry that, without further staff, it was impossible to check all the boats in the harbour; furthermore, he said, the £5 maximum fine for operating an unlicensed boat was not a deterrent. In Parliament on 15 March 1967 the trade minister Joseph Mallalieu said that he had no plans to introduce further legislation for the licensing of pleasure boats plying for hire, but proposed to increase the <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringement</b> of existing regulations.|$|R
