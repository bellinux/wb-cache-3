40|$|A recent {{experimental}} study on fault gouges prepared from limestone samples {{taken from the}} Longmen Shan Fault Zone, which hosted the Great Wenchuan Earthquake of 2008, showed unstable, velocity weakening slip in low velocity experiments performed at temperatures of 100 - 150 °C but stable, velocity strengthening slip at lower temperatures. Velocity weakening {{is the process of}} shear strength reduction with increasing sliding velocities and is a requirement for seismogenesis. The frictional properties were studied macroscopically with help of the Rate and State dependent Friction law. However, the resulting data do not enable identification of the microphysical processes which cause velocity weakening in the limestone gouge. To determine the process causing velocity weakening, the simulated fault gouge has been examined under the light and electron microscope, with magnifications ranging from 5 to 150. 000 times. Calcite twins and fractures were observed and the density of these structures seems to increase with temperature. The 150 °C limestone sample shows a more chaotic microstructure, with the R-shear bands being less common, broader and less recognizable compared to the 25 °C- 100 °C sheared limestone gouges. Calcite twinning is also very common in the high temperature experiment. Quantitative analysis of the grain size distribution shows that the smallest grain sizes (minimum grain size ~ 50 nm) barely change whereas large polycrystalline clusters (~ 15 µm) do show a decrease in size. Comparison of the mechanical and microstructural data with previous microphysical models for the velocity dependence of slip suggests that possible microphysical reasons for velocity weakening includes competition between frictional viscous flow, dilatation, -and compaction due to granular rearrangement plus pressure solution and/or minor crystal <b>plastic</b> flow (<b>twinning).</b> The very small grain size developed in the samples might speed up processes like diffusion, allowing such mechanisms to control slip at relatively high rates...|$|R

New potential was modified to provide the reliable representation of Cu nanoparticle systems. Different sets of simulation arrays were used to study the different stages of nanoscale sintering. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Three new mechanisms were found to contribute significantly to the early stage sintering. They are plastic deformation, mechanical rotation and amorphisation-recrystallization. Mechanical rotation, caused by large atomic forces relative to the particle masses, appeared to be almost independent of temperature. Plastic deformation was found to involved via dislocation generation and transmission and appeared almost athermal as well. Amorphisation of sub-critical grains was found to significantly increase the diffusion rates in the affected regions and dramatically accelerate the sintering kinetics and grain boundary kinetics. A high-speed <b>plastic</b> deformation, <b>twinning,</b> {{was found in the}} nanosphere sintering and resulted in sintered clusters with multiply twinned particles. (2) Only two of the six classical mechanisms (surface diffusion and grain boundary diffusion) were found to be important for nanoscale sintering. However, the processes were considerably accelerated by strong interatomic attractions, and depended only weakly on temperature. These “force-driven” diffusions are different from the standard “random walk” ones, and need to be treated quite differently. (3) Large array simulations are made possible by using pressure clamp technique. The effect of grain size distribution, temperature and pressure were investigated. Residual pores were found playing important role in fully densification. (4) Classical sintering laws, such as Herring 2 ̆ 7 s law, were found invalid to describe nanoscale sintering due to the facts that a series of mechanisms co-exists and come intro play in an overlapping manner {{in a short period of}} time. (5) Sintering Diagrams, estimated from the simulation results, appear to be differently from the ones that are predicted by the classical theory. ...|$|R

Therefore, a homogenization treatment within the single β-phase field region followed by water quenching has been carried out, whereby {{the majority of the}} disordered β-phase transforms into hexagonal α$_ 2 $′-martensite during cooling. Since the β to α transformation in the intermetallic β-solidifying Ti– 44 Al– 3 Mo– 0. 1 B alloy (at%) occurs at very high temperatures causing enhanced diffusional processes, a very locally diffusion-controlled transformation together with a displacive, hence purely martensitic transformation take place.

The formation of deformation twins plays a key role on the accommodation of a large amount of strain produced by {{plastic deformation}}. Grain orientation has a great influence on the formation of twins. Temperature has smaller effects than strain rate on the evolutions of the microstructures and mechanical properties. The area fraction of twins and their intersections increase with the increasing strain rate and the deformation strain, resulting in refined microstructures and higher hardness values. Strain rate also leads to the change of twin shape (type). While more lenticular twins are observed in samples after quasi-static deformation, there are lots of needle-like twins with straight and long boundaries in samples processed via dynamic plastic deformation. This may imply that different twin systems operate at different strain rate. For the needle-like twins in samples after dynamic <b>plastic</b> deformation, the <b>twin</b> area fraction approaches saturation beyond the true strain of about 0. 13, which is significant turning point for twinning rate.

However, their underlying hexagonal crystal structure furnishes Mg and its alloys with a complex mechanical behavior {{because of their}} comparably smaller number of energetically favorable slip systems. Besides the commonly studied slip mechanism, another way to accomplish general deformation is through the additional mechanism of deformation-induced twinning.

40|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{sufficient}} number of slip systems in hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals to accommodate arbitrary <b>plastic</b> deformation, mechanical <b>twinning</b> occupies {{an important role in the}} mechanical behavior of these metals. Twinning causes a significant and abrupt change in the orientation of crystals, whilst simultaneously affecting the hardening and plastic flow behavior of the material considerably. Modeling of forming processes of hexagonal close packed metals thus requires accounting for the evolution of texture and texture induced anisotropy, especially due to twinning. Additionally, the computational framework for the simulation of forming processes must be reliable and efficient in order to guarantee results in realistic time frames. In the present work, a phenomenological constitutive model consisting of an anisotropic yield function, associate flow rule and isotropic hardening, is coupled with the viscoplastic self-consistent polycrystal model in order to capture the slip and twinning activity, texture evolution and the evolving anisotropy during plastic deformation of hcp materials, similar to a hierarchical multi-scale modeling framework proposed by Van Houtte et al. [41] for cubic metals. To account for texture evolution during plastic deformation, the parameters involved in the anisotropic yield function are regularly updated based on mechanical test data obtained from the polycrystal model at the micro-scale. The parameter update is performed at discrete steps instead of every increment. The developed model is applied to describe the behaviors of pure zirconium at liquid nitrogen temperature.

The objective of the present article is to investigate the deformation modes at work in three different microstructures of a thin (8 µm) zinc coating on an interstitial-free steel substrate under tension, plane-strain tension, and expansion loading. Damage mechanisms are addressed in a companion article. The <b>plastic</b> slip and <b>twinning</b> activity in the zinc grains of an untempered cold-rolled coating (labeled NSK), a tempered cold-rolled coating (labeled SK), and a recrystallized coating are compared with {{the response of the}} corresponding bulk low-alloyed zinc material. The in-plane grain size in the NSK and SK coatings ranges from 300 to 600 µm, vs about 30 µm in the recrystallized coating and bulk material. The coatings exhibit a strong crystallographic texture, with the c-axis generally normal to the sheet plane. Basal slip is shown to be the main deformation mechanism in bulk zinc and the recrystallized coating, whereas pyramidal π 2 slip and mechanical twinning are found to be major modes in the NSK and SK coatings. These results, obtained from an extensive, quantitative slip-line analysis combined with electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) measurements, are explained by the constraining effect of the substrate. This effect is successfully modeled using a simple Taylor-like polycrystalline approach. The recrystallized coating behaves much like the bulk material. The interpretation of this grain-size effect between the NSK and SK coating, on the one hand, and the recrystallized coating, on the other hand, requires a full three-dimensional finite-element analysis of the multicrystalline coating provided in this work. The simulations show that strong strain gradients can develop in the recrystallized coating from the interface to the surface, which is not the case in the NSK and SK coatings...|$|R

Two types of tensile tests were performed, one by the application of very low loading rates and the other by the rapid application of a constant stress.

Understanding this deformation {{and the associated}} defects that are created in the material is crucial {{in the study of}} a wide range of phenomena, including planetary formation and asteroid impact sites, the formation of interstellar dust clouds, ballistic penetrators, spacecraft shielding and ductility in high-performance ceramics. At the lattice level, the basic mechanisms of <b>plastic</b> deformation are <b>twinning</b> (whereby crystallites with a mirror-image lattice form) and slip (whereby lattice dislocations are generated and move), but determining which of these mechanisms is active during deformation is challenging. Experiments that characterized lattice defects have typically examined the microstructure of samples after deformation, and so are complicated by post-shock annealing and reverberations. In addition, measurements have been limited to relatively modest pressures (less than 100 gigapascals). In situ X-ray diffraction experiments can provide insights into the dynamic behaviour of materials, but have only recently been applied to plasticity during shock compression and have yet to provide detailed insight into competing deformation mechanisms. Here we present X-ray diffraction experiments with femtosecond resolution that capture in situ, lattice-level information on the microstructural processes that drive shock-wave-driven deformation. To demonstrate this method we shock-compress the body-centred-cubic material tantalum-an important material for high-energy-density physics owing to its high shock impedance and high X-ray opacity. Tantalum is also a material for which previous shock compression simulations and experiments have provided conflicting information about the dominant deformation mechanism. Our experiments reveal twinning and related lattice rotation occurring on the timescale of tens of picoseconds. In addition, despite the common association between twinning and strong shocks, we find a transition from twinning to dislocation-slip-dominated plasticity at high pressure (more than 150 gigapascals), a regime that recovery experiments cannot accurately access. The techniques demonstrated here will be useful for studying shock waves and other high-strain-rate phenomena, as well as a broad range of processes induced by plasticity. </p...|$|R
