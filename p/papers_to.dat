5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News—one of the few big city <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> consistently support her.|$|E

5|$|Alderson enjoyed {{an active}} retirement, {{becoming}} Colonel Commandant of the Royal West Kent Regiment and pursuing hunting and yachting with fervour, being an active master of foxhounds of the South Shropshire Hunt {{and member of}} the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club. He was also very concerned that the growing popularity of motor sports would result in the demise of these traditional pastimes and expended much energy promoting them. After living the last few years of his life on a houseboat moored in Oulton Broad, he died in December 1927 of a sudden heart attack at Lowestoft and was buried at Chesterton, Oxfordshire, survived by his wife. She later arranged for his private <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> be given to the nation and they are currently stored at British Library and the National Archives of Zimbabwe.|$|E

However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington's death they argued that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington's daughter to excise portions of Arrington's diary. After legal negotiation, half of a box of the collection {{was given to the}} LDS Church Archives.|$|E

5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of BYU studies, BYU Studies was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone {{with an interest in}} Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> Dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Hickok willed her {{personal}} <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, {{part of the}} US National Archives. Her donation was contained in eighteen filing boxes that, according to the provisions of her will, were to be sealed until ten years after her death. In early May 1978, Doris Faber, as part of research for a projected short biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, became perhaps the first person outside the National Archives to open these boxes, and was astounded to discover that they contained 2,336 letters from Roosevelt to Hickok, and 1,024 letters from Hickok to Roosevelt. Most of them dated to the 1930s, but the correspondence continued up to Roosevelt's 1962 death. Hickok's papers remain at the FDR Library and Museum, where they are available to the public.|$|E

5|$|Only a {{few months}} later, on 14 December 1861, Albert died at Windsor Castle. During his final illness, Alice {{remained}} at his bedside. Alice sent for the Prince of Wales by telegram, without {{the knowledge of the}} Queen, who refused to notify him because she blamed him for Albert's death. The Queen was distraught by her husband's death, and the court entered a period of intense mourning. Alice became her mother's unofficial secretary, and for the next six months, the physical representation of the monarch. Through her passed the Queen's official <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> and from her government ministers, while the Queen secluded herself from all public life. Alice was aided in this task by her younger sister Princess Louise. Although Princess Helena, Louise's elder sister, would normally have been selected to assist, her inability to go long without crying was held against her.|$|E
