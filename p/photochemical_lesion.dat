Bacteriol. 92 : 144 – 147. 1966. —T 4 r mutations were {{induced by}} ultraviolet irradiation of extracellular phage particles, using a phage mutant, v, which is particularly susceptible to photoreactivation. Most of the induced r mutations could be subsequently photoreversed intracellularly with white light. Ultraviolet irradiation induces both transitions and sign mutations, {{and both were}} susceptible to photoreversal.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system is {{vulnerable}} to various insults and particularly to ischemia. To mimic ischemia, a photochemical or compression lesion was induced in the right sensory motor cortex of rat brains. We studied {{the time course of}} ultrastructural changes in cortical neurones after lesioning, and the occurrence of different types of neuronal death was examined with respect to a potential therapeutic window. The lesion's appearance was documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At 0. 5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-lesion, cortical neurones were examined by electron microscopy (EM). Following a <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesion,</b> the neuropil in the lesioned area appeared disorganised at 0. 5 h, while necrotic and apoptotic cells were identified as separate bodies. Three hours later the tissue was disintegrated. On the contralateral side, ruptured membranes were found at 3 h, which is a sign of irreversible cell death. Following a compression lesion, apoptotic cell death was most frequent at 12 h in the lesioned area, and signs of secondary delayed cell death, e. g. an enlarged endoplasmatic reticulum, were found at 3 h. Following a cortical <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesion,</b> neurogenesis was studied after beam-walking and fluoxetine pre-treatment. Dividing cells, confirmed by bromodeoxyuridine staining and EM, migrated to the border of the lesion, and their number was enhanced after fluoxetine treatment. Embryonic stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells, labelled with the iron-oxide nanoparticle Endorem®, were implanted into rat brains following a cortical <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesion</b> or a spinal cord compression lesion. Iron-containing cells, confirmed by Prussian blue staining and EM, were injected either into the contralateral hemisphere or intravenously into the femoral vein. The fate of labelled cells was tracked in vivo using MRI, which at seven and 14 days post-injection showed labelled cells migrating to the injury site. The time course of ultrastructural changes in spinal cord neurones following a compression lesion was studied. EM showed at 0. 5 - 6 h apoptotic and at 12 - 72 h necrotic cell death {{in the vicinity of the}} lesion. The studies demonstrate that the chosen models are useful when studying ultrastructural changes in injured cells. As the morphology drastically changed at 3 h, the cellular alterations at this time point might represent a breakpoint at which cells either progress towards cell death or recover. Fluoxetine enhances stem cell migration towards a lesion. Endorem®-labelled stem cells remain viable and migrate to a lesion site; thus, Endorem® can be used for MRI tracking of implanted stem cells in animals and humans...|$|E

40|$|Light {{may cause}} damage to living tissue {{in a range}} from barely detectable, {{temporary}} changes to gross destruction. The eye and its retina, though designed to gather light neces-sary for vision, are also susceptible to such deleterious effects. Although the visual system responds to wavelengths between 400 and 750 nm, light {{in the range of}} 400 - 1400 nm is transmitted by the ocular media and focused onto the retina. Within this spectral range, three types of retinal damage may occurc "(l) non-linear effects from picosecond and nanosecond pulses; (2) thermal effects for pulses in the range microseconds to seconds and for cw exposure to wavelengths above approximately 500 nm; and(J) photochemical effects for long term exposure to wavelengths below approximately 500 nm. " 11 We will be concerned here with only the thermal and <b>photochemical</b> effects. Thermal <b>lesions,</b> or heat burns of the retina, by ophthal-moscopic examination, appear as circumscribed lesions with well marked borders which contain a central area of yellow fluid. <b>Photochemical</b> <b>lesions,</b> in comparison, tend to have a very subtle yellow tinge throughout, and exhibit no distinct borders. 16 It has been shown 1 • 11 that the type of lesion which results is a factor of the spectral distribution of the incident radiation.

In most organisms (excluding placental mammals such as humans) they can be repaired by photoreactivation. Photoreactivation is a repair process in which photolyase enzymes directly reverse CPDs via <b>photochemical</b> reactions. <b>Lesions</b> on the DNA strand are recognized by these enzymes, followed by the absorption of light wavelengths >300 nm (i.e. fluorescent and sunlight). This absorption enables the photochemical reactions to occur, which results in {{the elimination of the}} pyrimidine dimer, returning it to its original state.|$|R

UV radiation from 254 to 300 nm was effective in producing photochemically damaged DNA in cell nuclei of the epidermis of irradiated hairless mice.

40|$|Light above 400 nm had {{selective}} {{effects on}} Escherichia coli ML- 308 : several processes or enzymes were strongly inhibited, whereas others were relatively unaffected.

The decrease in adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate level {{during the first few}} minutes of illumination resembled the inactivation kinetics of phenylalanine uptake. The results suggest that phenylalanine uptake may not depend greatly on oxidative energy and may depend on the adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate level. The results for glycine suggest either that its active uptake and respiration involve a common photosensitive component or alternately, that only the respiratory chain contains the photosensitive component, and that glycine uptake is coupled almost exclusively to respiration.

We studied whether superparamagnetic nanoparticles (CD 34 microbeads), used clinically for specific magnetic sorting, {{can be used as}} a magnetic cell label for in vivo cell visualization. Human cells from peripheral blood were selected by CliniMACS ® CD 34 Selection Technology (Miltenyi). Purified CD 34 + cells were implanted into rats with a cortical <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesion,</b> contralaterally to the lesion. Twenty-four hours after grafting, the implanted cells were detected in the contralateral hemisphere as a hypointense spot on T 2 weighted images; the hypointensity of the implant decreased during the first week.

40|$|Primary {{embryonic}} chick {{cells have}} been evaluated {{on the basis of}} their capacity to repair <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesions</b> produced in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The fate of one prominent class of UV photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, was monitored by an in vitro enzymatic assay. UV-irradiated cultures were incubated for prescribed times after which their damaged, radioactive-labeled DNA was extracted and exposed to a purified UV endonuclease selectively active toward sites altered by dimer formation. Single-strand scissions specifically introduced by the enzyme treatment and, therefore, the dimer-containing sites remaining in the DNA were quantified retrospectively by velocity sedimentation in alkaline sucrose. When the chick fibroblasts were incubated in black light, essentially all nuclease-susceptible sites rapidly disappeared from the UV-damaged DNA. In sharp contrast, incubation of the irradiated cultures in total darkness severely impeded the metabolic machinery responsible for site elimination. A substantial amount of UV-stimulated DNA repair synthesis was also detected in the chick cells by conventional techniques involving isopyknic centrifugation and autoradiography. However, the UV photoproducts triggering this indicator of excision repair were probably not dimers since incubation of the irradiated cultures in the light rather than in the dark did not lead to a diminution in the extent of repair synthesis. By these criteria of DNA repair, it appears that embryonic chick cells primarily rely on a highly proficient, light-requiring mechanism, presumably enzymatic photoreactivation, for dimer elimination but also possess a light-independent, excision-type process to cope with other, as yet unidentified, photochemical defects...|$|R
40|$|Growth-promoting {{macroglia}} (aldynoglia) {{with growth}} properties and immunological markers similar to Schwann cells, {{are found in}} loci of the mammalian CNS where axon regeneration occurs throughout life, like the olfactory sytem, hypothalamus-hypophysis and the pineal gland [79]. Contrary to Schwann cells, aldynoglia mingle freely with astrocytes and can migrate in brain and spinal cord. Transplantation of cultured and immunopurified olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) in the spinal cord after multiple central rhizotomy, promoted sensory and central axon growth and partial functional restoration, judging by anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural criteria. OEC transplants suppressed astrocyte reactivity, thus generally favouring axon growth after a lesion. However, the functional repair promoted by OEC transplants was partial in the best cases, depending on lesion type and location. Cyst formation after <b>photochemical</b> cord <b>lesion</b> was partially prevented but neither the corticospinal tract, interrupted by a mild contusion, nor the sectioned medial longitudinal fascicle, did regrow after OEC transplantation in the injured area.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{ultraviolet}} (UV) B (280 - 315 nm) and blue light (400 - 500 nm) radiation can produce phototoxic lesions in the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In the first section of this thesis, bovine lens cells (epithelium and superficial cortical fibre cell) and human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE- 19) cells were used to characterize in vitro changes following oxidative stress with UVB radiation in ocular lens optics and cellular function in terms of mitochondrial dynamics. In the second part, human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE- 19) cells and in vitro bioassays were used together to develop an in vitro approach for UV radiation-induced retinal toxicology research. In the third chapter, the in vitro approach developed above was used with intraocular lens (IOL) materials to evaluate the UV radiation blocking efficiency of commercially available IOL’s. Lastly, narrowband blue light irradiation and in vitro assays were used to determine more precisely the wavelengths of blue light responsible for <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesions</b> of the retina as an effort to contribute to future IOL designs. 	The results from mitochondrial dynamics of lens cells and RPE cells show significant decreases in mitochondrial movement after UVB irradiation in a dose dependent manner. Results obtained from four in vitro assays (Alamar blue assay, confocal microscopy for mitochondrial distribution and nucleic acids damage, phagocytotic activity assay) for evaluating the UVB-induced damage in ARPE- 19 show significant decreases in cell viability as well as phagocytotic activity of RPE cells after UVB radiation. In addition, the results show that UV radiation can also induce the degradation of DNA/RNA and mitochondria of RPE cells in a dose dependent manner. The results of the UV blocking efficiency test of commercially available IOL materials show very effective UV blocking ability, allowing no cellular damage at all, in comparison to an IOL uncovered control cell. The results of three different wavelengths of blue light exposure show that only 400 nm blue light radiation can cause significant damage to RPE cells, while 420 and 435. 8 nm blue light radiation cause no cellular damage at all. 	In conclusion, UVB and blue light radiation can cause phototoxic damage to the retinal pigment epithelium as a result of oxidative stress, and in vitro bioassays used for this research may offer a sensitive, and meaningful biomarker approach, not only for evaluating RPE function after oxidative and chemical stress, but also for evaluating IOL effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{provides a useful}} noninvasive method to study the long-term migration and fate of transplanted stem cells in {{the central nervous system}} in vivo. Grafted adult as well as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) labeled with superparamagnetic nanoparticles survive in the host organism and migrate preferentially into a lesion site, where they populate the damaged nervous tissue. The migration is not affected by the route of administration; the lesion is populated with the same number of cells after intracerebral grafting as after intravenous injection. Less than 3 % of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a cortical <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesion</b> differentiated into neurons and none into astrocytes, while most ESCs (70 %) differentiated into astrocytes and only 5 % into neurons.

Razmatrane su aktuelne koncepcije i ideje koje bi mogle dovesti do novih eksperimentalnih rezultata i boljeg razumijevanja djelovanja ultravioletne svjetlosti na animalne (uključujući i humane) stanice. Various {{aspects of}} the effect of ultraviolet light on mammalian cells grown in vitro are shown and discussed: from photochemical and photobiological aspects of cellular radiobiology to its pertinence to carcinogenesis. The macromolecular basis of the changes in irradiated cells is underlined. An attempt was made to survey some current concepts and ideas that may lead to better understanding of the effects of ultraviolet light on the living mammalian (including human) cells. Although UV-irradiation induces various kinds of molecular damage in mammalian cells two main types of photochemical lesions seem to be critical for the cell survival: pyrimidine dimers and DNA-protein crosslinking. The kinetics of dimer induction, simple in its proportionality with UV exposure, is followed by complex interactions of metabolic processes and repair pathways. The existence of two different modes in removal of pyrimidine dimers from the DNA divides mammalian cells in two main groups. The first group (in which human cells are included) has developed enzymatic mechanism for excising damaged parts from corresponding DNA; the second group (rodent cell lines) has formed the mechanism for postreplication repair of <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesion.</b> UV exposure is followed by intensive reparation activity thus attempting to remove the photochemical damage hindering normal metabolic activities. There are many variations and alternative pathways in these processes which are embracing DNA, various enzymes and other proteins and factors. The repair of each of UV-induced dimers undoubtedly does not function according to the same mechanical cliche, In the first phase of intensive reparation activity the mammalian cell certainly can not remove the complete photochemical damage induced by UV irradiation; perhaps cca 50 - 70 °/o of dimers are repaired in the first few hours after irradiation. To the contrary, it was demonstrated that these cells posses enzymatic mechanisms capable of repairing even greater number of dimers than that induced by exposures on the limit lethality (66). However, in the chromatin of cells there is a portion of photochemical damage that can not be approached by repair mechanism. Nevertheless, mammalian cells can survive in spite of the existence of the fraction of unrepaired dimers in their DNA which was untouched during the first hours after the irradiation. This is managed by bypass mechanism which temporarily enables the cells to »ignore« the existence of fraction of photochemical damage in their DNA. Those remaining dimers are gradually removed in a period of few days. In spite of all its complexity, the phenomena of UV induction of pyrimidine dimers and their repair can not exclusively comprehend mammalian cell tilling by UV light, specially survival variations in distinct phases of the cell cycle. The induction of another <b>photochemical</b> <b>lesion,</b> DNA-to-protein crosslinking, varies through the cell cycle in the similar manner as the cell survival, what indicates the biological importance of this type of damage. Many particularities connected with this type of lesion are still unclear, but there seem to be no repair of DNA-protein crosslinks. In addition with the critical number of unrepaired pyrimidine dimers, DNA-to-protein crosslinking therefore could have the principal role in UV-induced cell killing...|$|E
