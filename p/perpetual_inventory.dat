40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} project was to teach the management of <b>perpetual</b> and periodic <b>inventory</b> systems to university students {{in the field of}} food systems management {{through the use of a}} microcomputer software program developed for this purpose. The objective of the study was to determine the classroom simulation's effectiveness in enhancing students' understanding of inventory systems management. The population sample consisted of 68 students enrolled in a senior level food systems management course at Oregon State University. Simple random sampling was used to divide the population sample into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. All the participants completed a pretest to measure existing knowledge of inventory management concepts. This was followed by two fifty-minute classroom educational modules on the management of <b>perpetual</b> and periodic <b>inventory</b> systems in foodservice facilities. The members of the experimental group participated in using the microcomputer simulation program of food item inventory systems after the classroom modules. All the participants of the experimental and control groups completed a posttest approximately three weeks after the pretest. The difference in pretest mean scores between the experimental and control groups was not significant (P [less than or equal to]. 05) as determined by the student's t-test. This indicated the two groups were similar to each other in previous knowledge of inventory management. The difference in posttest adjusted mean scores between the experimental and control groups was significant (P [less than or equal to]. 05) as determined by analysis of covariance. Therefore, the microcomputer simulation was effective in enhancing students' understanding of the management of the <b>perpetual</b> and periodic <b>inventory</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addressed}} a comprehensive modelling and functionality requirement evaluation of <b>perpetual</b> production logistics <b>inventory</b> system for small-to-medium enterprises. The main {{idea is to}} analyse the system behaviour and data transactions invoked by a module-based inventory system using business process modelling and object-oriented data modelling techniques. The paper explains through the methodology and modelling procedure which eventually leads to a computerized inventory information system as a module able to be integrated with other back office systems in production logistics. The system is able to manipulate all inbound warehousing operations including docking, storing, and retrieval data as well as actual inventory SKU balance dynamically to keep the inventory data instantly up-to-date and in real-time. The functionality of the solution is evaluated based on the identified inventory system requirements responding to all inventory controlling of receiving, allocating, load balancing, and traceability linking through different types of lookups and data queries.

40|$|Hospitals, {{like all}} organizations, have both a mission and a finite supply of {{resources}} {{with which to}} accomplish that mission. Because the inventory of therapeutic drugs is among the more expensive resources needed by a hospital to achieve its mission, a conceptual model of structure plus process equals outcome posits that adequate emphasis {{should be placed on}} optimization of the organization 2 ̆ 7 s investment in this important structural resource to provide highest quality outcomes. Therefore emphasis should be placed on the optimization of pharmacy inventory because lowering the financial investment in drug inventory and associated costs increases productive efficiency, a key element of quality. ^ In this study, a post-intervention analysis of a hospital pharmacy inventory management technology implementation at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center was conducted to determine if an intervention which reduced a hospital 2 ̆ 7 s financial investment in pharmaceutical inventory provided an opportunity to incrementally optimize the organization 2 ̆ 7 s mix of structural resources thereby improving quality of care. The results suggest that hospital pharmacies currently lacking technology to support automated purchasing logistics and <b>perpetual,</b> real-time <b>inventory</b> management for drugs may achieve measurable benefits from the careful implementation of such technology, enabling the hospital to lower its investment in on-hand inventory and, potentially, to reduce overall purchasing expenditures. ^ The importance of these savings to the hospital and potentially to the patient should not be underestimated for their ability to generate funding for previously unfunded public health programs or in their ability to provide financial relief to patients in the form of lower drug costs given the current climate of escalating healthcare costs and tightening reimbursements. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{business}} and accounting/accountancy, <b>perpetual</b> <b>inventory</b> or continuous inventory describes systems of inventory where information on inventory quantity and availability is updated on a continuous basis {{as a function}} of doing business.

50|$|In his 1960 Accounting {{principles}} Braden and Allyn {{described and}} pictured the cost-flow principle: As direct material passes from the storeroom into the factory for conversion into finished products {{and back into}} the storeroom for storage until sold, costs are being gathered in totals and per unit for each stage of the productive process. Each movement in the factory operation is accounted for at the time it occurs. This is the cost-flow principle. Assisting in the carrying out of this principle is the <b>perpetual</b> <b>inventory</b> method of accounting for inventories. In the operation of this method of handling inventory, a record is made of the issue of direct and indirect materials from the storeroom, as well as a record of their receipt when they are purchased. The continuous accounting for the flow of materials at the time of occurrence is essential to an accounting for costs.|$|E
5000|$|A method {{often used}} in {{econometrics}} to estimate {{the value of the}} physical capital stock of an industrial sector or the whole economy is the so-called <b>Perpetual</b> <b>Inventory</b> Method (PIM). Starting off from a benchmark stock value for capital held, and expressing all values in constant dollars using a price index, known additions to the stock are added, and known disposals as well as depreciation are subtracted year by year (or quarter by quarter). Thus, an historical data series is obtained for the growth of the capital stock over a period of time. In so doing, assumptions are made about the real rate of price inflation, realistic depreciation rates, average service lives of physical capital assets, and so on. The PIM stock values can be compared with various other related economic variables and trends, and adjusted further to obtain the most accurate and credible valuation ...|$|E
50|$|From a {{financial}} accounting perspective, backflushing {{is a technique}} of the <b>perpetual</b> <b>inventory</b> system. Small businesses which have a rather modest variety of items in their inventory still use periodic inventory management. A periodic inventory system does not require day-to-day tracking of physical inventory. Purchases, cost of goods sold, and inventory on hand cannot be tracked {{until the end of}} the accounting time period when a physical inventory is performed and ending inventory is compared against the sum of beginning inventory and purchases. Cost of ending inventory can be calculated by using the LIFO or FIFO inventory accounting methods, or other less common methods. The end of the accounting period is considered usually the end of each month because otherwise some taxes like the VAT (value added tax) cannot be charged. The monthly stock-taking is the main disadvantage of the periodic inventory system. Another disadvantage is that it requires also monthly a reconciliation between the records of the management accounting and the financial accounting.|$|E
50|$|The {{forms and}} designs {{were to be}} used in {{connection}} with the several systems in the Factory Organization. Nicholson introduced three of these systems in advance as follows: # ESTIMATED COST SYSTEMS : In order to assist those who, instead of using an actual cost system, estimate their costs and keep their general accounts in the books {{in such a way as}} to make it difficult to form any opinion as to the accuracy of these estimates at the end of the year or at any other time, several methods calculated to aid in such case will be found in the chapters on this subject...# ACTUAL COST SYSTEM : The importance of this subject, while being generally conceded, is nevertheless sadly neglected, and the only explanation that can be given is that either the business man and his assistants are not able to inaugurate such a system, or the expense that might be involved prevents him from taking any action in this direction. This is the only logical explanation that can be offered where the importance of the matter is conceded and admits of no argument or difference of opinion...# STOCK SYSTEM : Although it is not necessary to inaugurate a <b>perpetual</b> <b>inventory</b> in order to obtain costs, yet it is advisable to do so whenever possible, as a safeguard to prevent waste of material, theft, or losses from any other causes; and also to guard against over-buying or failure to carry in stock such materials as are neces sary for the operation of the plant... The whole series of forms presented in the work is summarized in a single sheet (see image). They are presented in 24 classes, covering operations from purchasing, material handling, stock keeping, time tickets, and production records, to cost records, further accounting operations, to drawing patterns and monthly reports. It showed building blocks of the information architecture.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of <b>perpetual</b> <b>inventory,</b> {{backflushing}} is automatic accounting of material consumed for production, {{at the time of}} confirmation of the production, e.g. when a 4-wheeler automobile is rolled out from assembly line, 4 wheels and tires are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of back flushing by the system. Typically the assembly line has its own limited stock of materials as work in process. This stock is replenished by transferring materials from a warehouse (store) into the assembly lines own designated location, e.g. a supermarket. At goods receipt the consumed materials are posted automatically from the location designated to the issuing production line. In other words, back flushing refers only to materials which are already withdrawn from the inventory of the warehouse (store) and were delivered to the shop floor. Parts are issued from stores to Work-In-Process inventory, but not based on a job order or for a specific production order. They are issued in quantities estimated to cover requirements of individual work centers and production lines. The issuing may be used to cover a period of time or to fill a fixed—size container. But unlike the traditional approach, also known as [...] "preproduction issuing" [...] where the costs are assigned to the product order at the withdrawal of materials from the stores and after completion of production any excess material is given back to the stores, backflushing delays that until the goods receipt of the finished product or assembly is issued. The remaining quantity of unused material left on the shops is still held in the system as floor stock and so material will not be ordered incorrectly through the Manufacturing resource planning (MRP). By eliminating work-in-process accounts, backflush costing simplifies the accounting process. However, this simplification and other deviations from traditional costing systems mean that backflush costing may not always conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Another drawback of this system is the lack of a sequential audit trail. The main advantage of postproduction issuing, not necessarily of backflushing, {{is that there is no}} need to update the store balances of inventory at the withdrawal of the materials from stores and recording the excess material through reverse posting (storno). This is especially useful in series or mass production where it is no need to give back excess material to the stores because it is used for the next production order. Even if excess material is given back to stores it does not involve any update to the inventory balance in the financial accounting (stock accounts). It involves only a stock transfer in the inventory management or warehouse management. Only the materials reported as consumed through the method of backflushing or by the MES imply an update to the inventory balance: ...|$|E
