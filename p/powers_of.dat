60|$|This way of talking, nevertheless, has prevailed, and, as I guess, {{produced}} great confusion. For {{these being}} all different {{powers in the}} mind, or in the man, to do several actions, he exerts them as he thinks fit: but {{the power to do}} one action is not operated on by the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> doing another action. For the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> thinking operates not on the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> choosing, nor the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> choosing on the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> thinking; no more than the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> dancing operates on the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> singing, or the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> singing on the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> dancing, as any one who reflects on it will easily perceive. And yet this is it which we say when we thus speak, that the will operates on the understanding, or the understanding on the will.|$|R
