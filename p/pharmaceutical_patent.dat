50|$|A {{chemical}} patent, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patent</b> or drug patent is {{a patent}} for an invention in the chemical or pharmaceuticals industry. Strictly speaking, in most jurisdictions, there are essentially {{no differences between}} the legal requirements to obtain a patent for an invention in the chemical or pharmaceutical fields, in comparison to obtaining a patent in the other fields, {{such as in the}} mechanical field. A chemical patent or a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patent</b> is therefore not a sui generis right, i.e. a special legal type of patent.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} analyses {{the role}} and action of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Agreements (TRIPS) and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> in the public health network of Djibouti, by using an approach largely inspired by actor-network theory (ANT). In doing so, it addresses issues that run beyond the specificities of this case study and relate more broadly to the relevance of ANT to socio-legal analysis. The relation between TRIPS, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> and public health in developing countries has been a widely debated issue in the past decade. However, the field remains limited by a relative uniformity {{in the range of}} approaches and case studies chosen in existing research. This project aims to address some of these limits, by looking at the role of TRIPS and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> in a small country with no local pharmaceutical industry, no pre-existing official system of intellectual property, and with a largely undocumented public health system. Using ANT in this project allowed for the complexity of the mechanisms of both TRIPS and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> to be highlighted. It participated in emphasising {{that they need to be}} understood as made of multiple, co-existing dimensions. By demonstrating how specific connections and associations have shaped what TRIPS and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> are and do in the networks of Djibouti, this research emphasises the artificiality of the dichotomy between social and legal, and proposes an understanding of social connections as symmetrical and co-dependent. It discusses the more general relevance of this approach to socio-legal research. The example of Djibouti also allows for new questions to be raised in relation to the actual impact of TRIPS and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> in “developing countries”. In particular, it emphasises the need to return to a more balanced approach to the relation between <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> and health in poor countries.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry relies on innovation. However, many innovative firms are cutting their {{research and development}} investments and seeing their new product pipelines dry up, {{due in part to}} a lack of sufficient patent protection. This Note identifies two major factors that have caused this inadequacy in <b>patent</b> protection. First, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> are challenged early and often by generic manufacturers, as encouraged by the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act. Second, the scope of pharmaceutical-patents is sometimes unduly restrained due to limited application of the doctrine of equivalents. Consequently, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents,</b> especially drug-product patents, are easily designed around and cannot offer the protection necessary for innovative firms to recoup their developmental costs. This Note argues for a wider application of means-plus-function clauses in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> as a potential cure for this problem. Means-plus-function claims, although authorized by Congress in the 1952 Patent Act, have not been explored much in the pharmaceutical context. This Note argues that this claiming strategy is not only appropriate but also particularly effective for <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents.</b> Means-plus-function claims would give drug-product patents adequate scope even with the limited use of the doctrine of equivalents and thus would provide the protection necessary for innovative firms to withstand frequent attacks by generic manufacturers. Finally, this Note examines issues anticipated with applying means-plus-function claims to <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> and proposes possible solutions...|$|R

40|$|This comment explores India's {{resistance}} to strong intellectual property {{protection in the}} area of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents.</b> This resistance reflects concerns felt by many developing countries. The imposition of universal standards of patent protection under TRIPs in its current form cannot be justified. Anti-competitive intellectual property rights of industrialized nations, led by United States authorities, provide more benefits to the developed world than to developing countries. Such a high level of protection, particularly as it pertains to medical needs, is neither necessary nor fair. Section II begins with a brief overview of the nature of intellectual property as it relates to patents, and examines the diverging views held by developing and industrialized nations. Section III reviews the Uruguay Round of GATT and the implementation of TRIPs. This section also compares the competing perspectives of the industrialized and developing nations, about TRIPs, as evidenced by the current positions of the United States and India, respectively. An analysis of the WTO dispute resolution mechanism will also be undertaken. Section IV presents a brief review of the history and current state of India's patent regime. Section V presents the cases for and against a strong intellectual property regime for <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents</b> in developing countries, such as India. Section V also includes an overview of the nature of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents,</b> and the differing viewpoints supporting or contesting enhanced intellectual property rights as it applies to <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>patents.</b> In addition, an examination of the recent events in Pretoria, South Africa, and their implications, will be undertaken. The approaching January 1. 2005 deadline for developing countries to comply with the TRIPs agreement. 32 will be discussed in Section VI. Additionally, section VI proposes alternative methods of interpreting TRIPs and methods for dealing with the United States' heavy-handed attitude towards developing countries. Section VI also asserts that developing countries, including India, as sovereign nations, {{should have the right to}} determine their patent policies in accordance with the health concerns of their people...|$|R
