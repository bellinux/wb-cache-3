Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and <b>productiveness,</b> various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E

2500|$|For Rand, {{all of the}} {{principal}} virtues are applications {{of the role of}} reason as man's basic tool of survival: rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, <b>productiveness,</b> and pride—each of which she explains in some detail in [...] "The Objectivist Ethics." [...] The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her Atlas Shrugged character John Galt adhered to: [...] "I swear—by my life and my love of it—that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{groups in}} similar pursuits were to in turn {{organize}} {{themselves as a}} [...] "series" [...] and to elect a [...] "superintendent," [...] who would assess the <b>productiveness</b> of each group in the series. Under the theoretical Fourierist scheme once a community grew to sufficient scale, these superintendents were to constitute themselves as a [...] "council of industry." [...] This elaborate bureaucratic apparatus above the level of groups and foremen remained in the distant mists of Fourierian fantasy due to the small scale of the Wisconsin experiment, it should be noted.|$|E
2500|$|Astrologically speaking, Saturn is {{associated}} with focus, precision, nobility, ethics, civility, lofty goals, career, great achievements, dedication, authority figures, ordered hierarchy, stability, virtues, <b>productiveness,</b> valuable hard lessons learned, destiny, traditions, conformity, structures, protective roles, balance, and karma [...] (reaping what you have sowed or divine cosmic justice) but with limitations, restrictions, boundaries, anxiety, tests, practicality, reality, and time. It concerns a person's sense of duty, discipline, responsibility, including their physical and emotional endurance during hardships. Saturn also represents {{the part of a}} person's concern with long-term planning or foresight. The Return of Saturn is said to mark significant events in each person's life. According to the 1st-century poet Manilius, Saturn is sad, morose, and cold, and is the greater malefic. According to Claudius Ptolemy, [...] "Saturn is lord of the right ear, the spleen, the bladder, the phlegm, and the bones." [...] Saturn symbolized processes and things that were dry and cold, which are necessary balancing aspects to maintain life. It governed the melancholic humor.|$|E

[...] Shocklee's sentiments were reinforced by Chuck D while explaining the group's working methods during production. [...] "Eric was the musician, Hank was the antimusician. Eric did a lot of the [...] programming, [...] Keith was the guy who would bring in the feel." [...] For his contributions to the production side, Chuck stated that he [...] "would scour for vocal samples all over the Earth. I would name a song, tag it, and get the vocal samples." [...] Chuck D also noted the <b>productiveness</b> of Sadler and Shocklee's differing approaches to the creative process. [...] "The friction between Hank and Eric worked very well. Hank would put a twist on Eric's musicianship and Eric's musicianship would put a twist on Hank." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} Atlas Shrugged {{dramatically}} expresses Rand's ethical egoism, her advocacy of [...] "rational selfishness", whereby {{all of the}} principal virtues and vices are applications {{of the role of}} reason as man's basic tool of survival (or a failure to apply it): rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, <b>productiveness,</b> and pride. Rand's characters often personify her view of the archetypes of various schools of philosophy for living and working in the world. Robert James Bidinotto wrote, [...] "Rand rejected the literary convention that depth and plausibility demand characters who are naturalistic replicas of the kinds of people we meet in everyday life, uttering everyday dialogue and pursuing everyday values. But she also rejected the notion that characters should be symbolic rather than realistic." [...] and Rand herself stated, [...] "My characters are never symbols, they are merely men in sharper focus than the audience can see with unaided sight. ...My characters are persons in whom certain human attributes are focused more sharply and consistently than in average human beings".|$|E

Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society. He calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence. Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws {{in order to create}} the greatest good for the greatest number. He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared [...] "right", because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintain the maximum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest number of people.|$|E

60|$|The English-crossed plants, though so {{superior}} in <b>productiveness,</b> were, {{as we have}} seen, decidedly inferior in height and weight to the self-fertilised, and only equal to, or hardly superior to, the intercrossed plants. Therefore, the whole advantage of a cross with a distinct stock is here confined to <b>productiveness,</b> and I have met with no similar case.|$|E

6000|$|As {{the second}} of the [general] causes of {{superior}} <b>productiveness,</b> we may rank the greater energy of labor. By this is not to be understood occasional, but regular and habitual energy. The third element which determines the <b>productiveness</b> of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing, whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor. That the <b>productiveness</b> of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self-evident, and that any progress in those arts, any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses, enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce. One principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery.(114) ...|$|E

60|$|The superiority in <b>productiveness</b> of the intercrossed plants (that is, {{the product}} of a cross between the grandchildren of the plants which grew in Brazil) over the self-fertilised, small as it is, is wholly due to the larger average number of seeds {{contained}} in the capsules; for the intercrossed plants produced fewer capsules in the greenhouse than did the self-fertilised plants. The great superiority in <b>productiveness</b> of the English-crossed over the self-fertilised plants is shown by the larger number of capsules produced, the larger average number of contained seeds, and the smaller number of empty capsules. As the English-crossed and intercrossed plants were the offspring of crosses in every previous generation (as must have been the case from the flowers being sterile with their own pollen), we may conclude that the great superiority in <b>productiveness</b> of the English-crossed over the intercrossed plants is due to the two parents of the former having been long subjected to different conditions.|$|E

60|$|The {{most evident}} cause of {{superior}} <b>productiveness</b> is {{what are called}} natural advantages. These are various. Fertility of soil {{is one of the}} principal.

When coal [...] costs England as much as it does any other nation, then her [...] exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist. In the United [...] States the outlying iron deposits of Lake Superior, Lake [...] Champlain, and Pennsylvania, so geologists tell us, will find [...] competition arising from the new grades of greater <b>productiveness</b> [...] in the richer deposits of States like Alabama.

60|$|With {{respect to}} the <b>productiveness</b> of the crossed and self-fertilised plants of the {{successive}} generations, my observations unfortunately were not made on any uniform plan, partly from the want of time, and partly from not having at first intended to observe {{more than a single}} generation.

60|$|Land {{differs from}} the other {{elements}} of production, labor, and capital, in not being susceptible of indefinite increase. Its extent is limited, {{and the extent of}} the more productive kinds of it more limited still. It is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite. This limited quantity of land and limited <b>productiveness</b> of it are the real limits to the increase of production.|$|E
60|$|The present {{chapter is}} devoted to the Fertility of plants, as {{influenced}} by cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation. The subject consists of two distinct branches; firstly, the relative <b>productiveness</b> or fertility of flowers crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and with their own pollen, as shown by the proportional number of capsules which they produce, together with the number of the contained seeds. Secondly, the degree of innate fertility or sterility of the seedlings raised from crossed and self-fertilised seeds; such seedlings being of the same age, grown under the same conditions, and fertilised in the same manner. These two branches of the subject correspond with the two which have to be considered by any one treating of hybrid plants; namely, in the first place the comparative <b>productiveness</b> of a species when fertilised with pollen from a distinct species and with its own pollen; and in the second place, the fertility of its hybrid offspring. These two classes of cases do not always run parallel; thus some plants, as Gartner has shown, can be crossed with great ease, but yield excessively sterile hybrids; while others are crossed with extreme difficulty, but yield fairly fertile hybrids.|$|E

60|$|This {{inability}} {{may either}} (A), be concealed by meeting demands to the full, until it issue in bankruptcy, {{or in some}} form of national debt;--or (B), it may be concealed during oscillatory movements between destructiveness and <b>productiveness,</b> which result on the whole in stability;--or (C), it may be manifested by the consistent return of less than value received on each presented order, in which case there is a consistent fall in the worth of the currency, or rise in the price of the things represented by it.|$|E
60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary to observe, that no such advantage {{can result from}} the duty, if it operate as a protecting duty; if it induce the country which imposes it, to produce for herself that which she would otherwise have imported. The saving of labour--the increase in the general <b>productiveness</b> of {{the capital of the}} world--which is the effect of commerce, and which a non-protecting duty would enable the country imposing it to engross, could not be engrossed by a protecting duty, because such a duty prevents any such increased production from existing.|$|E
60|$|The <b>productiveness</b> of {{the public}} {{revenues}} hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it, {{but it is not}} expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be requisite, and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of our citizens, who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burthens.|$|E
60|$|This {{plant is}} {{remarkable}} from the crossed seedlings not exceeding in height or vigour the self-fertilised. On the other hand, a cross greatly increases the <b>productiveness</b> {{of the flowers}} on the parent-plant, and is indeed sometimes necessary in order that they should produce any seed; moreover, plants thus derived are themselves much more fertile than those raised from self-fertilised flowers; so that the whole advantage of a cross is confined to the reproductive system. It will be necessary for me to give this singular case in considerable detail.|$|E
