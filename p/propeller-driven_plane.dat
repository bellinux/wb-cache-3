50|$|In 1993, a small <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>plane</b> piloted by Richard Leakey crashed, {{crushing}} {{his lower}} legs, {{both of which}} were later amputated. Sabotage was suspected but never proved. While in the hospital, Leakey told President Moi, a religious man, not to pray for him, but act on matters pending for the Kenya Wildlife Service. In a few months Richard Leakey was walking again on artificial limbs. Around this time the Kenyan government announced that a secret probe had found evidence of corruption and mismanagement in the Kenya Wildlife Service. An annoyed Leakey resigned publicly in a press conference in January 1994. He was replaced by David Western {{as the head of the}} Kenya Wildlife Service.|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of {{military}} aircraft have crashed on the Dark Peak, generally due to atrocious weather conditions. Due to the bleakness and emptiness of the high moorlands, their wrecks tend to remain untouched, and are often stumbled across by hikers in these remote places. There have been reports of ghost planes {{in the area for}} years. Many of the aircraft witnessed are wartime machines such as the Wellington Bomber, B-29 Bomber, Dakota and Lancaster. The reports of eyewitnesses are usually of a low flying, <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>plane,</b> which appears to be in difficulty before seemingly crashing into the moors. Several people who recovered items from the crash site were allegedly then visited by ghosts. The story featured in a 1996 episode of Strange but True? titled [...] "Ghost Planes of the Peaks".|$|E
40|$|Jet {{aircraft}} {{will further}} enhance the medically safe and comfortable transportation of persons with disease. Experience in military medicine, substantiated by civilian commercial air travel experience, has already proved that transportation of sick or disabled persons in <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>planes</b> is essentially benign...|$|R
25|$|During the mid-1950s, Invercargill Airport {{was used}} for fuel top-up and final take off by Operation Deep Freeze. Twin-engine <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>planes</b> destined for McMurdo Sound in the Antarctic used the airport, {{assisted}} in takeoff by JATO rockets. Larger aircraft flew from Christchurch when a permanent Deep Freeze base was established there.|$|R
5000|$|Magan Airport (Аэропорт Маган; Маҕан аэропорда, Mağan aeroporda) [...] {{serves the}} village of Magan, a few {{kilometers}} at the west of Yakutsk, {{the capital of the}} Sakha Republic in Russia. As of 2007 the dirt runway appeared to be former concrete runway and it was highly maintained. Google Earth high-resolution satellite images shows nearly 100 general aviation <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tactical {{bombing was}} the first type of aerial bombing mission. It began in World War I when pilots dropped small bombs {{over the side of}} their open cockpits onto enemy troops below. One of the {{earliest}} examples of tactical bombing was at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915 when the Royal Flying Corps dropped bombs on German rail communications. By the time of World War II a number of specialized aircraft were developed to fulfill this role, including various fighter-bombers. During the Korean War tactical bombing missions were sometimes carried out by older piston-powered fighters such as the Vought F4U Corsair. In the Vietnam War, missions were frequently directed by forward air controllers (FACs) flying small <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>planes.</b> The FAC would mark targets with smoke, often in coordination with infantry on the ground. Bombers orbiting overhead would then fly in to hit the target.|$|R
50|$|At Convair, {{he started}} off {{working on the}} XYF-1 “Pogo” aircraft, a <b>propeller-driven</b> {{experimental}} <b>plane</b> designed to take off and land vertically—but not entirely capable of that elusive, expensive and performance degrading capability. After the project was cancelled, he moved to Edwards Air Force Base {{as part of the}} company’s flight test team, where he worked on the F-106 Delta Dart aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Set in an {{alternate}} history, the game follows the journeys and tribulations {{of a group}} of young fighter pilots involved in aerial dogfighting using <b>propeller-driven</b> fighter <b>planes.</b> Although the world is at peace, in order to ease the tension of a populace accustomed to war and aggression, private corporations contract fighter pilots to stage combat operations against each other for show.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Dengler served {{aboard the}} USS Ranger (CV-61) with VA-145 (Attack Squadron 145). At the time, the {{squadron}} {{was equipped with}} the Douglas AD-6/A-1H Skyraider, a single-engine, <b>propeller-driven</b> attack <b>plane.</b> On the morning of 1 February, Lt. Dengler launched from the Ranger with three other aircraft on an interdiction mission near the Laotian border. Visibility was poor due to weather, and upon rolling in on the target, Lt. Dengler and {{the remainder of his}} flight lost sight of one another. Dengler was the last man in and was hit by anti-aircraft fire. He was forced to crash-land his Skyraider in Laos.|$|R
50|$|Operational and {{technical}} personnel requiring travel to downrange sites boarded U.S. Air Force Military Air Transport Service (MATS) aircraft at Hangar 800 on Patrick Air Force Base. Travel by <b>propeller-driven</b> MATS <b>planes</b> was slow at the time. For example, travel by MATS to the South Atlantic Ocean tracking site at Ascension Island required {{three days of}} travel: Patrick Air Force Base to Surinam, with an overnight stay, then on to Recife, Brazil, with another overnight stay, and then, finally, the flight from Recife to Ascension Island. If traveling personnel were assigned to a tracking vessel awaiting their arrival in the Ascension Island area, {{it was necessary to}} then travel from Clarence Bay at Ascension Island to the vessel by means of motor whaleboat, barge, or other type of small craft, depending on boat schedule and sea condition.|$|R
50|$|The Peace Treaty of Paris of 1947 placed severe {{restrictions}} {{on all of}} the Italian armed forces, but then the establishment of NATO in 1949 with Italy as a founding member brought about the necessity for the modernization of all of the Italian armed forces, including the Italian Air Force. American military aid sent by the Mutual Defense Assistance Program brought about the introduction of American-made P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang <b>propeller-driven</b> fighter <b>planes.</b> Then in 1952, the Italian Air Force was granted jet fighters for the first time, American F-84G Thunderjets and F-86D Sabre jets. Next F-84F jet fighters and C-119 Flying Boxcar transport planes were sent from the United States to the Italian Air Force. The reborn Italian aviation industry also began to develop and produce a few ingenious aircraft designs of its own, such as the Fiat G91, the Aermacchi MB-326, the Piaggio Aero P.166, and the line of Agusta-Bell helicopters.|$|R
2500|$|Carpenter {{was then}} {{appointed}} to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, Class 13, at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland in 1954. He continued at Patuxent until 1957, working as a test pilot in the Electronics Test Division; in this assignment Carpenter conducted flight test projects {{in a variety of}} Navy airplanes, including multi- and single-engine jet aircraft and <b>propeller-driven</b> fighters, attack <b>planes,</b> patrol bombers and seaplanes. In his next tour of duty was spent in Monterey, California, at the Navy Line School. After attending the Naval Air Intelligence School, Washington D.C., for an additional eight months in 1957 and 1958, Carpenter was named Air Intelligence Officer for [...]|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the constant pitch attitude strategy as a possible non-precision maneuver for recovery from inadvertent wind shear encounters. The Wind Shear Training Aid published by the FAA recommends that upon encountering a severe wind shear, the pilot should apply maximum thrust and rotate the aircraft to an initial pitch target angle of 15 degrees. The 15 degrees target was identified through rigorous analyses using six-degree-of-freedom flight simulators and microburst models representative of actual accident cases. It was found that 15 degrees was an effective target for a wide range of shears, and was generally applicable to most jet transports. This work was undertaken to examine the issue of recovery performance in wind shear of other classes of aircraft - notably turboprop commuters and <b>propeller-driven</b> general aviation <b>planes.</b> It should be possible to postulate a target pitch angle (TPA) for such aircraft, as well...|$|R
