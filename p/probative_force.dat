Under this {{fifth and}} last class it is {{convenient}} to arrange all those fallacies {{in which the}} source of error {{is not so much}} a false estimate of the <b>probative</b> <b>force</b> of known evidence, as an indistinct, indefinite, and fluctuating conception of what the evidence is.|$|E

We have now to inquire, whether the syllogistic process, that of reasoning from generals to particulars, is, or is not, a process of inference; a progress from the known to the unknown: a means of coming to a knowledge of something which we did not know before.|$|E
60|$|Now {{an error}} or fallacy of analogy may occur in two ways. Sometimes it {{consists}} in employing an argument {{of either of}} the above kinds with correctness indeed, but overrating its <b>probative</b> <b>force.</b> This very common aberration is sometimes supposed to be particularly incident to persons distinguished for their imagination; but in reality it is the characteristic intellectual vice of those whose imaginations are barren, either from want of exercise, natural defect, or the narrowness of their range of ideas. To such minds objects present themselves clothed in but few properties; and as, therefore, few analogies between one object and another occur to them, they almost invariably overrate the degree of importance of those few: while one whose fancy takes a wider range, perceives and remembers so many analogies tending to conflicting conclusions, that he is {{much less likely to}} lay undue stress on any of them. We always find that those are the greatest slaves to metaphorical language who have but one set of metaphors.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, it {{will appear}} on consideration, that this {{apparently}} so decisive instance is no instance at all; that there is in every step of an arithmetical or algebraical calculation a real induction, a real inference of facts from facts; and that what disguises the induction is simply its comprehensive nature, and the consequent extreme generality of the language. All numbers must be numbers of something: {{there are no such}} things as numbers in the abstract. Ten must mean ten bodies, or ten sounds, or ten beatings of the pulse. But though numbers must be numbers of something, they may be numbers of any thing. Propositions, therefore, concerning numbers, have the remarkable peculiarity that they are propositions concerning all things whatever; all objects, all existences of every kind, known to our experience. All things possess quantity; consist of parts which can be numbered; and in that character possess all the properties which are called properties of numbers. That half of four is two, must be true whatever the word four represents, whether four hours, four miles, or four pounds weight. We need only conceive a thing divided into four equal parts (and all things may be conceived as so divided), to be able to predicate of it every property of the number four, that is, every arithmetical proposition in which the number four stands {{on one side of the}} equation. Algebra extends the generalization still farther: every number represents that particular number of all things without distinction, but every algebraical symbol does more, it represents all numbers without distinction. As soon as we conceive a thing divided into equal parts, without knowing into what number of parts, we may call it a or x, and apply to it, without danger of error, every algebraical formula in the books. The proposition, 2 (a + b)= 2 a + 2 b, is a truth co-extensive with all nature. Since then algebraical truths are true of all things whatever, and not, like those of geometry, true of lines only or of angles only, it is no wonder that the symbols should not excite in our minds ideas of any things in particular. When we demonstrate the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid, it is not necessary that the words should raise in us an image of all right-angled triangles, but only of some one right-angled triangle: so in algebra we need not, under the symbol a, picture to ourselves all things whatever, but only some one thing; why not, then, the letter itself? The mere written characters, a, b, x, y, z, serve as well for representatives of Things in general, as any more complex and apparently more concrete conception. That we are conscious of them, however, in their character of things, and not of mere signs, is evident from the fact that our whole process of reasoning is carried on by predicating of them the properties of things. In resolving an algebraic equation, by what rules do we proceed? By applying at each step to a, b, and x, the proposition that equals added to equals make equals; that equals taken from equals leave equals; and other propositions founded on these two. These are not properties of language, or of signs as such, but of magnitudes, which is as much as to say, of all things. The inferences, therefore, which are successively drawn, are inferences concerning things, not symbols; though as any Things whatever will serve the turn, there is no necessity for keeping the idea of the Thing at all distinct, and consequently the process of thought may, in this case, be allowed without danger to do what all processes of thought, when they have been performed often, will do if permitted, namely, to become entirely mechanical. Hence the general language of algebra comes to be used familiarly without exciting ideas, as all other general language is prone to do from mere habit, though in no other case than this can it be done with complete safety. But when we look back to see from whence the <b>probative</b> <b>force</b> of the process is derived, we find that at every single step, unless we suppose ourselves to be thinking and talking of the things, and not the mere symbols, the evidence fails.|$|E
60|$|Even the scientifically instructed, who possess, in {{the form}} of general propositions, a {{systematic}} record {{of the results of the}} experience of mankind, need not always revert to those general propositions in order to apply that experience to a new case. It is justly remarked by Dugald Stewart, that though the reasonings in mathematics depend entirely on the axioms, it is by no means necessary to our seeing the conclusiveness of the proof, that the axioms should be expressly adverted to. When it is inferred that AB is equal to CD because each of them is equal to EF, the most uncultivated understanding, as soon as the propositions were understood, would assent to the inference, without having ever heard of the general truth that “things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.” This remark of Stewart, consistently followed out, goes to the root, as I conceive, of the philosophy of ratiocination; and it is to be regretted that he himself stopped short at a much more limited application of it. He saw that the general propositions on which a reasoning is said to depend, may, in certain cases, be altogether omitted, without impairing its <b>probative</b> <b>force.</b> But he imagined this to be a peculiarity belonging to axioms; and argued from it, that axioms are not the foundations or first principles of geometry, from which all the other truths of the science are synthetically deduced (as the laws of motion and of the composition of forces in dynamics, the equal mobility of fluids in hydrostatics, the laws of reflection and refraction in optics, are the first principles of those sciences); but are merely necessary assumptions, self-evident indeed, and the denial of which would annihilate all demonstration, but from which, as premises, nothing can be demonstrated. In the present, as in many other instances, this thoughtful and elegant writer has perceived an important truth, but only by halves. Finding, in the case of geometrical axioms, that general names have not any talismanic virtue for conjuring new truths out of the well where they lie hid, and not seeing that this is equally true in every other case of generalization, he contended that axioms are in their nature barren of consequences, and that the really fruitful truths, the real first principles of geometry, are the definitions; that the definition, for example, of the circle is to the properties of the circle, what the laws of equilibrium and of the pressure of the atmosphere are to the rise of the mercury in the Torricellian tube. Yet all that he had asserted respecting the function to which the axioms are confined in the demonstrations of geometry, holds equally true of the definitions. Every demonstration in Euclid might be carried on without them. This is apparent from the ordinary process of proving a proposition of geometry by means of a diagram. What assumption, in fact, do we set out from, to demonstrate by a diagram any of the properties of the circle? Not that in all circles the radii are equal, but only that they are so in the circle ABC. As our warrant for assuming this, we appeal, it is true, to the definition of a circle in general; but it is only necessary that the assumption be granted in the case of the particular circle supposed. From this, which is not a general but a singular proposition, combined with other propositions of a similar kind, some of which when generalized are called definitions, and other axioms, we prove that a certain conclusion is true, not of all circles, but of the particular circle ABC; or at least would be so, if the facts precisely accorded with our assumptions. The enunciation, as it is called, that is, the general theorem which stands at the head of the demonstration, is not the proposition actually demonstrated. One instance only is demonstrated: but the process by which this is done, is a process which, when we consider its nature, we perceive might be exactly copied in an indefinite number of other instances; in every instance which conforms to certain conditions. The contrivance of general language furnishing us with terms which connote these conditions, we are able to assert this indefinite multitude of truths in a single expression, and this expression is the general theorem. By dropping the use of diagrams, and substituting, in the demonstrations, general phrases for the letters of the alphabet, we might prove the general theorem directly, that is, we might demonstrate all the cases at once; and to do this we must, of course, employ as our premises, the axioms and definitions in their general form. But this only means, that if we can prove an individual conclusion by assuming an individual fact, then in whatever case we are warranted in making an exactly similar assumption, we may draw an exactly similar conclusion. The definition is a sort of notice to ourselves and others, what assumptions we think ourselves entitled to make. And so in all cases, the general propositions, whether called definitions, axioms, or laws of nature, which we lay down at the beginning of our reasonings, are merely abridged statements, in a kind of short-hand, of the particular facts, which, as occasion arises, we either think we may proceed on as proved, or intend to assume. In any one demonstration it is enough if we assume for a particular case suitably selected, what by the statement of the definition or principle we announce that we intend to assume in all cases which may arise. The definition of the circle, therefore, is to one of Euclid’s demonstrations, exactly what, according to Stewart, the axioms are; that is, the demonstration does not depend on it, but yet if we deny it the demonstration fails. The proof does not rest on the general assumption, but on a similar assumption confined to the particular case: that case, however, being chosen as a specimen or paradigm of the whole class of cases included in the theorem, there can be no ground for making the assumption in that case which does not exist in every other; and to deny the assumption as a general truth, is to deny the right of making it in the particular instance.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} in how far successful {{simulation of}} a thrombin generation (TG) curve gives {{information about the}} underlying biochemical reaction mechanism. Results: The large majority of TG curves do not contain more information than can be expressed by four parameters. A limited kinetic mechanism of six reactions, comprising proteolytic activation of factor (F) X and FII, feedback activation of FV, a cofactor function of FVa and thrombin inactivation by antithrombin can simulate any TG curve {{in a number of}} different ways. The information content of a TG curve is thus much smaller than the information required to describe a physiologically realistic reaction scheme of TG. Consequently, much of the input information is irrelevant for the output. FVIII deficiency or activation of protein C can, for example, be simulated by a reaction mechanism in which these factors do not occur. Conclusion: A model that comprises not more than six reactions can simulate the same TG curve in a number of possible ways. The possibilities increase exponentially as the model grows more realistic. Successful simulation of experimental data therefore does not validate the underlying assumptions. A fortiori, simulation that is not checked against experimental data lacks any <b>probative</b> <b>force.</b> Simulation can be of use, however, to detect mistaken hypotheses and for parameter estimation in systems with fewer than five free parameters...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cardiovascular}} {{events are}} clinical manifestations of underlying atherosclerotic disease. The progression of atherosclerosis, traditionally measured by angiography, is predictive of future clinical events {{and is a}} valid surrogate marker of cardiovascular (CV) disease. There is growing interest in using novel surrogate end points in clinical trials to expedite {{the development of new}} CV therapies. Innovative imaging technologies, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), may carry advantages for the evaluation of coronary atherosclerotic burden and disease progression. Unlike angiography, which displays only the opacified luminal “silhouette,” IVUS provides transmural imaging of the entire arterial wall and permits both detection of early-stage atherosclerosis and accurate cross-sectional and even 3 -dimensional quantification of plaques. Intravascular ultrasound is now used to guide therapeutic interventions and for diagnostic purposes, primarily for the evaluation of ambiguous lesions and left main coronary artery disease. In addition, clinical studies are using IVUS serially to measure plaque progression, which appears to be related to future CV events. Although the <b>probative</b> <b>force</b> of clinical end point studies still is stronger, IVUS is catching up. Currently, several trials of CV therapies use IVUS-determined plaque progression as the end point. The rationale for using IVUS-based surrogate end points in clinical trials is discussed in the present review. Key advantages of using IVUS-based surrogate end points versus clinical outcome include smaller patient numbers and substantially shorter trial durations; this reduces costs and may expedite the development and testing of new drugs. We expect in the near future a further increase of the use of IVUS-based surrogate end points in trials that evaluate novel CV therapies targeting on coronary atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|The French Law of {{evidence}} {{is at the}} crossroad between procedural law and civil law. As part of the procedural law, it is governed by general principles set out by the Code de procédure civile, such as the contradictory principle, the principle of public hearing or the free disposition principle, {{which means that the}} parties define the framework of the proceeding and that the judge cannot base his decision on facts that were not put forward by the parties themselves. It is also the Code de procédure civile that organises the respective roles of the judge and the parties for the taking {{of evidence}}: since 1976, it imposes a – rather complex – balance between adversarial and inquisitorial principles. Other general principles were set by case law, e. g. the principle that no one can pre-constitute evidence in his own favour or the principle of fair evidence. On the other hand, more substantive rules {{are to be found in}} the Code civil. These rules mix two systems, the system of the preuve morale, applicable in some specific litigation, and the system of the preuve légale, which is clearly dominant in civil litigation. In the first system, evidence is in principle free, which means not only that any mode of proof is admissible, but also that assessment of evidence by the judges is free. In the second one, only determined means of evidence are admissible and their <b>probative</b> <b>force</b> is often set out by law. A majority of evidence rules derive more or less directly from this summa divisio. In fact, the predominance of the preuve légale system has made the French system of evidence rather rigid, in particular regarding the exaggerated importance of written evidence...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} three {{quarters}} of the twentieth century, the Wigmore treatise was the dominant force in organizing, setting out, and explaining the American law of evidence. Since then, the first two of those roles have been taken over in large part by the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rules). And the third has been performed most notably by the Weinstein treatise. Judge Jack Weinstein was present at the creation of the Rules and before. Though he first made his name in Civil Procedure, while still a young man he joined two of the stalwarts of evidence law, Edmund Morgan and John Maguire, to become the junior— that is, the laboring—author on the oldest textbook in the field. He was a natural selection {{to be a member of}} the Advisory Committee that drafted the Rules. The Rules were finally enacted in 1975, and though handling a full docket on the bench and teaching a full load at Columbia Law School, he was ready: He published his monumental treatise with Margaret Berger the same year. In this Article, I will take another look, more than half a century later, at Judge Weinstein’s most important early contribution to the law of hearsay. In an article published in 1961, <b>Probative</b> <b>Force</b> of Hearsay, he argued for a more discretionary approach to hearsay, functionally oriented and procedurally sensitive. In early drafts, the Advisory Committee appeared willing to give the trial judge broad discretion over the admissibility of hearsay, much as Judge Weinstein had advocated. But public commentary and congressional resistance resulted in rules that took a more cautious approach: a definition of hearsay followed by a list of exemptions. It was a long list, to be sure, and one that included a matched pair of open-ended residual exceptions. But this approach maintained the essential structure of traditional hearsay law and ensured that much of the work in applying that law would consist of determining the bounds of the enumerated exemptions...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{the large amount of}} {{information}} about the events occurred on 15 th February 2012 off the coast of Southern India the fragmented and unverifiable data coming from various sources make very difficult to carry out technical surveys having legal validity. It is obvious that both the expert of each party and the assessor need to have access to all documents and exhibits. In the Italian judicial system and legal proceedings both assessors and experts of the claimant and of the defendant take part in the technical survey process because the technical survey can have <b>probative</b> <b>force</b> and tend to prove a matter at issue. In the case of the jailed Italian marines issue, the unilateral decision of the Indian authorities not to allow the Italian forensic experts (the experts of the defendant) {{to take part in the}} technical survey process preventing them in this way from carrying out the technical survey together with the Indian experts (the experts of the claimant) violates the principles of a fair process.

40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the evaluation of interventions based on farm advisory services. The aim is to provide guidelines for producing evidence about the effectiveness of such interventions. These guidelines have been tested on a specific case: the effectiveness of farm advice for reducing occupational exposure to pesticides of farm labour. In the first section, we discuss the distinction between the different objectives which an evaluation of farm advisory programmes can endorse. We propose to distinguish three major goals for evaluation, by adopting the typology of Berriet et al. (2014) : i) to measure the impact of farm advisory programmes; ii) to understand the causal path that generates changes through farm advisory programmes; and iii) to support learning processes for the stakeholders involved in a programme to in turn enhance its implementation. A key point of this typology is that it allows for reflection on the methodology which is needed to gather the best possible evidence according to the goal pursued by the evaluation. The ‘best’ possibleevidence should be: a) socially relevant to those concerned (external validity); b) based on types of evidence (evidence of presence, of difference-making, of mechanism) which is adequate for the purpose of the evaluation; c) reliable (produced using rigorous methods, to ensure the highest degree of <b>probative</b> <b>force,</b> i. e. the highest level of evidence). Numerous studies provide frameworks for describing the impact schemes (or causal paths) of farm advisory service interventions, however there is a clear knowledge gap regarding the actual of their impact, especially in Europe. The second section is focused on this specific question of impact assessment of interventions based on the support given to farm advisory services. It highlights the fact that many methods (experimental or quasi-experimental) are now available to implement impact assessments. It also gives some critical points for evaluating the internal quality of studies based on such methods and for identifying their limits of validity for practice. A key dimension is that the results of impact assessments of farm advice interventions might not be extrapolated beyond the very context where the study was implemented. This statement calls for a need for reviews that combine results from impact assessments implemented in various contexts. The third section poposes methodological corner stones for the implementation of such systematic reviews about the effectiveness of farm advice. It describes the different steps for implementing this methodology, and proposes some examples of analytical tools such as: i) algorithms and diagrams to search and sort the papers; ii) tables to describe and evaluate the quality of papers; iii) criteria to combine evidence from different researches. We tested this methodology on a specific case: the effectiveness of farm advice regarding the reduction of occupational exposure to pesticides of farm labour. The case study is presented extensively in section 6. The results highlight a specific knowledge gap in the European context. There are almost no studies on the impact of farm advice on health issues in European agriculture. Nevertheless, the systematic review reveals that some positive effects of interventions (training, advice [...] .) on farmers and workers have been demonstrated in North Ameca (Canada and United States of America) ...|$|E
