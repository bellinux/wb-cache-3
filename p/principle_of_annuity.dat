We find that beneficial partial-equilibrium effects <b>of</b> stimulating <b>annuity</b> markets are counteracted by negative general-equilibrium repercussions. Balancing the positive partial-equilibrium and negative general-equilibrium forces {{we show that}} there exists some intermediate level of an-nuitization such that long-run welfare is maximized.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} systematic longevity risk, i. e., the risk arising from uncertain future survival probabilities, on the attractiveness of different types <b>of</b> <b>annuities.</b> We consider a life-cycle framework with expected utility where an individual faces both investment and longevity risk. In contrast to existing literature we allow not only for idiosyncratic, but also for systematic longevity risk. When comparing the expected lifetime utility, conditional on the type <b>of</b> <b>annuity</b> which is purchased, we find for a 65 -year old male that (i) systematic longevity risk reduces the attractiveness <b>of</b> <b>annuities,</b> (ii) when an immediate annuity is purchased, the expected lifetime utility is decreasing in the postponement period, (iii) when in the future purchasing an immediate <b>annuities,</b> the effect <b>of</b> {{the evolution of the}} survival probabilities on the optimal fraction of annuitized wealth is large, and (iv) the optimal annuity to purchase at retirement is a deferred annuity which starts to pay after only a short deferral period. However, when the purchase <b>of</b> an <b>annuity</b> with the optimal deferral period is compared to the purchase <b>of</b> an immediate <b>annuity</b> at retirement date, the utility gain is negligibly small...|$|R

40|$|Individuals can insure {{themselves}} perfectly against {{uncertainty about}} the length of life by purchasing deferred annuities early in life. In the absence of other uninsurable uncertainties (e. g. income), there will be no residual purchases or sales <b>of</b> <b>annuities</b> later in life, thereby avoiding any adverse-selection. In contrast, the presence of such uncertainties creates an active residual annuity market based on the arrival of new information. We characterize the equilibrium in the residual annuity market and propose a new …nancial instrument, refundable annuities with a guaranteed refund price, which enables individuals who hold a portfolio <b>of</b> such <b>annuities</b> to better adjust their optimum consumption plan to di¤erent realizations. Refundable annuities are shown to be equivalent to annuity options, that is, options that, if exercised, enable the purchase <b>of</b> <b>annuities</b> later in life at a predetermined price. Holding a variety <b>of</b> refundable <b>annuities</b> is (ex-ante) welfare enhancing...|$|R
