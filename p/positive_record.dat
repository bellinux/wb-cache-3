5|$|Nishikori and Raonic {{are among}} a group of players whom tennis pundits suggest could be the successors of the Big Four. The members of this group vary, but have {{included}} Grigor Dimitrov, Ernests Gulbis, Marin Cilic, and Dominic Thiem. Raonic holds a <b>positive</b> <b>record</b> against Gulbis and Thiem, having won in all six occasions, but has negative record against Čilić and Dimitrov, most notably having lost in four matches to the latter in five meetings.|$|E
5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most <b>positive</b> <b>record</b> we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

25|$|In {{head-to-head}} terms, Leinster dominate Irish provincial rivals Ulster with a 27–7 win-loss record. Similarly Leinster enjoy a 22–7 win:loss ratio against western province Connacht. Leinster hold only {{a narrow}} head-to-head lead against arch-rivals Munster {{in one of}} the most intense derbies in world rugby, where they possess a 20–15 advantage. Munster are the closest Pro12 team to having a <b>positive</b> <b>record</b> against Leinster - all of the league's other sides have substantial losing records against Leinster. The Welsh side Celtic Warriors existed in the league for its first couple of seasons and have a <b>positive</b> <b>record</b> against Leinster of two wins and zero defeats, but the sides only ever played a couple of matches head-to-head before Celtic Warriors and a number of other Welsh clubs went out of business or merged. This was also at a time when Leinster were nowhere near as strong as they are now.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, artist George Southwell was {{commissioned}} to paint murals in the rotunda depicting scenes from British Columbia history from 1792 to 1843. The work was completed three years later. Decades later, controversy arose over {{the depiction of}} west coast aboriginal people in the murals, which in modern times is now regarded as degrading. One mural, entitled Labour, portrays bare-breasted aboriginal women hauling timber while a white man watches. In another entitled Justice, an aboriginal chief is shown standing before a judge (said to be Matthew Baillie Begbie), suggesting the subjugation of natives to colonial law. However, Southwell's daughter claimed that her father depicted the chief as standing before another judge, one who championed native rights (notwithstanding Begbie's <b>positive</b> <b>record</b> in that regard).|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{brought some}} memorable moments for the team, {{particularly}} a dramatic one-point {{loss to the}} United States at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, where a win by Puerto Rico {{would have been the}} first undisputed basketball loss for the United States team at an Olympic competition. Also, the 1974 World Championship and the 1979 Pan American Games were held in San Juan, promoting local enthusiasm for international basketball and Puerto Rico's presence in it. The 7th and 10th places at the 1974 and 1978 World Championships, where the team, led by Hector Blondet and Rubén Rodríguez respectively, saw 2–5 and 4–3 finishes, became turning points for the Puerto Rican team. The 4–3 showing in 1978 in the Philippines was the first time ever the team finished with a <b>positive</b> <b>record</b> at a World Championship. These achievements were accompanied by golds at the 1973 CentroBasket and the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games. In all, Puerto Rico continued its regional success and was able to medal in all regional competitions.|$|E

6000|$|I gather {{from the}} above the very flower of my father's irrepressible {{utterance}} of his constitutional optimism, that optimism fed so little by any sense of things as they were or are, but rich in its vision of the facility with which they might become almost at any moment or {{from one day to}} the other totally and splendidly different. A less vague or vain idealist couldn't, I think, have been encountered; it was given him to catch in the fact at almost any turn right or left some flagrant assurance or promise of the state of man transfigured. The Concord school could be to him for the hour--there were hours and hours!--such a promise; could even figure in that light, to his amplifying sympathy, in a degree disproportionate to its genial, but after all limited, after all not so intensely [...] "inflated," [...] as he would have said, sense of itself. In which light it is that I recognise, and even to elation, how little, practically, of the idea of the Revolution in the vulgar or violent sense was involved in his seeing so many things, in the whole social order about him, and in the interest of their being more or less immediately altered, as lamentably, and {{yet at the same time}} and under such a coloured light, as amusingly and illustratively, wrong--wrong, that is, with a blundering helpless human salience that kept criticism humorous, kept it, so to speak, sociable and almost [...] "sympathetic" [...] even when readiest. The case was really of his rather feeling so vast a rightness close at hand or lurking immediately behind actual arrangements that a single turn of the inward wheel, one real response to pressure of the spiritual spring, would bridge the chasms, straighten the distortions, rectify the relations and, in a word, redeem and vivify the whole mass--after a far sounder, yet, one seemed to see, also far subtler, fashion than any that our spasmodic annals had yet shown us. It was of course the old story that we had only to be with more intelligence and faith--an immense deal more, certainly--in order to work off, in the happiest manner, the many-sided ugliness of life; which was a process that might go on, blessedly, in the quietest of all quiet ways. That wouldn't be blood and fire and tears, or would be none of these things stupidly precipitated; it would simply have taken place by enjoyed communication and contact, enjoyed concussion or convulsion even--since pangs and agitations, the very agitations of perception itself, are of the highest privilege of the soul and there is always, thank goodness, a saving sharpness of play or complexity of consequence in the intelligence completely alive. The meaning of which remarks for myself, I must be content to add, is that the optimists of the world, the constructive idealists, as one has mainly known them, have too often struck one as overlooking more of the aspects of the real than they recognise; whereas our indefeasible impression, William's and mine, of our parent was that he by his very constitution and intimate heritage recognised many more of those than he overlooked. What was the finest part of our intercourse with him--that is the most nutritive--but a <b>positive</b> <b>record</b> of that? Such a matter as that the factitious had absolutely no hold on him was the truest thing about him, and it was all the while present to us, I think, as backing up his moral authority and play of vision that never, for instance, had there been a more numerous and candid exhibition of all the human susceptibilities than in the nest of his original nurture. I have spoken of the fashion in which I still see him, after the years, attentively bent over those much re-written [...] "papers," [...] that we had, even at our stupidest, this warrant for going in vague admiration of that they caught the eye, even the most filially detached, with a final face of wrought clarity, and thereby of beauty, that there could be no thinking unimportant--and see him also fall back from the patient posture, again and again, in long fits of remoter consideration, wondering, pondering sessions into which I think I was more often than not moved to read, for the fine interest and colour of it, some story of acute inward difficulty amounting for the time to discouragement. If one wanted drama there was drama, and of the most concrete and most immediately offered to one's view and one's suspense; to the point verily, as might often occur, of making one go roundabout it on troubled tiptoe even as one would have held one's breath at the play.|$|E
