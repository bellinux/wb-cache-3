5|$|Published by Joseph Johnson, Mary {{itself was}} {{moderately}} successful, and sections {{of it were}} included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were <b>popular</b> <b>at</b> the time, such as The Young Gentleman and Lady's Instructor (1809).

It was not reprinted until the 1970s, when scholars became interested in Wollstonecraft and women's writing more generally.|$|E

5|$|The {{painted turtle}} is {{sometimes}} eaten {{but is not}} highly regarded as food, as even the largest subspecies, the western painted turtle, is inconveniently small and larger turtles are available. Schools frequently dissect painted turtles, which are sold by biological supply companies; specimens often come from the wild but may be captive-bred. In the Midwest, turtle racing is <b>popular</b> <b>at</b> summer fairs.|$|E
5|$|Books and scripts {{that use}} the general story line of Austen's novels but change or {{otherwise}} modernise the story also became <b>popular</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} 20th century. Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both Pride and Prejudice and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production Bride and Prejudice, which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become <b>popular</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, {{following}} in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, as well as computer science. After graduation, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he later became friends. They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin's data mining system to build a web search engine. The program became <b>popular</b> <b>at</b> Stanford, and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in a rented garage.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first subway opened in 1904, the lines had been {{consolidated}} into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The city built most of the lines and leased them to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended {{to compete with the}} private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down, but stayed within the core of the City due to its small startup capital. This required it to be run 'at cost', necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare <b>popular</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E
