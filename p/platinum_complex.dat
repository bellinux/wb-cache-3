In 1965, Barnett Rosenberg, Van Camp et al. of Michigan State University discovered that electrolysis of platinum electrodes generated a soluble <b>platinum</b> <b>complex</b> which inhibited binary fission in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. Although bacterial cell growth continued, cell division was arrested, the bacteria growing as filaments up to 300 times their normal length. [...] The octahedral Pt(IV) complex cis-, but not the trans isomer, was found to be effective at forcing [...] filamentous growth [...] of E. coli cells. The square planar Pt(II) complex, cis- turned out to be even more effective at forcing filamentous growth. This finding led to the observation that cis- was indeed highly effective at regressing the mass of sarcomas in rats. Confirmation of this discovery, and [...] extension of testing to other tumour cell lines launched the medicinal applications of cisplatin. [...] Cisplatin was approved for use in testicular and ovarian cancers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 19 December 1978., and in the UK (and in several other European countries) in 1979.|$|E

Sixteen cyclometalated <b>platinum</b> <b>complexes</b> have been synthesized with different coordination patterns, which include six complexes with tridentate N^C*N cyclometalating ligands (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18), five complexes with N^N*C cyclometalating ligands (19 a, 19 b, 20 a, 20 b, and 24), three complexes with N^N^C cyclometalating ligands (21 a, 21 b, and 29) and two complexes with tetradentate C^C*N^N cyclometalating ligands (33 and 34).

AG(3) (T(2) AG(3)) (3) has been previously found to adopt two different quadruplex structures: the antiparallel one in a solution containing Na(+) and the parallel one in a K(+) -containing crystal. The two structures are strikingly distinct and are not expected to form the same platinum cross-links. Therefore, characterization of the cross-links formed with <b>platinum</b> <b>complexes</b> in solution allowed the predominant conformation(s) to be identified. The bases coordinating the platinum atoms were identified by chemical and 3 '-exonuclease digestions. The observed cross-links showed that the parallel structure exists in solution whatever the cation and confirmed the existence of the antiparallel structure in the presence of both cations as previously reported from cross-linking experiments of AG(3) (T(2) AG(3)) (3) by mononuclear <b>platinum</b> <b>complexes.</b> Furthermore, the major platinum cross-links were unexpectedly formed between two guanines belonging to the same G-quartet. Their formation was rationalized using molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent of the two quadruplex structures.

40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the cellular basis of the platinum cytotoxicity of two novel <b>platinum</b> <b>complexes,</b> 3 Pt and 1 Pt, in comparison with that of cisplatin. 3 Pt comprises anionic phosphate moieties, while 1 Pt comprises neutral aromatic ligands. Methods: We compared the cytotoxic potency of 3 Pt and 1 Pt with that of cisplatin in osteosarcoma cell lines and an orthotopic mouse model. Results: The cytotoxic potency of 3 Pt was markedly {{higher than that of}} cisplatin in all cell lines. Both novel <b>platinum</b> <b>complexes</b> showed a complete lack of cross resistance in cisplatin-resistant cells. Caffeine enhanced the cytotoxic potency of these novel <b>platinum</b> <b>complexes,</b> as observed for cisplatin. Apoptosis after drug administration was observed by DNA ladder formation and an annexin V/PI assay. DNA double-strand breaks were confirmed by phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX. In vivo, the antitumor activity of 3 Pt and 1 Pt was superior and similar, respectively, to that of cisplatin. Both novel <b>platinum</b> <b>complexes</b> exerted strong antitumor effects on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: 3 Pt may be an effective drug for the treatment of bone cancer because the PO 3 moiety has a high affinity to bone, as exhibited by bisphosphonates, and is expected to decrease the incidence of side effects at extraskeletal sites and overcome drug resistance. Cationic 1 Pt may also be an effective antitumor drug because of its unique chemical structure and properties.
