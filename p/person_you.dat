5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial Closet {{this small}} {{building}} was situated {{to the east}} of the Temple of Friendship designed by Gibbs and built in 1739. The interior had paintings of Titus, Hadrian & Marcus Aurelius with these inscriptions beneath each painting: 'Diem perdidi' (I have lost the day), 'Pro me: si merear in me' (For me, but if I deserve it, against me) & 'Ita regnes imperator, ut privatus regi tevelis' (So govern when an emperor, as, if a private <b>person,</b> <b>you</b> would desire to be governed). The building was demolished in 1759.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined <b>person,</b> <b>you</b> count around the circle n times. Once you reach the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E

500|$|Libby is {{a mysterious}} {{character}}, {{seated at the}} tail-section of the plane. Her character was written {{to be in her}} late forties to early fifties, easy on the eyes, amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good at what she does, most people will not know she is not what she seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters. She's that <b>person</b> <b>you</b> want in the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Hard Candy {{came from a}} news story {{producer}} David W. Higgins saw on 20/20 about young Japanese girls who would lure older businessmen to a location {{with the promise of}} meaningful conversation, only to assault and mug the men with a gang of other girls. This led him to wonder, [...] "What if the <b>person</b> <b>you</b> expect to be the predator is not who you expect it to be? What if it's the other person?" [...] He then hired writer Brian Nelson to flesh out the idea. Due to the controversial nature of the work, the budget was kept under $1 million so that the production company would not ask to change anything.|$|E

500|$|... "The Cure" [...] {{was written}} after Gaga's {{performance}} at the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga worked with longtime collaborator DJ White Shadow (aka Paul Blair) for the track. He recalled sitting with Gaga and feeling a positive vibe, which led them to write the track described by Blair as [...] "upbeat and cool". Their camaraderie originated due to the [...] "terrible stuff {{going on in the}} world right now, it's like when you're a creative <b>person</b> <b>you</b> do your best to try and combat evil with creative stuff, so that was kind of the vibe." [...] Gaga and her team wanted to release the [...] "one-off" [...] single as soon as production was completed.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{process was}} a {{collaborative}} effort consisting of Vinnie, Darrell, and Lachman. Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, [...] "the crumbling of one empire and then starting over... So {{there are a lot}} of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new." [...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a <b>person</b> <b>you</b> know with a beer bottle".|$|E
500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the <b>person.</b> <b>You</b> could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the <b>person</b> <b>you</b> will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{delivered}} by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and {{were applied to}} the 1,000 or so shots in the film, {{though most of the}} effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: [...] "The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real <b>person.</b> <b>You</b> have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive <b>Person,</b> <b>you</b> yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E

Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, Beyoncé's former bandmates from the group Destiny's Child provided background vocals along with Stefan Skarbek and Boots. The audio mixing of [...] "Superpower" [...] was completed by Tony Maserati at Mirrorbal Studios and Clockworks Studios and the track was eventually mastered by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill at Sterling Sound. Beyoncé explained on her iTunes Radio channel that she considered [...] "Superpower" [...] to be a [...] "powerful" [...] song with strong vocals; she went on saying, [...] "he lyrics that Frank Ocean wrote... it's like he thought of one thing and the thought just keeps going and going...

500|$|The 2001 film Legally Blonde {{marked a}} turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, [...] "When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make sure she was the kind of <b>person</b> <b>you</b> just can't hate." [...] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, {{grossing}} US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as [...] "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and Salon.com noted that [...] "she [...] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, [...] "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." [...] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.|$|E
500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the <b>person.</b> <b>You</b> know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da Villian.|$|E
