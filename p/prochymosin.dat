40|$|Activation of {{the four}} {{separate}} components of <b>prochymosin</b> (prorennin) at pH 5. 0 demonstrated that each zymogen was the precursor to an electrophoretically distinct chymosin (rennin). When the increase in milk-clotting activity with time was analysed, the mechanism of activation of unfractionated <b>prochymosin,</b> individual <b>prochymosin</b> components, and a mixture of the <b>prochymosin</b> fractions at pH 5. 0 was shown to follow essentially autocatalytic kinetics. The activation of <b>prochymosin</b> C was completed in 70 h, whereas the other three fractions each required more than 110 h for complete activation under the same conditions. Intact <b>prochymosin,</b> the mixture of four components and <b>prochymosin</b> C were activated at similar rates. Interaction of the individual fractions during activation is suggested to explain the increased rate of the activation for the mixture. Comparison of autocatalytic activation of unfractionated <b>prochymosin</b> purified chromatographically at pH 6. 7 and 5. 7 demonstrated an increased rate of reaction of the zymogen prepared at the lower pH value. The possibility that <b>prochymosin</b> became susceptible to activation during preparation at pH values slightly below 6. 0, {{as a result of}} changes in the proportion of the components or a conformational change and exposure of the active site, is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The disulphide-coupled {{refolding}} of recombinant <b>prochymosin</b> from Escherichia coli {{inclusion bodies}} was investigated. <b>Prochymosin</b> solubilized from inclusion bodies is endowed with free thiol groups and disulphide bonds. This partially reduced form undergoes renaturation {{more efficiently than}} the fully reduced form, suggesting that some native structural elements existing in inclusion bodies and remaining after denaturation function as nuclei to initiate correct refolding. This assumption {{is supported by the}} finding that in the solubilized <b>prochymosin</b> molecule the cysteine residues located in the N-terminal domain of the protein are not incorrectly paired with the other cysteines in the C-terminal domain. Addition of GSH/GSSG into the refolding system facilitates disulphide rearrangement and thus enhances renaturation, especially for the fully reduced <b>prochymosin.</b> Based on the results described in this and previous papers [Tang, Zhang and Yang (1994) Biochem. J. 301, 17 - 20], a model to depict the refolding process of <b>prochymosin</b> is proposed. Briefly, the refolding process of <b>prochymosin</b> consists of two stages: the formation and rearrangement of disulphide bonds occurs at the first stage in a pH 11 buffer, whereas the formation and adjustment of tertiary structure leading to the native conformation takes place at the second stage at pH 8. The pH 11 conditions help polypeptides to refold {{in such a way as}} to favour the formation of native disulphide bonds. Disulphide rearrangement, the rate-limiting step during refolding, can be achieved by thiol/disulphide exchange initiated by free thiol groups present in the <b>prochymosin</b> polypeptide, GSH/GSSG or protein disulphide isomerase...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{reports have}} shown that {{synthesis}} of certain recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli results {{in the production of}} intracellular inclusion bodies. These studies have not analyzed the structure of the inclusion body especially regarding the intermolecular forces holding it together. We have examined structural aspects of inclusion bodies made in E. coli as a result of high level expression of the eukaryotic protein, calf <b>prochymosin.</b> <b>Prochymosin</b> is a monomeric protein containing three disulfide bridges. It was expressed at up to 20 % of cell protein from a plasmid containing the E. coli tryptophan promoter, operator and ribosome binding site. Proteins in the inclusion bodies were analysed by Western blotting of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When experiments were done using conditions which preserved the in vitro state of thiol groups, inclusions were shown to be composed of multimers of <b>prochymosin</b> molecules which were interlinked partly by disulfide bonds. The inclusion bodies also contained a high concentration of reduced <b>prochymosin.</b> The presence of intermolecular disulfides probably contributes to the difficulty of solubilizing recombinant <b>prochymosin</b> during its purification from E. coli...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProchymosin can be {{converted}} into chymosin by an action of external proteinases.

Even better results were achieved with <b>prochymosin</b> activation by Legionella pneumophila metalloproteinase.

Secretion of fusion <b>prochymosin</b> enzymatically and immunologically indistinguishable from bovine <b>prochymosin</b> was achieved after transformation of two stable protoplast type L-form strains derived from Proteus mirabilis. The secreted proenzyme was converted by autocatalytic processing to chymosin showing milk-clotting activity. In controlled laboratory fermentation processes, a maximum specific rate of activable <b>prochymosin</b> synthesis of 0. 57 x 10 (- 3) /h was determined from the time courses of biomass dry weight and product formation. Yields as high as 40 +/- 10 micrograms/ml were obtained in the cell-free culture fluid of strain L 99 carrying a naturally altered expression plasmid of increased segregational stability.

In our study, we described that yak chymosin gene recombinant Pichia pastoris strain could serve as a novel source for rennet production. Yaks total RNA was extracted from the abomasum of an unweaned yak. The yak preprochymosin, <b>prochymosin,</b> and chymosin genes from total RNA were isolated using gene specific primers based on cattle chymosin gene sequence respectively and analyzed their expression pattern byreal time-polymerase chain reaction. The result showed that the chymosin gene expression level of the sucking yaks was 11. 45 times higher than one of adult yaks and yak chymosin belongs to Bovidae family in phylogenetic analysis. To express each, the preprochymosin, <b>prochymosin,</b> and chymosin genes were ligated into the expression vector pPICZαA, respectively, and were expressed in Pichia pastoris X 33. The results showed that all the recombinant clones of P. pastoris containing the preprochymosin, <b>prochymosin</b> or chymosin genes could produce the active form of recombinant chymosin into the culture supernatant. Heterologous expressed <b>prochymosin</b> (14. 55 Soxhlet unit/mL) had the highest enzyme activity of the three expressed chymosin enzymes.

40|$|When the {{heterologous}} proteins thaumatin and bovine <b>prochymosin</b> {{are produced}} in yeast cells as a fusion with the yeast invertase secretory signal peptide, less than 2 % {{of the product}} is secreted in a biologically active form into the medium.

40|$|Purpose: To further {{investigate}} the binding of α−crystallin to other proteins {{as part of}} its chaperone-like activity, we studied interactions of α−crystallin with recombinant calf prochymosins and chymosin. Methods: Recombinant calf <b>prochymosin</b> B and one C-terminal mutant (PC+ 2, with two additional residues, Histidine-Glycine) were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Native and mutant proteins were denatured in 8 M urea before being refolded by dilution slowly in phosphate buffer, pH 10. 7, in the presence and absence of α−crystallin at different concentration ratios. After dialysis, the folded proteins were converted to the active chymosin by acidification. The resulting enzyme activities at standard protein concentrations were determined by a microtitre milk-clotting assay. Results: Refolding of 1. 0 mg/ml of protein inclusion bodies diluted in phosphate buffer at 0. 32 M urea in the presence of α− crystallin resulted in enhanced chymosin activity relative to the control without α−crystallin. When lower inclusion body concentrations were used, enzyme activity was not enhanced relative to the control. The mutant enzyme (PC+ 2) showed no conversion to the active form in the presence of α−crystallin. α−Crystallin formed a complex with refolded <b>prochymosin,</b> as well as with <b>prochymosin</b> during refolding, but not with active chymosin. Removal of the 43 -residue propeptide resulted in loss of α−crystallin binding. The addition of two residues (Histidine-Glycine) to the <b>prochymosin</b> C-terminus resulted in precipitation of the mutant prochymosin-α-crystallin complex and loss of enzyme activity.

40|$|Abstract Background Variations in codon usage between {{species are}} one of the major causes {{affecting}} recombinant protein expression levels, with {{a significant impact on the}} economy of industrial enzyme production processes. The use of codon-optimized genes may overcome this problem. However, designing a gene for optimal expression requires choosing from a vast number of possible DNA sequences and different codon optimization methods have been used in the past decade. Here, a comparative study of the two most common methods is presented using calf <b>prochymosin</b> as a model. Results Seven sequences encoding calf <b>prochymosin</b> have been designed, two using the "one amino acid-one codon" method and five using a "codon randomization" strategy. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the variants optimized by the codon randomization approach produced significantly more proteins than the native sequence including one gene that produced an increase of 70 % in the amount of <b>prochymosin</b> accumulated. On the other hand, no significant improvement in protein expression was observed for the variants designed with the one amino acid-one codon method. The use of codon-optimized sequences did not affect the quality of the recovered inclusion bodies. Conclusions The results obtained in this study indicate that the codon randomization method is a superior strategy for codon optimization. A significant improvement in protein expression was obtained for the largely established process of chymosin production, showing the power of this strategy to reduce production costs of industrial enzymes in microbial hosts. </p...|$|E

Sequencing data analysis showed that the exon six has been spliced out and, therefore the gene product is 114 bp shorter in length. In {{order to determine the}} biological significance of the AS 6 preprochymosin, we expressed the encoding cDNA together with a com-plete chymosin cDNA in E. coli.

Protein prediction program analyses showed that the missing exon contain groups of amino acids with high hydrophobicity score. Therefore, the deletion of this exon may explain the higher expression of the recom-binant product in E. coli.

40|$|Bovine, ovine, caprine, porcine and hen Pepsinogen C (PgC) {{have been}} reviewed. Pepsinogens C, {{together}} with other gastric proenzymes, {{are thought to have}} evolved from a common ancestral aspartyl proteinase. PgC appears to have diverged first followed by <b>prochymosin</b> and pepsinogens A (PgA) and F. PgC is mainly expressed in adult animals. In contrast, in hens and quails, it is synthesized during the embryonic stage before hatching. The purification of PgC requires a combination of weak anion-exchange and strong anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, size exclusion chromatography may be necessary. PgC in pigs and goats occurs in 2 isoforms, namely PgC- 1 and Pg C- 2, with approximately 370, 363 and 387 amino acid residues for goat, pig and hen PgC, respectively. The molecular mass porcine pepsinogen C is close to 38 - 41. 4 kDa and 33 - 36. 6 kDa for the zymogen and the active enzyme, respectively. Pepsinogens C in ruminants differ from those of humans and of other animal species in their phosphate content. Unlike PgA, PgC has a higher proteolytic activity against hemoglobin at pH 3 than at pH 2. Also, PgC is less susceptible to the most potent inhibitors of aspartic proteases, such as pepstatin. Investigation of PgC in farm animals is still limited to the gastric mucosal area, despite the fact that PgC C has been reported to be present in blood and in many other tissues.

40|$|Confluent monolayers of MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells {{provide a}} widely used system {{to study the}} biogenesis of {{epithelial}} cell polarity. We now report that these cells are also capable of the vectorial constitutive secretion of a major endogenous product, a glycoprotein of 81 kDa, which is released into the medium from the apical surface within 30 min of its synthesis. This release represents a bona fide exocytotic secretory process and is {{not the result of}} proteolytic cleavage of a plasma membrane-associated precursor since, in cells treated with chloroquine, a protein indistinguishable from the mature secretory product accumulated intracellularly. In contrast to the vectorial secretion of the endogenous product, a variety of exogenous exocrine and endocrine proteins synthesized in MDCK cells transfected with the corresponding genes were secreted from both the apical and basolateral surfaces. These included proteins such as rat growth hormone, chicken oviduct lysozyme, bovine gastric <b>prochymosin,</b> and rat salivary gland alpha 2 u-globulin, which in their cells of origin are secreted via a regulated pathway, as well as the liver form of the alpha 2 u-globulin and the immunoglobulin kappa chain, which are normally released constitutively. These results demonstrate the existence of secretory pathways that lead to both surfaces of MDCK cells and are accessible to the foreign secretory products. They are consistent with the operation of a sorting mechanism in which the polarized secretion of the endogenous product is effected through the recognition of signals that prevent its random distribution within the fluid phase in the cellular endomembrane system...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{chymosin}} is {{an important}} milk-clotting agent used in the manufacturing of cheeses. Currently, the production of recombinant proteins by genetically modified organisms is widespread, leading to greatly reduced costs. Lactococcus (L.) lactis, the model lactic acid bacterium, was considered {{a good candidate for}} heterologous chymosin production for the following reasons: (1) it {{is considered to be a}} GRAS (generally regarded as safe) microorganism, (2) only one protease is present on its surface, (3) it can secrete proteins of different sizes, and (4) it allows for the direct production of protein in fermented food products. Thus, three genetically modified L. lactis strains were constructed to produce and target the three different forms of bovine chymosin, <b>prochymosin</b> B, chymosin A and chymosin B to the extracellular medium. Although all three proteins were stably produced in L. lactis, none of the forms were detected in the extracellular medium or showed clotting activity in milk. Our hypothesis is that this secretion deficiency and lack of clotting activity can be explained by the recombinant protein being attached to the cell envelope. Thus, the development of other strategies is necessary to achieve both production and targeting of chymosin in L. lactis, which could facilitate the downstream processing and recovery of this industrially important protein.

40|$|The {{release of}} a {{haemolytic}} toxin from some urinopathogenic strains of E. coli is unique {{in that it is}} the only reported polypeptide to be truly secreted from this Gram-negative organism. This secretion system comprises four genes on a contiguous, approximately 7. 5 Kb DNA fragment, encoding the toxin itself (HlyA, 107 KD), two membrane localised export proteins (HlyB,D) and the cytoplasmic HlyC protein, whose only apparent function is to post-translationally activate the toxin. Recently, another unlinked gene, tolC, encoding a minor outer membrane protein has also been reported to be required for the export process together with HlyB,D. A novel feature of this system is the presence of a C-terminal targeting signal to direct HlyA from the cell. In this study I show that the HlyA C-terminal targeting signal can be harnessed to secrete the majority of both the mammalian <b>prochymosin</b> and the E. coli cytoplasmic, LacZ, proteins in an HlyB,D dependent manner. I have also shown that the efficiency of secretion dramatically decreases when either the C-terminal domain is reduced in size, from 23 KD to 4 KD, or as the "passenger" domain increases in size. These results suggest that the HlyA signal domain is composed of sequences required for both efficiency of secretion and targeting and that the secretion process is inhibited by heterologous passenger domains, the effect increasing with size presumably due to the adoption of more stable folded conformations. This study has also been concerned with the investigation into the nature of the novel hlyA targeting signal by deploying a series of in vitro mutagenesis methods (hydroxylamine, site directed and "saturation"), to introduce point mutations. This work has generated a bank of mutants, the analysis of which, has highlighted several residues essential for efficient secretion and also indicated a minimal region containing the signal motif. However, this information together with comparisons with other molecules carrying similar targeting signals have not yet identified a common signal motif...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} some {{molecular}} and functional aspects of lysosomes.

Cathepsin D characteristics and physiopathological aspects are reviewed {{as well as the}} general properties of aspartic proteases, with special relevance to their evolutionary aspects. This work relates the basic, molecular aspects to the broader framework of clinical medicine and clinical genetics. The work describes the general cellular pathways of the lysosomal enzymes and the biosynthetic pathway of cathepsin D and debates some hypotheses viewing a better unterstanding of cathepsin D turnover. Physiologic as well as pathophysiologic aspects of some lysosomal enzymes are also discussed. The experimental work describes the isolation of a cathepsin D cDNA clone. The cDNA clone for cathepsin D was obtained by screening a human fibroblast library in the pCD expression vector. This library was divided in sub-libraries based {{on the size of the}} cDNA inserts. Two mixed sequence aligonucleotides, III and IV, corresponding to aminoacids 25 to 34 and 198 to 205, respectively, of the known aminoacid sequence of porcine spleen were used to screen the above mentioned sub-libraries. A plasmid pCGS 586 (14 kb- 15 kb) containing <b>prochymosin</b> cDNA was also used to screen the same sub-libraries. This bovine chymosin probe was chosen, because it showed 75 % of identical residues when compared to the aminoacid sequence from the carboxy terminal end of cathepsin D. The cathepsin D cDNA was subcloned into Mp 13 filamentous phage vector, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced protein sequence proved to be similar to the sequence of cathepsin D determined previously, a similar reflecting the high evolutionary conservation of the protein sequence among the different mammalian species.
