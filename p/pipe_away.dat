500|$|On {{the morning}} of the Battle of Rossbach, Frederick passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of the cavalry, much to those men's {{annoyance}} and to Seydlitz' satisfaction. At Rossbach, Seydlitz's coup d'œil] and his understanding of the King's objectives led to battlefield success. [...] After positioning the cavalry in two ranked lines, he watched the French army move for several minutes, while puffing on his pipe; his troopers never took their eyes off him. [...] When he threw his <b>pipe</b> <b>away,</b> this was the signal they had waited for: the first line of massed squadrons surged forward, smashing the unprepared French in the flank. Typically, cavalry action in the mid-eighteenth century meant a single cavalry charge; the cavalry would {{spend the rest of the}} action pursuing fleeing troops. At Rossbach, though, not content with this single attack, Seydlitz called his second formation of squadrons in another charge; he then withdrew all 38 squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. [...] Without waiting for new orders from the King, Seydlitz deployed the Prussian cavalry a third time; this proved a critical factor in the battle. As trained, Seydlitz's squadrons charged headlong into the French columns: a massive wall of horses galloping flank to flank, their riders flashing swords and maneuvering at full speed. By the end of the battle, only seven infantry battalions of Frederick's army had fired a shot; the rest of the victory had been the work of Seydlitz's 38 squadrons and Karl Friedrich von Moller's artillery.|$|E

50|$|The {{lake was}} created by filling a valley full of water which is {{retained}} by an earth and concrete dam built by W. & C. French in 1965 and is extracted and processed at an adjacent Anglian Water treatment plant before being <b>piped</b> <b>away</b> as drinking water.|$|R
50|$|The pipe {{incorporates}} {{an outer}} jacket that shrouds the inner high pressure pipe. This jacket is usually metallic in construction and {{can either be}} a thin walled tube or convoluted hose.

60|$|She {{soon found}} that {{whistling}} to the bullfinches in Mrs d'Urberville's room {{was no such}} onerous business when she had regained the art, for she had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those songsters admirably. A far more satisfactory time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning. Unrestrained by the young man's presence she threw up her mouth, put her lips near the bars, and <b>piped</b> <b>away</b> in easeful grace to the attentive listeners.|$|R

60|$|Very {{different}} was {{her opinion}} of John Hockins.

50|$|Trompes {{are very}} simple devices. A {{vertical}} pipe or shaft {{goes down to}} a separation chamber, a <b>pipe</b> coming <b>away</b> from that chamber allows the water to exit at a lower level, and another pipe coming from the chamber allows the compressed air to exit as needed.|$|R
60|$|But if {{he thought}} but little of his visitor's {{appearance}} at first, he soon changed his sentiments toward him, for Tom had not spoken twenty words when Mr. Chillingsworth's whole aspect changed.

50|$|On 11 November 1902, {{five men}} {{lost their lives}} and two others were injured in No.2 South pit.

60|$|He {{was busy}} for some little time {{scraping}} stones {{out from the}} hollow beneath the ledge, and then he built a rough wall of the larger ones on two sides of it. After that they got Miss Kinnaird there with some difficulty, and when she and the others had crept into the shelter and wrapped the blankets round them, he turned away and stretched himself out beneath the largest stone he could find. For an hour he lay there smoking, and then put his <b>pipe</b> <b>away.</b> He had not much tobacco, {{and it occurred to}} him that he might want the little that remained on the morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "My idea," [...] said I, [...] "of a happy home is an eight-room {{house in}} a grove of live-oaks {{by the side of}} a charco on a Texas prairie. A piano," [...] I went on, [...] "with an {{automatic}} player in the sitting-room, three thousand head of cattle under fence for a starter, a buckboard and ponies always hitched at a post for 'the missus'--and May Martha Mangum to spend the profits of the ranch as she pleases, and to abide with me, and put my slippers and <b>pipe</b> <b>away</b> every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings. That," [...] said I, [...] "is what is to be; and a fig--a dried, Smyrna, dago-stand fig--for your curriculums, cults, and philosophy." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} by the window on a rickety chair that protested under his weight, and quite {{mechanically}} he put his pipe {{in his mouth and}} dipped into the side pocket of his coat. The absence of any tobacco made him aware of his action, and, with a scowl for his forgetfulness, he put the <b>pipe</b> <b>away.</b> His movements were slow, almost hulking, as though he were burdened by the heavy weight of his muscles. He was a solid-bodied, stolid-looking man, and his appearance did not suffer from being overprepossessing. His rough clothes were old and slouchy. The uppers of his shoes were too weak to carry the heavy re-soling that was itself of no recent date. And his cotton shirt, a cheap, two shilling affair, showed a frayed collar and ineradicable paint stains.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AU£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a calorifier, the rerouting of all steam <b>pipes</b> <b>away</b> from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.|$|R

60|$|Well! if you'll believe me, {{they had}} not been dancing five minutes, when {{suddenly}} the Carrier flings his <b>pipe</b> <b>away,</b> takes Dot round the waist, dashes out into the room, and starts off with her, toe and heel, quite wonderfully. Tackleton no sooner sees this than he skims across to Mrs. Fielding, takes her round the waist, and follows suit. Old Dot no sooner sees this than up he is, all alive, whisks off Mrs. Dot {{into the middle of the}} dance, and is foremost there. Caleb no sooner sees this than he clutches Tilly Slowboy by both hands, and goes off at score; Miss Slowboy, firm in the belief that diving hotly in among the other couples, and effecting any number of concussions with them, is your only principle of footing it.|$|E
60|$|Many a pipe did he {{empty and}} fill again, many a dark change passed over his heavy features, as he now pondered long and laboriously over {{every word of}} the {{dialogue}} that had just been held between himself and Zack. But {{not so much as}} five minutes out of all the time he thus consumed, was, in any true sense of the word, time wasted. He had sat down to his first pipe, resolved that, if any human means could compass it, he would find out how the young girl whom he had seen in Mr. Blyth's studio, had first come there, and who she really was. When he rose up at last, and put the <b>pipe</b> <b>away</b> to cool, he had thought the matter fairly out from beginning to end, had arrived at his conclusions, and had definitely settled his future plans.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} bridle, and while {{one or two}} of the men turning in their saddles looked about them the horses plodded on, but Shyanne stood still for at least five minutes. He was not {{especially}} remarkable for intelligence, but it was evident to him that the men had a sufficient reason for desiring that nobody should see them. Then he put his <b>pipe</b> <b>away,</b> and proceeded circumspectly up the trail, with the print of the horse hoofs leading on before him, until they turned off abruptly into the bush. The meaning of this was incomprehensible, since it was not the season when timber-right or mineral prospectors started on their journeys, and Shyanne decided that it might be advisable to go on and inform Wilkins of what he had seen. Still, he made no great progress, for the snow was soft, and, after all, the Canopus did not belong to him.|$|E
60|$|Without a {{particle}} of expression in his yellow face, Mr. Wilkins {{nodded to the}} stranger over the picket fence of his collar, lighted his <b>pipe,</b> and clumped <b>away</b> to enjoy his afternoon promenade without compromising himself by a single word.|$|R
50|$|On 3 October 2007 3,200 {{employees}} were trapped underground when a 15 metre compressed air <b>pipe</b> broke <b>away</b> just below {{surface in the}} men and material shaft {{and fell to the}} shaft bottom, severely damaging both the shaft steelwork and the electricity supply to the sub men and material shaft. The trapped workers were all brought to surface by 4.00 p.m. the following day after cages had been installed in the rock shaft. 48 days of production were lost.|$|R
50|$|On {{the outward}} trip from Stockport to Buxton that day, Driver Axon had noticed a leak from the {{supply to the}} {{locomotive}} steam brake and had requested and received fitter's attention at the Buxton depot. On the return trip from Buxton to Stockport, the repair did not hold and the supply <b>pipe</b> broke <b>away</b> from the steam brake disabling the locomotive steam brake and whistle. This filled the locomotive cab with scalding steam and prevented Driver John Axon and Fireman Ron Scanlon from reaching the controls.|$|R
60|$|The {{work was}} hard, {{for when they}} reached a sand bar up the creek {{they were forced to}} wade some {{distance}} through mud and shallow water with the heavy bags on their backs, while the perspiration soaked their thin clothes and the black dust worked through to their skin. At noon they stopped for half an hour and Walthew lay in the stern-sheets of the gig where there was a patch of shade. He could not eat, and after drinking some tea tried to smoke, but the tobacco tasted rank and he put his <b>pipe</b> <b>away.</b> Up to the present his life had been luxurious. He had been indulged and waited on, and had exerted himself only in outdoor sports. Now he felt very sick and worn out, but knew that he must make good. Having declined to enter his father's business, he must prove his capacity for the career he had chosen. Moreover, he suspected that Macallister and Grahame were watching him.|$|E
6000|$|Harry did {{not seem}} more {{inclined}} to give an opinion than we had been, for he sat and puffed out such huge volumes of smoke, that Polly threatened to take his <b>pipe</b> <b>away</b> {{if he did not}} smoke more quietly. At last he took it from between his lips, and began: [...] "The fact is, girls, I am loath to give my opinion, not because I have not one, but because I do not wish to influence you. Your cases are so very different from mine, that there is no comparison at all between us. I am now just twenty-one; I am in a position to keep myself, and consequently the advantage this sum of money would be to me, is not sufficient to counterbalance the repugnance I feel--as far as I am concerned--to taking the money from these women who have robbed us. Still understand, I am not so much against it as to decide to refuse it, should you both agree to accept it. This is rather a suggestion of mine, as it were, than a positive and final opinion. I mean to say that for my own sake I certainly would not accept of the offer, but you are so differently placed that if you give your vote for accepting it, I shall be quite ready to agree with you." ...|$|E
50|$|When Class 6E1, Series 7 {{and earlier}} {{locomotives}} {{began to be}} rebuilt, {{it was necessary to}} retrofit them with a brake equipment frame or brake rack. Since this already increased the per-unit rebuilding cost, it was decided to simultaneously re-route the compressor <b>pipe</b> <b>away</b> from bolster and other members to the outside of the bodywork on the locomotive's right side, from below and {{to the right of the}} cab door to just before the second sandbox lid from the rear end. An added advantage was that the pipe would run cooler and more moisture would condense on the way to the reservoirs. The same modification was not done on locomotives which were rebuilt from Class 6E1, Series 8 and later.|$|E
6000|$|The painter was biting hard {{upon the}} stem of his <b>pipe.</b> He turned <b>away</b> and began {{ordering}} the color-tubes and pencils on a table against the wall, putting them close together in very neat, straight rows. Presently he said: [...] "Perhaps Miss Vervain also advised {{you to go to}} America?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Public {{reactions}} {{towards the}} government have been largely negative, criticizing what {{was seen as a}} slow response by the authorities to stop and isolate the gas leak after it was first reported. In wake of the disaster, many local residents have said that the government should relocate the gas <b>pipes</b> <b>away</b> from their neighborhoods. One resident claimed that he had notified city authorities prior to the explosion when he smelled a gas odor near his apartment. However, authorities told him that the situation was under control and had been declared safe after police and firefighters arrived at the scene. Kaohsiung city authorities responded to these criticisms by saying that had residents been evacuated prior to the explosions, there may have been even more fatalities, since most of the injured or dead were those on the roads {{at the time of the}} incidents. According to Taipower, staying indoors was the best precaution that could be taken for people facing such a disaster. The Kuomintang caucus of the Kaohsiung City Council sued Mayor Chen Chu for negligence that led to loss of life. The Democratic Progressive Party caucus responded by filing a lawsuit against former Kaohsiung mayor Wu Den-yih, for [...] "illegitimately" [...] allowing the pipelines to be buried. Wu then publicized documents stating that the pipes were installed before his leadership of Kaohsiung.|$|R
5000|$|These are the {{two most}} {{remarkable}} buildings in the Home Farm complex and are listed Grade II* They are at the N W side of the farm and were built around 1855. The buildings consist of 2 circular sheds both of which are open in the centre; the W shed was a sheep house, the E shed was a piggery. These are joined by a long link range which housed sheep on the N side, facing the fields, and probably cattle on the S side facing the 2 stockyards. The sheep house and piggery has louvres in the vent ridges of the roof. Its inner wall has drains at the internal floor level above a deep sump in which there are 8 radiating tunnels with round-headed openings. The slurry from the animals would drain in to the circular sumps, before being <b>piped</b> <b>away</b> for use as manure to fertilise the estate fields. The timber framing used to construct the very complex structure of the ridge of the circular buildings is remarkable. The roofs drain water both outwards and inwards, into the circular sump. It has been suggested that these circular buildings were developed from similar farm building on model farms in the U.S.A. , but Wilian illustrates another circular cowhouse at Cae’r lan, Abercraf, Breconshire. This lacks the central sump, but is of the same date ...|$|R
