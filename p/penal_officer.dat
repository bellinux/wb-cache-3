50|$|In {{the morning}} of 8 May 2012, Ampon {{was found dead in}} the Khlong Prem Prison. The cause of death was {{initially}} unknown. Police Colonel Suchat Wong-a-nanchai, Director General of the Corrections Department, revealed that a <b>penal</b> <b>officer</b> informed him that Ampon had complained about a pain in his stomach on 3 May, and the officer delivered Ampon to the Penal Hospital the following day.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1957 O'Meally again {{escaped from}} Pentridge. With an accomplice, John Henry Taylor, who was {{armed with a}} [...]38 {{automatic}} handgun, he ran through the main gates of the gaol. Chief <b>Penal</b> <b>officer</b> Robert Davis tried to stop them and {{was shot in the}} thigh, breaking his femur. O'Meally then took the firearm and engaged in a gun battle with warders. They were re-captured 13 minutes after escaping.|$|E
50|$|In year 689 of the Tang Dynasty, Wu Zetian {{is to be}} crowned {{the first}} Empress in China despite {{opposition}} from Tang officials. She has a Buddha figure built overlooking her palace in Luoyang, but an official inspecting the progress mysteriously erupts into flames. <b>Penal</b> <b>officer</b> Pei Donglai and his superior investigate and interrogate the supervising builder, Shatuo, who was formerly imprisoned after he {{took part in a}} rebellion. They find nothing and Pei's superior dies soon after erupting into flames.|$|E
5000|$|The {{judgment}} was pronounced on 23 November, through a videoconferencing {{system from the}} Criminal Court to the Khlong Prem Prison where Ampon was detained, as the 2011 flood prevented his personal appearance. The court took eighteen minutes to pronounce the judgment. Since the pronouncing could not be heard clearly, the <b>penal</b> <b>officers</b> sitting {{by the side of}} Ampon subsequently asked a court officer through the monitor what the court had said. The court officer merely answered: [...] "Uncle, you'll be inside for twenty years." ...|$|R
50|$|Following the British Government’s {{establishment}} of a penal settlement where the city of Brisbane now stands, an embargo {{was placed on the}} occupation of land within fifty miles of the ‘closed’ <b>penal</b> establishment. Several <b>officers</b> of the colony made journeys of exploration up the Brisbane River, passing through the area which would become Fernvale. After Alan Cunningham’s discovery in 1828 of Cunninghams Gap a wave of squatters travelled from Sydney via the inland areas of New England and the Darling Downs, bringing sheep to settle on the rich pastures of the Brisbane Valley, taking up runs {{of tens of thousands of}} acres.|$|R
5000|$|AB 128: Following a {{recommendation}} {{made by the}} California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST), AB 128 reclassifies the Los Angeles World Airports police department under <b>Penal</b> Code 830.1. <b>Officers</b> with 830.1 status are considered full peace officers, equivalent to municipal police departments. Without 830.1 status, airport officers are prohibited from removing vehicles, seizing drugs or weapons, or other functions for which they may need to wait for backup to arrive. Bradford, whose district includes Los Angeles International Airport, introduced the bill {{ten years after the}} POST recommendation. Earlier versions of the bill died in the Legislature.|$|R
5000|$|A {{prison officer}} (UK and Ireland, and the {{official}} English title in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden), also known as corrections officer (New Zealand, US), correctional officer (Australia, Canada, Jamaica, and US), detention officer (US) or <b>penal</b> <b>officer</b> (US), is a person responsible for the supervision, safety, and security of prisoners in a prison, jail, or similar form of secure custody. Historically, terms such as [...] (also spelled jailor or [...] ), jail guard, prison guard, and turnkey have also been used.|$|E
50|$|In some penal units {{like the}} 8th Detached <b>Penal</b> (<b>Officer)</b> Battalion, platoons were {{sometimes}} had up to 50 men, companies were 300 men, and the battalion {{could be as}} big as 850 men; which implies that a penal battalion was sometimes larger than a regular rifle battalion of the Red Army. Interesting to note is that on paper, the battalion was to be commanded by a Colonel with two deputies, a chief of staff, and a political officer. The companies were to be commanded by Majors and their platoons by Captains. This is probably because in this instance, the shtrafniks consisted of former officers of the Red Army.|$|E
5000|$|In reality, {{the promise}} of {{rehabilitation}} was (in most cases) propaganda intended to induce obedience from men already earmarked for death, similar to the German strafbattalions that inspired them. While some men were able to survive their terms via a combination of luck and the recommendation of sympathetic <b>officers,</b> <b>penal</b> infantry battalions were administered and commanded by the feared field units of the NKVD secret police, who treated shtrafniki as a particularly loathsome and dangerous subspecies of cannon fodder who would have already been executed if {{there was not a}} constant use for them in absorbing heavy casualties that would otherwise be inflicted on a more worthy Soviet unit. They were used in attempts to break through particularly stubborn enemy defenses; to perform hazardous patrols in large groups (reconnaissance-in-force) to determine enemy strength; as sacrificial rearguards during retreats; and as decoys (e.g., wearing dark, instead of snow camouflage clothing to draw enemy fire away from regular Red Army units). [...] They were also on occasion sent into battle unarmed, or with sticks to mimic rifles.|$|R
5000|$|On Sunday 6 November 2016, {{there was}} a riot in Bedford prison with 200 prisoners protesting lockdowns due to staff shortages. Prisoners claim {{accessing}} drugs is easier than accessing clothing or bedding in the prison. [...] The numbers claiming they developed a drug problem while in the prison rose from 4% to 14%. The Prison Officers Association has been warning for some time {{about the risk of}} violence in British prisons. [...] Her Majesty's Prison inspection in May 2016 found poor physical conditions and stated, “Arrangements for managing violent and bullying behaviour and supporting victims were weak.” [...] The riot caused £1 million damage.The Howard League for <b>Penal</b> Reform stated <b>officers</b> refused to unlock prisoners when it was considered too risky. Andrew Neilson of the campaign said: Of course that means prisoners are spending more and more time banged up in their cells. Personally I think that is partially why we've seen this incident happen, because if you are telling people they will spend 23 out of 24 hours of a day locked in basically a toilet, then you're breeding a lot of boredom and frustration. This is one of four serious incident within under two months, Riots also happened at Birmingham Prison, Lewes Prison and Swaleside Prison.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} uphold the Senjinkun {{military}} code, it was considered extremely dishonourable to become an enemy prisoner in Japan at the time, even in a situation as desperate as the one faced by the Japanese Army in New Guinea. In the Japanese Army <b>Penal</b> Code, commanding <b>officers</b> ordering their troops to surrender {{was treated as a}} form of desertion, and even when troops gave their all in battle, surrender was still punishable by six months' imprisonment (article 41). Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, commander of the 18th Army, also gave an order on 18 March 1945, telling his soldiers that they should under no circumstances bring upon themselves the shame of being taken prisoner. As a result, examples of the Japanese Army surrendering as a group are extremely rare. Apart from Takenaga's unit, the only other examples of group surrender by the Japanese Army in the Pacific War were two other groups in New Guinea that are discussed below, and the Army Naval Raiding Squadron, commanded by Umezawa and defending Zamami Island, in the Battle of Okinawa. However, Takenaga's unit was not the first example; there was a previous incident in May, 1905, at the Battle of Mukden in the Russo-Japanese War, where 42 survivors of a company of the 49th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Division were all taken prisoner.|$|R
