The BaTiO 3 based PTCR powders were grinded by conventional ball milling and high-energy ball milling.

The measurement results of the resistance-temperature characteristics of PTCR ceramics indicated that the temperature stability of resistance below the switching temperature of PTCR ceramics could be improved by high-energy ball milling, and the optimum temperature stability of resistance below the switching temperature existed in the sample of 3000 rpm- 1 h.

40|$|The {{conventional}} materials {{discovery is}} a kind of empirical (“trial and error”) science that of handling one sample at a time in the processes of synthesis and characterization. However, combinatorial methodologies present the possibility of a vastly increased rate of discovery of novel materials which will require a great deal of conventional laboratory work. The work presented in this thesis, involved the practice of a conceptual framework of combinatorial research on BaTiO 3 -based <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>resistor</b> (PTCR) materials. Those including (i) fabrication of green BaTiO 3 base discs via high-throughput dip-pen printing method. Preparation and formulation of BaTiO 3 inks (selection of dispersant and binder/volume fraction) were studied. The shape of drying residues and the morphogenesis control of droplet drying were discussed. (ii) investigation of a fast droplet-doping method, which induced the dopant precursor solution infiltrating into the porous BT base disc. Various characterization methods were used to examine the dopant distribution in the body of disc. (iii) devising a high-throughput electrical measurement system including an integrated unit of temperature control and automatic measurement operation, and an arrayed multichannel jig. (iv) synthesis of donor-doped BaTiO 3 libraries, which involved lanthanum, erbium, yttrium as donor elements and manganese as an acceptor dopant element respectively. Their temperature dependant resistivities were also explored. The work successfully developed an integrated tool including high-throughput synthesis of a large batch of libraries and high-throughput electrical property measurement for combinatorial research on BaTiO 3 -based PTCR ceramics. The Abstract ii combinatorial method, thus validated, has the potential to deliver dopant-doped BTbased PTCR libraries rapidly with a very wide range of dopant mixtures and concentrations for electrical property measurement and deserves to be applied to other low level dopant ceramic systems. These approaches are novel and paving the way for other new materials selection and materials research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
30|$|Barium {{titanate}} (BaTiO 3) {{is widely}} used for electronic devices in the technological ceramic industry because of its ferroelectric, thermoelectric, and piezoelectric properties when it assumes the tetragonal structure [1].

40|$|Barium {{titanate}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and widely studied ferroelectric ceramics with ABO 3 type perovskite structure. Due to its promising ferroelectric properties, it has been used in several applications such as <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>resistors</b> (PTCR) called thermistor, sensors, electro-optical devices, multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), electroluminescent panels, etc. Barium titanate shows a significant phase transition below and above Curie temperature (120 °C for pure barium titanate) from tetragonal to the cubic crystal structure. This phase transition however is strongly dependent on the microstructural properties such as density, grain size distribution, type of dopants and sintering conditions. In this research, extensive characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to study the microstructural and compositional characteristics of 8 industrial samples. We have employed state of the art spark plasma sintering that offer rapid consolidation of powders, enabling significantly improved or even completely novel materials on barium titanate samples containing Ca, Sr and Pb as a dopant. The effect of various sintering parameters e. g. sintering temperature, soaking time and heating rate on microstructural and phase composition of the sintered samples were investigated and compared to the benchmark industrial sample...|$|R
40|$|Barium {{titanate}} (BT) -based ceramics {{have attracted}} much interest and {{have received a}} favorable review, both from fundamental and applied aspects, such as multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) and <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>resistors</b> (PTCRs) etc [...] The favorable attributes of the fine BT-based MLCCs are higher stored energy, flatter <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of capacitance (TCC) and nontoxic to the environment. Small multilayer capacitors are physically compatible with solid-state semiconductor components and are usually used in hybrid circuitry. For this purpose, the dielectric temperature-stability of the capacitor is very important since the circuits are expected to function {{in a variety of}} ambient conditions and heat output from the semiconductor components can be high. In X 7 R type MLCC materials, the capacitance variation (ΔC/C 25) -value must be within ± 15 % from - 55 ℃ to 125 ℃ temperature regime, where C 25 is the capacitance at 25 ℃. The key factor resulting in low capacitance variation (ΔC/C 25) of dielectric properties is presumed to be the presence of the core-shell microstructure, which can be achieved by critically controlling the doping species and concentration. However, the microstructure and hence the related dielectric properties are extremely sensitive to the processing parameters, which are presumed due to growth of the grains during sintering, altering the core-shell microstructure for the materials. In view of this, a sintering process which can effectively densify the materials without inducing the growth of grains is thus demanded. Microwave sintering process can markedly reduce the temperature necessary for densification of the materials. Grain growth phenomenon is thus pronouncedly suppressed such that high-density materials containing fine grain microstructure can be obtained, which is expected to improve the processing reliability. Furthermore, {{one of the most effective}} means is the use of fine-grained BaTiO 3 for reducing dielectric thickness while retaining good reliability. As the thickness of dielectric layer is reduced to 2 μm, the dielectric grains of ceramic layer after sintering must have an uniform grain size less than 200 nm for the reliability of MLCCs. It is also known that DC degradation, voltage breakdown strength and fracture toughness can be improved as the grain size of dielectric materials decreases. Moreover, enhanced dielectric performance of BaTiO 3 can be expected by shifting the phase transitions near room temperature and flatting the K-T curve forming a solid solution with suitable dopants such as Y 2 O 3 and MgO. The temperature dependence of the permittivity is hence determined by the degree of chemical heterogeneity in the doped material. In this study, microwave-sintering technique is adopted to densify the nano-grained BaTiO 3 materials co-doped with Y and Mg species. The effect of processing parameters on the microstructure and hence dielectric properties of these BaTiO 3 materials are examined.
