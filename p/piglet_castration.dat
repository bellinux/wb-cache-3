40|$|In {{organic farming}} {{there is an}} ongoing {{discussion}} on <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without anaesthesia and possible alternatives to this practice due to animal welfare concerns. Consumer acceptance of alternatives to <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without anaesthesia {{plays an important role}} in this discussion. This contribution examines organic consumers’ attitudes towards <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without anaesthesia and the alternatives castration with anaesthesia and analgesia, immunocastration and fattening of entire males. Additionally, consumers’ willingness-to-pay for the alternatives is determined. The results show that animal welfare, food safety and health concerns influence consumers’ attitudes towards the alternatives. However, the individual perception of those aspects is quite varying. Thus, consumers’ opinions towards the alternatives are also different. Consumers’ perception of the alternatives is reflected in their willingness-to-pay. When implementing alternatives to <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without anaesthesia the organic farming sector should address consumers’ concerns in an appropriate way in order to avoid misinformation and insecurity among consumers...|$|E

Because of growing concern on animal welfare however, it is seriously questioned. A search for alternatives is in progress but besides animal welfare, {{the opinion of the}} consumer should also be considered. With this in mind 1018 people (aged 16 - 80 years) were interrogated in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium), equally spread over the different regions and different social classes. Questions were about their awareness of <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> in general and several alternatives for unanaesthetized <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> like breeding intact males, immunocastration, and castration under anaesthesia combined with analgesia for the pain afterwards.

Presently examined alternatives are evaluated here, {{as well as their}} practical applications and impact on the piglets welfare. After considering various research results it's obvious that the most used alternative will be the immunocastration of male piglets under local anaesthesia. Methods like sperm sexing and general anaesthesia have been excluded due to high financial costs. Chemical castration technique seems to be a promising but so far not entirely finalized alternative. There's also a possibility of using a complex solution with a high potential contribution to pig breeding by comprising male piglets fattening, feeds modification and genetic selection...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} costs of the {{veterinarian}} and physical work load for the farmer of anaesthetizing <b>piglets</b> before surgical <b>castration</b> compared with castration without anaesthesia on seven organic pig farms. Based on experiences from farmers and veterinarians in Norway a protocol 'Castration with anaesthesia' was formulated. This protocol was tested on the Experimental Farm at Raalte and then applied on six organic pig farms. By means of video recording it was measured how much time it takes to castrate and anaesthetize the piglets. The veterinarian anaesthetized the piglets with lidocame. The work load for the farmer was measured by scoring the physical load for the back and the upper limbs. It took 142 and 81 seconds per litter, respectively, to castrate and anaesthetize the piglets. The waiting time between anaesthesia and castration varied from 10 to 20 minutes on the six farms. Based on these measurements, it was calculated that {{the costs of}} the veterinarian (excluding call out fee) of anaesthetizing piglets are is an element of 1. 73 per litter with five boars. The costs of lidocaine are is an element of 0. 25 per litter with five boars. The costs per kg organic pig meat are is an element of 0. 012. The farmers and their veterinarians were asked to react on some theses. They all agreed that the pig farmer should perform the anaesthesia with lidocaine.

40|$|In German organic agriculture, general {{anaesthesia}} of male <b>piglets</b> before <b>castration</b> is commonly performed by injection of ketamine and azaperone, plus {{application of the}} analgesic meloxicam. Inhalation anaesthesia with isoflurane (plus meloxicam) is an alternative with a shorter recovery phase and widely used in Switzerland, but requires reclassification for pigs on a case to case basis in Germany. In order to provide data on piglets´ behavior after castration and potential long-term effects on growth until weaning, a trial under practical conditions on an experimental farm was conducted. Body weight development until weaning was not affected by the method of anaesthesia. However, piglets anaesthetised with injection showed significantly more motoric anomalies and {{were in danger of}} being crushed more frequently during the first eight hours after castration.

40|$|In Germany {{and other}} European {{countries}} piglets are routinely castrated {{in order to}} avoid the occurrence of boar taint, an off-flavour and off-odour of pork. Sensory perception of boar taint varies; however, it is regarded as very unpleasant by many people. Surgical castration which is an effective means against boar taint has commonly been performed without anaesthesia or analgesia within the piglets’ first seven days of life. <b>Piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without anaesthesia has been heavily criticised, as the assumption that young piglets perceive less pain than older animals cannot be supported by scientific evidence. Consequently, surgical castration is only allowed with anaesthesia and/or analgesia in organic farming throughout the European Union since January 2012. Abandoning <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without pain relief requires the implementation of alternative methods which improve animal welfare while maintaining sensory meat quality. There are three relevant alternatives: castration with anaesthesia and/or analgesia to reduce pain, a vaccination against boar taint (immunocastration) and the fattening of uncastrated male pigs (fattening of boars) combined with measures to reduce and detect boar taint in meat. Consumers’ attitudes and opinions regarding the alternatives are an important factor with regard to the implementation of alternatives, as they are finally supposed to buy the meat. The objective of this dissertation was to explore organic consumers’ attitudes, preferences and willingness-to-pay regarding <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without pain relief and the three alternatives. Important aspects for the evaluation of the alternatives and influencing factors (e. g. information, taste) on preferences and willingness-to-pay should also be identified. In autumn 2009 nine focus group discussions were conducted each followed by a Vickrey auction including a tasting of boar salami. Overall, 89 consumers of organic pork participated in the study. Information on <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> and alternatives (in three variants) was provided as a basis for discussion. The focus group data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. In order to compare the focus group results with those from the auctions, an innovative approach applying an adapted scoring model to further analyse the data set was used. The majority of participants were not aware that piglets are castrated without anaesthesia in organic farming. They reacted shocked and disappointed on learning about this practice which did not fit into their image of animal welfare standards in organic farming. Overall, the results show, that for consumers of organic pork castration with anaesthesia and analgesia as well as the fattening of boars may be acceptable alternatives in organic farming. Considering the strong food safety concerns regarding immunocastration, acceptance of this alternative may be questioned. Communication regarding alternatives to <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without anaesthesia and analgesia should take into account that the relevance of the aspects animal welfare, food safety, taste and costs differs between alternatives. Furthermore, it seems advisable not to address an unappetizing topic like <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> directly at the point of sale so as not to deter consumers from buying organic pork. The issue of <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> demonstrates exemplarily that it is important for the organic sector to implement and maintain high animal welfare standards and communicate them in an appropriate way, thereby trying to prevent strong discrepancies between consumers’ expectations regarding animal husbandry in organic farming and actual conditions. So, disappointment of consumers and a loss of image due to negative reports about animal welfare issues can be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Surgical <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> {{without pain}} relief has been banned in organic farming in the EU since the {{beginning}} of 2012.

In an innovative approach using a multi-criteria decision making procedure, qualitative data from focus group discussions were compared with quantitative results from Vickrey auctions. Overall, participants preferred all alternatives to castration without pain relief. Different aspects influenced willingness-to-pay for the methods. Animal welfare was important for the evaluation of castration without pain relief and castration with anaesthesia. Food safety played a major role for willingness-to-pay for immunocastration, while taste and, to some extent, animal welfare were dominant factors for fattening of boars. These differences should be considered when communicating the alternatives...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{occurrence}} of boar taint, almost all male piglets are routinely castrated in Europe. Usually, this surgical intervention is carried out without the use of anaesthesia or analgesia. Recently, animal welfare concerns over this practice have been raised and efforts are made to ban surgical castration of piglets without anaesthesia. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternatives to <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without anaesthesia. An important factor for the implementation of possible alternatives is consumers’ acceptance of and willingness to pay for pork which was produced using these alternatives. Existing research on this topic mainly focused on consumer reactions to meat form entire male pigs. Only a few studies analysed consumer acceptance of immunocastration, castration with anaesthesia and sexing of sperm.

Twenty-nine male Landrace crossbred piglets aged 3 to 6 days were used. The piglets were randomly divided into two groups: orchiectomy with anesthesia (A, n = 15) and orchiectomy without anesthesia (NOA, n = 14). Piglets in the A and NOA groups were treated with 0. 5 mL of intratesticular 2 % lidocaine with a vasoconstrictor in each testicle and 0. 5 mL of intratesticular 0. 9 % sodium chloride, respectively. Blood samples were collected from all animals immediately after surgery and at 3 and 6 days postoperatively for measurement of the serum cortisol concentration. Behavior was assessed daily for 6 days by two observers blinded to the treatment. Weight was measured at the same time as cortisol measurement. Analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to investigate differences in time within and between the two groups. Mean times of six evaluations done for 90 minutes during 6 days of each behavior were compared by Tukey t test. The level of statistical significance was 5 %. The serum cortisol concentration was higher immediately after surgery than at 3 and 6 days postoperatively in both groups. Weight gain was greater at 3 and 6 days postoperatively in the A group than in the NOA group.

40|$|Routine {{procedures}} {{carried out}} on <b>piglets</b> (i. e. <b>castration,</b> tail docking, teeth clipping, and ear notching) are considered painful. Unfortunately the efficacy of current pain mitigation modalities is poorly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the existing primary scientific literature regarding the effectiveness of pain management interventions used for routine procedures on piglets. The review question was, 2 ̆ 7 In piglets under twenty-eight days old, undergoing castration, tail docking, teeth clipping, and/or methods of identification that involve cutting of the ear tissue, what {{is the effect of}} pain mitigation compared with no pain mitigation on behavioral and non-behavioral outcomes that indicate procedural pain and post-procedural pain? 2 ̆ 7 A review protocol was designed a priori. Data sources used were Agricola (EBSCO), CAB Abstracts (Thomson Reuters), PubMed, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters), and ProQuest Dissertations 2 ̆ 6 Theses Full Text. No restrictions on year of publication or language were placed on the search. Eligible studies assessed an intervention designed to mitigate the pain of the procedures of interest and included a comparison group that did not receive an intervention. Eligible non-English studies were translated using a translation service. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance using pre-defined questions. Data were extracted from relevant articles onto pre-defined forms. From the 2203 retrieved citations forty publications, containing 52 studies met the eligibility criteria. In 40 studies, <b>piglets</b> underwent <b>castration</b> only. In seven studies, piglets underwent tail docking only. In one study, piglets underwent teeth clipping only, and in one study piglets underwent ear notching only. Three studies used multiple procedures. Thirty-two trial arms assessed general anesthesia protocols, 30 trial arms assessed local anesthetic protocols, and 28 trial arms assessed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) protocols. Forty-one trial arms were controls where piglets received either placebo or no treatment. Forty-five outcomes were extracted from the studies, however only the results from studies that assessed cortisol (six studies), β-endorphins (one study), vocalisations (nine studies), and pain-related behaviors (nine studies) are reported. Other outcomes were reported in only one or two studies.

A total of 144 piglets of 2 to 5 days of age were allocated to one of six treatments: castration (CAST), castration with lidocaine (LIDO), castration with meloxicam (MELO), castration with lidocaine and meloxicam (L + M), handling (SHAM) and no handling (NONE). Behaviour was observed for 5 days after the procedure, growth until weaning was recorded and characteristics of the castration wound noted. MELO piglets showed significantly (P < 0. 05) more no pain-related behaviour than CAST and LIDO at the afternoon after castration, and were not significantly different from SHAM and NONE. LIDO piglets showed an increase (P < 0. 001) in tail wagging, lasting for 3 days. This increase was not seen in L + M piglets. The occurrence of several behaviours changed with age, independent of treatment. A treatment effect on growth was not found. Wound healing was rapid in all treatments, but thickening of the heal was observed in several piglets, suggesting perturbation in the cicatrization process. Our study showed a pain-relieving effect of meloxicam after castration.

The aim this study was to contrast approaches from the large number of new and elder literatures with the subjects of reducing and eliminating boar taint and to assess the effectiveness of these methods to avoid boar taint. For the first time, these findings were presented in a summarised and concentrated form. After reviewing 857 titles out of the year 1911 up to 2015, 664 sources of literature were chosen from all fields of pig breeding, housing and feeding, application of drugs, meat processing and the answer of consumers give a comprehensive understanding on the term of boar taint and the alternatives of <b>piglet</b> <b>castration.</b> There is no single strategy against boar taint being exposed after this work. There are some approaches possible: the immunocastration that gained acceptance in Australia and Belgium is an animal welfare friendly and in practice feasibly method. But it needs an inspection for boar taint at the slaughter line. The fattening of young boars, supported by Switzerland, could be improved by an optimised housing and feeding strategy, as well as the use of breeding lines for low boar taint. The processing of boar meat to premium products is possible. However, the amount of tainted boar meat coming into processing is still not clarified.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} the questions whether on-farm use of local anaesthesia with lidocaine {{leads to a}} reduction in pain responses during castration, and whether the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam improves technical performance after <b>castration</b> of <b>piglets.</b> Five treatments were included in the study: (1) castration without anaesthesia or analgesia (CAST), (2) castration after local anaesthesia with lidocaine (LIDO), (3) castration after administration of meloxicam (MELO), (4) castration after lidocaine and meloxicam (L + M) and (5) sham castration (SHAM). To reduce litter influences, each treatment was present in each of the 32 litters (n = 32 per treatment). During castration, vocalizations were recorded continuously. Blood samples were collected 15 min before and 20 min after castration for determination of plasma levels of total cortisol, glucose, lactate and creatine kinase (CK). Mortality was registered and piglets were weighed several times to calculate growth. Several aspects of vocalizations during castration showed consistent and significantly different levels in CAST compared with LIDO, L + M and SHAM. CAST piglets squealed longer, louder and higher. Vocalizations of MELO piglets most resembled those of CAST. An increase in cortisol was seen in all treatments. However, in SHAM piglets this increase was significantly lower than in the other treatments. LIDO piglets showed a significantly smaller increase in plasma cortisol levels compared with CAST and MELO. L + M piglets differed significantly only from the SHAM group. Lactate levels differed significantly between LIDO and MELO, the level in LIDO being decreased after castration. In the other treatments an increase was measured. No treatment effects were found in plasma glucose and CK levels, nor in growth and mortality of the piglets.

40|$|With the {{perspective}} to test drugs that may reduce pain due to surgical castration, this preliminary study {{tries to find}} out a robust and valid method for pain assessment in piglets. In the present study three treatments were applied: handling (H), tail docking (TD) and surgical castration + tail docking (CTD). To evaluate pain response to the treatments different variables were analyzed: movement latency (time from placing back the piglet inside the farrowing crate after treatments and its first movement towards the nest or the sow), rectal temperature and plasma cortisol and lactate levels. Movement latency was measured for all treatments. Rectal temperature was measured before treatments H and CTD, and 1, 3, 5, 24 hours later. Blood samples for cortisol and lactate determination were collected 1 hour before treatments H and CTD, right after and 3, 5, 24 hours later. The significant increase of movement latency for CTD compared to H showed that pain can be assessed by this type of measure. Rectal temperature was significantly affected by time (P < 0. 01) but not by treatment likely due to several factors that might have confounded the studied effect. Cortisol was significantly affected by interaction time*treatment (P < 0. 01) particularly due to the high peak for CTD right after the surgical procedure. Lactate was modified only by time (P < 0. 01). This preliminary study suggests that a non invasive and easy measure such as movement latency is a promising method to assess pain in <b>piglets</b> after surgical <b>castration</b> and tail docking...|$|R
40|$|Gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) plays {{a pivotal role}} in fertility and reproduction in mammals. It induces the release of luteinising hormone (LH) en follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. These hormones are responsible for gonadal steroid production and indirectly for gametogenesis. In this thesis, studies are presented which described the development of a highly immunogenic GnRH antigen, as well as the evaluation of this antigen in vaccines in target species. The native GnRH peptide was enlarged to a GnRH-tandem peptide and immunogenicity was further increased by dimerization of the peptide and introduction of foreign amino acids (G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer). This modified peptide construct was conjugated to ovalbumine. It appeared to be highly effective in immunosterilization, i. e. blocking testosterone production, in male piglets. The role of the individual amino acids of the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer on immunosterilization efficacy was established, using alanine replacements. All amino acids, except amino acids at position 2 and 3, could be individually replaced by alanine without affecting efficacy of the vaccine. Peptides with alanine replacements at position 1 or 4 did induce antibodies that were specific for GnRH and did not cross-react with other GnRH-isoforms present in mammals. Immunosterilization by vaccination against GnRH could be a suitable alternative for surgical <b>castration</b> in male <b>piglets.</b> Surgical <b>castration</b> prevents boar taint, but is an animal unfriendly practice, as it is performed without anaesthesia. Immunosterilization may also be beneficial for growth performance. Effects of the time of onset of effective immunosterilization on growth performance were studied. Effective immunosterilization early during the fattening period resulted in a growth performance similar to surgical castrates. In contrast, when immunosterilization was initiated late during the fattening period, growth performance was improved over surgical castrates and carcass quality appeared to be similar to intact male pigs. In addition, immunosterilized pigs of both groups could easily be distinguished from intact male pigs by the size of their testes. Two vaccines with the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer antigen in CoVaccine and Carbopol adjuvant were evaluated in sexually mature male ponies. The CoVaccine-treated stallions showed a high antibody response after the second vaccination, subsequently leading to undetectable testosterone levels and affected testis function, while effects in the Carbopol group were only present in one of the four stallions treated. In humane medicine, GnRH vaccination could be an alternative for hormone therapy in prostate cancer patients. Two potential vaccines with the antigen in ISA 51 and in CoVaccine adjuvant were studied in pigs. The latter vaccine appeared to be more effective. It reduced testosterone levels, weights of testes and accessory sex glands in all treated animals. Both vaccines can be considered as non-toxic; no chronic abnormalities were observed in blood, urine, organs or tissues. In conclusion, this vaccine could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in pigs, eventually leading to a ban on this animal unfriendly practice in the EU. In human medicine, GnRH vaccination could replace hormone therapy in diseases driven by gonadal steroids. In prostate cancer for instance, GnRH vaccination may be a long term effective, cheap and safe alternative...|$|R

The injections for the animals of group 12 to 15 are blinded. group	number of animals	application of the agent	castration Cortisol 1 	Handling NaCl	 35 	 0, 3 ml Saline Solution (0, 9 %) i. m. 	no 2 	Handling Meloxicam	 25 	 0, 4 mg Meloxicam/kg wt i. m. 	no 3 	Handling Flunixin	 26 	 2, 2 mg Flunixin-Meglumin/kg wt i. m. 	no 4 	Handling Detomidin	 25 	 40 μg Detomidinhydrochlorid/kg wt i. m. 	no 5 	Castration NaCl	 28 	 0, 3 ml Saline Solution (0, 9 %) i. m. 	yes 6 	Castration Meloxicam	 25 	 0, 4 mg Meloxicam/kg wt i. m. 	yes 7 	Castration Flunixin	 26 	 2, 2 mg Flunixin-Meglumin/kg wt i. m. 	yes 8 	Castration Metamizol + Skopolamin	 25 	 50 mg Metamizol and 0, 4 mg N-Butylscopolaminiumbromid/kg wt i. m. 	yes 9 	Castration Metamizol	 25 	 50 mg Metamizol/kg wt i. m. 	yes 10 	Castration Carprofen	 15 	 1, 4 mg Carprofen/kg wt s. c. 	yes 11 	Castration Detomidin	 25 	 40 μg Detomidinhydrochlorid/kg wt i. m. 	yes Behaviour 12 	Handling NaCl	 10 	 0, 3 ml Saline Solution (0, 9 %) i. m. 	no 13 	Castration NaCl	 10 	 0, 3 ml Saline Solution (0, 9 %) i. m. 	yes 14 	Castration Meloxicam	 10 	 0, 4 mg Meloxicam/kg wt i. m. 	yes 15 	Castration Flunixin	 10 	 2, 2 mg Flunixin-Meglumin/kg wt i. m. 	yes 15 to 30 minutes after administering the substances, piglets are either castrated (groups 5 - 11 and 13 - 15) or only restrained for about 30 seconds (groups 1 - 4 and 12). They are returned to their box immediately afterwards. 2 - 3 ml blood is taken from all animals of the cortisol-groups before the application of the agents including 30 minutes, one hour, four and 24 hours after castration/fixation, and the concentration of cortisol in the serum is measured. The behaviour of all animals in groups 12 to 15 is observed individually for 20 minutes in the first and third hour after <b>castration.</b> Additionally, all <b>piglets</b> are scanned every 60 seconds for certain behaviours. On the first, fourth, seventh and 14 th day after castration, wound healing and general condition are assessed and a “clinical score” is determined. The results of the cortisol measurement show that handling the animals has little influence on the cortisol level, while castration leads to a significant rise of the cortisol concentration that is still present four hours later. All of the tested non-opioid analgesics reduce the rise of the cortisol concentration after castration and a considerable reduction is especially noticeable after one hour. Group 6 “Castration Meloxicam” and group 7 “Castration Flunixin” show the lowest cortisol response to castration. The concentrations of cortisol in those two groups are significantly lower 30 minutes, one and four hours after castration than the concentration of group 5 “Castration NaCl”, and already after one hour they do not differ significantly from the corresponding handling groups. Irregardless if animals are castrated or only restrained, the use of Detomidin (group 4 and 11) leads to higher values of cortisol after castration/fixation compared to the values after the application of NaCl (group 1 and 5). A conspicuous impact on the postoperative behaviour is obvious when non-opioid analgesics are used. The frequency of occurrence of castration-induced signs of pain, drooping the tail and changing the position is explicitly reduced when Meloxicam and Flunixin are injected before castration. The effect of Flunixin is most clear. In this group, the incidence of castration-induced signs is only higher for five minutes after castration when compared to the Handling-group. Animals without preoperative medication show an overall reduced activity at the mammary glands and playing. Results indicate that non-opioid analgesics, especially efficient anti-inflammatory drugs like Meloxicam and Flunixin, are capable of reducing castration-induced pain in <b>piglets.</b> The <b>castration</b> wounds of 76, 5 % of the piglets are healed completely after 14 days. NSAIDs are incapable of improving the healing process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the issue {{related to the}} influence of pigs castration methods on their growth, slaughter value and meat quality. Nowadays, it is legal the surgical castration within anaesthesia in young boards, younger than 7 days. This method is the most used by pig breeders for several reasons, but especially it is neither financially or time demanding. Even though this surgical invention should be performed by veterinarian, but due to it simplicity it is performed by educated farm workers in practice. The problem will occur in 2018. In this year the surgical castration without anaesthesia will be prohibited because of animal pain and the effort to improve animal welfare. The main reason of <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> is the boar taint, which is connected to sexual maturation and hormone activity. The main substances, which caused the boar taint, are androstenone, skatole and indole. Androstenone is a steroid hormone produced in the testis with the typical urine like odor. Skatole is the substance with fecal odor and it is produced in the hind gut. Another reason for <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> is higher activity, even aggression in non-castrated pigs. The aggression is a negative effect causes injuries between animals. The next negative effect is the aggression against breeders. Based on these facts, there are numerous studies focused on possible solutions of this problem. There are describes surgical castration with local or total analgesia. The most practical, seems to be the local analgesia. Another method is the immune castration, where {{it is based on the}} hormone castration. There are applied 2 injections with the time lag. The first is applied in 13 to 16 weeks old pigs, the second in 21 to 22 weeks old pigs. The alternative method for relieving the pain is the boar fattening, where is important to decreased the aggression and level of boar taint by different methods. One of the methods is fattening pigs to lower slaughter weight (between 80 to 90 kg), or the breed choice. An interesting method is also sperm sexing, where is an effort for the highest female production. However, this method is not relevant for everyday practice, due to its difficulty...|$|E
40|$|Male piglets in Belgium {{are still}} {{castrated}} unanesthetized {{in the first}} week of life, but animal rights organizations, supermarkets, and some consumers no longer accept this method in terms of animal welfare, and are pushing the pig industry to apply available alternative methods. This major change in pig husbandry will increase production costs without a guarantee for return of investment by consumers. Therefore, it is important to know the opinion of consumers on this matter. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 1, 018 people through face to face interviewing in Flanders. A Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to analyze the data. Results show that in spite of several media campaigns of animal welfare organizations over the past few years, still half of the Flemish respondents were not aware of the problem of unanesthetized <b>piglet</b> <b>castration.</b> However, after being informed, the majority wanted unanesthetized castration to be banned.

40|$|This paper {{constitutes}} a review {{on the welfare}} aspects of <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> that considers the scientific literature published after 2004. Castrating during the neonatal period (1 to 3 days of age) is clearly painful. In addition, inflammatory processes may {{take place at the}} sites of incision, thus adding further pain to the procedure. Surgical castration with general and local anaesthesia, in combination with long-term analgesia, has been shown to reduce pain but the additional handling and injection of the anaesthetic, the effectiveness and limited safety margins have to be thoroughly evaluated. Raising entire males during the whole fattening period or immunocastration of males {{towards the end of the}} fattening period are other alternatives with welfare benefits in young pigs compared to current surgical castration, but with some potential welfare drawbacks regarding handling stress and behaviour during fattening. Based on the current knowledge, it can be concluded that sperm sexing and raising entire males after genetic control of boar taint are potentially preferable alternatives to current practices, but need further research, as these methods are not yet availabl...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{occurrence}} of boar taint, castration of piglets without pain relief is a common practice in pork production. Due to increasing animal welfare concerns, the practice will be banned in organic agriculture from 2012 and alternative methods will have to be implemented. An important factor for the successful implementation of such alternatives is consumers’ acceptance of the methods, as consumers’ daily buying decisions are crucial to the further development of the organic pork sector. Thus, this paper explores organic consumers’ attitudes towards <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> without pain relief and three alternative methods and examines which aspects of these alternatives are important to consumers of organic products. The analysis of nine focus group discussions in Germany conducted in fall 2009 and involving a total of 89 participants, shows that castration without pain relief in organic farming was unacceptable for participants. Animal welfare, food safety, taste, and costs were principal aspects that participants used to assess the three alternatives. Participants had mainly favorable attitudes towards castration with anesthesia and analgesia. Although participants had some concerns regarding the fattening of boars (taste), there was openness towards this alternative due to its perceived naturalness. Immunocastration was seen quite critically because participants feared that this alternative might lead to (hormone) residues in meat. Overall, the results suggest that fattening of boars and castration with anesthesia and analgesia could be acceptable alternatives to consumers of organic pork...|$|E
40|$|In the pig industry, farmers always {{strive for}} optimal {{productions}} results. In {{order to obtain}} these results, they carry out several management practices on piglets like tail docking (to avoid tail biting; routinely prohibited), teeth shortening (to avoid wounding to the udder of the sow or to litter mates; routinely prohibited), castration of male piglets (to avoid boar taint), All these procedures are however considered to be painful and therefore can also influence animal welfare and zootechnical results of the piglets. The aim of this thesis was to {{study the effects of}} reducing or adjusting these painful management practices on piglet welfare and zootechnical results. In the society of today, animal welfare is gaining consumers interest and concern. <b>Piglet</b> <b>castration</b> is a sensitive issue that has drawn the attention of the public as a result of animal welfare organizations campaigns. Therefore {{it is important to know}} consumers opinion on this topic. For that reason the opinion of Flemish consumers on unanesthetized <b>piglet</b> <b>castration,</b> and three possible alternatives is reported in the second chapter. A total of 2018 people, spread over the 5 provinces, were questioned. The results showed that in spite of several media campaigns of animal welfare organizations over the past few years, still about half of the Flemish respondents were not aware of the problem of unanesthetized <b>piglet</b> <b>castration.</b> However, after being informed, the majority wanted unanesthetized castration to be banned. Although the concern about animal welfare implications was very high, the willingness to pay extra for alternatives was low, which might prevent the return of investment for the farmers since production costs will increase. Results of the second chapter demonstrated that castration under anesthesia was the most accepted alternative by Flemish consumers. Therefore castration under carbon dioxide (CO 2) anesthesia was compared to unanesthetized castration in the third chapter. No behavioral differences were found in piglets treated with CO 2 -anesthesia or zolazepam, tiletamine (Zoletil®) and xylazine (Xyl-M®), which is an indication that CO 2 matches the anesthetic properties of the combination of Zoletil® and Xyl-M®. In the main experiment, observed differences in behavior were not conclusive. However, a difference in interactive behavior indicated a better state of welfare for the CO 2 -anesthetized castrated piglets compared to the unanesthetized castrated piglets. On the other hand, all barrows, including the anesthetized group, displayed behaviors indicative of pain or discomfort. Therefore, piglets may need to be provided with additional analgesia to eliminate the pain caused by castration even if they are anesthetized prior to castration. Castration is not the only event that may threaten piglets welfare. As mentioned before, piglets are subjected to several painful management practices, especially during their first week of life. In order to improve overall welfare, not only castration has to be dealt with, but painful management procedures in general. In the fourth chapter it was therefore investigated if reducing painful interventions during the first week of life resulted in better zootechnical performance of the piglets, reduced piglet mortality and if the overall welfare, indicated by behavioral criteria, was improved. In 22 litters, all piglets were weighed after birth. The four lightest piglets of each litter of the experimental group were not subjected to tail docking or teeth shortening, the other procedures (castration for the male piglets, iron injection, vaccination, ear tagging) were carried out as normal. The four lightest piglets of each litter of the control group did have their tails docked and teeth shortened, next to the other management procedures. All procedures were applied on the heavier piglets of both the control and the experimental group. The lightest piglets seemed to show less pain related behavior when their teeth and tail were left intact. Moreover, mortality rate tended to be lower when compared with the lightest piglets of the control group but further research specified on neonatal mortality would be useful. The objectives of the previous two chapters, reducing painful procedures and using anesthesia during these procedures, were combined in the fifth chapter. Two experiments, using 41 litters, were carried out. In the first experiment, all procedures were performed on one moment in time in the experimental group while in the control group procedures were carried out as normal (spread over the first week of life). In the second experiment, bundling of the procedures without anesthesia was compared to bundling the procedures after the animals were anesthetized with CO 2. Piglets seemed to cope better with pain if painful interventions were not combined. Moreover, the applied CO 2 -anesthesia had facilitated the pain experience after treatment, since lying, interactive and walking behavior indicated more discomfort for the anesthetized piglets. Anesthetized piglets had only an advantage when considering nursing behavior. Although the beneficial effect of anesthesia during painful procedures is not really confirmed by the results, these results should be interpreted as a delayed pain experience for anesthetized piglets rather than an additional pain experience. As already found in chapter one CO 2 -anesthesia relieves the pain during the procedure, but not after the anesthesia has wore of. The post-operative pain may have been present in both treatments, but the absent pain experience during the procedures for piglets of the anesthetized group can still be interpreted as advantageous to piglet welfare. The results of this thesis showed that public awareness on <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> was still low. On the other hand, when respondents were informed, they felt the need for alternatives was high. Castration under anesthesia was the most accepted alternative but willingness to pay an extra price to improve piglet welfare was low. Reducing painful procedures (tail docking and teeth clipping) improved animal welfare and survival rate to a certain extent. Adjusting the painful procedures by using CO 2 -anesthesia and/or bundling all procedures on one moment in time did not give clear results. Bundling of the procedures without anesthesia did not seem to benefit the piglets. Anesthesia with CO 2 provides anesthesia and analgesia on the moment of the procedure, which improves animal welfare, but it wears off quickly resulting in postoperative pain. Further research could be useful to optimize the procedure, e. g. by providing additional analgesia for the postoperative pain.

40|$|Unanaesthetized <b>piglet</b> <b>castration</b> is {{a routine}} {{management}} practice {{that is much}} under discussion these days because of animal welfare concerns. In a search for alternatives the possible effect of an analgesic administered {{at the time of}} castration (Meloxyvet®, p. o., 0. 2 mg/kg; 1. 5 mg/ml) was investigated. Piglets were castrated within the first week of life, and were divided into two groups. In the first (control) group, piglets were castrated without anaesthesia or analgesia, like the common practice today. The second group of piglets was castrated right after they received Meloxyvet®. Piglets were housed in identical pens in the same room. Behaviour was scored based on an ethogram described in literature on the day of castration, and four subsequent days (except for Saturday and Sunday). All piglets were observed 10 minutes before noon and 10 minutes in the afternoon. Overall, no significant differences in behaviour between the different treatment groups were observed. The different observation periods were analysed separately, because the analgesic needs some time before its starts working properly. Meloxyvet® was only administered at the time of castration, wich explains why no differences in (pain related) behaviour between the treatment groups were observed the first 10 minutes after castration. However, several hours later, when the analgesic should already have started to kick in, also no differences in (pain related) behaviour were expressed. This may suggest that the administration of meloxicam (p. o., 0. 2 mg/kg, 1. 5 mg/ml) does not relieve the pain caused by castration, or that any effect on the behaviour of piglets was perceived, or that the timing and dose of application was not appropriate. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the use of topical vapocoolant, local anesthetics (LA) and fixation of the spermatic cord with a clamp during <b>piglet</b> <b>castration.</b> Based on serum cortisol measurements, the impact of various castration-methods on pain and stress was examined. Additionally, the wound healing process was assessed. A total of 221 male suckling piglets, three to five days old, were randomly assigned to eight different treatments and groups: Group 1 : fixation, no castration; Group 2 : fixation, cryogen spray, no castration; Group 3 : fixation, castration; Group 4 : fixation, cryogen spray, castration; Group 5 : fixation, castration, LA dropped into the wound Group 6 : fixation, cryogen spray, castration, LA dropped into the wound; Group 7 : intratesticular (i. t.) LA, fixation, castration; Group 8 : fixation, cryogen spray, castration, fixation of the spermatic cord with a clamp, LA dropped on the fixed cord. The cryogen spray (ethyl chloride) was applied from a distance of 10 cm to the scrotum until a skin temperature up to - 12 °C was achieved. The local anesthetic (40 mg procainehydrochloride with 0. 05 mg epinephrine) was either dropped into the wound after removal of the testes (Group 5 and 6), injected into the testes 10 minutes prior to castration (Group 7) or dropped on the spermatic cord after removal of the testes (Group 8). The concentration of cortisol in the serum of the piglets was measured 30 minutes before and 30 minutes, one hour, four hours and one day after castration/fixation. Wound healing was evaluated one day, four days, seven days, 14 days and 21 days after castration. The results of the cortisol measurements indicated that handling has a minor impact on the neuroendocrine stress response compared to castration. None of the examined castration methods (Groups 4 - 8) induced a significant minor stress reaction than the conventional method of castration (Group 3). Fixation of the piglet and application of cryogen spray caused significantly higher average cortisol concentrations than fixation alone half an hour after treatment(Group 2 vs. Group 1). A minimizing effect on castration induced stress using a cryogen spray prior to castration was not evident (Group 4 vs. Group 3). After dropping a local anesthetic into the wound (Group 5), the average cortisol levels of the piglets were by trend lower than those of conventionally castrated piglets (Group 3) half an hour after castration. Four hours after castration, the average cortisol concentration of piglets of Group 5 and 6 were significantly higher than that of Group 3. The preoperative intratesticular application of the local anesthetic had no significant effect on pain induced stress half an hour and one hour after castration compared to the average cortisol concentration of conventionally castrated piglets (Group 3). Four hours after castration, the cortisol levels of the animals of Group 7 were significantly higher than the cortisol levels of Group 3 piglets. The application of cryogen spray combined with the use of a clamp to fix the spermatic cord (Group 8) led to a significant increase in serum cortisol concentration one hour after castration compared with the serum cortisol concentration of conventionally castrated piglets (Group 3). The wound healing was not affected by using the cryogen spray or by intratesticular application of the local anesthetic. When local anesthetics were dropped into the wound and when the spermatic cord was fixed with a clamp, the wound healing was significantly impaired...|$|E
