25|$|Clutter {{may also}} {{originate}} from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection, atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection/refraction (e.g., anomalous propagation). This clutter type is especially bothersome since {{it appears to}} move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below, appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it {{on the basis of}} jitter or a <b>physical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward. These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.|$|E

500|$|Some {{exceptions}} are also made for [...] "impossible attempts", which {{are divided into}} legal impossibility, impossibility through ineptitude and <b>physical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> Cases of legal impossibility occur when the defendant attempts to do something which he believes to be illegal, which is in fact not; this does not constitute a crime. This defence does, however, remain for common law conspiracies. Impossibility through ineptitude is where the defendant attempts {{to commit a crime}} with inadequate means, in which case he can be found guilty. However, prosecutors' discretion {{is likely to be a}} factor, since some plans [...] for example murder through a voodoo doll [...] may be simply too removed from the attempted crime. <b>Physical</b> <b>impossibility</b> covers situations where not only is the action inadequate, but impossible; an example is the attempted murder of (or conspiracy to murder) someone who is, in fact, already dead. Such actions are governed by section 1(2) and 1(3) of the 1981 Act, which provides that they do constitute a crime if the actions, were the facts of the case to be as the defendant believed them to be, would have led to a valid attempt; as Herring states, [...] "if the defendant believes he is dealing in illegal drugs he can be convicted of an attempted drug-dealing offence, even if in fact what he is selling is chalk". A plan which successfully comes to fruition without the offence the defendant intended coming to pass may also relieve the defendant of liability, although this ruling from Haughton v Smith has proved hard to distinguish from the abolition of other defences of impossibility.|$|E

40|$|Networked {{control systems}} (NCS) have {{recently}} been attracting significant attention as they are easier to monitor and modify and have reduced costs for wiring compared to the standard wired solutions. Wireless systems, on top of these traits, can overcome several <b>physical</b> <b>impossibilities</b> of wiring, i. e. they could enable installing a sensor on a rotating mill. However, wireless communication systems have evident imperfections, such as time-varying delay and packet dropout. The stochastic packet transmission process makes the critical assumptions of classical control theory appear invalid. Therefore new system theory and engineering methodology for NCSs need to be developed. PID Controllers, being simple and effective, overwhelmingly dominate the industrial controllers. It is not far-fetched to believe that, as the migration from wired systems to wireless systems continues, PID controllers will remain the dominant controllers in industry. This study, therefore investigates the application of PID controllers to wireless systems. Two particular control structures from the literature have been examined, followed by a newly developed estimation-based controller structure for networked PID control. Various simulations have been conducted on many types of plants, and the robustness of the system against packet losses and plant uncertainties, among others, have been evaluated.

40|$|For over a decade, the hypercomputation {{movement}} has produced computational models that in theory solve the algorithmically unsolvable, {{but they are}} not physically realizable according to currently accepted physical theories. While opponents to the hypercomputation movement provide arguments against the physical realizability of specific models in order to demonstrate this, these arguments lack the generality to be a satisfactory justification against the construction of any information-processing machine that computes beyond the universal Turing machine.
