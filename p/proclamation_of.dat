5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim leaders of the Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had drastic consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the <b>proclamation</b> <b>of</b> the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The negotiators for Armenia were from the ARF.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal.

He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{establishment}} of the Colony of New South Wales did not occur on 26 January as is commonly assumed.

5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren's <b>proclamation</b> <b>of</b> his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E

5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag. This flag was most likely a simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, {{and also in the}} center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies—including at the <b>proclamation</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E
5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the <b>proclamation</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian {{independence}} in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} nascent republic. The Indonesian republican government, based in Jakarta and including Sukarno as president and Mohammad Hatta as vice president, began to take over infrastructure from the departing Japanese. By September 1945, however, allied British and Dutch forces had begun to enter the archipelago, hoping to reestablish the status quo ante. The British initially focused on Java and Sumatra and attempted to avoid armed confrontations with the Republican forces; the Dutch, meanwhile, spent the first months after the Japanese surrender reclaiming the eastern islands with help from Australia.|$|E

He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prison (alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan). His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, {{and had to be}} committed to an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.|$|E
