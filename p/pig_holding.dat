40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} between May 2013 and August 2014 in three provinces of Vietnam to investigate financial impacts of swine diseases in pig holdings in 2010 – 2013. The aim {{of the study was}} to quantify the costs of swine diseases at producer level in order to understand swine disease priority for monitoring at local level. Financial impacts of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), foot and mouth disease (FMD), and epidemic diarrhoea were assessed for 162 pig holders in two Red River Delta provinces and in one Mekong River Delta province, using data on pig production and swine disease outbreaks at farms. Losses incurred by swine diseases were estimated, including direct losses due to mortality (100 % market value of pig before disease onset) and morbidity (abortion, delay of finishing stage), and indirect losses due to control costs (treatment, improving biosecurity and emergency vaccination) and revenue foregone (lower price in case of emergency selling). Financial impacts of swine diseases were expressed as percentage of gross margin of <b>pig</b> <b>holding.</b> The gross margin varied between pig farming groups (P < 0. 0001) in the following order: large farm (USD 18 846), fattening farm (USD 7014) and smallholder (USD 2350). The losses per <b>pig</b> <b>holding</b> due to PRRS were the highest: 41 % of gross margin for large farm, 38 % for fattening farm and 63 % for smallholder. Cost incurred by FMD was lower with 19 %, 25 % and 32 % of gross margin of <b>pig</b> <b>holding</b> in large farm, fattening farm and smallholder, respectively. The cost of epidemic diarrhoea was the lowest compared to losses due to PRRS and FMD and accounted for around 10 % of gross margin of <b>pig</b> <b>holding</b> in the three pig farming groups. These estimates provided critical elements on swine disease priorities to better inform surveillance and control at both national and local level. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

This can lead to AR exposure of non-target small mammals and their predators, which is known from several regions of the world. However, drivers of exposure variation are usually not known. To identify environmental drivers of AR exposure in non-targets we analyzed 331 liver samples of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) for residues of eight ARs and used local parameters (percentage of urban area and livestock density) to test for associations to residue occurrence. 59. 8 % of samples collected across Germany contained at least one rodenticide, in 20. 2 % of cases at levels at which biological effects are suspected. Second generation anticoagulants (mainly brodifacoum and bromadiolone) occurred more often than first generation anticoagulants.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the roles of various environmental sources, such as truck-washing systems, waste-processing lagoons, and other sources, as potential contributors to the exposure and dissemination of Salmonella in commercial swine production systems. Four cohorts of nursery age swine herds which originated from distinct farm flows were selected. In addition, cross-sectional sampling of four truck wash stations selected based on the types of disinfectants and sources of water used for sanitizing trucks were tested. Salmonella isolates were recovered from pigs (feces, cecal contents, and mesenteric lymph nodes) and environmental sources (barn floor, lagoon, barn flush, trucks, and holding pens). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and genotyping were conducted using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and amplified fragment length polymorphism, respectively. Salmonella prevalence significantly increased with age from late nursery to slaughter {{for all of the}} cohorts (P = 0. 007). In two of three instances, all three <b>pig</b> <b>holding</b> pens (lairage) sampled at processing were Salmonella positive. The predominant antibiotypes for all sources included ACSSuT (51. 8 %), SSuT (16. 8 %), T (6 %), and pansusceptible (7. 4 %). For the isolates obtained at the farms, the ACSSuT phenotype was 5. 6 {{times more likely to be}} found in the animals than in the environment (95 % confidence interval, 4. 4 to 7. 2 times). Serogroup B was the most common serogroup (79 %), followed by serogroup E (10. 4 %). Despite the fact that the four production flows were independent, 1 of the 11 genotypic clusters (cluster A 1) was commonly detected in any type of sample regardless of its origin. Five of the genotypic clusters (clusters A 3, A 4, A 5, A 6, and A 7) contained isolates that originated from trucks and lairage swabs and also from cecal contents and/or mesenteric lymph nodes. More interestingly, genotypic clusters A 3, A 4, and A 6 (but not clusters A 5 and A 7) were not detected on the farms. They originated from the trucks and lairage swabs and then were identified from the cecal contents and/or mesenteric lymph nodes. These findings underscore the significance of various environmental factors, including inadequate truck-washing systems, and emphasize the role of lairage contamination by Salmonella that has food safety significance...|$|E

40|$|Detection of {{classical}} swine fever virus (CSFV) {{can be achieved by}} a range of assays of which the most commonly used are: immunohistochemical and virus culture techniques. New developments have enabled the detection of viral proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and the detection of the viral genome by RT- PCR. So far, laboratory findings show that the latter assays may supplement or replace the conventional techniques in the near future. The detection of serum antibody against structural and non-structural proteins of CSFV has been improved by developments in recombinant DNA techniques and has lead to a range of ELISAs. Although the characteristics of these ELISAs are excellent, positive results still need to be confirmed in the virus neutralization test. The available amount of sequence data enables diagnosticians to type strains of CSFV as different by comparing several parts of the genome. In some cases, this can provide conclusive evidence if a primary or secondary outbreak has been detected. Increased efforts focused on the retrieval of relevant data on the introduction of CSFV in a <b>pig</b> <b>holding</b> and the spread of CSFV in- and between pig holding(s) has generated more insight into the epizootiology of the disease. A successful control and eradication programme for {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) can consist of zoosanitary measures and/or vaccination. The latter can compromise the export of live pigs and pig products considerably unless marker vaccines have been used. Several studies were performed to determine the efficacy of an E 2 subunit vaccine and live recombinant vaccine candidates. Firstly, we determined the 95 % protective dose of an E 2 subunit vaccine at 32 μg E 2 per dosage after a single application. Further studies with a single administration of the subunit vaccine showed that: the vaccine was stable for a prolonged period after production, was able to reduce horizontal and vertical transmission of CSFV among vaccinated pigs, and provided protection for at least 6 months. An Erns antibody discriminatory assay was developed for use in combination with the subunit vaccine. Evaluation of the E(rns) ELISA showed that the sensitivity of the assay was lower than but that the specificity was equal to that of existing antibody assays. Two live recombinant marker vaccines were evaluated for the induction of clinical protection and reduction of transmission of CSFV shortly after vaccination. Results showed that these vaccines provided good clinical protection 1 week after a single vaccination. Research has shown that marker vaccines can be used in the future to support the control and eradication of CSFV...|$|E

Information on the antibiotic use at farm level is normally not available, which hampers the authority control of imprudent use of antibiotics. Therefore, SafeOrganic will investigate if bacterial antibiotic resistance patterns and genotypes can be used as markers for the consumption of antibiotics in organic animal production.

The program aims to achieve a 50 % reduction in the incidence and commercial impact of pale, soft and exudative pork by determining the level of pork quality at each processing facility and recommending improvements. A total of 1, 366 carcases was sampled from three processing facilities. Carcases were sampled over three days at each facility, representing approximately 25 % of the kill for those days. Pork quality was deter-mined by measuring pH and light scatter in the loin and ham of every carcase. Carcases were described as either extensive soft and exudative, localised soft and exudative, reddish-pink, firm and non-exudative, localised dark, firm and dry or extensive dark, firm and dry. The processing operations from unloading to chilling were also appraised at each facility to identify ways of improving pork quality.

40|$|The air of loose-boxes <b>holding</b> <b>pigs</b> {{affected}} with swine vesicular {{disease was}} sampled for virus. In the multistage impinger virus to a titre of 102 · 6 TCID 50 was associated with particles greater than 6 μm., 101 · 6 with particles 3 - 6 μm. and 101 · 4 or less with particles less than 3 μm. In the noses of workers {{in contact with the}} pigs for periods not less than 5 min., virus to a titre of 102 · 4 TCID 50 was found. Virus was recovered from the air for 2 - 3 days during the disease and maximum titre in pigs infected by injection or by contact occurred on the second to third day after generalization of the lesions. The amounts of virus were about 160 -fold less than those recovered from pigs affected with foot-and-mouth disease, and the quantity and time of excretion suggest that the source of {{swine vesicular disease}} virus in the aerosol may be from the lesions and skin rather than from the respiratory tract...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in pigs at abattoirs {{is higher than}} in pigs sampled on farms. This study investigated whether MRSA negative pigs can become MRSA positive during transportation from the farm to the abattoir after exposure to other pigs and environmental sources of MRSA. Nasal swabs were collected from four batches of pigs during loading at the farm, on arrival at the abattoir and after stunning. Environmental wipes were taken from lorries after transporting pigs and from lairages after <b>holding</b> <b>pigs.</b> All pigs (n = 117) tested MRSA negative before transportation. On arrival at the abattoir, 12 / 117 (10. 3 %) pigs in two batches tested MRSA positive. In lorries that tested positive after transportation, the {{prevalence of}} MRSA positive pigs was 21. 1 %, whereas no MRSA was detected in pigs that had been transported in lorries that tested negative after transportation. At stunning, all batches and 70 / 117 (59. 8 %) pigs tested MRSA positive. Pigs can become MRSA positive in the {{short period of time}} during transportation from the farm to stunning at the abattoi...|$|R
40|$|A {{parody of}} Democratic {{politics}} in the months preceding the party's 1848 national convention. Specifically, the artist ridicules the rivalry within the party between Free Soil or anti-slavery interests, which upheld the Wilmot Proviso, and regular, conservative Democrats or "Hunkers. " The "Gilpins" (named after the hero of William Cowper's 1785 "Diverting History of John Gilpin," who also loses control of his mount, to comic effect) are regular Democrats Lewis Cass, Thomas Hart Benton, and Levi Woodbury, who ride a giant sow down "Salt River Lane" away from the "Head Quarters of the Northern Democracy," which displays a Liberty cap and a flag "Wilmot Proviso. " Cass, a former general and avid expansionist, wears a military uniform and brandishes a sword "Annexation. " John Van Buren (right), a Free Soil Democrat, tries to restrain the <b>pig</b> by <b>holding</b> its tail. He remarks, "This is our last hope. If the tail draws out, they are gone for good. " A man at left tries to block the pig's passage shouting "Stop, stop, Old Hunkers! here's the house!" Cass orders, "Clear the road. Don't you see that we are fulfilling our manifest destiny!" Benton asserts, "We are not a whit inclined to tarry there. " On the far right a stout gentleman chases after them calling, "Hey! hey, there! where upon airth are you going? Come back here to your quarters!" Meanwhile former President and Free Soil contender Martin Van Buren is neck-deep in a pool at the lower right. He laments, "Had I served my country with half the zeal with which I served my illustrious predecessor, I should not thus have slumped in the mud. " He refers to his service under Andrew Jackson, whom he succeeded as President. Attribution of "The Modern Gilpins" to John L. Magee is based on its similarities in draftsmanship and facial characterizations to Magee's 1850 satire "The Clay Statue," (no. 1850 - 9) and to several Mexican War prints he executed for the publisher Baillie.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model for computing the temperature distribution in a torpedo-car <b>holding</b> <b>pig</b> iron is described in this work. The model determines the temperature gradients in steady and transient conditions within the different parts that constitute the system, which {{are considered to be}} the steel casing, refractory lining, liquid iron, slag and air. Heat transfer within the main fluid phases (iron and air) is computed assuming an apparent thermal conductivity term incorporating the contribution from convection and radiation, and it is affected by the dimensions of the vessel. Thermal gradients within the constituents of the torpedo-car are used to calculate heat losses during operation. It was found that the model required the incorporation of a region within the iron-refractory interface to reproduce thermographic data recorded during operation; the heat transfer coefficient of this interface was found to be equal to 30 Wm- 2 K- 1 . En este trabajo se describe un modelo bidimensional basado en el método del elemento finito para calcular la distribución de temperaturas en un carro torpedo lleno de arrabio. El modelo determina los gradientes térmicos en condiciones estacionarias y transitorias dentro de las partes que constituyen el sistema considerado, como son cubierta de acero, recubrimientos refractarios, arrabio líquido, escoria y aire. La transferencia de calor en las fases fluidas (arrabio y aire) se calcula suponiendo un coeficiente de conductividad térmica aparente que incorpora las contribuciones por convección y radiación y está afectado por las dimensiones del recipiente. El conocimiento de los gradientes térmicos permite calcular las pérdidas de calor durante la operación del carro. Se encontró que el modelo requiere de la incorporación de una región en la intercara hierro-refractario para reproducir la información termográfica recopilada durante pruebas en planta. El coeficiente de transferencia de calor de esta interacara resultó ser de 30 Wm- 2 K- 1 ...|$|R
