Possible reactions in a shorter time limit are contact allergy and toxic contact dermatitis. Some plastic materials are also known to release substances which may have an estrogenic effect. Aim: The aim of this master thesis was to explore by a literature research the risk for the patient getting adverse reactions when treated with resin-based materials. Materials and Methods: Relevant studies were acquired through a search in PubMed for adverse reactions and resin-based materials. Three relevant articles were found.

40|$|Endocrine {{disruptors}} (EDs) are exogenous substances or xenoestrogens {{natural or}} synthetic, capable of interacting with different systems and altering their normal hormonal regulation, being the reproductive system {{one of the}} most affected. EDs produce their effects not only by acting on nuclear steroid receptors, but also on membrane receptors, steroidal and non-steroidal synthetic enzymatic pathways and/or metabolism. The incorporation to the body depend on each EDs, which are liposoluble and easily deposited in the tissue; thus ensuring a prolonged accumulation and release, even when the exposure is not continuous. In addition to cross the placenta, EDs may act in the offspring during the reproductive system formation and maturation key stages and its regulatory mechanisms. The effects of EDs can be multiple, but most acts mediating estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic effect. Three groups of EDs are widely used: in plastics (<b>phtalates),</b> sunscreens (cinnamate and methylbenzylcamphor), and detergents (nonylphenol).

The risk exists {{due to the}} contact with xenogenic substances from maternal breast milk and other food, polluted air and water, plastic materials, cosmetics. All endocrine and neurological disruptors (EDC) pass across placenta, then can cause hormonal, neurological or metabolic disorders mainly due to estrogenic action. Bisphenol A is one of endocrine disruptors leaching from polychlorobiphenyl plastic (PCB), present commonly in baby polycarbonate bottles. <b>Phtalates</b> like DEHP, DOP, DINP, DIDP, DIPB, DBP or BBP are used as plasticizers making plastics softer and more flexible.

40|$|The {{modern society}} can be {{described}} as a globalized risk society characterised by increasing complexity and unpredictable consequences of techno-scientific innovations and production. One example is the “chemicalisation” of our society, bodies and nature. Actually one could even talk about a ”chemical oppression”, where we all – mainly unaware – are exposed to different risk-related chemicals, such as additives and contaminants, in our everyday life. Some examples, sometimes reported on in the public debate, are <b>phtalates</b> and perfluorated chemicals. But probably these groups of chemicals are only the top of an iceberg. Therefore, we think that risk-related chemicals should be discussed more in school and the discussion should be about e. g. knowledge uncertainties concerning chemical risks and actors’ interplay in the so-called ”chemical society”. However today, as illustrated with two examples (nanotechnology and plastics) from a lower-secondary chemistry textbook, the oppression seems to continue into the science/chemistry classroom. Chemical applications are often treated in an unproblematizing way in textbooks and teaching. Critical pedagogy opens up for a breaking of the chemical oppression through the science education. Furthermore, by puting emphasis in school on the chemical oppression, the society will get educated citizens – with critical scientific literacy – who are able to assess and value information about environmental chemicals and chemical risks, and also to take educated actions against the chemical oppression.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the cause of toxicity in sediments and suspended matter, {{a large number of}} samples with different degrees of contamination was taken at various locations in The Netherlands. Standard acute bioassays were carried out with the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the anostracan Thamnocephalus platyurus. Chronic standard tests were performed using the water flea Daphnia magna and larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius. Some novel bioassays were performed as well. Most toxic effects observed in standard bioassays with sediments from polluted sediments (class 3 and 4 on a scale of 0 ¿ 4 according to the Dutch criteria) could be partly explained by toxic concentrations of known persistent priority pollutants, mainly heavy metals and occasionally polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In some of the samples, ammonia toxicity was a confounding factor during testing. Suspended matter from the Meuse river at Eijsden, which may be considered as `new' sediment (pollution class 2), was moderately to highly toxic in almost all bioassays. This could have been associated with a combination of heavy metals, PAHs and ammonia. At two locations from the Lake IJssel area with no apparent persistent pollution, moderate and strong effects were nonetheless observed in invertebrate tests. This might have been due to agricultural run-off of pesticides, which are not routinely measured in sediments. A few effects on V. fischeri in canals and a small stream could not be explained with standard chemical analysis, but seemed associated with the outlets of sewage water treatment plants and industrial effluents. Additional chemical analysis of pore water samples from five selected sediments yielded more identified substances such as <b>phtalates,</b> decanes, cosanes and fragrances, but it was estimated that their contribution to the effects observed on V. fischeri, D. magna and C. riparius was negligible...|$|R

40|$|The Bayer {{process for}} the {{production}} of alumina, is a closed loop process that suffers from a buildup of organic molecules. These molecules contaminate the Bayer liquor resulting in lower plant efficiency. Removal of the contaminants is necessary to maintain plant operation. This research covers three distinct aspects of organic contaminant removal. In the first, plasma treatment of various synthetic Bayer liquors was performed. The process performance was determined as a function of operation parameters. Secondly, the decomposition of isophtalate and <b>phtalate</b> in a synthetic liquor was studied. Finally, system performance using real plant liquors was evaluated by using the plasma treatment method on two liquors imported from Alcan's plants. This innovative thermal plasma treatment process was developed at the Université de Sherbrooke in collaboration with Alcan International. The process utilizes a 40 kW, direct current (DC) submerged plasma torch to oxidize organic molecules in the contaminated Bayer liquor. The reactor may be operated in both batch or continuous modes with various types of plasma gases. Samples taken during testing were analyzed using the following techniques: potentiometry, ion chromatography, and some by precipitation. The determination of total organic carbon (TOC) was completed as well. The plasma system destroyed 22 % of the isophtalate and 20 % of the <b>phtalate</b> under identical conditions. For more concentrated Bayer solutions a loss in efficiency of approximately 10 % is expected. Use of oxygen as a plasma gas increases the efficiency of the treatment. For the range of concentrations studied, {{it is not possible to}} clearly determine how each organic molecule interacts with other organic components in the liquor. The treatment of aliphatic molecules like adipate is more rapid than that of the aromatic molecules such as phalate. In fact, the difference between the kinetic constants from an oxygen plasma treatment is approximately one order of magnitude with k adipate = 0. 0178 /min and k <b>phtalate</b> = 0. 0079 /min. A study of the plasma gas volume as a function of the plasma feed gas established the importance of the solution recirculation rate on reactor oxidation efficiency. A higher destruction efficiency was also achieved during the first 3 minutes of the plasma treatment process. After the typical 30 minute test, the caustic concentration diminishes by approximately 20 g/l while the carbonate increases by 10 g/l. The productivity of the liquor varies from - 0. 10 g hydrate /gTOC <b>phtalate</b> and - 0. 27 g hydrate /gTOC isophtalate. This is on a rage of 0 to 18 g TOC /l of salt respectively. Degradation by-products generated during the plasma treatment are very undesirable and contribute to lower the amount of hydrate produced by the liquor. As an example, a liquor with 12 g/l TOC of <b>phtalate,</b> treated by the plasma process, will loose 8. 7 % of its hydrate productivity. A 12 g/l TOC liquor of isophalate will loose 8. 9 % of its hydrate productivity. The 0. 2 % difference results from different by-products being produced during decomposition. Plant liquors may be treated continuously using the submerged plasma. As expected, a residence time of 15 minutes is preferable to a 5 minutes residence time. At a 3 l/min flow rate, the treatment of a liquor with an initial TOC of 6 g/l is less efficient than a liquor with an initial TOC of 35 g/l. The productivity of plant liquors after plasma treatment varies. Each liquor has its own characteristics. For example the hydrate production of plant A liquor increases by 0. 2 g hydrate/l for a treatment flow rate of 3 l/min. For the same treatment process, liquor from plant B looses 2. 4 g hydrate/l in productivity. The seemingly contradictory behavior of the treated liquors may be a result of the initial composition. Plant B's liquor probably started with larger organic molecules. During treatment these were broken into a number of smaller organic molecules. Plant A most likely started with a lower molecular weight organics charge which were destroyed by the plasma treatment resulting in a reduction of the total low molecular weight organics. The production plant Bayer liquor tests have shown that the plasma treatment needs to be evaluated specifically for each Bayer plant before process implementation and scale up. Further work should also include study of the effect of other aromatic molecules on the liquor productivity. Tests with synthetic liquors/catalyst mixtures may also be useful for exploration of new reaction mechanisms. This may include using a reducing medium for organic decomposition. Further simplification of the synthetic liquor composition will permit a more detailed study and fundamental comprehension of this reactive system. Use of hydrogen peroxide as a catalyst is promising as well...|$|E

The following plasticizers were chosen: the well-known bisphenol-A, three phthalates (diisononylphpthalate, DiNP; Di-isodecyl phthalate, DiDP; diethylene glycol dibenzoate, DiGD) and one organophosphorus compound (tri-m-cresylphosphate,TmCP). Their binding capacity to nuclear receptors was verified on HEPG 2 cells transfected with receptor-luciferase reporter constructs; all <b>phtalates</b> (10 - 5 - 10 - 7 M) were shown to activate PPAR and to induce the expression of downstream target genes (FABP 4, PDK 4, FGF 21, CPT 2). The potential obesogenic effects of these compounds were then tested on differentiating 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocyte cells. All molecules (10 - 8 - 10 - 6 M) were able to significantly enhance lipid droplet deposition when administered both in the two-days differentiation induction, or in the eight-days post differentiation period. Food plastic packaging is mostly composed by mixtures of plasticizers, so multiple molecules may migrate simultaneously into food. We therefore treated 3 T 3 -L 1 cells with mixtures of plasticizers (10 - 8 M each), mimicking commercial plastics (pvc, polypropylene, polyethylene teraphthalate); in all cases we observed a significant positive modulation of lipid deposition. The obesogenic effects of all compounds were also investigated at the molecular level by performing qRT-PCR on target genes such as PPARs, LXR, RXR and their downstream effectors. Taken together, our data enforce the emerging awareness on alteration of lipid metabolism following environmental exposure to plasticizers. This effect could be of special concern in vulnerable periods such as pregnancy and early postnatal life...|$|R

To achieve these goals detailed knowledge of the distribution and long-term effects of these substances is needed. This information is crucial for the development of future-oriented policy measures at the national and European level. The project can be divided into four different research phases. In Phase I the occurance and distribution of endocrine disrupting substances in the Scheldt estuary was studied. Water, sediment, suspended solids and biota were sampled 3 times a year for a period of 4 years (2002 - 2006). In all these matrices, 7 groups of chemicals were analysed: estrogens, pesticides, phthalates, organotins, polyaromatic components (PCBs, PBDEs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phenols. All the analyzed chemicals are on the OSPAR list of priority chemicals or are indicated as endocrine disruptors on this list. The different water samples were also tested using in vitro assays to assess their potential to bind to the (human) estrogen and androgen receptor. Phase II evaluated the exposure of biota occuring in the Scheldt estuary to endocrine disrupting substances. Based on the results of the chemical analysis, priority substances were selected. Phase III studied the effects of endocrine disrupting substances occurring in the Scheldt estuary on resident mysid shrimp populations (laboratory and field studies). Substances of concern were selected and tested in the laboratory to evaluate their effects on the estuarine mysid Neomysis integer. In the context of this project, three new assays using invertebrate-specific endpoints were developed to examine the effect of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on molting, embryogenesis and vitellogenesis of N. integer. Finally, in Phase IV laboratory and field results were used to perform a preliminary environmental risk assessment of endocrine disruptors in the Scheldt estuary. Samples were collected along the salinity gradiënt of the Scheldt estuary with the RV Belgica. Water samples were taken with Teflon-coated Go-Flo bottles (10 L), sediment samples with Van Veen Grab, biota with a hyperbentic sledge, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) was continuously sampled with an Alfa Laval flow-through centrifuge. For the chemical analysis, protocols were developed to analyse estrogens, organotriazine herbicides, organochlorine pesticides, <b>phtalates,</b> organotins, PAHs, PCBs, and PBDEs in the different matrices: i. e. water, sediment, SPM and biota. Experimental studies were performed to analyse growth, molting, embryogenesis and vitellogenesis of N. integer. These studies were needed to develop ecotoxicological assays to evaluate EDCs on these physiological processes. To study growth of N. integer, organisms were individually transferrred in exposure solutions and molts were collected to measure the growth after each molting. To study embryogenesis, embryos were taking out of the marsupium and placed in multiwell plates. Each day survival, developmental stages and hatching was analysed. To study vitellogenesis, vitellin was isolated from eggs with gelfitration and polyclonal antibodies were developed (in rabbits). With the isolated vitellin and the antibodies an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed. Vitellin was quatified in ovigerous females exposed to test compound in the laboratory and in females collected from the different sampling sites of the Scheldt estuary. In addition to vitellin levels, energy allocation and testosterone metabolism was examined in field collected mysids. Finally, results from population stu...|$|R
40|$|The {{forward and}} {{backward}} scattering parts (phase 11) of the new neutron spectrometer, TOSCA, replacing the old TFXA and TOSCA (phase 1), have been successfully installed at the ISIS pulsed neutron source. The results show a significant enhancement in the counting rate due to the larger detector area. The improved resolution (to 1. 5 %- 3 % of the energy transfer) {{as compared with the}} previous instruments (TXFA: 2. 5 %- 3. 5 %; TOSCA-I: 2 %- 3. 5 %) has been achieved by increasing the primary flight path from 12 m to 17 m. A chopper has been added in order to avoid neutron frame overlap and to reduce the fast neutron background. Additional diffraction capability will be installed in the near future. An example of the high resolution that is routinely available is provided by the spectrum of potassium hydrogen <b>phtalate</b> at 20 K...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} spectroscopic {{properties of}} some Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs), frequently found {{in food and}} in natural water. Studied molecules belong to the groups of phenolic and phthalate EDCs. In a first part, we have examined their absorption and fluorescence properties. Fluorescence emission wavelengths are about 300 nm for phenolic compounds and 360 nm for <b>phtalate</b> compounds; main excitation wavelengths being comprised between 210 nm and 230 nm. Fluorescence lifetimes measured are short (about 4 ns) and the fluorescence quantum yield has been determined. In a second part, to avoid the time consuming solvent extraction step, an analytical application to evaluate {{the performance of a}} direct analysis by laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy of ECDs traces in tap water and in raw water is presented. Good detection limits have been obtained, i. e. : 0. 35 µg. L− 1 of chlorophenol in tap water, which are always lower than the reported Predictive Non Efficient Concentration (PNEC) ...|$|E
40|$|Phtalates are {{commonly}} found in several household products such as food packaging, furniture and toys. Humans are exposed to phtalates through different ways such as inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact. Due to the abundance of plastic in our society, the exposure to phtalates is ubiquitous. A {{growing body of evidence}} investigated the association of <b>phtalate</b> exposure with cardiovascular risk factors, i. e., obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Phtalates are thought to contribute to obesity through their binding and activation of PPARγ receptor that in turn results in the upregulation of adipocyte production. Phtalates are also known to interfere with insulin signaling and to increase oxidative stress. All these mechanisms contribute to the onset of insulin resistance. Recent evidences support a role of phtalates in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and hypertension. Thus, the aim of this communication was to summarize the current evidences dealing with the association of phtalates and cardiovascular risk factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} sensors of {{the construction}} of Hyoscine Butylbromide (HyB) ionselective electrodes based on the complex ion associate of hyoscine with tetraphenyl borate ionophor in the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) matrix with dioctyl <b>phtalate</b> and dibutyl sebathate as plasticizers. The electrochemical performance characteristics of the two HyB-selective electrodes were evaluated according to IUPAC standards. Sensors show stable potential response with near Nernstian slope of 52. 42, 54. 57 mV per decade for sensors denoted as № 1 and 2, respectively. Selectivity coefficients data for different organic and inorganic ions are also presented. The two sensors have fast response time (20 - 30 s) and applicable over a wide range of the operational pH (6 - 10). The results obtained from the determination of HyB with the two proposed electrodes have shown the average recoveries of 98. 6 %, 99. 6 % for analysis of tablets and 100. 17 %, 99. 01 for (spiked) human plasma. The data agree well with those obtained by the standard reference methods...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of {{preprocessing}} of short Curaua fibers with supercritical carbon dioxide on the properties of biocomposites with cellulose acetate was studied. The treatment with supercritical CO 2 may result in the partial lignin extraction from the fibers. Two series of biocomposites, one plasticized with dioctyl <b>phtalate</b> (DOP) and another with triethyl citrate (TEC), were prepared by extrusion. Fibrilation and uniform distribution of fibers in the cellulose acetate matrix were observed for both biocomposites. As a consequence, the composites showed a higher specific heat, lower thermal conductivity and higher {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} than plasticized cellulose acetate. The treatment of the fibers increased such differences. Among the plasticizers, DOP was more efficient, decreasing Tg and Young's modulus of plasticized cellulose acetate. The fiber addition had a relatively low impact on the modulus (10 %), however caused a decrease in the impact resistance. Taken together, the results show that these biocomposites are promising as thermal insulators, with the additional advantage of biodegradability of all components in the case of biocomposites plasticized with TEC...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of three}} characteristic groups of trace organic compounds (Phtalates, Nonyl Phenol Ethoxylates and Chlorophenols) in a ground-plant {{system has been}} carried out. With the aim of reclaiming biosolids for agriculture, the transfer potential has been studied in hydroponically growing tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Rondello), where transfer should be optimal. Plant containers inside a temperature and humidity controlled plant house were used. There were two types of experiment. Trace organic compounds have initially been introduced as pure substances. A second experiment {{has been carried out}} under the same conditions, but using wastewater treatment plant biosolids. The results clearly show a difference in behaviour of the trace organic compounds according to the part of the plant and method of introduction. Generally speaking, for the experiments using pure substances, the roots absorb higher quantities of trace organic compounds and block {{to a greater or lesser}} extent their transfer to the above ground parts of the tomato plant. However, with the biosolids filtrate, the Di-ethylhexyl <b>phtalate</b> and the Nonyl ethoxylate phenol can be traced all over the plant...|$|E
40|$|Flotation of {{plastics}} becomes a very prospective method of their separation {{as a reflection}} of the industrial quality of purity requirements. The problem is however that most of the plastics have relatively similar hydrophobic surfaces preventing them to be selectively sorted by the flotation method. That is why various ways have been proposed in order to stimulate the wetting of the plastics´ surfaces selectively (gamma flotation, selective adsorption of wettting substances or depressants, physical treatment, and chemical treatment). Unfortunately, the application of traditional use of depressants is questionable since there are different or even contrast theoretical explanations of their adsorption mechanism on the plastics´ surfaces. In this article, a brief theoretical overview is presented summarizing the possible mechanisms of the selective adsorption of organic depressants from the standpoint of modern surface thermodynamics approaches. On the other hand, the method of chemical treatment of the plastics´ surfaces known as the selective hydrophobic modification is better studied and so understood. Therefore, the influence of NaOH solutions as well as of two plasticizers (diisodecyl <b>phtalate</b> and diethylen glycol dibenzoate) on the surface wettability of PVC and PET plastics has been studied experimentally...|$|E
