500|$|Israeli actress Ania Bukstein {{was also}} {{introduced}} in the series as the High Priestess Kinvara, who is brought to Meereen to spread propaganda about Daenerys Targaryen's supposed success at eliminating {{the problem with the}} Sons of the Harpy. In an interview with Bukstein she said, [...] "Yes, it's very exciting, but let's calm down. It's not like I'm the new Khaleesi. Game of Thrones came after a ton of hard work. I filmed a lot of audition tapes in front of a white wall at home. I've <b>paid</b> <b>my</b> dues for years." [...] Bukstein also stated that she had previously sent in an audition tape to the series when it was first casting its first season, saying, [...] "A few years ago, when they had only begun to cast the first season of Game of Thrones, I sent an audition tape. I didn't really know for which role, and I mainly didn't know—and neither did the world—what a hit the series was about to become. But I remember that even then, the scenes that I got excited me, and I completely went with the style." ...|$|E
500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ... You do {{this all the time}} in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times I <b>paid</b> <b>my</b> taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as of the time of the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, Hill {{was charged}} with three counts of tax fraud or failing to file taxes (Title 26 USC § 7202 Willful failure to collect or pay over tax) not tax evasion [...] on $1.8 million of income earned between 2005 and 2007. During this time she had toured as a musical artist, earned {{royalties}} from both her records and from films she had appeared in, and had owned and {{been in charge of}} multiple corporations. In a long post to her Tumblr, Hill said that she had gone [...] "underground" [...] and had rejected pop culture's [...] "climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism and ageism." [...] She added that, [...] "When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and <b>paid</b> <b>my</b> taxes. This only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family." [...] On June 29, 2012, Hill appeared in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark and pleaded guilty to the charges; her attorney said she would make restitution for the back taxes she owed. By April 22, 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately; U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying [...] "This is not someone who stands before the court penniless. This is a criminal matter. Actions speak louder than words, and there has been no effort here to pay these taxes." [...] Hill also faced possible eviction from her rented home in South Orange as well as a civil lawsuit from the town for running a business out of a home without a zoning permit.|$|E

2500|$|One of Zimmer's most durable {{works from}} {{his time in}} the United Kingdom was the theme song for the {{television}} game show Going for Gold, which he composed with Sandy McClelland in 1987. In an interview with the BBC, Zimmer said: [...] "Going for Gold was a lot of fun. It's the sort of stuff you do when you don't have a career yet. God, I just felt so lucky because this thing <b>paid</b> <b>my</b> rent for the longest time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Freddie Hubbard {{had close}} ties to the Jazz Foundation of America in his later years. He is quoted as saying, [...] "When I had {{congestive}} heart failure and couldn't work, The Jazz Foundation <b>paid</b> <b>my</b> mortgage for several months and saved my home! Thank God for those people." [...] The Jazz Foundation of America's Musicians' Emergency Fund took care of him during times of illness. After his death, Hubbard's estate requested that tax-deductible donations be made in his name to the Jazz Foundation of America.|$|E
2500|$|Berlin {{loved his}} country, and wrote many songs {{reflecting}} his patriotism. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau requested {{a song to}} inspire Americans to buy war bonds, for which he wrote [...] "Any Bonds Today?" [...] He assigned all royalties to the United States Treasury Department. He then wrote songs for various government agencies and likewise assigned all profits to them: [...] "Angels of Mercy" [...] for the American Red Cross; [...] "Arms for the Love of America", for the Army Ordnance Department; and [...] "I <b>Paid</b> <b>My</b> Income Tax Today," [...] again to Treasury.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{incident}} McQueen's stepfather persuaded {{his mother to}} sign a court order stating that McQueen was incorrigible, remanding him to the California Junior Boys Republic in Chino. Here, McQueen began to change and mature. He was not popular with the other boys at first: [...] "Say the boys had a chance once a month to load into a bus and go into town to see a movie. And they lost out because one guy in the bungalow didn't get his work done right. Well, you can pretty well guess they're gonna {{have something to say}} about that. I <b>paid</b> <b>my</b> dues with the other fellows quite a few times. I got my lumps, no doubt about it. The other guys in the bungalow had ways of paying you back for interfering with their well-being." [...] Ultimately McQueen became a role model when he was elected to the Boys Council, a group who set the rules and regulations governing the boys' lives. He eventually left the Boys Republic at age 16. When he later became famous he regularly returned to talk to the boys and retained a lifelong association.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1970, Gibb played piano on George Harrison's song [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] and Genesis' Phil Collins remembers {{him being}} present {{when he played}} on that song. In 1971, he {{produced}} Lulu's 1971 song [...] "Everybody Clap", which features Gibb on guitar, Leslie Harvey on guitar, former Manfred Mann and Cream member Jack Bruce on bass, and Led Zeppelin's John Bonham on drums. Bonham and his wife, Pat Philips became friends with Gibb and Lulu. Also in that year, he played bass on Billy Lawrie's 1973 song [...] "Freedom". Future Wings and former Thunderclap Newman guitarist Jimmy McCulloch played guitar on that song, and McCulloch suggests that it was recorded at {{around the same time}} as Lulu's [...] "Everybody Clap", with Stone the Crows' Maggie Bell providing backing vocals.
