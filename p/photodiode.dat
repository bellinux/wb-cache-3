25|$|Dark current: The current {{through the}} <b>photodiode</b> {{in the absence}} of light, when it is {{operated}} in photoconductive mode. The dark current includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the saturation current of the semiconductor junction. Dark current must be accounted for by calibration if a <b>photodiode</b> is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of noise when a <b>photodiode</b> is used in an optical communication system.|$|E
25|$|Photodiodes {{are similar}} to regular {{semiconductor}} diodes except {{that they may be}} either exposed (to detect vacuum UV or X-rays) or packaged with a window or optical fiber connection to allow light to reach the sensitive part of the device. Many diodes designed for use specifically as a <b>photodiode</b> use a PIN junction rather than a p–n junction, to increase the speed of response. A <b>photodiode</b> is designed to operate in reverse bias.|$|E
40|$|Silicon <b>photodiodes</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} by defect-free phosphorus diffusion having practically no carrier recombination at the SiSiO 2 interface or in the front diffused region.

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} and investigation of carbon nanotubes-based Schottky <b>photodiodes</b> using different metals and structures. It is found that the work functions of metals {{play an important role}} in determining the properties of the <b>photodiodes.</b> Symmetric Schottky <b>photodiodes</b> using different metals have varied dark current and photocurrent of several orders of magnitude. Low built-in potentials resulted in large dark current and photocurrent, while high built-in potentials caused smaller dark current and photocurrent. Two Schottky barriers reversely connecting with each other in the symmetric metal structure, which was verified by position-dependent photocurrent measurements, can explain this. In order to improve the performance of CNT-based Schottky <b>photodiodes,</b> asymmetric structure <b>photodiodes</b> using metals with high/low work functions at two contacts were fabricated. Compared to the symmetric <b>photodiodes,</b> asymmetric <b>photodiodes</b> had lower dark current and higher photocurrent. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{variety of}} silicon carbide (SiC) {{detectors}} {{have been developed}} to study their sensitivity, including Schottky <b>photodiodes,</b> p-i-n <b>photodiodes,</b> avalanche <b>photodiodes</b> (APDs), and single photon-counting APDs. Due to the very wide bandgap and thus extremely low leakage current, SiC photo-detectors show excellent sensitivity. The specific detectivity, D*, of SiC <b>photodiodes</b> are many orders of magnitude higher than the D * of other solid state detectors, and for the first time, comparable to that of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). SiC APDs have also been fabricated to pursue the ultimate sensitivity. By operating the SiC APDs at a linear mode gain over 106, single photon-counting avalanche <b>photodiodes</b> (SPADs) in UV have been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The highly {{sensitive}} silicon PIN <b>photodiodes</b> were fabricated {{to use in}} radiation environments. The Si PIN <b>photodiodes</b> are coated with 150 nm silicon dioxide (SiO 2) as anti-reflective (AR) coating. The presence of AR coating {{on the performance of}} irradiated PIN <b>photodiodes</b> is studied up to a total dose of 10 Mrad. The effects of 75 MeV boron (B 5 +) ions and 60 Co gamma radiation on the I–V, C–V and spectral responses of PIN <b>photodiodes</b> were studied systematically to understand the radiation tolerance of the devices. The 75 MeV B 5 + irradiation results are compared with 60 Co gamma irradiated results in the same dose range for 1 mm × 1 mm and 10 mm × 10 mm active area PIN <b>photodiodes.</b> The irradiation results show that the ion irradiated PIN <b>photodiodes</b> show more degradation when compared 60 Co gamma irradiated devices. The irradiation results are presented in this paper and the possible mechanism behind the degradation of <b>photodiodes</b> is also discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{the results of}} an {{investigation}} into the effects of ionizing radiation on commercial-off-the-shelf InGaAs and Si <b>photodiodes.</b> The <b>photodiodes</b> were exposed to 30, 52, and 98 MeV protons with fluences ranging from 10 ^ 8 - 5 x 10 ^ 11 protons/cm^ 2 at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility. We tested the <b>photodiodes</b> for changes to their dark current and their relative responsivity as a function of wavelength. The Si <b>photodiodes</b> showed increasing damage to their responsivity with increasing fluence; the InGaAs <b>photodiodes</b> showed significantly increased dark current as the fluence increased. In addition, we monitored the absolute responsivity of the InGaAs <b>photodiodes</b> over their entire bandpass.

25|$|One {{advantage}} of <b>photodiode</b> arrays (PDAs) {{is that they}} allow for high speed parallel read out since the driving electronics may not be built in like a traditional CMOS or CCD sensor.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>photodiode</b> {{is used in}} {{an optical}} {{communication}} system, all these parameters contribute to {{the sensitivity of the}} optical receiver, which is the minimum input power required for the receiver to achieve a specified bit error rate.|$|E
25|$|Photosensors of {{all types}} {{may be used to}} respond to {{incident}} light, or to a source of light {{which is part of the}} same circuit or system. A <b>photodiode</b> is often combined into a single component with an emitter of light, usually a light-emitting diode (LED), either to detect the presence of a mechanical obstruction to the beam (slotted optical switch), or to couple two digital or analog circuits while maintaining extremely high electrical isolation between them, often for safety (optocoupler). The combination of LED and <b>photodiode</b> is also used in many sensor systems to characterize different types of products based on their optical absorbance.|$|E
40|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{noise measurement}} setup employing a switching unit to measure statistically relevant numbers of InAs/GaSb superlattice <b>photodiodes</b> has been developed. The noise current resolution limit of 20 fA Hz(- 1 / 2) enables {{the characterization of}} focal plane array-sized InAs/GaSb superlattice homojunction <b>photodiodes</b> for the long-wavelength infrared at 77 K. To resolve midwavelength infrared <b>photodiodes</b> a junction area of about (400 µm) 2 is required. Without switching unit and by using a dedicated low noise amplifier, noise currents down to 2 fA Hz(- 1 / 2) can be achieved, allowing the noise characterization of mid-wavelength <b>photodiodes</b> with smaller junction areas. With this setup longwavelength and mid-wavelength InAs/GaSb superlattice <b>photodiodes,</b> with generation-recombination limited dark current behavior, are investigated at 77 K. The measured diode noise follows the theoretically predicted shot noise level within the white noise part of the spectra...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} our {{research}} efforts on RCE high-speed high-efficiency p-i-n and Schottky <b>photodiodes.</b> Using a microwave compatible planar fabrication process, we have designed and fabricated GaAs based RCE <b>photodiodes.</b> For RCE Schottky <b>photodiodes,</b> {{we have achieved}} a peak quantum efficiency of 50 % along with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 100 GHz. The tunability of the detectors via a recess etch is also demonstrated. For p-i-n type <b>photodiodes,</b> we have fabricated and tested widely tunable devices with near 100 % quantum efficiencies, along with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 50 GHz.

These <b>photodiodes</b> exhibit short-circuit responsivities of 0. 3 and 0. 2 A/W at 1. 3 and 1. 55 mum, respectively, reverse dark currents of 20 mA/cm(2) and response times of 800 ps...|$|R
25|$|While {{alternatives}} are available, perhaps the simplest method for position detection involves imaging the trapping laser exiting the sample chamber onto a quadrant <b>photodiode.</b> Lateral deflections {{of the beam}} are measured similarly to how it is done using atomic force microscopy (AFM).|$|E
25|$|When used in zero bias or {{photovoltaic}} mode, {{the flow}} of photocurrent out of the device is restricted and a voltage builds up. This mode exploits the photovoltaic effect, which {{is the basis for}} solar cells – a traditional solar cell is just a large area <b>photodiode.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>photodiode</b> is a p–n {{junction}} or PIN structure. When a photon {{of sufficient}} energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. This mechanism {{is also known}} as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The total current through the <b>photodiode</b> is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.|$|E
40|$|The {{optical and}} {{electrical}} {{characteristics of the}} various types of <b>photodiodes</b> potentially useful for UV radiometers were studied. It was concluded that both GaAsP and GaP <b>photodiodes</b> have advantages over silicon <b>photodiodes</b> in terms of spectral response and UV stability. Both GaAsP and GaP have excellent electrical characteristics for low frequency radiometers, although their high capacitance could be inconvenient for high frequency applications. GaAsP is particularly good with respect to dynamic range...|$|R
25|$|P–n <b>photodiodes</b> are {{not used}} to measure {{extremely}} low light intensities.

By operating the SiC APDs at a linear mode gain over 10 (exp 6), SPADs in UV have been demonstrated. SiC UV detectors have great potential for use in solar blind UV detection and biosensing. Moreover, SiC detectors have excellent radiation hardness and high temperature tolerance which makes them ideal for extreme environment applications such as in space or {{on the surface of the}} Moon or Mars...|$|R

25|$|Avalanche photodiodes are photodiodes with {{structure}} {{optimized for}} operating with high reverse bias, approaching the reverse breakdown voltage. This allows each photo-generated carrier to be multiplied by avalanche breakdown, resulting in internal gain within the <b>photodiode,</b> {{which increases the}} effective responsivity of the device.|$|E
25|$|If an {{external}} voltage is placed across the diode {{with the same}} polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues {{to act as an}} insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless electron–hole pairs are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see <b>photodiode).</b> This is called the reverse bias phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} on-orbit calibration of <b>photodiodes</b> for sun sensing in an attitude determination system. The calibration estimates the scale factors and alignment angles of the <b>photodiodes,</b> resulting in higher attitude determination accuracy than achieved with the pre-flight calibration parameters. The calibration is implemented with an extended Kalman filter to simultaneously estimate spacecraft attitude and the calibration parameters. This approach, {{as opposed to an}} attitude-independent method, enables the calibration of an arbitrary number of <b>photodiodes</b> mounted in any orientation on the spacecraft and facilitates the use of an attitude-dependent Earth albedo model. The method is demonstrated by application to flight data from the RAX- 2 satellite and results in an average angular improvement of 10 _ in sun vector measurements with the <b>photodiodes.</b> Attitude determination accuracies of below 1 _ in each axis are demonstrated using the calibrated <b>photodiodes</b> in combination with a low-cost three-axis magnetometer and rate gyroscope...|$|R

25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this <b>photodiode</b> current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a <b>photodiode.</b> While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{distinct}} applications of this technique. One is the optical clock, where an optical frequency is overlapped {{with a single}} tooth of the comb on a <b>photodiode,</b> and a radio frequency is compared to the beat signal, the repetition rate, and the CEO-frequency. Applications for the frequency-comb technique include optical metrology, frequency-chain generation, optical atomic clocks, high-precision spectroscopy, and more precise GPS technology.|$|E
25|$|Electrically, RO is a {{resistance}} {{controlled by the}} current flowing through the light source. In the dark state, the resistance typically exceeds a few MOhm; when illuminated, it decreases as the inverse of the light intensity. In contrast to the <b>photodiode</b> and phototransistor, the photoresistor can operate in both the AC and DC circuits and have a voltage of several hundred volts across it. The harmonic distortions of the output current by the RO are typically within 0.1% at voltages below 0.5 V.|$|E
