A simplified equation for estimating maximum surge height is provided. Estimated heights are {{shown to be}} in reasonable agreement with <b>preliminary</b> water <b>mark</b> measurements. An application of the equation for a different geographical setting is described. At the end of August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near the Louisiana / Mississippi border (Fig. 1). Less than one month later, Hurricane Rita struck near the Louisiana / Texas border (Fig. 2). Both of these storms produced catastrophic damage, and areas of the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts were devastated. According to the National Hurricane Center (Knabb et al., 2005 a and 2005 b), precise measurements of the maximum storm surges associated with these storms were complicated due to incomplete or failed gauge records and, in some areas, the complete destruction of coastal structures which otherwise might have been left with residual high water marks. Nevertheless, extensive surveys were conducted by the Interagency Performance Evaluation Taskforce (IPET) and by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

40|$|Information may {{be defined}} as the {{conceptual}} or communicable part of the content of mental acts. The content of mental acts includes sensory data as well as concepts, particular as well as general information. An information system is an external (non-mental) system designed to store such content. Information systems afford indirect transmission of content between people, some of whom may put information into the system and others who are among those who use the system. In order for communication to happen, the conceptual systems of the originators and users of the information must be sufficiently similar. A formal conceptual framework that can provide the basis for exchange of information is termed an ontology. In its most fundamental form, ontology studies the most basic constituents of reality. Traditionally, ontology seeks to reflects structures that are independent of thought and cognition. The term ontology is used more broadly in artificial intelligence and software engineering, to refer to the conceptual basis for an information system. As part of our investigations of the ontological foundations of geographic information science (Smith and Mark, 1998, 1999), we are studying the concepts that every-day people use when thinking and communicating about the geographic world, the categories used in people’s naive geographies (Egenhofer and Mark, 1995). This paper is based on an experimental protocol that elicits examples of categories from subjects. This protocol follows one used by Battig and Montague (1968) to elicit such category examples, which they called norms; we piloted this protocol for geographic categories last year, and reported some <b>preliminary</b> results (<b>Mark</b> at al., 1999).

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Failure of {{the donor}} (graft) heart {{is the main}} cause of {{mortality}} in the first month after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. In a <b>preliminary</b> study <b>marked</b> downregulation of cardiac beta adrenoceptor density was found in apparently normal donor hearts of recipients who developed severe cardiac failure soon after implantation. Cardiac beta adrenoceptors are an important factor in the development of cardiac failure in the human heart. The aim of this study therefore was to determine whether fatal graft failure in the first month after transplantation is associated with downregulation of beta adrenoceptor density in the donor heart. PATIENTS AND METHODS [...] Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens were taken from consecutive adult donor patients immediately before implantation. A previously described radioligand binding method was used to determine beta adrenoceptor density in consecutive patients who developed fatal graft failure and died within 1 month of transplantation and in a group of control donors transplanted during the same period. RESULTS [...] Perioperative fatal graft failure developed in 13 patients. Forty one specimens from donor hearts that were transplanted into recipients who did not develop fatal graft heart failure formed the control group. There were no systematic differences in donor or recipient characteristics between the graft heart failure and control groups. In particular donor catecholamine requirement and recipient pulmonary vascular resistance did not differ between groups. Total beta adrenoceptor density was reduced in the fatal graft heart failure group compared with that in the controls (13. 4 (7) fmol/mg v 21 (7) fmol/mg; P < 0. 01). There was a positive correlation between beta adrenoceptor density in the donor heart and time to death in the graft heart failure group (r 2 = 0. 3, P < 0. 05). The beta adrenoceptor binding affinity (Kd) did not differ between the graft failure group and the controls (47 (6) pM v 44 (7) pM). CONCLUSION [...] The development of perioperative fatal cardiac failure after orthotopic cardiac transplantation is associated with downregulation of beta adrenoceptors in the donor heart before implantation...|$|R
40|$|Hillside Commons : a cohousing {{development}} The {{focus of}} this thesis centers {{on the role of}} the designer in a cohousing project. Facilitator, orchestrator, and mediator are all roles the designer must accept as a professional within the participatory design process. A desired site, potential applicable codes, and the global, regional, and local environment, present tangible resources for the early stages of design. The most important resource remains intangible and that is the users themselves. Their ideas and or definitions for community along with their feelings about privacy combined with existing or desired routines make listening the most important tool available to the designer. The focus of all concerned aims at developing a cohesive intentional community design. Facilitation is achieved by listening to the needs and concerns and translating them into ideas. Success of the participatory design process depends on the dynamics of group communication before it can be realized in three-dimensional form. Mediation between group members initiates the designer into the process. The succeeding development of a <b>preliminary</b> program <b>marks</b> the first phase of the process for the designer. Phase two for the designer is marked by the purchase of the site. Theory for passive solar design can be given real numbers. Code compliance no longer has to be second guessed. The orchestration of actual site analysis and code compliance can now be combined with the preliminary program. The combination of phase I and Phase 11 will eventually bring both the designer and the cohousing group into the final phase of the design process. When the final design phase begins all users need to understand the constraints and allowances of the site and the general conditions of the preliminary program. Once agreed to, physical design issues are less tedious and more accessible. Arriving at a group consensus on the final design acknowledges the efforts of all involved. The design consultant's job may continue with construction documentation but the participatory design process works efficiently and effectively, more often than not, where professional consultation assists the process.

None of them evaluated the global exposure to ribavirin. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether early ribavirin global exposure is related with SVR. An exploratory pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) study was conducted in genotype 1 hepatitis C patients treated with peginterferon alfa- 2 a and ribavirin (dose-adjusted for BW) for 12 weeks, to which amantadine was added for the following 36 weeks. Full and abbreviated ribavirin area under the concentration time curves (AUC(0 - 12 h), AUC(0 - 4 h)) were derived from plasma concentration profiles at day 0 (D 0), week 12 (W 12), W 12 + 1 day, and W 24. Virological follow-up was performed at D 0 (0, 12, and 24 hours), W 2, W 4, W 6, and monthly until W 72 (TaqMan polymerase chain reaction, cut-off 15 international units/mL). Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in the study and 24 completed it. Patients with a SVR had a significantly higher D 0 AUC(0 - 12 h) (3695 [1571 - 6916] versus 2937 [1266 - 4913] microg/hour/L, P = 0. 03) and D 0 AUC(0 - 4 h) (2010 [615 - 3175] versus 1340 [622 - 2246] microg/hour/L, P = 0. 03). Patients with D 0 AUCs above the cut-off values defined by receiver operating characteristic curves (3014 microg/hour/L and 1755 microg/hour/L for AUC(0 - 12 h) and AUC(0 - 4 h), respectively) had a significantly better chance of achieving an SVR than patients with AUCs under the thresholds (odds ratio = 16. 0, 95 % confidence interval 1. 54 - 166. 6, P = 0. 02 and odds ratio = 8. 9, 95 % confidence interval, 1. 4 - 56. 6; P = 0. 02).

Small-scale trial excavations were conducted in order to check the hypothesis of a possible cemetery site, as well as to determine microtopographic and chronological relations of Late Bronze Age settlements in the Slatina area. The trial excavations encompassed the eastern part of the settlement from the older stage of the Late Bronze Age. Unearthed in the settlement were parts of shallower trenches (SU 10, 18, 26, 28, 44), which might be remains of fences of smaller plots, as well as pillar hole remains (SU 14, 20, 24, 30, 32) with some daub, and pits (SU 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 22, 34, 36, 38, 40) with waste materials, containing ceramic vessels fragments, bones and charcoal. Characteristic for the Bobovište site is a large quantity of incinerated bones in the pits, which in a <b>preliminary</b> analysis were <b>marked</b> as animal bones, thus confirming the site as a settlement.

Patients with a SVR had a significantly higher D 0 AUC 0 – 12 h (3695 [1571 – 6916] versus 2937 [1266 – 4913] μg/hour/L, P = 0. 03) and D 0 AUC 0 – 4 h (2010 [615 – 3175] versus 1340 [622 – 2246] μg/hour/L, P = 0. 03). Patients with D 0 AUCs above the cut-off values defined by receiver operating characteristic curves (3014 μg/hour/L and 1755 μg/hour/L for AUC 0 – 12 h and AUC 0 – 4 h, respectively) had a significantly better chance of achieving an SVR than patients with AUCs under the thresholds (odds ratio = 16. 0, 95 % confidence interval 1. 54 – 166. 6, P = 0. 02 and odds ratio = 8. 9, 95 % confidence interval, 1. 4 – 56. 6; P = 0. 02). Conclusion: Ribavirin exposure at D 0 is significantly related to SVR. To our knowledge, this is the first study to give an early pharmacokinetic predictor of SVR. We propose a minimum AUC 0 – 4 h threshold of 1755 μg/hour/L at D 0 as a target for ribavirin dose adjustment...|$|R
