40|$|Nowdays an {{efficient}} production {{is critical to}} achieve for companies competing {{on the market for}} steel cutting tools. One of such companies is Halmstad based Tooling Support Halmstad AB that manufactures threading-taps, threading-dies and <b>parting</b> <b>off</b> <b>tools,</b> towards a centralized warehouse in Schiedam, Holland. The large amount of different products, approximately 2500 is a big contributor to the problem along with a new order system that creates a demand of low setup times. Previously the company was forwarded orders through quarter based prognoses which enabled planning of the production over a longer time span. Currently the newer order system ZENIT is in use and the company thereby gets their orders weekly. This type of customer orders effects the production in terms of weekly orders having a variety of different products, which in turn creates a larger amount of setup work that prolongs the lead times even further. The purpose of this project has been to survey the present production in the end manufacturing state of the thread taps in order to come up with improvement proposals which will lead to a more flexible production and less sensitive to irregular demand. The factory consists of several production lines. Our work has been limited to the end manufacturing state of the thread taps in one of the 9 production lines, line 435. Based on the limitation our work has followed the production and order use of thread taps from the local storage to precisely before the wash. Value stream mapping and the SMED-method has been useful during the work process. With these tools proposals have been generated towards a production flow with a divided lead time compared to the current state and a decreased setup-time by 26...|$|R

The OS/SL series to Freetown and the South Atlantic continued, but now the two routes were combined from Gibraltar; SL convoys from Freetown now making a rendezvous with MKS convoys from North African ports for the final leg of the journey to Britain.

40|$|Abstract: Manufacturing cost is {{the major}} factor that affects the profit of any {{industry}} or any product. Manufacturing Cost involves material, labor, equipment & tooling, quality, maintenance etc. Sheet metal forming {{is one of the}} major manufacturing processes and used for most of the products. The Die is the tooling used in the sheet metal forming. The proper design of die is important in sheet metal forming processes. This article discusses how the Combination Die can reduce the manufacturing cost, particularly the labor cost and material handling cost. For this study, a product “U Clamp ” is considered. The Product requires piercing, bending and <b>parting</b> <b>off</b> operations. The Combination Die is designed and fabricated for the product and tested. Data on operation time, material handling time, die fabrication cost are collected, analyzed and discussed...|$|R
50|$|For a given {{machining}} operation, {{the cutting}} speed will remain constant for most situations; therefore the spindle speed will also remain constant. However, facing, forming, <b>parting</b> <b>off,</b> and recess operations on a lathe or screw machine involve the machining of a constantly changing diameter. Ideally this means changing the spindle speed as the cut advances {{across the face}} of the workpiece, producing constant surface speed (CSS). Mechanical arrangements to effect CSS have existed for centuries, but they were never applied commonly to machine tool control. In the pre-CNC era, the ideal of CSS was ignored for most work. For unusual work that demanded it, special pains were taken to achieve it. The introduction of CNC-controlled lathes has provided a practical, everyday solution via automated CSS. By means of the machine's software and variable speed electric motors, the lathe can increase the RPM of the spindle as the cutter gets closer {{to the center of the}} part.|$|R

Sucre and Maricruz were also implicated as a result, though without Lincoln's knowing. Later on, Susan used Sofia as a hostage. That night, Lincoln steals a bus to knock out the power lines to Sona Prison, which then starts off the escape of Michael and the other inmates inside Sona Prison. The escape is eventually successful, with Lincoln joining the inmates and McGrady <b>parting</b> <b>off</b> with his dad in separate ways. Whistler later tried to escape, but Lincoln managed {{to get hold of}} him, forcing Gretchen to carry out the hostage exchange successfully at a museum. Later on, Gretchen's men open fire on police, so that Gretchen and Whistler could escape unharmed but the firing caused Sofia to be shot.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{tool life}} extension methods applied to cut-off tools made of high-speed steel. Despite the wide application of cutting tools made of sintered carbides, which {{is becoming the}} main cutting material, including the coated tools, there still remain the applications of high-speed steel cutting tools for low cutting speed machining (i. e. screw taps, reamers, broaching <b>tools,</b> cutting <b>off</b> <b>tools).</b> Therefore the improving of their cutting ability {{is important to be}} researched. The paper involves the application of selected modification methods for the increasing of the tool life in operating conditions, i. e. in manufacturing of ball bearing rings from the bar raw product. Moreover, the paper introduces and evaluates the results obtained by individual methods (tool mechanical and physical modifications) finding the reasons of longer tool-lives for example by analysing the metallographic microsections of chip formation process...|$|R

40|$|Mind-boggling {{complexity}} of EDA tools necessitates reuse {{of intellectual property}} in any large-scale commercial or academic operation. However, {{due to the nature}} of software, a tool component remains an ill-defined concept, in contrast to a hardware component (core) with its formally specified functions and interfaces. Furthermore, EDA tasks often evolve rapidly to fit new manufacturing contexts or new design approaches created by circuit designers; this leads to moving targets for CAD software developers. Yet, it is uneconomical to write <b>off</b> <b>tool</b> reuse as simply an endemic “software problem”. Our main message is that CAD tools should be planned and designed in terms of reusable components and glue code. This implies that industrial and academic research should focus on (1) formulating practical tool components in terms of common interfaces, (2) implementing such components, and (3) performing detailed evaluations of such components. While this is reminiscent of hardware reuse, most existing EDA tools are designed as stand-alone programs and interface through files. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} laser to trim the outer surface from tree-ring increment cores in preparation for dendrochemistry of certain metals. A source of contamination specific to dendrochemistry of metals is metal constituents, such as iron, tungsten, chromium, nickel, and cobalt, coming <b>off</b> <b>tools</b> used to collect and process cores and adhering to the sample surface. One method to eliminate this contamination is to trim off the outer surface of cores using laser. To test this application of laser, three tree-ring increment cores were collected from each of three trees. For each tree, one core was trimmed using a CO 2 laser, one core was trimmed using a stainless steel razor blade, and one core was left untrimmed. The resultant cores were measured for metals using acid dissolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Trimmed cores had on average one-third the content of iron, tungsten, and chromium than that of untrimmed cores. Laser-trimmed cores had less of these metals than razor-trimmed cores. Razor-trimmed cores also had measurable nickel, but laser-trimmed cores had no nickel. Laser trimming is an ideal solution to potential contamination of cores with metals from increment borers without imparting other contamination from tools such as razor blades...|$|R
