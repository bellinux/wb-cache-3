40|$|Anti-endothelial-cell {{antibodies}} {{are associated}} with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>manifestations</b> in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our primary aim {{in this study was}} to seek and characterize molecules that behave as endothelial autoantigens in SLE patients with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>manifestations.</b> By screening a cDNA library from human umbilical artery endothelial cells with serum from an SLE patient with psychosis, we identified one positive strongly reactive clone encoding the C-terminal region (C-ter) of Nedd 5, an intracytoplasmatic protein of the septin family. To evaluate anti-Nedd 5 serum immunoreactivity, we analyzed by ELISA specific IgG responses in 17 patients with SLE and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>manifestations</b> (group A), 34 patients with SLE without <b>psychiatric</b> <b>manifestations</b> (group B), 20 patients with systemic sclerosis, 20 patients with infectious mononucleosis, and 35 healthy subjects. IgG specific to Nedd 5 C-ter was present in 14 (27 %) of the 51 SLE patients. The mean optical density value for IgG immunoreactivity to Nedd 5 C-ter was significantly higher in patients of group A than in those of group B, those with infectious mononucleosis, or healthy subjects (0. 17 +/- 0. 14 vs, respectively, 0. 11 +/- 0. 07, P = 0. 04; 0. 11 +/- 0. 06, P = 0. 034; and 0. 09 +/- 0. 045, P = 0. 003, on Student's t-test). Moreover, IgG immunoreactivity to Nedd 5 C-ter was significantly higher in patients with systemic sclerosis than in patients of group B or healthy subjects (0. 18 +/- 0. 18 vs, respectively, 0. 11 +/- 0. 07, P = 0. 046; and 0. 09 +/- 0. 045, P = 0. 003). The percentage of patients with anti-Nedd 5 C-ter serum IgG was higher in group A than in group B (8 (47 %) of 17, vs 6 (17 %) of 34, P = 0. 045, on Fisher's exact test). In order to clarify a possible mechanism by which Nedd 5 might be autoantigenic, we observed that Nedd 5 relocated from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of EAhy 926 endothelial cells after apoptotic stimuli.

The {{aim is to}} show how the category of ‘DSPD ’ manifests aspects of Beck’s analysis of the ‘risk society ’ and poststructural ‘governmentality’ approaches to understanding the notion of risk. Concepts such as ‘dangerousness’, ‘violence ’ and ‘risk ’ are critically reviewed in relation to ‘DSPD ’ and are found to be less than objective. The paper interrogates the political underpinnings of this newly proposed diagnosis and analyses pre-existing frameworks of potential utility for developing further understanding of dangerousness and violent behaviour. Key issues are critically discussed in relation to the concept of ‘dangerousness’ including the reliability of assessment tools, the socioeconomic status of those potentially diagnosed with DSPD and detention without committing any prior offence. The paper also discusses the potential for conflict between the proposed legislation, the UK Human Rights Act 1998, healthcare practice and the likelihood of divided professional loyalties.

It is also important that substance misusing take place in psychiatric patients. This study was performed to evaluate substance abuse ratio of inpatients and its relation with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>manifestation.</b> Method: This was a retrospective study evaluating files of all inpatients treated between January 2007 and February 2009 in Sağlık Bakanlığı Erenköy Mental Health Research and Training Hospital in the psychiatric wards. Results: A total of 5524 inpatients were evaluated. It was detected that 203 patients (3. 7 %) had abused a substance in their life period. Among the SA group, 22. 2 % were diagnosed as having abuse, 15. 8 % as dependency, and 18. 7 % had no diagnosis although they were using substance. According to patients in the remaining group, 13. 3 % of them used rarely and were not active, and 30 % of them believed they were in remission. When the SA ratio of all inpatients according to their psychiatric disorders was investigated, it was found that 5. 9 % were brief psychotic disorder, 3. 9 % psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, 3. 5 % bipolar disorder, 3. 2 % schizophrenia, 2. 6 % schizoaffective disorder, 1. 5 % depressive disorder, and 1. 2 % anxiety disorder. The most commonly used substance was cannabis. Conclusions: It was found that the ratio of substance abuse was unexpectedly low among psychiatric inpatients.

40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{caused by a}} tandem repeat expansion encoding an expanded tract of glutamines in the huntingtin protein. HD is progressive and manifests as psychiatric symptoms (including depression), cognitive deficits (culminating in dementia) and motor abnormalities (including chorea). Having reached the 20 th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} the ‘genetic stutter’ which causes HD, we still lack sophisticated insight into why so many HD patients exhibit affective disorders such as depression at very early stages, prior to overt appearance of motor deficits. In this review, we will focus on depression as the major <b>psychiatric</b> <b>manifestation</b> of HD, discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis identified from animal models, and compare depression in HD patients with that of the wider gene-negative population. The discovery of depressive-like behaviours as well as cellular and molecular correlates of depression in transgenic HD mice has added strong support to the hypothesis that the HD mutation adds significantly to the genetic load for depression. A key question is whether HD-associated depression differs from that in the general population. Whilst preclinical studies, clinical data and treatment responses suggest striking similarities, there are also some apparent differences. We discuss various molecular and cellular mechanisms which may contribute to depression in HD, and whether they may generalise to other depressive disorders. The {{autosomal dominant}} nature of HD and the existence of models with excellent construct validity provide a unique opportunity to understand the pathogenesis of depression and associated gene-environment interactions. Thus, understanding the pathogenesis of depression in HD may not only facilitate tailored therapeutic approaches for HD sufferers, but may also translate to the clinical depression which devastates the lives of so many people...|$|E

40|$|Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor) encephalitis, first {{described}} in 2007, is a rare, autoimmune limbic encephalitis. In {{half of the}} cases anti-NMDAR antibodies are paraneoplastic manifestations of an underlying tumor (mostly ovarian teratoma). In the early stage of the disease psychiatric symptoms are prominent, therefore 60 - 70 % of the patients are first treated in a psychiatric department. In most of the cases, typical neurological symptoms appear later. Besides the clinical picture and typical symptoms, verifying presence of IgG antibodies in the serum or CSF is necessary {{to set up the}} diagnosis. Other diagnostic tools, including laboratory tests, MRI, lumbar puncture or EEG are neither specific, nor sensitive enough. Therapy is based on supportive care, plasma exchange and immune suppression, intensive care administration can be necessary. If there is an underlying tumor, tumor removal is the first-line treatment. The disease can cause fatal complications in the acute phase but with adequate therapy long-term prognosis is good, although rehabilitation can last for months. In the past few years besides the typical clinical picture and illness course an increasing number of case reports described no typical neurological symptoms, only psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, disorganized behavior, and catatonic symptoms. Immune suppressive treatment was still effective in most of these cases. Such cases present a difficult diagnostic challenge. These patients may receive unnecessary antipsychotic treatment because of the suspected schizophrenia, although they often suffer from serious extrapyramidal side effects. A few years ago there was a hypothesis that {{a small part of the}} patients who are treated with therapy-resistant schizophrenia may suffer from anti-NMDAR encephalitis, so they require a different kind of medication. Evidence from the latest publications did not confirm this hypothesis, although the connection between anti-NMDAR antibodies and disorders with psychotic symptoms is still not clear.

40|$|Synthetic Cannabinoids are {{a street}} drug that is widely {{attainable}} and cheap compared to natural cannabis, and has variable potency and unpredictable effects with no commercially available diagnostic test to confirm its presence. Similar to natural cannabis, Synthetic Cannabinoid intoxication can present {{in several ways}} with the most common emergency room presentations to be of neurologic and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>manifestation.</b> The respiratory depressive effect of Synthetic Cannabinoids has not been well documented in medical literature. We report four patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory failure necessitating endotracheal intubation after use of Synthetic Cannabinoid. All patients had a reversal of respiratory failure in less than 24  h, three patients had a complicated course due to aspiration pneumonia. All four patients exhibited aggressive behavior, with two of them diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Cocaine Use Disorder. The effect of Synthetic Cannabinoids in peripheral receptors such as chemoreceptors and baroreceptors can increase bronchial airway resistance. It is postulated that CB 1 receptor stimulation {{could be one of}} the possible mechanisms of synthetic cannabinoid-induced respiratory depression. Chemical gases released after its inhalation may also cause damage to the bronchiolar epithelium and has the potential to disrupt the protective surfactant layer in the alveoli, which then could interfere with effective gas exchange leading to hypoxia and acidosis. The stimulation of CB 1 receptors have a series of downstream signaling effects in the G protein-coupled pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, causing suppression of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. The aforementioned molecular changes in the central nervous system after CB 1 receptor stimulation could impact respiration. The use of Synthetic Cannabinoids can cause respiratory depression in individuals without an underlying pulmonary disease and adds to the growing number of literature about the presentation and debilitating adverse events from its consumption. Although there is no specific toxidrome associated with it, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion with its use especially in patients presenting with a history of drug overdose...|$|E

Aims and objectives: The {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of adequate antidepressant dose of escitalopram on thyroid function in patients with depression of euthyroid state over a period of six weeks and the relationship between thyroid function and depression. Material and methods: The study was conducted at Government Medical College Srinagar and associated hospitals from May 2013 to April 2016. The study sample comprised of 191 patients diagnosed with first episode depression. The evaluation of patients was done by using pro-forma to gather information on parameters pertaining to mental health/ illness also physical indices. DSM- 5 diagnostic criteria have been used for diagnosing the patients having depression. Diagnosis was confirmed by the consultant in the department. Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) has been used for assessing the severity of depression. Baseline thyroid function test was performed in these patients and these patients were given approved/adequate dose of escitalopram. Results: The mean age was 35. 3 years and males were 55. 5 %. Only 19. 9 % have family history with psychiatric illness and 11. 5 % have family history of thyroid disorder. HAMD score before treatment was 13. 34 ± 3. 080 (p< 0. 001) and after first follow up 11. 24 ± 2. 742 (p< 0. 001) and after second follow up was 9. 96 ± 2. 33 (p< 0. 001) and TSH before treatment 3. 45 ± 1. 52 (p< 0. 001) and after first follow up 4. 55 ± 1. 69 (p< 0. 001), and after second follow up 4. 53 ± 1. 59 (p= 0. 791).
