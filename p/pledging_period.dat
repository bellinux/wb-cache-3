5000|$|Much like {{a college}} fraternity, {{prospective}} members of Phi Kappa are chosen by the active membership of the local chapter and are extended a bid to pledge the fraternity. The <b>pledging</b> <b>period</b> usually lasts around one academic semester. During this period, pledges learn about the fraternity and become better acquainted with the active members. The importance of academics is stressed and pledges are expected to maintain {{a certain level of}} academic achievement during the pledge period. Hazing (physical, psychological or otherwise) of pledges is strictly forbidden by the fraternity. After completion of the pledge period, the new members are initiated into the fraternity and, at that point, become full and equal members of Phi Kappa.|$|E
5000|$|A pledge pin is {{a common}} custom of United States fraternities and sororities in which a pin is worn by pledges for the {{duration}} of the <b>pledging</b> <b>period,</b> usually during all times not considered dangerous to do so (during sports, etc.). In the context of fraternities and sororities, the Phi Beta Kappa society founded on December 5, 1776 was the first. This organization's earliest emblem of recognition was a silver square medal with the initials S.P. and the date December 5, 1776 engraved on the one side, with the Greek letters ΦΒΚ (Phi Beta Kappa) engraved on the other side. This emblem from the first [...] "American Greek" [...] organization would be the first use of an emblem in identifying a member of the organization.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the pledge retreat is to {{increase}} the retention rate of new members in Beta Sigma Chapter of The Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. Ideally, the retreat should be scheduled early in the <b>pledging</b> <b>period</b> so as to move the new member group through Tuckman's stages of group dynamics. Subsequently, the new member class should naturally form a unified identity. The retreat does this through intentional experiential activities:Icebreakers move the group through the forming stage. Teambulding moves the group through the storming stage. Self assessment and discovery paired with discussion move the group through the norming stage. The pledge class brand activity takes advantage of the class' arrival in the performing stage and utilizes peak performance the next day during goal setting. The retreat includes a participant's manual and a detailed facilitators guide with facilitating skills to help assist future pledge educators in conducting the retreat.

50|$|Pledgeship is {{a period}} for {{potential}} members before they are fully initiated into Sigma Chi. The <b>pledge</b> <b>period</b> differs in length from chapter to chapter but eight weeks is the recommended length by Headquarters. The <b>pledge</b> <b>period</b> consists of intellectual exercises to cultivate potential members into becoming brothers; this includes learning the history of Sigma Chi, the operational workings of Sigma Chi, leadership skills, and allows the potential members to {{become an integral part}} of the chapter before initiation.|$|R

25|$|Membership to Phi Delta Theta {{is open to}} all {{qualified}} men {{without concern}} for race, religion, or ethnicity. Initial membership to the fraternity is contingent upon receiving an invitation to an interested individual by members of an active chapter. A pledge of Phi Delta Theta is called a Phikeia. The typical <b>pledge</b> <b>period</b> lasts a minimum of eight weeks, although occasionally it is shortened or lengthened to fit university requirements or by approval of the General Council. The <b>pledge</b> <b>period</b> is a time where the prospective member learns about the fraternity history, structure, traditions, organization as well as social etiquette. Phi Delta Theta has a strict policy against hazing and does not tolerate chapters who violate the policy. Once initiated, a brother is entitled to all rights and privileges of fraternity membership unless he formally resigns or is expelled.|$|R

50|$|The Seiran Sorority is an {{amalgamation}} of {{a student}} government, an extracurricular club, and an elite society, and is a school tradition that is said to date back to at least the 1930s. Similar to western fraternities and sororities, prospective members seem to be nominated by those already in the Sorority, and undergo a <b>pledge</b> <b>period</b> {{in which they are}} interviewed for fitness. Family legacy, appropriate extracurricular activities, and attractive appearances are the main considerations for admission. The Sorority appears to have around forty or fifty members, though several of the senior members are given prominence and special nicknames.

40|$|Standard {{models of}} policy credibility, {{defined as the}} {{expectation}} that an announced policy will be carried out, emphasize the preferences of the policymaker {{and the role of}} tough policies in signaling toughness and raising credibility. Whether a policy is carried out, however, will also reflect the state of the economy. We present a model in which a policymaker maintains a fixed parity in good times, but devalues if the unemployment rate gets too high. Our main conclusion is that if there is persistence in unemployment, observing a tough policy in a given period may lower rather than raise the credibility of a no-devaluation <b>pledge</b> in subsequent <b>periods.</b> We test this implication on EMS interest rates and find support for our hypothesis.

We do this by examining the fulfilment of Irish parties’ election <b>pledges</b> over a <b>period</b> of more than 30 years, 1977 - 2011. During the time period considered, the Irish electoral and party systems produced eleven governments of four distinct types: majority and minority coalitions as well as majority and minority single-party governments. The eleven governments that held office during this period also varied considerably from each other in duration and the economic conditions they faced. By examining variation in pledge fulfilment across these governments, are able to draw inferences about the effects of different types of government and economic conditions on pledge fulfilment...|$|R

New Zealand's target is to limit net {{greenhouse gas emissions}} for the five-year 2008-2012 commitment period to five times the 1990 gross volume of GHG emissions. New Zealand may meet this target by either reducing emissions or by obtaining carbon credits from the international market or from domestic carbon sinks. The credits may be any of the Kyoto units; Assigned amount units (AAU), removal units (RMU), Emission Reduction Units (ERU) and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In April 2012, the projection of New Zealand's net Kyoto position was a surplus of 23.1 million emissions units valued at NZ$189 million, based on an international carbon price of 5.03 Euro per tonne.

40|$|Governments {{around the}} world have {{committed}} to urgent reductions in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in order to limit the increase in global average temperature to less than 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels, a warming level recognized as a key threshold for dangerous climate change. In the lead-up to a key United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Paris in late 2015, countries have begun to announce GHG emission reduction <b>pledges</b> for the <b>period</b> beyond 2020. In this paper, we investigate feasibility of 2 °C as a post- 2020 warming threshold via the solution of an input-constrained optimal control problem in which the control inputs to be optimized are the emissions reduction rate, and the fraction of net economic output invested in capital. Using the DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) integrated assessment model (IAM), we show that rapid emissions reductions are necessary to reach global net zero emissions by mid-century and so restrict warming to 2 °C. Attempts to limit warming to 2 °C by constraining either the absolute rate, or rate of growth, in emissions reductions effort in a global post- 2020 mitigation scheme are achievable only with appreciable loss of economic output, with total emissions falling sharply as a consequence. The results of this paper underscore the importance of recognizing the interdependence of geophysical and economic dynamics in attempting to stay below the 2 °C warming threshold...|$|R
