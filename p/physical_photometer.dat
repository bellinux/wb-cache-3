40|$|This Technical Report {{summarizes}} visual photometric {{measurement methods}} which can provide visually meaningful assessments of light. They {{can be more}} complicated than the simple use of of a V(?) -corrected <b>physical</b> <b>photometer,</b> and in addition require some understanding of the visual system and how it works. Their advantage is that the assessment of light bears a logical relationship to the human perception of light. For photopic vision and luminances larger than several cd/m 2, ordinary physical photometers corrected to V(?) give visually accurate measures for small, centrally fixed, broad-band lights. For other applications, a different luminous efficiency function should be employed. In order to utilize the appropriate function, one must either measure the spectral distribution of radiant power directly or correct the V(?) response of the photometer to the appropriate luminous efficiency. An alternative solution is to calculate mathematical formulas specifically developed for this purpose. This method is potentially the most useful since different formulas can be developed for different applications (for example, two degree or ten degree fields). It is based on established CIE data, and no additional measures need to be developed. For scotopic vision, an assessment of radiant power is made {{with respect to the}} scotopic luminous efficiency function V'(?) by means of an appropriately corrected <b>physical</b> <b>photometer,</b> by radiance measurement, or by visual photometry. In mesopic photometry, the photopic and scotopic contributions of the light must be assessed. An estimate can be obtained by combining the photopic and scotopic luminances non-linearly. A more precise measure can be obtained by using three or, still better, four quantities based on X 10, Y 10, Z 10, and V'(?) ...|$|E
40|$|A new auroral {{photometer}} for {{low light}} level measurements has been designed by making use of the latest development of the technology. As a result, PC controlled scanning multichannel auroral photometer has been built at the University of Oulu, Department of <b>Physical</b> Sciences. The <b>photometer</b> consists of several photometer tubes with narrow bandpass interference filters and separate power supplies {{as well as the}} scanning module. The measured data is transferred to counter card inside the measurement PC. PC controls the measurement via I/O (in/out lines) according to prewritten file, which consists of header and measurement parameters including the starting and stopping times. Timing is based on data received with GPS receiver and the PC time is corrected accordingly. Three of these second generation photometers have been installed to measure auroral emissions in Northern Scandinavia and Antarctica. According to the measurements the quality and continuity of the data is most acceptable for scientific research of auroras...|$|R
