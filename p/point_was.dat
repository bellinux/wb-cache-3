5|$|After a two-game winning streak, the Pros {{played the}} Gary Elks, a non-APFA team, at Gleason Field, with 2,000 people in attendance. The Elks game {{into the game}} with an undefeated 5–0–1 record. The Pros were {{the first team to}} score when Gilo had a 20-yard rushing {{touchdown}} in the first quarter; the extra <b>point</b> <b>was</b> missed, however. The score would stay 6–0 until Smeltzer of the Elks caught a pass from Leverette in the fourth quarter. The extra <b>point</b> <b>was</b> made, and the final score of the game was a 7–6 loss for the Pros.|$|E

Kipke also missed a drop kick for field goal in the second quarter. Still in the second quarter, Steger scored his third touchdown on a pass from quarterback Irwin Uteritz. Kipke's drop kick for extra <b>point</b> <b>was</b> good, and Michigan led, 19–0, at halftime.|$|E

5|$|Arnold, {{convinced}} that Crown <b>Point</b> <b>was</b> no longer viable {{as a point}} of defense against the large British force, destroyed and abandoned the fort, moving the forces stationed there to Ticonderoga. General Carleton, rather than shipping his prisoners back to Quebec, returned them to Ticonderoga under a flag of truce. On their arrival, the released men were so effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops.|$|E
5|$|Bo also {{oversaw the}} {{restructuring}} of the Ministry, formed from the amalgamation of the National Economics and Commerce Bureau and the Department of International Trade. Bo sought to balance {{the amount of attention}} given to foreign investors and domestic commercial institutions. He began tackling the imbalance from the retail sector, whose success up to that <b>point</b> <b>was</b> largely dependent on foreign companies. He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.|$|E

2500|$|A turning <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a <b>point</b> {{at which}} the {{derivative}} changes sign. A turning <b>point</b> may <b>be</b> either a relative maximum or a relative minimum (also known as local minimum and maximum). If the function is differentiable, then a turning <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a stationary point; however not all stationary <b>points</b> <b>are</b> turning <b>points.</b> If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary <b>points</b> that <b>are</b> not turning <b>points</b> <b>are</b> horizontal inflection <b>points.</b> For example, the function [...] has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection <b>point,</b> but <b>is</b> not a turning point.|$|R
5|$|Defence of Tigné <b>Point</b> <b>was</b> further {{enhanced}} {{with the construction}} of Cambridge Battery between 1878 and 1886. Garden Battery was then built between 1889 and 1894, covering the area between Cambridge Battery and Fort Tigné. Barrack blocks were constructed {{on the rest of the}} peninsula in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Effusive eruptions on {{the main}} island {{returned}} on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24cumi), and the island's highest <b>point</b> <b>was</b> 174metres (570ft) above sea level at that time.|$|E
5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and some {{accounts}} suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.|$|E

5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting <b>point</b> <b>was</b> calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
