40|$|Erosion {{of trade}} {{preferences}} currently being enjoyed by LDCs and some developing countries remain an important {{area in the}} on-going trade negotiations. The different positions regarding the <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> question besides being informed by political economy considerations are also founded on empirical results of this particular question. But does the methodology used for the empirical analysis matter? In this paper, the importance of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> question due to MFN liberalisation on agriculture is analyzed. Drawing from the potential complementary strengths in triangulation, the paper uses both partial and general equilibrium analyses. The paper shows that the ranking of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> as an issue of policy concern {{is influenced by the}} empirical methodology adopted. However, irrespective of the rank, the paper concludes that <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> is an important issue {{not only in terms of}} welfare, but also as it has impacts on incomes for preference receiving countries.

40|$|The July Package of WTO {{agricultural}} {{trade negotiations}} {{and the recent}} Hong Kong WTO Ministerial declaration call for duty and quota-free access for imports originated from least developed countries, including the African LDCs (ALDCs). This paper discusses the merits of this proposal. The usefulness of preferences has been revealed by the high utilization rate of agricultural trade preferences and the case for improving trade preferences {{is supported by the}} possibility of <b>preference</b> <b>erosions.</b> Based on these, this paper interprets the July Package text as deepening, widening, broadening and strengthening trade preferences. A set of CGE simulations illustrates the potential impact of implementing this proposal. The first scenario confirms the ALDCs' vulnerability in multilateral liberalization. Deepening and widening trade preferences (scenario 2) would more than offset these negative effects. At the same time, harmonizing the preferences programs would help reveal true comparative advantages of the ALDCs. Adding selected advanced developing countries to the preference-granting group (i. e., broadening preferences) would further expand exports from the ALDCs. It {{should be noted that the}} added benefits from broadening preferences would be smaller than what could be achieved from the deepening and widening scenario. However, these estimated benefits would not be fully realized without strengthening the legal foundation of the preference programs and the ALDCs need to conduct domestic policies reforms aiming at creating an enabling environment for their exportoriented industry to take advantage of this opportunity.

However, colleges desiring to survive in a rapidly changing external environment often discover they must first {{find a way to make}} fundamental changes in their institutional culture. Some of the external forces driving change include increased competition from nontraditional and traditional providers, new technologies, changing student <b>preferences,</b> the <b>erosion</b> of cost and convenience as a competitive advantage, tightening resources, and an emerging focus that places learning at the heart of the academic enterprise. A review of the literature suggests that this topic is a primary concern of many colleges. Yet, few colleges have gotten beyond the design stage and realized the successful implementation of the improvements that were desired. This study spanned 4 years and used qualitative methods to conduct an in-depth study of how one community college responded to external forces by attempting to transform from a bureaucratic organization to a high-performance work system. The study describes the reasons for the change, the approach used, and the results realized. Conclusions suggest that indeed certain factors and strategies are essential to create the capacity for change within an organization; however, unless these strategies include the support and commitment of executive leadership and significant attention to the human side of change, they will not lead to sustainable change. This study provides information on how one community college approached organizational transformation by addressing internal structural, cultural, and political impediments. A description of one community college's attempt to develop and implement transformational change can help educators describe, explain, understand, and perhaps even predict behavior within other institutions {{of higher education}}.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the new {{findings from the}} on-going work of the OECD project on trade <b>preference</b> <b>erosion.</b> Following {{a review of the}} recent literature, the paper develops two main types of analysis. First, a detailed statistical analysis is undertaken drawing on the trade preferences database developed by the Secretariat and covering the Quad countries and Australia. This includes a presentation of the structure of tariff regimes in these key developed countries and identification of countries and sectors that are most reliant on tariff preferences. The second analytical approach uses the standard model and database of the Global Trade Analysis Project to simulate trade liberalisation scenarios that would entail <b>preference</b> <b>erosion.</b> While highlighting a number of cases of preference reliance, the paper underscores the advantages of multilateral liberalisation. Globally and for a majority of developing regions, liberalisation by preference-granting countries will result in positive welfare gains, notwithstanding the effects of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion.</b> In a comparatively small number of cases, however, the analysis points to a risk of net welfare losses under the scenarios modelled here. nonreciprocal preferences, <b>preference</b> <b>erosion,</b> CGE simulation, developing countries, multilateral trade negotiations, tariff reductions...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of graphene through the thermal decomposition of silicon carbide is explored. Four broad categories of experiments {{are carried out}} based on the polar face being decomposed, Si- or C-face, and the decomposition pressure, vacuum or near atmospheric. The graphene film {{is characterized by a}} plethora of analysis techniques including atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Hall mobility measurements, and others. Each one of the four experiment categories provides unique results which are discussed in-depth. The analysis allows for gaining a better understanding of graphene formation mechanisms on silicon carbide. ^ For the Si-face, the study of thermal decomposition in vacuum focused on understanding how a pristine SiC surface progressed toward becoming fully graphitized. Different growth features were found and characterized on the surface, a crystallographic <b>preference</b> for <b>erosion</b> was discovered, and the kinetics of graphene formation were calculated. The activation energy was found to be 90 kcal mol− 1 and the reaction rate was calculated to be − 0. 044 ± 0. 004 min− 1. Thermal decomposition at near atmospheric pressure was found to produce a discontinuous graphitic film with a lower Hall mobility than the decomposition under vacuum conditions. Under a growth pressure of 10 mbar, the average Hall mobility was 1500 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1, but increased to 1900 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 when decomposed in vacuum. ^ For the C-face, thermal decomposition in vacuum rapidly produced a graphitic film that varied linearly in thickness with temperature, 1. 7 nm at 1475 °C and 5. 7 nm at 1600 °C. Given the fast formation of graphene in vacuum, the chamber pressure was increased to slow the formation. A thermodynamic and kinetic study was undertaken to understand the effect of pressure and temperature on graphene formation. This study revealed differences in rate limiting kinetic steps of graphene formation as the decomposition environment changed. Furthermore, the increase of chamber pressure was found to correlate with an increase in Hall mobility values. Vacuum decomposition produced Hall bars with an average Hall mobility of 3900 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1, while decomposition at 50 mbar gave rise to an average Hall mobility of 17500 cm 2 V− 1 s − 1. Various analytical techniques were used to probe Hall bars in an attempt to understand the reasons behind this correlation. ...|$|R

The discarded oil was purified with a brine solution and bleached with H 2 O 2. Purified bleached discarded palm oil (P. B. D. P. O.) was mixed with two materials commonly used in toilet soap manufacturing, i. e., inedible tallow (I. T.) and palm kernel oil (P. K. O.) at different ratios for the preparation of toilet soap. The data revealed that using P. B. D. P. O. up to 30 % as a substitute for I. T. produced fine toilet soaps from the view point of; hard consistency, soft surface, good hand lather <b>preference</b> and medium <b>erosion</b> from hand washing. The soap samples containing more than 30 % P. B. D. P. O. as a substitute for I. T. gave bad quality. After the storage of soap samples for 6 months at room temperature, significant improvements in the physical properties of the soap samples at different ratios were found. It could be recommended that discarded palm oil from chip frying factories can be used after purification and bleaching in place of inedible tallow up to 30 % to produce a fine toilet soap.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the risk of}} <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> for non-reciprocal preference recipients in the agricultural sector {{as a consequence of}} MFN tariff cuts. It is based on a simulation of a single tariff-cutting scenario. The measure of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> risk is the difference in preference margins enjoyed by individual suppliers to the QUAD (Canada, EU, Japan, United States) markets before and after a MFN tariff reduction, multiplied by the associated trade flow. The paper does not attempt to determine how losses in preference margins translate into trade outcomes, but it does highlight which products and which non-reciprocal preference beneficiaries are the most vulnerable to erosion effects in the major developed country markets. Overall, the paper finds that the risk of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> is small, but some countries are strongly affected in particular product lines (notably sugar and bananas) ...|$|E

The modelling exercise is carried out with the partial equilibrium multi-commodity multi-region world trade model AGRISIM.

Supposing that level of preferences granted to the MPCs by the EU remains as of 2001 then the effects are particularly distinguishable for high protected markets like beef in Turkey, milk and rice in Morocco and olive oil in all MPCs. Supposing that the free trade area with the EU is accomplished, then the impacts are evident mainly on beef, milk and sugar markets, where the prices among the preferential partners are {{much higher than the}} world market ones. The farmers are faced with lower supply and prices, which in turn reduce their income and their surplus, but to the benefit of the consumers and of the tax payers resulting to an increase of the overall welfare. <b>Preference</b> <b>erosion</b> effects on typical Mediterranean commodities such as olive oil, oranges and tomatoes are smoother when the free trade area is in force. <b>preference</b> <b>erosion,</b> Mediterranean Partner Countries, AGRISIM, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

He recognised their concern over the process of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> on the EU market, saying that 'we clearly have to address this concern, or the development round simply will not succeed'.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} additional {{findings from}} the on-going work of the OECD project on trade <b>preference</b> <b>erosion.</b> The purpose was to assess in more detail the situation of those preference-reliant countries seen as being most at risk of experiencing negative welfare effects from <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> {{as a consequence of}} multilateral tariff liberalisation (building on Lippoldt and Kowalski, 2005). Based on a selection criterion, 7 developing countries were chosen for inclusion in the present study: Bangladesh, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Using the standard GTAP database and model, the paper considers a scenario of multilateral tariff liberalisation involving a 50 % linear reduction in the ad-valorem equivalent measure of protection. Whereas most developing regions experienced welfare gains as a consequence of such a scenario, the selected countries were found to be at risk of modest welfare losses, most of which were associated with tariff liberalisation by European Union countries (EU- 15). Where negative welfare impacts occurred in the selected developing countries, they tended to be driven primarily by terms of trade losses (especially by negative export price effects). In line with the modest size of the estimated welfare losses, the overall impact in terms of structural adjustment [...] as measured by an index of structural change [...] tended to be relatively modest. For three of the seven developing countries, welfare losses primarily associated with the EU- 15 tariff liberalisation are estimated to be more than fully offset by greater gains arising from improved market access in other sectors and markets. nonreciprocal preferences, <b>preference</b> <b>erosion,</b> CGE simulation, statistical review, developing countries, multilateral trade negotiations, tariff reductions...|$|E

As with other aid initiatives, coordination and cohesion among assistance programs is critical for success. Delivery mechanisms such as the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), the Trade Facilitation Facility (TFF), and the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), are aimed at facilitating such coordination, but more could be done.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} trade preferences for apparel {{and the evolution of}} apparel trade from developing country beneficiaries to conclude that preferences have been an important factor in stimulating diversification into manufactures for certain developing countries. For example, AGOA has led to substantial increases in imports from a number of Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Nevertheless, for most African countries the value of EU, US and Japanese preferences are very low or negligible. However, the scope for preferences to facilitate diversification into the apparel sector is limited by the lack of consistency across the different preference schemes. Typically, an apparel product from Africa that can enter under one country’s preference scheme will not be able enter under another due to differences in the rules of origin.

40|$|In recent debates, trade <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> {{has been}} viewed by some as {{damaging}} to developing countries, and by others as insignificant, except in a few cases. But little data have been available to back either view. The objective {{of this paper is}} to improve our measures of the size, utilization, and value of all U.

Highly disaggregated data are used to quantify the margins, coverage, utilization, and value of agricultural and nonagricultural tariff preferences for all beneficiary countries in the U. S. regional programs and in the Generalized System of Preferences. Results show that U. S. regional tariff preference programs are generally characterized by high coverage of beneficiary countries'exports, high utilization by beneficiary countries, and low tariff preference margins (except on apparel). For 29 countries, the value of U. S. tariff preferences was 5 percent or more of 2003 dutiable exports to the United States, even after incorporating actual utilization. Most of this value is attributable to nonagricultural tariff preferences, and to apparel preferences in particular.

The simulation results indicate that the overall balance of payments implications of the Uruguay Round for these countries, while negative, may not be very significant. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much debate over the value of {{preferential}} trade programs offered by industrial countries, granting duty-free or reduced-duty access for many exports from developing countries. 1 Some leaders from developing countries and nongovernmental organizations have argued that <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> would have serious development consequences and requires compensation (e. g., Oxfam 2005). Other leaders have argued that vulnerability to <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> is lim-ited to only a few countries and products, and thus requires more targeted assist-ance (WTO 2004). A country that is granted trade preferences would presumably see demand for its exports grow, relative to demand for exports from countries still facing most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs. If the country receiving preferences is small, its exports {{would continue to be}} sold in the importing country at the prevailing tariff- inclusive price, with the exporter earning the difference. Thus, the benefits of such preferences for the exporting country would be increased exports and a transfer of rent from the importing country. But how important are these trade preferences to developing countries? Are the tariff margins large? Do countries fully utilize their preferential access? Is all rent actually earned by the exporting The authors are grateful to Maya Shivakumar and Nick Grossman for their superb work assembling and analyzing data.

40|$|<b>Preference</b> <b>erosion</b> {{has become}} an {{obstacle}} to multilateral trade liberalization, as beneficiaries of trade preferences {{have an incentive to}} resist reductions in mostfavored- nation (MFN) tariffs. This study identifies middle-income developing countries that are vulnerable to export revenue loss from <b>preference</b> <b>erosion.</b> It concludes that the problem is heavily concentrated in a sub-set of preference beneficiaries-primarily small island economies dependent on sugar, banana, and-to a lesser extent-textile exports. Accordingly, measures to help mitigate the impact of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> can be closely targeted at the countries at risk.

40|$|The ongoing {{negotiations}} on non-agricultural market access (NAMA) in the WTO {{are expected to}} lead to substantive reductions in the tariff rates on industrial goods in both the developed and the developing countries. Although an agreement on the formula and coefficient(s) {{is yet to be}} reached, it is becoming increasingly clear that countries are moving towards a differentiated swiss-type formula with deeper cuts for higher tariffs. The July (2004) Framework Agreement stipulated that LDCs will not be required to undertake any tariff reduction commitments under the NAMA. However, LDCs are likely to suffer substantive tariff <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> as a consequence of NAMA negotiations since any tariff reduction by the developed countries will result in a fall in the preferential margins currently enjoyed by the LDCs under the various GSP schemes operated by the developed countries. Consequently, the competitive edge currently enjoyed by the LDCs by taking advantage of the preferential treatment under the various GSP schemes is set to suffer erosion. This is a major concern for Bangladesh and other LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper attempts to make an estimate about the range of preferential erosion for Bangladesh given her current trade pattern and preferential treatment enjoyed by her exports. The paper finds that for Bangladesh, the preferential erosion could be substantial (e. g. $ 42. 1 million worth of net <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> in the EU alone for RMG products under one of the possible scenarios). Reduced preference margin will also undermine future competitiveness in the developed country markets. It is also to be noted that tariff reductions under NAMA will have positive implications for Bangladesh in the US market where most of Bangladesh’s industrial goods do not enjoy GSP treatment. Thus, tariff reduction under NAMA is expected to have diverse implications for Bangladesh’s export of industrial goods. NAMA, thus, may increase Bangladesh’s competitive edge vis-à-vis Caribbean and Sub-Sahara African countries which are currently enjoying zero-tariff access for apparels under the AGOA and the CBI. The paper reviews some of the proposals that are being discussed to address the possible negative consequences of <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> for the LDCs...|$|E
