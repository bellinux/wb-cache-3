40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} selected Smalltalk mechanisms supporting {{software system}} evolution. System modifications considered are the renaming <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class,</b> the removal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class,</b> {{and the change}} of the layout <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class.</b> The mechanisms discussed are in use in Smalltalk implementations {{for a long time}} and have proven to be effective for unanticipated software evolution. This paper gives a retrospective overview in this context. ...|$|R

These are not {{properties of the}} class per se, so a special instance named a prototype instance is used to represent relations common to all members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class.</b> Any other instance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> is assumed to have the relations involving the prototype instance of the class {{as well as the}} relations in the prototype instances <b>of</b> the super-classes. <b>A</b> <b>class</b> can only have one prototype instance.|$|R

40|$|Performing duties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher {{represents}} <b>a</b> {{competence in}} which a teacher faces <b>a</b> great deal <b>of</b> challenges. Researches indicate that in that competence there is a considerable disparity between teachers actual and the desired qualification. We have investigated teacher’s professional development in the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher and which factors influence his/her development. The present master’s thesis comprises of theoretical and empirical parts. Theoretical part is subdivided into two contextually separate sections; {{in the first section}} we have focused our attention to the role and duties of the class teacher whilst in the second part we deal with the phases and features of professional development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher. We have presented the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher and have presented legislative basis for work <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher. Basic duties and the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher are presented. Particular attention has been devoted to the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher in the leadership <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> and collaboration with parents. Definition of teacher’s professional development has been presented along with individual phase models of the professional development. Particular attention has been devoted to the factors that have impact on professional development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher. Empirical investigation has been carried out on <b>a</b> sample group <b>of</b> <b>class</b> teachers. Qualitative and quantitative methodologies have been employed in our empirical research to investigate professional development of class teachers. The objective of the present master thesis was to determine how a teacher in the first five classes of the primary school judge factors of own professional development {{in the role of the}} class teacher, particularly factors that made significant impact on their capacity to work with parents. Results of our quantitative and qualitative researches provide insights into experiences of teachers with development of their competences in the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> teacher as well as into factors that influence professional development of class teachers. Our results are the basis for further improvements and provide support to teachers in the role of class teachers, in particular to the beginners. The present work presents significant contribution in fields of educational sciences, particular in fields of didactics...|$|R
