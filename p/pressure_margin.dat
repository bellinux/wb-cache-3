40|$|This thesis studies an {{innovative}} working hydraulic system design for mobile applications. The {{purpose is to}} improve the energy efficiency and the dynamic characteristics compared to load sensing systems without increasing the complexity or adding additional components. The system analysed in this thesis is referred to as flow control. The fundamental difference compared to load sensing systems is that the pump is controlled based on the operator’s command signals rather than feedback signals from the loads. This control approach enables higher energy efficiency since the pressure difference between pump and load is given by the system resistance rather than a prescribed pump <b>pressure</b> <b>margin.</b> High power savings are possible especially at medium flow rates. Furthermore, load sensing systems suffer from poor dynamic characteristics since the pump is operated in a closed loop control mode. This might result in an oscillatory behaviour. Flow control systems have no stability issues attached to the load pressure feedback since there is none. Pressure compensators are key components in flow control systems. This thesis addresses the flow matching problem which occurs when using conventional compensators in combination with a flow controlled pump. Flow sharing pressure compensators solve this problem since the pump flow will be distributed between all active functions. A novel control approach where the directional valve is controlled without affecting the cylinder velocity with the objective of optimizing the damping is proposed. In this research, both theoretical studies and practical implementations demonstrate the capability of flow control systems. Experiments show a reduced pump <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> and energy saving possibilities in a short loading cycle for a wheel loader application...|$|E

40|$|Managed Pressure Drilling is a {{drilling}} technique that evolves continuously. Complex drilling {{problems such as}} narrow mud-weight windows (narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margins),</b> severe losses and deep water effects can be significantly reduced. The objectives of the MPD technology are to mitigate certain drilling challenges. Although this drilling technique has been proven to be efficient for several fields, proper candidate selection is essential. It {{is important to understand}} what MPD can accomplish as the technique do have associated risks that needs to be fully understood. Improper use of the technology leads to higher operational costs and possibly worsening of drilling issues. Total E&P Norway is planning to drill an ultra HPHT well (Solaris) in 2015 located in the Central Graben area, an area with several drilling challenges such as narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margins,</b> uncertainties, high temperature and high pressure. The Solaris well is a challenging well with many similarities to the Mandarin well drilled by BG. The objective is to securely drill through a narrow mud-weight window to the target depth. The goal of this Master Thesis is to define MPD risks and benefits and summarize all findings for the Solaris exploration well. A literature survey on MPD experience with focus on HPHT wells with narrow mud-weight window similar to the Solaris well will be performed, an MPD system is proposed for the Solaris well and risks and benefits of using an MPD system has been closely examined. Based on current available information, literature review and simulation performed (comparing conventional drilling to MPD) it is likely that MPD is the better solution for the Solaris well. The well faces challenges such as a narrow mud-weight window and wellbore breathing issues, challenges that can be mitigated with MPD technology. As MPD do provide better control of the BHP pressure fluctuations are reduced. Target depth {{is more likely to be}} reached as the narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margins</b> are drilled in a more controlled manner. Conventional drilling is possible for the Solaris well, however as uncertainty is present MPD do provide far better remedies and thereby increases the chance of reaching the target depth. Further evaluation should be done before deciding whether to use MPD or not. Complex and detailed simulations are one solution, trying to reduce the uncertainty level. </p...|$|R

40|$|In some {{industrial}} {{applications such as}} turbine airfoil film cooling, coolant passage configurations must maintain sufficient <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> to prevent hot gas ingestion whilst using holes of large enough diameter to avoid foreign object blockage. This frequently means that some regions of a film-cooled surface are provided with excess air, or that exhausting film jets are over-blown, adversely amplifying local mixing or coolant separation and therefore enhancing heat flux. A cooling system featuring intersecting passages would allow a high <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> to be obtained using discrete, localized loss mechanisms where flows intersect. The degree of loss could be tailored to the local internal and external flow conditions by altering the intersection extent (i. e. the degree of intersecting passage offset), thereby optimizing the use of coolant. Furthermore, localized in-passage convective heat transfer enhancements caused by thin boundary layers and impinging flows {{in the vicinity of}} the intersections would improve total heat flux (Watts per square meter) despite surface area lost to intersection voids. As the heat transfer and loss enhancements do not rely on intricately manufactured flow features, the cooling performance is likely to be robust in {{industrial applications}}, extending component life. An experimental and computational investigation of the flow through two intersecting cylindrical pipes has been carried out at turbine engine-representative conditions to test these hypotheses. While previous workers have characterized loss and heat transfer in co-planar intersecting holes, this first-of-a-kind study parametrically investigates both fully and partiallyintersecting passages, accounting for passage offsets due to typical manufacturing tolerances or purpose-built localized loss enhancements. The loss coefficient across the intersection has been experimentally determined for a range of intersection angles and degrees of intersection in a large scale model running at near atmospheric conditions. The results are used to develop an empirical correlation for the loss coefficient for the isolated intersecting circular channel. A commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, FLUENT©, has been used to model heat transfer locally within selected intersecting geometries, and thus to examine the average heat transfer coefficient compared to that predicted by the well-known Dittus-Boelter correlation and other investigators. Insight gained from the CFD predictions enables a first-order estimate of the impact of adding intersections to the convective cooling performance of these advanced cooling configurations. Results show that even an imperfectly machined (i. e. partial) intersection can provide a significant improvement to heat transfer as well as enhanced loss. copyright © 2007 by ASME...|$|E

40|$|Cement is {{a crucial}} part of well construction. If a good cement bond between the casing and well bore wall cannot be {{achieved}} in the primary cementing, expensive remedial cementing jobs or possible loss of the well bore can occur. When cementing casings and liners in deep waters or pressure depleted reservoirs there is often a small <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> between pore pressure and fracture pressure, this makes cement operations more complex. New cementing techniques and cements are being developed to solve the problems in these areas. Light weight cements have for a long time been used as a means to avoid fracturing the cemented formations. The first light weight cements used water and water absorbing solids to lower the cement slurry density. More modern techniques involve using nitrogen gas, hollow glass spheres or a combination of both to make the cement slurry light enough. These methods have proven useful and clearly have their advantages in certain areas. However, the light weight methods also have their limitations so a new method for getting heavy conventional cement down in narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> areas has been evaluated. The method is based on reducing the hydrostatic head of fluid above the cement column by displacing the mud in the riser by a lighter fluid. A choke valve placed in bypass over a closed BOP will make it possible to control the pressure so that a constant bottom hole pressure is achieved. The Macondo well in Gulf of Mexico {{has been used as a}} case to evaluate the new method. Hydraulic simulations have been done for cementing a full casing string and for cementing a liner as a production casing in this well. Results from the simulations together with a standard liner cementing procedure have been used to make complete cementing procedures for the new method. Results from the simulations show that the new method could be used with success on the Macondo well. Further analyses of the results show large differences in case of what well geometry the method is used in, and limitations on where the method can be used in terms of water depth. The new method is not applicable in shallow waters as the riser volume in these conditions will be too small. As the riser volume is a limiting factor for the method, completing a well with a full casing string will also reduce the chances it can be used. Even though this thesis shows promising results for the new method for cementing in narrow pressure windows, there is still much work to be done in examining the different aspects of the method further, before an eventual field test. </p...|$|E
40|$|The sudden {{hydrocarbon}} influx {{from the}} formation into the wellbore poses a serious {{risk to the}} safety of the well. This sudden influx is termed a kick, which, if not controlled, may lead to a blowout. Therefore, early detection of the kick is crucial to minimize the possibility of a blowout occurrence. There is a high probability of delay in kick detection, apart from other issues when using a kick detection system that is exclusively based on surface monitoring. Down-hole monitoring techniques have a potential to detect a kick at its early stage. Down-hole monitoring could be particularly beneficial when the influx occurs {{as a result of a}} lost circulation scenario. In a lost circulation scenario, when the down-hole pressure becomes lower than the formation pore pressure, the formation fluid may starts to enter the wellbore. The lost volume of the drilling fluid is compensated by the formation fluid flowing into the well bore, making it difficult to identify the kick based on pit (mud tank) volume observations at the surface. This experimental study investigates the occurrence of a kick based on relative changes in the mass flow rate, pressure, density, and the conductivity of the fluid in the down-hole. Moreover, the parameters that are most sensitive to formation fluid are identified and a methodology to detect a kick without false alarms is reported. Pressure transmitter, the Coriolis flow and density meter, and the conductivity sensor are employed to observe the deteriorating well conditions in the down-hole. These observations are used to assess the occurrence of a kick and associated blowout risk. Monitoring of multiple down-hole parameters has a potential to improve the accuracy of interpretation related to kick occurrence, reduces the number of false alarms, and provides a broad picture of down-hole conditions. The down-hole monitoring techniques have a potential to reduce the kick detection period. A down-hole assembly of the laboratory scale drilling rig model and kick injection setup were designed, measuring instruments were acquired, a frame was fabricated, and the experimental set-up was assembled and tested. This set-up has the necessary features to evaluate kick events while implementing down-hole monitoring techniques. Various kick events are simulated on the drilling rig model. During the first set of experiments compressed air (which represents the formation fluid) is injected with constant <b>pressure</b> <b>margin.</b> In the second set of experiments the compressed air is injected with another <b>pressure</b> <b>margin.</b> The experiments are repeated with another pump (flow) rate as well.

40|$|A novel {{experimental}} {{facility for}} {{the testing of}} modern high pressure nozzle guide vanes, the Annular Sector Heat Transfer Facility, is described in this thesis. Non- dimensionally similar conditions to a thermal paint test are reproduced, in a warm flow field, {{by the use of}} actual engine hardware, contoured sidewalls, and an innova- tive system of deswirl vanes in a five-passage annular sector cascade. External Mach and Reynolds numbers, inlet turbulence intensity, and coolant-to-mainstream pres- sure ratio are all matched to engine conditions. The test vanes are heavily cooled both internally (by convection and impingement) and externally (by film cooling). Detailed aerodynamic measurements are discussed, which demonstrate that a peri- odic, transonic, and highly engine-realistic flow is established in the cascade. High resolution full coverage maps of overall cooling effectiveness are presented, acquired on the vane surfaces at steady state conditions by wide-band liquid crys- tals and infrared thermography. Experimental measurements are then scaled to en- gine conditions by a new theoretical procedure, argued from first principles, which extends the principle of superposition to fully-cooled compressible flows. A newly- defined recovery temperature is proposed, which accounts for the redistribution of heat between the internal and external vane flows in a fully-integrated manner. This technique makes the results analogous to those of a thermal paint test, but allows for fundamental research and early and inexpensive cooling system validation. Overall cooling effectiveness measurements are complemented by those of the re- quired cooling flow capacity to achieve them, conducted in a second test rig commis- sioned during this research: the Flow Testing Facility. To conclude, the approach developed is applied to the global thermal assessment of the dendritic geometry, an innovative turbine cooling system.

40|$|New {{drilling}} {{technology is}} primarily developed when limitations of existing technology {{makes it difficult}} or impossible to reach new targets. Drilling in deep waters and in depleted reservoirs is less profitable or too risky using conventional drilling methods. A better and safer alternative is to use specific managed pressure drilling (MPD) systems such as dual gradient systems. Dual gradient systems are designed for deep water operations. Drilling in hostile environments necessitates technologies and operational procedures that are thoroughly thought through. A small margin between the pore and fracture pressures implies increased need for pressure control. In this dissertation, well control of new drilling technologies has been discussed with focus on selected MPD systems. Extensive hydraulic modeling has been necessary to calculate flow and pressure variations for a drilling system using a partly evacuated marine drilling riser, i. e. where the mud level in the riser annulus is not fixed and is free to move up and down. The focus has been to simulate well dynamics when gas is flowing into the wellbore and is being circulated out. Drilling in narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> reservoirs will {{increase the risk of}} losses and gain, and stringent well control is important. Well-control procedures have been discussed and proposed based on simulation results of different well scenarios using the Low Riser Return System (LRRS). Five papers are attached, where four of them present the main results of the research work. The results are related to the dynamic behavior of the mud level in a partly evacuated marine drilling riser. It is shown that the marine drilling riser {{can be used as a}} separator during a gas-kick circulation, and that the mud level in the marine drilling riser annulus can self-regulate as long as it is located a sufficient distance below surface. A new U-tubing model for managed pressure drilling systems like the LRRS has been developed and successfully tested in a small scale facility. It is important to take into account that the inner cross-section area of the drillstring is different from the cross-section area of the annulus. This has not been included in the existing model. The results also show that the LRRS can adjust the wellbore pressure by controlling the pumps used in the circulation system. ECD control during drillpipe connection has been studied for the LRRS, and it is shown that time is an important parameter, especially in small open-hole sections where the pressure margins are small. Simulations show that the total time needed for making a drillpipe connection is typically in the order of 5 - 45 minutes depending on the magnitude of the ECD.

40|$|A new {{suboptimal}} {{guidance law}} design approach for aerospace vehicles is proposed in this thesis, {{followed by an}} advanced control design for supersonic air-breathing engines. The guidance law is designed using the newly developed Generalized Model Predictive Static Programming (G-MPSP), {{which is based on}} the continuous time nonlinear optimal control framework. The key feature of this technique is one-time backward propagation of a small-dimensional weighting matrix dynamics, which is used to update the entire control history. This key feature, as well as the fact that it leads to a static optimization problem, lead to its computational efficiency. It has also been shown that the existing model predictive static programming (MPSP), which is based on the discrete time framework, is a special case of G-MPSP. The G-MPSP technique is further extended to incorporate ‘input inequality constraints’ in a limited sense using the penalty function philosophy. Next, this technique has been developed also further in a ‘flexible final time’ framework to converge rapidly to meet very stringent final conditions with limited number of iterations. Using the G-MPSP technique in a flexible final time and input inequality constrained formulation, a suboptimal guidance law for a solid motor propelled carrier launch vehicle is successfully designed for a hypersonic mission. This guidance law assures very stringent final conditions at the injection point {{at the end of the}} guidance phase for successful beginning of the hypersonic vehicle operation. It also ensures that the angle of attack and structural load bounds are not violated throughout the trajectory. A second-order autopilot has been incorporated in the simulation studies to mimic the effect of the inner-loops on the guidance performance. Simulation studies with perturbations in the thrust-time behaviour, drag coefficient and mass demonstrate that the proposed guidance can meet the stringent requirements of the hypersonic mission. The G-MPSP technique in a fixed final time and input inequality constrained formulation has also been used for optimal guidance of an aerospace vehicle propelled by supersonic air-breathing engine, where the resulting thrust can be manipulated by managing the fuel flow and nozzle area (which is not possible in solid motors). However, operation of supersonic air-breathing engines is quite complex as the thrust produced by the engine is a result of very complex nonlinear combustion dynamics inside the engine. Hence, to generate the desired thrust, accounting for a fairly detailed engine model, a dynamic inversion based nonlinear state feedback control design has been carried out. The objective of this controller is to ensure that the engine dynamically produces the thrust that tracks the commanded value of thrust generated from the guidance loop as closely as possible by regulating the fuel flow rate. Simultaneously, by manipulating throat area of the nozzle, it also manages the shock wave location in the intake for maximum pressure recovery with sufficient margin for robustness. To filter out the sensor and process noises and to estimate the states for making the control design operate based on output feedback, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimation design has also been carried out and the controller has been made to operate based on estimated states. Moreover, independent control designs have also been carried out for the actuators so that their response can be faster. In addition, this control design becomes more challenging to satisfy the imposed practical constraints like fuel-air ratio and peak combustion temperature limits. Simulation results clearly indicate that the proposed design is quite successful in assuring the desired performance of the air-breathing engine throughout the flight trajectory, i. e., both during the climb and cruise phases, while assuring adequate <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> for shock wave management...|$|E

The observer implemented is tested, and shows promising results in estimating both the bottomhole pressure and the friction coefficient in the well during a pipe connection procedure.

Small to mid size investment counsel firms are under <b>pressure</b> of <b>margin</b> compression and must find {{a new way to}} compete against larger firms and low cost alternative investment products. Shepherd Solutions is a Middle Office service that strives to reduce the distractions of managing the operations of an investment counsel firm allowing management to allocate resources towards value added activities...|$|R
40|$|While {{advanced}} {{process control}} and optimization {{has been extensively}} applied to chemicals and downstream refining [1, 2], it is still relatively unexplored and immature in drilling automation and {{in many areas of}} upstream production [3]. The challenge is that exploration and production is progressively moving into more extreme environments with narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margins</b> as productivity declines from existing wells. If not managed properly, these extreme environments can lead to damaged formations and loss of well productivity or worse yet, safety incidents and loss of human life. The goal {{of this paper is to}} introduce an efficient automated control that maintains the pressure within acceptable window while at the same time detects and attenuates the unexpected gas influx (termed as kick) in managed pressure drilling. To achieve this, a novel formulation for pressure control along a drill-string is presented by leveraging a new wired drill pipe telemetry network for high-speed and distributed sensing using a nonlinear model predictive controller and moving horizon estimator. A wired pipe telemetry network offers high speed two way data communication between the surface and downhole sensors [4, 5]. In this technology sensors are positioned at various points along the drill string. Integrating the wired pipe technology into the control and observer structures will make it possible to control the pressure along the drill string as well as the downhole pressure directly and therefore mor...|$|R

This is being driven by increasing competition, consolidation in the industry, increasingly onerous regulations, <b>pressure</b> on <b>margins</b> and increasingly sophisticated customers demanding more advanced products and better service. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish current perceptions of corporate banking services and whether the current client relationship model is appropriate for corporate financial services in South Africa. A Key Account Management model for servicing key clients in South Africa was also developed and tested since existing models were found to be inappropriat...|$|R
40|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{increasing}} petroleum consumption {{on a world}} wide basis {{there is a need}} to find new resources. As mature fields are drained, reservoir pressure falls, which again leads to tight <b>pressure</b> <b>margins.</b> To reduce down time due to hole stability problems (e. g. kicks) there is a demand for accurate control of the pressure profile in the well. As the pressure profile is not known and depends on unknown factors such as friction loss {{there is a need to}} estimate the pressure. In this thesis an observer that adapts to unknown factors, such as friction and density changes, and estimates the bottomhole pressure is presented. Furthermore, a parameter estimator for the bulk modulus in the annulus is developed as an extension to the observer to facilitate for future control design. Both designs are based on a third order model and provide rigid proofs of stability and convergence of the estimated pressure and parameters. The pressure estimate from the observer is shown to converge to the true pressure under reasonable conditions. For parameter estimates to converge to their true values conditions on excitation are presented. The observer and parameter estimator are tested in simulations and also on log data from a well drilled at the Grane field in the North Sea. Simulation results show that the observer performs very well during typical drilling procedures affecting choke valve opening, pump flows and drill string movements. The observer shows promising behavior when tested on log data from the Grane field. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} main determinants {{of the net}} interest margin of banks operating in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in the period from 1999 to 2010. The results reveal several main drivers of net interest margins in the CEE. Prior to 2008 the net interest margins declined primarily due to strong capital inflows and stable macroeconomic environment. In the crisis period, significant rise in government debt accompanied by the increase in macroeconomic risks and abating capital inflows were pushing margins up while other factors such as low credit demand, higher capitalization and significantly increased share of non-performing loans <b>pressured</b> banks’ <b>margins</b> down. The results also confirm the important contribution of higher efficiency to lowering banks’ margins...|$|R
