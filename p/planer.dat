5|$|The West End {{production}} reunited the show's original creative {{team with}} Idina Menzel, who had originated {{the role of}} Elphaba in the Broadway production. Original London cast members included Helen Dallimore as Glinda, Miriam Margolyes as Madame Morrible, Adam Garcia as Fiyero, Martin Ball as Doctor Dillamond, James Gillan as Boq, Katie Rowley Jones as Nessarose and Nigel <b>Planer</b> as the Wizard. After her limited engagement, Menzel was succeeded by Kerry Ellis, who became the first British woman {{to play the role}} of Elphaba and the following year, the second actress to play Elphaba on both Broadway and in the West End productions.|$|E
5|$|The Churchill Machine Tool Co was {{a founder}} member of Associated British Machine Tool Makers Ltd (ABMTM) in 1917, an {{organisation}} {{that might be}} classed as a cartel but which was then perfectly. It was a joint-venture marketing company to develop export markets. Charles Churchill & Co continued to handle domestic sales. A further note of inter-company co-operation was informal Saturday afternoon exchange visits between local machine shops to aid the exchange of ideas and appreciate differences in development and working practice which lasted {{for a few years}} before 1923. Companies involved in this included Churchill, Mather & Platt, Hans Renold, John Hetherington, B & S Massey, British Westinghouse and Browett, Lindley & Co of Patricroft. In January 1919, Charles Churchill & Co bought a one-third share in Cornelius Redman & Sons Co Ltd, <b>planer</b> and lathe-makers at Pioneer Works between Parkinson Lane and Warley Road in Halifax, Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|<b>Planer</b> {{boards are}} trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate fishing line in a spring tension release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a spring tension clip that releases upon setting or tripping the <b>planer</b> board so it slides down the fishing line to a swivel tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|E
