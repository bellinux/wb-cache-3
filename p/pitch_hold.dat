Because ultimately, you win because you score more runs, and what I want is to be 90-feet smarter and 90-feet more aggressive than the other team." [...] Always {{a student of the}} game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986. In an interview that year, Boros said: [...] "The science against stealing has evolved radically in {{the last four or five}} years. That has made it tougher than ever to steal. Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick <b>pitch,</b> <b>hold</b> the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often. Now you've got pitching coaches with stopwatches timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal control framework {{to determine a}} collection of open-loop command signals that mathematically guarantees operation of an aircraft within certain prescribed state constraints. The framework is specifically applied to estimate margins for the reference command inputs of aircraft autopilot systems, so that safe operation within a given flight envelope can be assured under appropriate control action. Flight envelope excursions are generally considered as precursors to Loss-Of-Control incidents, and hence, these margins contain safety critical information that can help improve the situational awareness on-board the aircraft. In off-nominal conditions, the computed safety margins provide indications of a degraded aircraft with reduced flying and handling qualities. These indications appear {{in the form of}} increasingly more strict limits on the autopilot reference command input. The entire framework is illustrated on an example problem involving a pitch dynamics model with state constraints on the pitch attitude. Simulations are conducted wherein margins are computed for the reference pitch command of the <b>pitch</b> <b>hold</b> system, while the aircraft enters an off-nominal condition with severely degraded system dynamics and reduced elevator effectiveness.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for an {{efficient}} control of the aircraft landing and attitude through Dynamic Matrix Control. The idea of MPC structures used in aircraft control has been well established {{during the last few}} years, but some aspects require further investigation. With this in mind, the paper proposes structures for aircraft landing and aircraft attitude control by using single DMC controllers for landing and respectively one DMC controller for each of the attitude axis (<b>pitch</b> attitude <b>hold,</b> bank angle hold and heading hold). The model used for analysis of the aircraft landing structure is based on the last phase of landing. Also, the model used to illustrate the attitude control is that of a <b>pitch</b> attitude <b>hold</b> system of a N 250 - 100 aircraft. Simulations are performed for a variety of control and prediction horizons, taking into account the possibility of adding a weighting factor for the control actions. Apart from separate studies on step reference variations, for some use cases, a generic reference trajectory is provided as a control purpose of the system. Results show a better performance of the proposed method in terms of control surface transition and protection of the actuators involved and a better time response in stabilizing the aircraft attitude. Overall, the aspects shown ensure an improved aircraft attitude control and landing stabilization...|$|R

The derivation of the adaptive controllers depends upon a model simplification {{that results in}} two unknown parameters for each mode. The resulting controllers have been successfully implemented on the Kestrel autopilot (which has a low-power micro-controller) and flight tested on three different miniature air vehicles (MAVs). In addition, one of the MAVs was outfitted with a deployable flap that significantly changes the aerodynamic coefficients of the airframe. The adaptive controllers proposed in this paper successfully adapt to mid-air deployment of the flap. I...|$|R
