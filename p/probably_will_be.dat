In the HIV-seropositive group, this has caused HIV to progress rapidly to AIDS. Looking ahead, we expect 7 to 10 million Ethiopians <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> infected by 2010 {{because of the}} high current rate of adult prevalence, widespread poverty, low educational levels, and the government’s limited capacity to respond more actively.|$|E

500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{said that}} the live CD proved that Madonna is a better singer. A {{reviewer}} from The Buffalo News {{was impressed with the}} release, saying that [...] "This is exactly what you'd expect it to be– a live document of Madonna's most recent tour, which means, essentially, a tour through the dance-based pop music of the past 20 years." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website explained that [...] "though parts of I'm Going to Tell You a Secret frustrate, it remains a reasonably entertaining program. It <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> most interesting for Madonna's most serious fans, though. Those in search of the broader titillation of Truth or Dare will leave disappointed." [...] He added that most of the shots in the DVD seemed accurate, time-and-again a softness crept up in the wide angle shots. Jacobson found the performance s shots to be compelling and gave the sound of the DVD a rating of B+. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 49th ceremony in the category Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|Not {{knowing when}} his next billed episode would be, Nimoy {{said in an}} {{interview}} before [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] aired that he's [...] "waiting to see what these terribly imaginative writers come up with for the future. I’m expecting that I <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> going back to work for them before too much longer. I'm looking forward to what they send me on the page". After shooting the episode, Pinkner said [...] "We want him back as much as he wants to come back". Nimoy's next appearance occurred six episodes later, in [...] "Grey Matters". As a reference to a brief appearance by Nimoy's character William Bell, sound editor Bruce Tanis was instructed to create bells as a recurring motif in the scene when Bell encounters Olivia and gives her vital information about the parallel universe. Tanis explained that because he couldn't put the sound of bells in everything, he [...] "took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and reverbed them to become ringing tones that I played underneath the whole scene". Tanis also used some [...] "reversed" [...] ship's bells as well as crystal glass rubs in order to make Bell's office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds; he referred to the scene as [...] "a little ominous" [...] but not [...] "too cliche".|$|E
