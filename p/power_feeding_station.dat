While {{a number of}} studies have investigated the consequences of surplus food on the population dynamics of scavengers, relatively little is known about the effects of such practices at the individual level. Within the long-term monitored breeding population of Canarian Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) we investigated individual bird’s patterns of use of a supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> at Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), over the course of breeding (2001, 2002; 2004 - 2011) and non-breeding seasons (2000 - 2010). Our results show that during the breeding season the individual use of the supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> was inversely related to the distance to the breeding territory, which suggests the existence of central-place foraging constraints. In addition, larger birds of poor body-condition and individuals that ultimately failed to fledge young were detected more frequently at the <b>feeding</b> <b>station.</b> During the non-breeding season, and because most breeding birds abandoned the breeding territories, the overall abundance of Egyptian vultures at the <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> grew. Moreover, the only variable increasing the probability of presence of individuals was poor body condition so that birds with lower wing residual visited the <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> more frequently.

40|$|<b>Feeding</b> <b>stations</b> are {{commonly}} used to sustain conservation programs of scavengers but their impact on behaviour is still debated. They increase the temporal and spatial predictability of food resources while scavengers have supposedly evolved to search for unpredictable resources. In the Grands Causses (France), a reintroduced population of Griffon vultures Gyps fulvus can find carcasses at three types of sites: 1. "light feeding stations", where farmers can drop carcasses at their farm (spatially predictable), 2. "heavy feeding stations", where carcasses from nearby farms are concentrated (spatially and temporally predictable) and 3. open grasslands, where resources are randomly distributed (unpredictable). The impact of <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> on vulture’s foraging behaviour was investigated using 28 GPS-tracked vultures. The average home range size was maximal in spring (1272 ± 752 km 2) and minimal in winter (473 ± 237 km 2) and was highly variable among individuals. Analyses of home range characteristics and feeding habitat selection via compositional analysis showed that <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> were always preferred compared {{to the rest of}} the habitat where vultures can find unpredictable resources. <b>Feeding</b> <b>stations</b> were particularly used when resources were scarce (summer) or when flight conditions were poor (winter), limiting long-ranging movements. However, when flight conditions were optimal, home ranges also encompassed large areas of grassland where vultures could find unpredictable resources, suggesting that vultures did not lose their natural ability to forage on unpredictable resources, even when <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> were available. However during seasons when food abundance and flight conditions were not limited, vultures seemed to favour light over heavy <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> probably because of the reduced intraspecific competition and a pattern closer to the natural dispersion of resources in the landscape. Light <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> are interesting tools for managing food resources, but don’t prevent vultures to feed at other places with possibly high risk of intoxication (poison) ...|$|R

Here fine-scale foraging strategies of Zebra (Equus quagga) were investigated by studying their selection for vegetation greenness in a Southern African savanna. Zebras have high-energy requirements thus the primary productivity and condition of the habitat plays an important role on their movements. Grass greenness was measured by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation productivity and quality. Finer-scale studies are needed to understand the processes leading to a correlation between NDVI and herbivores performance.

In the less snowy study area, cows using <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> only spent 30 % of the winter within 500 m of <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> and showed little difference in winter weight change or reproductive rate from individuals not using <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> In the same study area, winter habitat selection differed slightly between users and non-users of feeding sites with users selecting less for spruce and deciduous stands. However, commercially important young pine stands were favoured by both groups of moose suggesting that supplementary feeding does not reduce forest damage. Moose using feeding sites concentrated space use around <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> becoming central-place foragers. Data collection is on-going but we expect that the effects of supplementary feeding on habitat selection and ecological fitness will increase with the proportion of time spent at <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> and hence be greater in severe winters and as the duration of the feeding programme increases...|$|R

Surprisingly, little consideration was given so far {{to the effect of}} supplemental feeding on ungulate spatial ecology at a large scale, in management and conservation studies. Analyses of the main ecological drivers influencing the use of supplemental feeding sites by ungulates across a gradient of abiotic and biotic factors are currently lacking. We conducted a large-scale assessment of ecological and management drivers of use of <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> sites in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), a small cervid widely distributed across Europe that is particularly sensitive to winter severity. We tested four competing hypotheses by comparing the time spent at <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> sites by 180 individual Global Positioning System-collared roe deer from nine populations spanning a wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradient. We found that roe deer used <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> sites highly opportunistically in response to winter severity across its range. The harshest weather conditions at the northern range limit or the highest elevations provoked an intense use of <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> sites, which typically peaked at the end of winter, in accordance with the adverse weather and nutritional condition hypotheses. Consistently, milder winters corresponded to a reduced and/or more homogeneous use of supplemental feeding. In general, intensively used <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> sites heavily conditioned spatial behavior of roe deer. Importantly, biotic factors such as the presence of competitors decreased roe deer use of supplemental <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> sites. Our results emphasize the importance of this human-induced alteration to resource distribution, especially {{in the context of the}} rapidly occurring climate change that is modifying resource availability for ungulate populations...|$|R
40|$|Herbivorous {{ungulates}} {{live in a}} spatially heterogeneous environment making foraging decisions at a {{range of}} hierarchical scales, from bite size to landscape. We investigated the factors that control intake rate in Soay sheep (Ovis aries) when discrete items of food were sparsely distributed at the <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> scale. Within the <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> we varied the difficulty of accessing food, distance between items of food, difficulty of finding the food {{and complexity of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> and recorded how intake rate responded in relation to body size, mouth size and the sex of the animal. Our findings demonstrated how increasing difficulty of accessing food, and increasing complexity of the <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> negatively affected intake rate. The expected mechanistic response that smaller animals or animals with smaller mouth size were better at handling discrete small items of food, was overridden by individual and sexual differences in behaviour. We also considered that intake rate within a <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> could be maximised by optimising the spatial pattern of offtake, and the results clearly indicated that both sexes tended to show clustered patterns of offtake. Animals of the same sex responded in a similar way to the difficulty in handling food items; males persevered more than females and consequently were less handicaped by having larger mouths. We discussed these results in relation to behavioural and body mass differences between the sexes and animals...|$|R
