40|$|Abstract — Detecting and resolving {{failures}} in information system (IS) projects is highly desirable process. Being {{able to do}} so depends on the proper identification of underlying reasons for failures; which are often difficult to accurately identify. One of the fundamental enablers of this identification is suitable categorization of the related reasons. This paper will concentrate on developing a categorization technique for IS <b>projects</b> <b>failure</b> reasons, identifying some of these categories, and providing a simple justification for reasons behind this <b>failure.</b> IS <b>projects</b> <b>failure</b> reasons categories are based on the underlying IS elements such as IS components, IS lifecycle, project environment, scope, budget, requirements and its technical and managerial issues.

40|$|Purpose This study {{investigates the}} factors that cause {{government}} construction <b>projects</b> <b>failure</b> in a developing. Methodology The study used sequential data collection approach through an in-depth semi-structured interview (16 participants) and questionnaire survey (230 participants) to solicit their perceptions from project management practitioners, contractors and client (government officials) about {{the factors that}} lead to Ghanaian government construction projects. The Relative Importance Index (RII) {{was used to determine}} the relative importance of the factors identified. This was followed by Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Kendall’s coefficient of concordance to measure the degree of agreement among the participants on their perceptions. Findings Thirty-four (34) factors were identified as the main factors that lead into Ghanaian government construction <b>projects</b> <b>failure.</b> The top ten (10) most important factors that cause Ghanaian government construction <b>projects</b> <b>failure</b> are: political interferences, delays in payment, partisan politics, bureaucracy, corruption, poor supervision, lack of commitment by project leaders, poor planning, starting more projects than the government can fund, and change in government. The failure factors were grouped into four main themes and found that the most important failure factors are leadership. This is followed by management and administrative practices, resources, and external forces respectively. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to only the public sector and therefore finding may not be applicable in the private sector. Practical implications Policy makers and construction project management practitioners would be able to use findings as a guide during the implementation of government projects in order to reduce and/or avoid government construction <b>projects</b> <b>failure.</b> Originality/value Construction <b>projects</b> <b>failure</b> in developing countries is high. Accordingly, extant literature has been devoted to identifying the factors that lead to failure; however, they have mainly been discussed from generic point of view or individual case studies. Researches that focus exclusively on government construction projects in developing countries are rare despite the dynamics in which these projects are implemented. This research extends the construction project management literature by focusing on government construction projects in a developing economy; where there are weak public institutional systems coupled with partisanship politics and bad cultural orientation towards government sector work inherited from colonial rule...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : IS Success and FailureInternational audienceThe {{majority}} of the existing literature {{is based upon the}} assumption that, by paying attention to success factors, failure will be avoided. In the case of challenged <b>projects,</b> where <b>failure</b> factors are overcome the projects go on to be delivered successfully. Hence, it is worthwhile to explore the key factors that determine failure, since this information may be useful in averting future <b>project</b> <b>failures.</b> This research aims to collate and classify existing research in order to: (1) understand the common failure factors; and (2) categorise identified factors pertaining to country, <b>project</b> stage and <b>failure</b> categories. In so doing, this research work goes beyond the identification of traditional factors since it further classifies them according to <b>project</b> stages, <b>failure</b> types and geographical regions.

We developed a set of propositions regarding multiple teams in the OOSDproject context to explain failures.

Furthermore, empirical studies reveal {{that a lot of}} risk factors emerge during the runtime of projects why the ex ante valuation of IT projects even with respect to requirements seems insufficient.
