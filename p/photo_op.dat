5|$|In March, Melina {{was placed}} in an angle where she became jealous of SmackDown! Diva Ashley Massaro, who was {{receiving}} attention because of her appearance in Playboy. The angle had Melina claim in her blogs that no Playboy cover models were capable of fighting her. This resulted in scheduled matches against former Playboy cover girls Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle, with both women losing to Melina. The storyline {{came to an end}} at WrestleMania 23, where Melina pinned Ashley in a Lumberjill match to retain her Women's Championship. After WrestleMania, Melina organized a <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> with the Women's Championship belt in the ring, but was interrupted by Mickie James, resulting in another storyline feud between the two Divas. On April 24, at a house show in Paris, France, Melina lost the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match to James when James pinned Victoria, but on the orders of Jonathan Coachman, she was entitled to a rematch on the same night, where she pinned James by putting her hands on the ropes to regain the title and become a two-time WWE Women's Champion.|$|E
5|$|The scripted feud between James and Melina was rekindled {{during her}} <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> on Raw. At a house show in Paris, France on April 24, James won her third Women's Championship during a triple threat match that also {{involved}} Victoria. Since James pinned Victoria and not Melina, an immediate rematch was scheduled, in which James dropped the title back to Melina, {{giving her the}} shortest Women’s Championship reign in WWE history. James later received a rematch for the title at Backlash, but was unsuccessful. After Backlash, James would only make sporadic appearances on television, wrestling occasionally in tag-matches and rarely in singles competition. On the November 26 episode of Raw, James defeated Melina in a number one contender's match for Beth Phoenix's Women's Championship, setting up a title match between the two at Armageddon, in which Phoenix retained the title.|$|E
25|$|After {{the reading}} of the apology statement, the jury foreman {{personally}} handed the statement to Arbuckle who kept it as a treasured memento {{for the rest of his}} life. Then, one by one, the entire 12-person jury plus the two jury alternates walked up to Arbuckle's defense table where they shook his hand and/or embraced and personally apologized to him. The entire jury even proudly posed in a <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> with Arbuckle for photographers after the verdict and apology.|$|E

25|$|Governor Dukakis {{attempted}} to quell criticism {{that he was}} ignorant on military matters by staging a <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> in which he rode in an M1 Abrams tank outside a General Dynamics plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The move ended up being regarded as a major public relations blunder, with many mocking Dukakis's appearance as he waved to the crowd from the tank. Footage of Dukakis {{was used by the}} Bush campaign as evidence he would not make a good commander-in-chief, and the incident remains a commonly cited example of backfired public relations outings.|$|E

500|$|In March 2009, Clinton {{presented}} Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a [...] "reset button" [...] symbolizing U.S. {{attempts to}} rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev. The <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which {{became known as}} the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012. In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations. In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S. Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the story}} about Widlar {{bringing}} a goat to trim the lawn {{in front of his}} office, retold by The New York Times after his death, was incorrect. It was a sheep, not a goat; Widlar brought her in his Mercedes-Benz convertible for just one day, which included a <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> for the local journalists. According to Pease, Widlar abandoned her in the nearest bar; according to Lojek the sheep was [...] "mysteriously stolen".|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Gowron on screen, O'Reilly {{continued}} to attend Star Trek conventions in character, often appearing on stage alongside J.G. Hertzler as Martok.

For me, it was a dream come true, it was nice to come back to it. And the fans just love it. We tried it once and the fans just went crazy." [...] The pair debuted the in-makeup appearances at a convention in the late 2000s in Germany, and after generating the longest <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> queue at the event, they decided {{to take it to the}} stage. Larry Nemecek praised their convention appearances, saying [...] "They are fan favourites because they are big, gregarious guys. They slap people on the back. They have a good time. They tease people back. They do it for the audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Military College of Canada {{launched}} its Artist-in-Residence program in January 2010 with Steven Heighton, a novelist and poet {{as the first}} to hold the post. The third person to hold the position, playwright Dr. Julie Salverson, presented [...] "Drama, Imagination, and RMC" [...] on 3 April 2012 in Currie Hall. Dr. Salverson, who has conducted drama workshops with cadets since the early 1990s, helped facilitate a play about RMC, [...] "Shakespeare in Scarlets" [...] in 2012. In 2014, the Artist-in-Residence was Gord Sinclair of The Tragically Hip, who put together a concert on the parade square where cadets, staff, and faculty performed for their peers at an event dubbed Bruciepalooza. Both The Trews and guitarist Rob Baker of The Tragically Hip made unexpected guest appearances to perform for the College. Kingston photographer Chris Miner held the position throughout the 2014–15 academic year, culminating in a gallery exhibition of his work along with winning photographs by students, staff, and faculty submitted {{as part of the}} <b>Photo</b> <b>Op</b> 2015 photography contest.

2500|$|George Stephanopoulos asked Obama on {{television}} in early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, {{saying that he was}} passing on a question from Obama's daughters who were sitting in the control room. Obama said, [...] "They seem to have narrowed it down to a labradoodle or a Portuguese water hound ... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going to start looking at shelters to see when one of those dogs might come up." [...] Much was made by the public and press about the family's search for a dog. On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy. The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as [...] "The Meeting". However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at the White House on Tuesday, April 14, 2009. Immediately after he arrived, the family staged a <b>photo</b> <b>op</b> with Bo on the property's South Lawn. At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside the Oval Office, to which he responded: [...] "of course." [...] He also gave a nod to President Harry Truman's quote, [...] "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog." [...] The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.|$|E
50|$|Among nearly ritual <b>photo</b> <b>ops</b> {{are those}} when {{participants}} of a summit {{get out of}} their cars, shake hands or kiss, or sign a document.

50|$|In 1989 Siena {{partnered with}} Conrad Cummings in writing <b>Photo</b> <b>Op,</b> a 60min long {{contemporary}} opera. Siena wrote the words (libretto) and Cummings the music. In 2012, UrbanArias, a local Washington DC-based company {{that specializes in}} small-scale, contemporary, and experimental operas staged a production of <b>Photo</b> <b>Op.</b> UrbanArias’ producer/conductor Robert Wood notes that, although Siena and Cummings wrote <b>Photo</b> <b>Op</b> in 1989, “the immediacy of this opera 20 years later is uncanny.” That’s because it’s so clichéd. Maybe we should blame the politicians more than the librettist; they are, after all, the ones who keep getting caught in their zippers.|$|E
