5|$|APM 08279+5255 {{is a very}} distant, broad {{absorption}} line quasar discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found. It is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light <b>passes.</b> <b>It</b> {{appears to be a}} giant elliptical galaxy with a supermassive black hole around 23 billion times as massive as the Sun and an associated accretion disk that has a diameter of 3600 light years. The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. It has a cosmological redshift of 3.911. While observing the quasar in 2008, astronomers using ESA's XMM Newton and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona discovered the huge galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133.|$|E
60|$|The weighty {{business}} of dressing began, and one courtier after another knelt and paid his court {{and offered to}} the little King his condolences upon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded.

Poor little wondering chap, it reminded him of passing buckets at a fire.|$|R

Sam Costen passed the ball to Honus Craig, Craig <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> to Morton and Morton <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> to Bob Blake, who ran to the side and <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> 25 yards back to Costen. Costen ran the remaining 20 yards for a touchdown.|$|R

5|$|Anders visits Bond, {{revealing}} that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises {{to hand the}} Solex over to him at a Muay Thai venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders dead and meets Scaramanga. Bond observes the Solex {{on the floor and}} is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who <b>passes</b> <b>it</b> to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a homing device on Scaramanga's car, she becomes trapped in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an AMC showroom car to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing Sheriff J.W. Pepper seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's car transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.|$|E
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Rihanna is walking towards a {{dressing}} room mirror while {{preparing for a}} show. This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant. While they talk to each other, Rihanna's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some time, during which Rihanna watches the other tables. One diner writes a note and gives it to a waiter, who <b>passes</b> <b>it</b> to Rihanna, who reads and quickly hides the note as her boyfriend returns to the table. Rihanna starts to sing the song's lyrics while she leaves the dressing room and approaches the stage, where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage. The arena is empty and it appears as though Rihanna is rehearsing.|$|E

5|$|In Week 10, the Colts {{traveled}} to Pittsburgh, {{who had the}} league's highest ranked defense. They trailed 17–7 {{in the second quarter}} before Manning found tight end Dallas Clark for a two-yard touchdown to end the half 17–14.

Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time this season (18th time, career).|$|E
5|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, {{followed by the}} athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: {{the flag of the}} current host country; the flag of Greece, to honour the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. The president of the organising committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished.

2500|$|... 'Pass and move': This is {{the most}} basic team tactic [...] {{as soon as the}} ball has come into {{possession}} of the player, they need to be quick to decide whether to <b>pass</b> <b>it</b> or not.

25|$|Since the {{parabola}} is symmetrical, {{the travel}} {{away from the}} board as the diver <b>passes</b> <b>it</b> is twice {{the amount of the}} forward travel {{at the peak of the}} flight.

The King then has another 30 days to give the royal assent; otherwise, it passes into law. The law does not take effect until it is published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
25|$|Markeli is {{situated}} near the Mochuritsa River (a major {{tributary of the}} Tundzha), on the western tip of the Hisar highland, {{which is part of}} the southeastern Balkan Mountains.

25|$|In endospermic seeds, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and <b>passes</b> <b>it</b> to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.|$|E
25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and <b>passes</b> <b>it</b> hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
25|$|The Oyster card is a {{contactless}} {{smart card}} system introduced for the public in 2003, {{which can be used}} to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other <b>passes.</b> <b>It</b> is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader. Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.|$|E
