Films were annealed post-deposition at temperatures up to 800 °C in order to induce the high-anisotropy L 10 phase. The FePt films initially showed an improvement in magnetic properties with annealing temperature, but for annealing above around 400 °C the magnetic properties deteriorated markedly. The magnetic properties of the FePtN films, however, continued to improve with increasing annealing temperature, right up to the maximum temperature applied of 800 °C. Analysis by X-ray diffraction revealed the formation of iron and <b>platinum</b> <b>silicides</b> in FePt films above 400 °C, but that such silicides are absent from the FePtN at all annealing temperatures except 800 °C. This behavior is attributed to the nitrogen in FePtN films reacting preferentially with the silicon in the substrate to form silicon nitride, thus suppressing the formation of <b>platinum</b> and iron <b>silicides.</b> Thus, by introducing nitrogen during the deposition of FePt films on Si substrates the formation of deleterious silicides appears to be suppressed during thermal treatment, thereby offering protection against silicon pollution.

40|$|International audienceThe {{deposition}} {{of gold and}} platinum nanoparticles (NPs) on hydrogen-terminated Si(100) (Si(100) -H) surfaces has been performed by galvanic displacement using fluoride-free sub-millimolar metallic salt solutions. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed the formation of oblate hemispherical NPs, with an average diameter of ca. 40 nm and an average height of 20 ± 10 and 10 ± 5 nm for Au and Pt, respectively. Furthermore, the calculated number density was (6. 0 ± 0. 8) × 10 (9) Au NPs cm(- 2) and (6. 6 ± 1. 3) × 10 (9) Pt NPs cm(- 2) with a larger size distribution measured for Au NPs. The Au 4 f and Pt 4 f X-ray photoelectron spectra of the metallized surfaces were characterized by a principal component corresponding to either the metallic gold or platinum. However, two other components located at higher binding energies were also visible and ascribed to gold or <b>platinum</b> <b>silicides.</b> Using this fluoride-free deposition process and a "reagentless" UV photolithography technique, we have also demonstrated {{that it was possible}} to prepare metallic NP micropatterns. Following this approach, single metal (Au) and two metals (Au and Pt) patterns have been produced and characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) which revealed the presence of the expected metal(s). Such metallic NP micropatterned surfaces were used as photocathodes for H(2) evolution from water as a proof-of-concept experiment. These electrodes exhibited much higher electrocatalytic performance than that of nonmetallized Si(100) -H, both in the absence of light and under illumination.

30|$|Before the {{implementation}} of <b>platinum</b> <b>silicides</b> (PtSi) for the realization of metallic source/drain contacts, the SiO 2 layer is etched selectively by CCP mode plasma at {{both sides of the}} VNWs using a fluorine chemistry (CHF 3 :CF 4 :Ar[*]=[*] 20 : 20 : 10). The source contact is defined by a lift-off process. A 10 -nm platinum layer is deposited by electron beam evaporation (anisotropic deposition), followed by the silicide reaction activation using a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 500  °C during 3  min under N 2 H 2 (96  % 4  %) atmosphere. The VNW sidewalls are cleaned from platinum contaminations by a selective wet etching in aqua regia solution. Figure  2 b presents a VNW network with silicided contacts at both sides of the VNWs with clean sidewalls. The 3 D process completion must go through a perfect mastery of nanoscale layer engineering. To this end, an innovative planarization method to realize the source to gate isolation spacer was developed using the HSQ as a dielectric material [21]. It is characterized by a low viscosity, providing excellent filling properties. Moreover, the HSQ is a CMOS-compatible material that offers a low dielectric constant (k[*]≈[*] 2.7), minimizing the parasitic capacitances. The planarization process was performed by chemical etching in highly diluted hydrofluoric acid (HF) in deionized water (1 : 1000). This approach has been preferred to plasma etching or chemical mechanical polishing (CMP); both approaches are widely used to planarize horizontal architectures but are not adapted to 3 D architectures. However, the etching of the HSQ in diluted HF needs to take over bubble encroachments on the dielectric surface issued from the releasing of the hydrogen gas during SiOxHy etching that induces severe degradations leading to a rough surface. To prevent the bubble encroachment, a cationic surface agent, benzalkonium chloride, has been added to the diluted HF solution. This leads to the extraction of the gas bubbles as they appeared on the surface which then vanish in the solution. The resulting planarization is presented in Fig.  2 c with a highly planarized HSQ layer over VNWs. It demonstrated an extremely flat layer, minimal roughness below 2  nm (measured by atomic force microscopy), without any degradation of the HSQ surface or of the VNWs. The etching rate of the HSQ is 2.3  nm/s, resulting in a highly controllable process. A 15 -nm nickel layer is then deposited by electron beam evaporation over the gate to source spacer. The gate contact is performed by each back process after the definition of hard mask by photolithography step. The unprotected Ni layer is etched in chemical solution based on H 2 SO 4 :H 2 O 2 :EDI[*]=[*] 25 : 1 : 50  ml, followed by the photoresist stripping. For the proposed architecture, {{it is worth noting that}} the gate length is simply defined by the gate material thickness, without any high-resolution lithography step. A second spacer is then performed to insulate the gate to the drain contacts (Fig.  2 d). Via openings are created by plasma etching in the dielectric to contact the metallic source and gate extensions. Finally, a 400 -nm thick Al layer is deposited by sputtering followed by a chemical etch back in a solution of H 3 PO 4 :HNO 3 :EDI[*]=[*] 5 : 40 : 7. Finally, a forming gas anneal (FGA) (N 2 H 2, 96  % 4  %) at 250  °C for 4  min is performed in order to passivate defects at both Si-SiO 2 interface and at Si-PtSi contact interface [22].|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Dr. Biard {{designed}} linear transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) to {{work with}} silicon photodiodes for receiving optical signals generated by LEDs. When the signal current from the silicon photodiode was too large, the input stage of the amplifier would saturate and cause undesirable delays when the optical signal was removed. Dr. Biard solved this problem by connecting a silicon HP Schottky diode across the collector-base junction of the input transistor. Since the Schottky diode had a lower forward drop than the transistor PN junction, the transistor did not saturate and the undesirable delay time was eliminated. The engineer in the next office at the SRD Lab was developing Diode Transistor Logic (DTL) ICs and also having saturation problems. Dr. Biard decided to use what he learned with the optical receiver amplifiers and apply that to the bipolar logic circuits. On December 31, 1964, Dr. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor (U.S. Patent US3463975), a.k.a. the Schottky-clamped transistor, which consisted of a transistor and an internal metal-semiconductor Schottky-barrier diode. The patent was filed based on Schottky Clamped DTL monolithic integrated logic circuits using aluminum-silicon Schottky diodes across the collector-base junctions of the transistors and in the input to adjust the logic levels. The diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The Schottky diode could be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. Dr. Biard's patent was filed before Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits had been invented, yet it was written broadly {{enough to cover the}} Schottky clamped TTL ICs using <b>platinum</b> <b>silicide</b> Schottky diodes, which were much more predictable and manufacturable than the aluminum Schottky diodes he originally used. His patent ultimately improved the switching speed of saturated logic designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost. In 1985, Dr. Biard received the Patrick E. Haggerty Innovation Award for this patent.|$|E

40|$|Metal {{deposition}} on Si has {{effects that}} may be detrimental to device operation such as diffusion, Fermi level pinning and silicide formation. Silicide formation is dependent on type of metal and temperature at which particular silicide is formed. Different defects have been observed during metallisation of Si to form electrical contact. The electrical characterisation of <b>platinum</b> <b>silicides</b> and palladium silicides were investigated using current-voltage and capacitance voltage measurements. Defects introduced were characterised by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and Laplace DLTS (L-DLTS) while silicidation process was monitored by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The Rutherford utilities manipulation program (RUMP) and Genplot program were used to analyse the data from RBS. The electron beam deposition process was used to fabricate Pt Schottky contacts onto n-Si (111). Subsequently these contacts were annealed at temperatures varying from 50 °C to 600 °C for ten minutes at each temperature. The forward I-V characteristics show that the diodes were stable at lower voltages and suffer series resistance effects at voltages higher than 0. 5 V. The reverse I-V curves shows increasing leakage current with increasing annealing temperature. At lower annealing temperatures, the reverse leakage current is constant at about 10 - 9 A. The ideality factor increased from 1. 02 to 2. 61 while the barrier height decreased from 0. 80 to 0. 70 eV as the annealing temperature increased. DLTS revealed that electron beam deposition introduced defects which were identified as the E-centre (VP centre), the A-centre (VO centre), the interstitial carbon (Ci) and the interstitial carbon-substitutional carbon (CiCs) pair. Isochronal annealing at 10 minutes intervals revealed that the E-centre vanishes between 125 and 175 °C annealing while the concentration of the A-centre increased in this range. The A-centre annealed out above 350 °C and after 400 °C, all the electron beam induced defects were all removed. Palladium Schottky contacts were fabricated on epitaxially grown n-Si (111) by resistive deposition. Current-voltage (I-V), capacitance- voltage (C-V) measurement techniques were used to characterise the as deposited and annealed Pd/n-Si Schottky contacts. These contacts were annealed at temperatures ranging from 200 °C to 700 °C, in steps of 100 °C for ten minutes each temperature. The ideality factor increased from 1. 2 for as deposited to 1. 6 after annealing at 700 °C while the Schottky barrier height (SBH) decreased from 0. 69 to 0. 64 eV as the annealing temperature increased. In this study, silicides seem to form at 300 °C where the ideality factor is at its lowest value and SBH begins to lower. The Rutherford backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) technique was used to verify temperatures at which Pd 2 Si was formed. The results obtained suggest that the Pd 2 Si silicide phase begins to form at 200 °C and at 300 °C it is completely formed. The defects introduced in epitaxially grown p-type silicon (Si) during electron beam exposure were electrically characterised using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and high resolution Laplace-DLTS. In this process, Si samples were first exposed to the conditions of electron beam deposition (EBD) without metal deposition. This is called electron beam exposure (EBE). After 50 minutes of EBE, aluminium (Al) and nickel (Ni) Schottky contacts were fabricated using the resistive deposition method. For the Al contacts, the defect level H(0. 33) was identified as the interstitial carbon (????) related defect. The defect level observed using the Ni contacts had an activation energy of H(0. 55). This defect has an activation energy {{similar to that of}} the I-defect. DLTS depth profiling revealed that H(0. 33) and H(0. 55) could be detected up to a depth of 1. 2 ??m and 0. 8 ??m respectively. We found that exposing the samples to EBD conditions without metal deposition introduced a different group of defects which are not introduced by the EBD method.
