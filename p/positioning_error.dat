Meanwhile, by using the zero Doppler bin data, the phase error estimation can behave independently of <b>position</b> <b>errors.</b> Then the joint iteration strategy between the gain-phase and <b>position</b> <b>error</b> estimations in the conventional method can be avoided, which makes the modified method perform stably with low computational load.

30|$|In the {{conventional}} method, {{two kinds of}} errors, the gain-phase <b>error</b> and the <b>position</b> <b>error,</b> are respectively estimated {{under the assumption that}} other kinds of errors are known. The inherent relationship among gain, phase, and <b>position</b> <b>errors</b> is not considered and analyzed in {{the conventional}} method. In this article, by studying of the conventional method, the following two aspects are observed. First, gain <b>error</b> estimation and <b>position</b> <b>error</b> estimation can affect each other, which will influence the convergence rate. And the conventional method may even suffer from suboptimal convergence in large <b>position</b> <b>errors.</b> Second, if spectrum components within the zero Doppler bin are used as calibration sources to estimate the errors, phase error estimation can be performed independent of <b>position</b> <b>errors.</b> Based on the above two aspects, a modified array error estimation method is proposed in this article. First, in order to eliminate the interaction between the gain and <b>position</b> <b>error</b> estimations, gain errors are first estimated and compensated.

30|$|The {{performance}} of distributed small satellite {{synthetic aperture radar}} systems degrades significantly due to the unavoidable array errors, including gain, phase, and <b>position</b> <b>errors,</b> in real operating scenarios. In the conventional method proposed in (IEEE T Aero. Elec. Sys. 42 : 436 – 451, 2006), the spectrum components within one Doppler bin are considered as calibration sources. However, it is found in this article that the gain error estimation and the <b>position</b> <b>error</b> estimation in the conventional method can interact with each other. The conventional method may converge to suboptimal solutions in large <b>position</b> <b>errors</b> since it requires the joint iteration between gain-phase <b>error</b> estimation and <b>position</b> <b>error</b> estimation. In addition, it is also found that phase errors can be estimated well regardless of <b>position</b> <b>errors</b> when the zero Doppler bin is chosen. In this article, we propose a method obtained by modifying the conventional one, based on these two observations. In this modified method, gain errors are firstly estimated and compensated, which eliminates the interaction between gain <b>error</b> estimation and <b>position</b> <b>error</b> estimation. Then, by using the zero Doppler bin data, the phase error estimation can be performed well independent of <b>position</b> <b>errors.</b> Finally, <b>position</b> <b>errors</b> are estimated based on the Taylor-series expansion. Meanwhile, the joint iteration between gain-phase <b>error</b> estimation and <b>position</b> <b>error</b> estimation is not required. Therefore, the problem of suboptimal convergence, which occurs in the conventional method, can be avoided with low computational method.

So {{it is necessary to}} analyze the precision of the position of sub-mirrors.

The results show that root mean square (RMS) values generated by the same <b>position</b> <b>error</b> are different when sub-mirrors are at the different positions. The middle mirrors are sensitive to the movement along X axis direction, and the outer ones are sensitive to the movement along the Y axis direction. Two methods are used to distribute the errors into the sub-mirror <b>position</b> <b>error.</b> One is distributing the <b>position</b> <b>error</b> to each sub-mirror alone.
