40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the shape optimization problem of columns for a given volume and length against buckling by using the discrete link-spring model or the so-called Hencky bar-chain model (HBM). This discrete beam model comprises a finite number of rigid segments connected by frictionless hinges and rotational springs. In particular, the rotational spring stiffness of HBM {{is a function of the}} square of cross-sectional area of columns with regular <b>polygonal</b> or circular <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape.</b> Therefore, the design of optimal rotational spring stiffnesses of a HBM allows one to obtain the optimal shape of a column provided that the assumed number of springs is sufficiently large. The present formulation of HBM for column optimization is prompted by some discrepancies in the volume calculations and the specification of the spring stiffness at the clamped end in Krishna and Ram (2007) discrete link-spring model formulation. By using the correct formulation and the semi-analytical method proposed by Krishna and Ram (2007), we determine the optimal shape of clamped-free, pinned-pinned, clamped-spring supported columns. In addition, we extend the semi-analytical method to optimize the shape of clamped-free columns under distributed loads. Also presented herein are exact buckling solutions for the uniform HBM under axial load and selfweight as well as the non-uniform HBM under axial load with a specific class of spring stiffnesses.

40|$|Dry {{paper is}} {{composed}} of ribbon-shaped paper fibers randomly oriented in the plane of the sheet. Paper fiber cross-sections transform from elliptical in the pulp slurry to ribbon-like on drying due to capillary pressure of water contained in the lumen of the paper fiber. On contacting a dry paper with water or simply exposing the paper to high humidity, paper fibers tend to regain their initial elliptical <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> due to breakage of hydrogen bonds and relaxation of drying stresses. Fiber expansion is the resultant of swelling of the fiber wall and opening of the collapsed lumen. A single-fiber model is presented to predict the fiber <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes</b> at various stages during drying and/or moisturization. Swelling of paper fibers affects the physical and transport properties of paper. Predicted <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes</b> of paper fibers are mapped onto an idealized unit cell model of paper structure to predict the effective diffusion coefficient and permeability of paper as function of fiber swelling. The model predicts that the effective diffusion coefficient drops as relative humidity decreases {{and that there is a}} sudden drop in effective diffusion coefficient as the fibers collapse from elliptical to ribbon-like cross-sections.

40|$|The {{reported}} biomechanical {{properties of}} soft tissues are often {{dependent on the}} method used to determine specimen cross-sectional area as {{this is an important}} factor in tissue stress calculations. <b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> is also important, especially for documenting morphological changes in the tissue during healing. Successful measurement of these geometric characteristics, however, has been hindered by the complex geometry of many biological tissues, as well as concerns regarding the deformability of these tissues under mechanical contact. The overall objective of this thesis was to evaluate the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> and area of normal and healing ligaments using laser-based devices. Lasers allow for measurements without inducing mechanical contact and deformation. Initially, the effects of treatment with a bio-scaffold, small intestinal submucosa (SIS), on the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> and area of healing ligaments were evaluated using the laser micrometer system. However, due to limitations of currently available methods such as the inability to detect concavities, a new system was also developed and evaluated. The <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> and area of non-treated healing and SIS-treated healing rabbit MCLs were assessed using a laser micrometer system 26 weeks after gap injury. No significant changes in shape were detected between SIS-treated and non-treated MCLs. However, SIS-treatment significantly reduced the cross-sectional area at 26 weeks after injury in comparison to the non-treated group. A charge coupled device (CCD) laser reflectance system was developed in order to determine the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> and area of tissues containing surface concavities. For this system, a CCD laser displacement sensor recorded distance measurements off a specimen while it rotated 360 °. The area and shape could then be determined from this data. The system was evaluated using geometric <b>shapes</b> of known <b>cross-sectional</b> area before being applied to biological specimens. This work demonstrated that <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> and area measurements can be used to quantify tissue healing and remodeling. Additionally, the CCD laser reflectance system successfully detected concavities on the surfaces of tissues and therefore is a viable approach to biological tissue measurement. However, this system does not offer much improvement in accuracy over the laser micrometer system for tissues that do not have significant concavities...|$|R
