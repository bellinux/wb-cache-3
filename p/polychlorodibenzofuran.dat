40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{recently}} closed old municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) on polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (POD), <b>polychlorodibenzofuran</b> (PCDF), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in the surrounding environment and resident serum has been studied in a small rural area of France. Studied soils and eggs from chickens foraging on these soils were sampled {{in the vicinity of}} the MSWI under the prevailing wind stream, while comparison samples were collected outside the assumed impact zone. PCB levels observed in soils and eggs did not differ statistically from comparison sites. This confirmed the low impact of MSWI PCB emission on environmental media, compared to other well-known sources. PCDD/PCDF levels in soils and eggs were significantly higher than in comparison samples, pointing out the impact of MSWI emission on the surrounding environment. The high dioxin concentrations in eggs set aside for private consumption would increase the dioxin intake for the studied population. Blood specimens of 10 nonoccupationally exposed volunteers who had lived within a 2 km radius of the incinerator for at least 25 years have been analyzed. When adjusted for age, PCB and PCDD/F blood levels were higher than general European populations and comparable to a similarly exposed Belgian population. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Negative {{chemical}} ionization mass spectrometry {{with a mixture}} of isobutane, methylene chloride, and oxygen as the reagent gas has been used to explore contamination of environmental substrates with xenobiotic chemicals. The substrates in question, fish tissue, human seminal plasma, and human adipose tissue, were cleaned up by one of the following three cleanup procedures: (1) continuous liquid-liquid extraction steam distillation; (2) gel-permeation chromatography; and (3) adsorption on activated carbon followed by elution with toluene. The third procedure was used only for the examination of planar polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons in environmental samples. Using these techniques, we have found evidence for contamination of fish samples with polychloronaphthalenes, polychlorostyrenes, polychlorobiphenyls, polychlorodibenzofurans, and polychlorodibenzodioxins among other chemicals. The polychlorodibenzodioxins appeared only in the spectra of extracts of fish obtained from the Tittabawassee River at Midland Michigan. The <b>polychlorodibenzofuran</b> ions appeared in NCI mass spectra of fish that were significantly contaminated (above 2 ppm) with polychlorobiphenyls. Toxic substances occurring in human seminal plasma included pentachlorophenol, hexachlorobenzene, DDT metabolites, and polychlorobiphenyls. We have investigated toxic substances in human seminal plasma because of the apparent decrease in sperm density in U. S. males over the last 30 years. Results of screening human adipose tissue for contamination with xenobiotic chemicals have been largely coincident with result of the EPA human monitoring program. Polychlorobiphenyls, DDT metabolites, nonachlor, and chlordane have appeared in most samples examined. Detection limits for all of these chemicals were of the order of 1 ppb...|$|E
40|$|Chlorine {{has been}} used {{extensively}} as an industrial compound for synthesis of innumerable commercial product, including bleaches, organic diluents, adhesives, dust reducing agents, cutting oils, disinfectants, and monomers for plastics, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Despite societal contribution of chlorinated chemicals, there have recent suggestion by some environmental associations and scientists to ban the industrial use of chlorine. After their release into environment, organochlorine pollutants are stable and resistant to chemical and biodegradation and preferentially accumulation in the sequence food chain. As a detoxification hydrodechlorination (HDC) reactions change neither the thermodynamics of the reaction nor the equilibrium composition. Also, there is no possibility of producing hazard by-product such as polychlorodibenzodioxins and <b>polychlorodibenzofuran.</b> Liquid phase hydrodechlorination of 4 -chlorophenols was studied over the temperature range from room temperature (R. T) to 80 °C using various Nickel catalysts and active hydrogen sources. Raney Nickel system converted 4 -chlorophenol to ~ 49 mol% of phenol and ~ 34 mol% cyclohexanol at R. T. and {{proved to be more}} reactive than Ni 0 and Ni-Fe. The HDC system with borohydrides as hydrogen source achieved hydrodechlorination at lower temperature than the system with molecular hydrogen. Ni-Al proved to be reactive for hydrogenolysis in the presence of borohydride at R. T. A somewhat surprising temperature dependence of Ni-Al mediated HDC in absence of H 2 and borohydride was absented. Optimization with Ni-Al under mild condition was performed using central composite design (CCD). Optimal condition for maximum phenol production was predicted to be 80 °C, for 11 h with 30 mg of catalyst. 98 mol% phenol is produced under this condition. A continuous stream of pentachlorophenol (PCP, 0. 5 mg/min) in mixture of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) and hydrogen was hydrodechlorinated by a heated column of gamma-alumina supported palladium (5 % w/w). Dechlorination efficiencies and time to reach equilibrium were influenced appreciable by the temperature and substrate delivery rate. The product from reaction at 210 °C, 2000 psi accounted for 92 mol% phenol and 2. 3 mol% cyclohexanone. The temperature was maintained at 210 °C while the pressure and content of H 2 in the gas mixture was changed to 1000 ~ 2000 psi, 5 % and 16 % (v/v) H 2 /CO 2. The production of phenol and cyclohexanone was greater at higher pressures (2000 psi.) with the formation of methoxy-cyclohexane.

40|$|Heavy {{metals and}} toxic {{chlorinated}} organics, added to very low grain- size distributions, make fly ashes from municipal incinerators a very hazardous waste. For their disposal, the present general trend is, {{not only to}} stabilize chemically the ashes, i. e. to reduce the leachability of the toxic substances, but also to stabilize them mechanically, i. e. to convert them into massive, resistant, and unleachable solids. This paper describes various stabilization methods used on representative European fly ash samples, {{which led to the}} development of a new stabilization technique taking place in four stages: elimination of the alkali chlorides by dissolution; addition of a moderate quantity of phosphoric acid; calcination; and solidification with Portland clinker or cement. The principal advantages of the process are as follows: the polychlorodibenzodioxins- <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> are destroyed, the reactivity of the heavy metals is reduced drastically, the final solids have satisfactory mechanical properties, and the increase in weight of the waste to be disposed of does not exceed one fourth.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} concern regarding dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) {{in the marine}} environment. These ubiquitous contaminants are highly resistant to degradation, highly accumulated by marine organisms, and extremely toxic. Concentrations of DLCs, including 7 polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, 10 <b>polychlorodibenzofurans,</b> and 4 coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls, were determined in sediments, mussels (Mytilus edulis), and sea stars (Asterias rubens) from five intertidal stations distributed along the Belgian coast and the English Channel. The induction of a biomarker, cytochrome P 450 immunopositive protein (CYP 1 A IPP), was also measured in sea star pyloric caeca. Although {{no significant differences were}} found between the considered stations, DLC levels were found to be relatively high in biota, especially when the toxicity of these compounds is considered. Particular concern arises from TEQ values determined in mussels from all locations. Sea stars were found to be more discriminant between the stations.

In this contribution we present {{the results of the}} research done at the University of Alicante {{in the last four years}} [1 - 7] about the thermal decomposition of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Several materials have been studied, including PVC and halogen-free wires, printed circuit boards and casing from mobile phones, as well as brominated flame reatardants used in the EEE preparation such as TBBPA (tetra-bromo-bisphenol-A). Several experiments were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere (pyrolysis runs) and also in an oxidative atmosphere with different oxygen concentrations. Thermogravimetric runs were used to characterize samples, and a horizontal laboratory reactor was used to study the formation and destruction of pollutants during the thermal decomposition of these samples. More than 150 compounds, including carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorophenols (ClPhs), chlorobenzenes (ClBzs) and bromophenols (BrPhs) have been identified and quantified.

40|$|Among the {{different}} analytical tools proposed {{as an alternative}} to the very expensive gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) analyses of polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and <b>polychlorodibenzofurans,</b> Chemically Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) in vitro cell bioassay is very promising. It allows the analyses of a high number of samples since it is relatively fast, inexpensive, and sensitive. However, this technique is not yet widely applied for screening or environmental monitoring. The main reasons are probably the lack of validation and the difficulty in interpreting the global biological response of the bioassay. In this paper, the strict quality control criteria set up for the validation of CALUX are described. The validation has shown good repeatability (relative standard deviation (RSD) = 9 %) and good within-lab reproducibility (RSD = 15 %) of the results.

Comparison of CALUX and GC-HRMS analysis was made for various marine matrixes (fishes, mussels, starfishes, sea birds, and marine mammals).

40|$|Summary. In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the accumulation of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlo-rodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDFs), and the chlorinated pesticides 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) -ethene (DDE), 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) -ethane (DDT), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in the breast muscle, liver, lung, heart and brain tissues of adult common swifts (Apus apus, a long-lived aerial feeder bird). Individuals were collected in an urban area located in Rome during the breeding period. As shown by lipid-base normalized data, in general analytes had a significant minimum concentration in the brain. PCDD and PCDF concen-tration values in such tissue were approximately one order of magnitude lower than those found in breast muscle, heart, and lung tissues, {{and as much as}} two orders of magnitude below the relatively high levels found in the liver. PCB levels followed the same accumulation patterns. Of all analytes, HCB exhibited the most uniform distribution pattern over the five matrices assayed. DDE and DDT were by far the most and the least concentrated pesticide. In the urban environment of Rome, an air-to-swift bioconcentration factor (lipid based) in the order of 5 × 106 (2 × 105, fresh tissue base) was estimated for PCDDs and PCDFs.

40|$|Abstract Background Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDFs), and {{polychlorobiphenyls}} (PCBs) are persistent {{organic pollutants}} that represent a major concern for women of reproductive age because of the neurodevelopmental effects associated to perinatal exposure. Objectives This study was aimed at characterizing exposure of women of reproductive age to PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs {{as a function of}} residence in different Italian Regions, in areas at presumable different environmental contamination and human exposure to these pollutants. Methods Study participants were enrolled in 2011 – 2012 in 6 Italian Regions representative of Northern, Central and Southern Italy; in each region, areas at presumed different exposure (rural, urban and industrial) were selected for enrolment. Each participant provided a serum sample for the analysis of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs. Results Median concentrations of PCDDs + PCDFs, DL-PCBs, NDL 6 -PCBs and NDL 9 -PCBs in serum samples were respectively 6. 0 and 3. 5 pgWHO-TE 05 /g fat, and 75 and 93 ng/g fat. Age was the variable that most affected median serum concentrations. Age adjusted concentrations were found significantly different between geographical zones: women from Northern Italy showed the highest values, followed by Central and Southern Italy. PCDDs + PCDFs concentrations were significantly higher in the group of women residing in industrial areas compared to the group residing in rural areas. A clear diminishing temporal trend was observed compared to levels reported in previous studies. Conclusions This study produced the largest dataset on serum concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in women of childbearing age in Italy...|$|R

The litter-to-eggs tranfer and depletion of the aforesaid compounds were studied in a flock of laying hens reared on contaminated wood shawings. PCP determination was carried out with HRGC-LRMS/MS; PCDDs and PCDFs were quantified by HRGC-HRMS (SIM). After the substitution of the litter, contaminated by PCDDs and PCDFs {{at an average of}} 50 pgWHO-TE/ g and by PCP at 15 µg/g, pooled eggs from six selected hens were sampled twice a month for a depletion study. At steady state, PCDDs and PCDFs showed a transfer rate of 0. 9, while that of PCP was 0. 03. PCP concentration in eggs (500 ng/g whole weight) fell sharply after the second week from exposure withdrawal; for PCDDs and PCDFs (47 pgWHO-TE/g fat, at day 0) the overall TEQ half-life was estimated at an average of 3. 8 weeks. Due to differences in toxicokinetics (a faster depletion), PCP {{does not appear to be}} a suitable marker of PCDD and PCDF violative levels. However, the prominent analytical contribution of H 7 CCD and O 8 CCD in the contamination profile may help to trace back the source of contamination.

Milk specimens from mothers of the general population of the Venice and Rome areas were collected over the 1998 - 2001 period, pooled, and analyzed for selected persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs), <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDFs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, hexachlorobenzene), and polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and the heavy metals Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, Sn, and Zn. The goal was to verify whether mother milk from the Venice area, whose lagoon is partly under direct industrial impact, had a contaminant load greater than that from the Rome area, primarily urban. For mothers from the Venice area, the correlation between fish and fishery product consumption and contaminant concentrations in milk was also explored, with however inconclusive results. The concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, dioxin-like PCBs, and organochlorinated pesticides determined in this study were compared with those available from a previous analytical work carried out on 1987 human milk pools of domestic origin: the declining trend of the aforesaid contaminants in milk is confirmed to be in agreement with what was observed in other European countries.

It was observed that the CO 2 /CO ratio increased with temperature. Methane was the only light hydrocarbon whose yield increased with temperature up to 1000 °C. Benzene was rather stable at high temperatures, but in general, combustion at temperatures above 500 °C was enough to destroy light hydrocarbons. Semivolatile hydrocarbons were collected in XAD- 2 resin and more than 160 compounds were detected. Trends on polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) yields showed that most had a maximum at 850 °C in pyrolysis, but naphthalene at 700 °C. Formation of chlorinated aromatics was detected. A detailed analysis of all isomers of chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols was performed. Both of them reached higher total yields in combustion runs, the first ones having a maximum at 700 °C and the latter at 500 °C. Pyrolysis and combustion runs at 850 °C were conducted to study the formation of polychlorodibenzo- p-dioxins (PCDDs) and <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDFs).

In this study, we investigated the distribution of tetra- to octa-CDD/F along the flue gas line in a full-scale reciprocating grate incinerator and evaluated the effects of temperature control and O- 2 level on PCDD/F formation. Six runs were laid out and all performed under sufficient burning conditions, in which the combustion efficiency of MSW was more than 99. 9 %. The total concentration of tetra- to octa-CDD/F measured at the boiler outlet showed an increasing tendency {{with the increase of}} boiler outlet temperature (TB) from 214 degrees C to 264 degrees C. When flue gas ran across the semi-dry scrubber and cyclone precipitator, in which the temperature varied from 264 degrees C to 162 degrees C, the concentrations of the lower chlorinated dioxins and furans were significantly raised, especially for the TCDF. Increasing 02 supply from 6. 0 % to 10. 5 % essentially led to a higher yield of tetra- to octa-PCDD/F, suggested that under sufficient burning conditions the lower O- 2 level was favorable for reducing PCDD/F formation and emission. The variation of O- 2 level did not give rise to a systematical change of PCDD/F homologue pattern. For all measurements, the isomer distributions of tetra- to hepta-PCDD/F were more or less the same, nearly independent of variations in {{the operating}} conditions and sampling positions.

Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs, dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) and non dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs) in a sample of 300 workers of metallurgical plants operating in the Brescia area and in a control group of 113 men. Serum samples were grouped in pools of 10 and analyzed for their concentration of PCDDs and PCDFs, DL- and NDL-PCBs. Metallurgical workers show serum concentrations of NDL-PCBs similar to those observed in non-occupationally exposed living in Brescia, except in the case of some congeners, such as PCBs 28, 52, 101 which result to be significantly higher in metallurgical workers. Their concentrations range of "dioxins" was of 32. 5 - 84. 8 pgTEQ g(- 1) lb. No significant difference was found between metallurgical workers and the control group on the whole, but the difference became significant when comparing metallurgical workers with the group of the 47 subjects living in remote non industrialised areas. In conclusion, concentrations of total PCBs observed in metallurgy workers are comparable with those observed in the control group, with the exception of a few, more volatile, congeners which resulted to be higher in metallurgy workers. Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs showed a range of values similar to that observed in the general population of Brescia not professionally exposed. However, concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs observed in subjects resident in "remote" areas were significantly lower than those assessed in metallurgy workers and subjects living in the town of Brescia.

Factors such as prevalence of diseases, conflicts, and the efflux of intellectual capacity make low income countries more susceptible to these adverse health effects. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the effectiveness of interventions geared towards better managing the generation, collection, transport, treatment and disposal of medical waste, {{as they have been}} applied in lower and middle income countries. ^ Using a systematic search strategy and evaluation of study quality, this study reviewed the literature for published studies on healthcare waste management interventions carried out in developing countries, specifically the low and lower middle income countries from year 2000 to the current year. From an initially identified set of 829 studies, only three studies ultimately met all inclusion, exclusion and high quality criteria. A multi component intervention in Syrian Arab Republic, conducted in 2007 was aimed at improving waste segregation practice in a hospital setting. There was an increased use of segregation boxes and reduced rates of sharps injury among staff {{as a result of the}} intervention. Another study, conducted in 2008, trained medical students as monitors of waste segregation practice in an Indian teaching hospital. There was improved practice in wards and laboratories but not in the intensive care units. The third study, performed in 2008 in China, consisted of modification of the components of a medical waste incinerator to improve efficiency and reduce stack emissions. Gaseous pollutants emitted, except <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDF) were below US EPA permissible exposure limits. Heavy metal residues in the fly ash remained unchanged. ^ Due to the paucity of well-designed studies, there is insufficient evidence in literature to conclude on the effectiveness of interventions in low income settings.

40|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) {{is one of}} the plastics most extensively used due to its versatility. The {{demand of}} PVC resin in Europe during 2012 reached 5000 ktonnes 1. PVC waste management is a big problem because of the high volume generated {{all over the world and}} its chlorine content. End-of-life PVC is mainly mixed with municipal solid waste (MSW) and one common disposal option for this is waste-to-energy incineration (WtE). The presence of plastics such as PVC in the fuel mix increases the heating value of the fuel. PVC has two times higher energy content than MSW ‒around 20 MJ/kg vs 10 MJ/kg, respectively. However, the high chlorine content in PVC resin, 57 wt. %, may be a source for the formation of hazardous chlorinated organic pollutants in thermal processes. Chlorine present in the feedstock of WtE plants plays an important role in the formation of (i) chlorine (Cl 2) and (ii) hydrochloric gas (HCl), both of them responsible for corrosion, and (iii) chlorinated organic pollutants 2. In this work, pyrolytic and oxidative thermal degradation of PVC resin were carried out in a laboratory scale reactor at 500 ºC in order to analyze the influence of the reaction atmosphere on the emissions evolved. Special emphasis was put on the analysis of chlorinated organic pollutants such as polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDFs) and other related compounds like polychlorobenzenes (PCBzs), polychlorophenols (PCPhs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

They are produced in small quantities from a large number of diverse man-maid and natural sources. These chemicals contaminate most areas of the world and accumulate in the food web. The major source of nonoccupational exposures to humans from PCDDs/PCDFs is animal food. In view of adverse health effects and widespread and persistent presence of PCDDs/PCDFs in the environment, these compounds are monitored in air, rain, effluents, soil and biota matrices. 	 Measuring PCDDs/PCDFs background concentrations requires methods that provide extremely high sensitivity (low picogram to low femptogram range). Specificity is obtained through extensive purification followed by determination with a GC/MS technique. Because of the very low concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs in air, high resolution mass spectrometry in combination with high resolution gas chromatography was the method of choice. These instrument are very expensive to purchase and to maintain, so the aim {{of this study was to}} establish a method which delivers comparable results by using the more economic ion trap mass spectrometers (ITMS). The advantages of this method in comparison to quantrapole instruments, which are often used to determine these substances in other matrices, are the increase in sensitivity and the greater selectivity. They are reached by the typical MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) four-step process involving ionization (Electron Impact), parent isolation, collision induced dissociation (CID) and mass analysis of daughter ions. However, in tandem mass spectrometry a set of parameters has to be optimized in order to attain the required sensitivity. Five parameters were varied, including ion source temperature, isolation time, excitation time, excitation voltage and q value. By this optimization a limit of detection of 125 fg/μl was obtained. Tandem mass spectrometry by ion trap mass spectrometers provides high sensitivity and selectivity and ensures reliable results for analysis of low contaminated samples like air samples. So, after the optimization studies, 10 samples of particulate and gas phase from the atmosphere of several areas of Athens and Crete were analyzed...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose Since 2005, {{freshwater}} fish contamination by polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorodibenzodioxins, and <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> has been assessed in the Rhone River basin (France). A large database of surface sediment contamination by PCBs is also available, opening {{the way to}} the study of biota-to-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) distribution throughout this basin. The ultimate goal {{of the study was to}} determine a sediment quality guideline (SQG) corresponding to the regulatory fish consumption limit. Materials and methods A bootstrapping procedure for determining BSAFs was applied to a data set matching the available databases of sediment and fish contamination by PCBs in the Rhone River basin. The SQG was obtained by combining the current tissue-based regulatory threshold with a characteristic BSAF value, for a species particularly prone to accumulating these compounds. As the current regulatory threshold refers to dioxins and related com- pounds, while most available sediment data deal with non- dioxin-like PCBs, a set of correlations was used to derive an SQG for the sum of seven indicator PCBs. To assess the reliability of these SQG pairs, actual fish and sediment concentrations were classified into four categories, accord- ing to a comparison with the regulatory threshold for fish data and the calculated SQG. Results and discussion BSAFs were determined for 11 species. The barbel and European eel had the highest BSAFs. The common carp, a benthic species, had surpris- ingly low BSAFs, as low as pelagic and omnivorous species such as chub. The data set was also split into two parts, one comprising fish samples at or above the regulatory limit and the other samples below this threshold. Sediment concentrations and BSAFs were higher in the former group. An SQG was derived on the basis of the 75 th percentile of barbel's BSAF, equaling 26. 6 ng g− 1 dry weight (range 15. 6 - 38. 6 ng g− 1) for the sum of seven indicator PCBs. When tested against the same database, this SQG displayed an overall efficiency of about 60 % resulting from the limited reliability of sediment data and the factors influencing PCB bioavailability. Conclusions From the perspective of regulatory frame- works such as the European Water Framework Directive, a tiered monitoring strategy combining sediments (first tier) and biota (second tier) could be more relevant than a single- compartment approach. In this context, an SQG such as the one determined herein would trigger the second tier...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} if protracted {{living in}} degraded environments of the Caserta and Naples provinces (Campania Region, Italy) {{had an impact}} on exposure of local people, highly toxic persistent contaminants were measured in blood, blood serum, and human milk {{of a large number of}} healthy donors. Sampling was carried out from 2008 to 2009. Blood was collected from over 850 20 - 64 -year old donors; by pooling, 84 blood and 84 serum samples were obtained. Milk was donated by 52 mothers: specimens were pooled into six samples. Polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs), <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDFs), and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs, dioxin-like (DL) and non-dioxin-like (Σ 6 PCBs)), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) were measured in serum (organic biomarkers) and blood (metals); these chemicals and polybromobiphenyl ethers (Σ 9 PBDEs) were analyzed in milk. PCDD+PCDF, DL-PCB, TEQTOT, and Σ 6 PCB concentration ranges (medians) in serum were 6. 26 - 23. 1 (12. 4), 3. 42 - 31. 7 (11. 5), 10. 0 - 52. 8 (23. 9) pgTEQ 97 /g fat, and 55. 5 - 647 (219) ng/g fat, respectively, while in milk concentration ranges were 5. 99 - 8. 77, 4. 02 - 6. 15, 10. 0 - 14. 2 pgTEQ 97 /g fat, and 48. 7 - 74. 2 ng/g fat. Likewise, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb findings in blood spanned 2. 34 - 13. 4 (5. 83), 0. 180 - 0. 930 (0. 475), 1. 09 - 7. 60 (2. 60), 10. 2 - 55. 9 (28. 8) μg/L, respectively; only Pb could be measured in milk (2. 78 - 5. 99 μg/L). Σ 9 PBDE levels in milk samples were 0. 965 - 6. 05 ng/g fat. Biomarkers' concentrations were found to be compatible with their current values in European countries and in Italy, and consistent with an exposure primarily determined by consumption of commercial food from the large distribution system. Based on relatively higher biomarker values within the hematic biomonitoring database, the following municipalities were flagged as possibly deserving attention for health-oriented interventions: Brusciano and Caivano (As), Giugliano (Hg), Pianura (PCDDs+PCDFs), and Qualiano-Villaricca (As, Hg). The analysis of samples' qualitative variability indicated that biomarker composition was sensitive at municipality level, a feature that can potentially drive interventions for future local risk assessment and/or management measures.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study on dioxin levels in samples of curly kale, collected in deposition areas of municipal waste incinerators and a metal reclamation plant as well as in background locations in the Netherlands. From earlier reports on environmental contamination with dioxins it is known that in areas within a few kilometers of waste incinerators, elevated dioxin levels can be found in top soil, grass and a consequence of this, in cow's milk from locally situated dairy farms. Therefore, it was assumed that in the same areas elevated levels can be found in outside growing crops especially curly kale. For these reasons, the first objective was to obtain more insight in levels of the seventeen toxic polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> in samples of kale collected in suspected and non-suspected areas, whereas the second objective was to produce more data on dioxin levels in kale to enable assessments of the additional intake of dioxins by the Dutch population by consumption of kale and other leafy vegetables. In February 1991, {{at the end of the}} growth period, fourteen samples of kale were collected in deposition areas of two municipal waste incinerators and one metal reclamation plant and two background locations. Strategy in sampling preparation was directed to obtain representative data on dioxin levels in kale for each of the five regions at a limited number of 15 - 20 samples reserved for this study. Analyses were performed by the use of in-house standard operating procedures for extraction, isolation and GC/MS-analysis of purified extracts. It appeared that no elevated levels chould be found in samples of kale from depostion areas. The dioxin levels of the fourteen samples ranged between 0. 52 and 1. 3 with a mean of 0. 87 +- 0. 06 pg 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD-equivalents (using International REFs) per g dry weight (pg TEQ/g dry weight). According to consumption data from the Dutch Food Consumption Study 1987 - 1988, a yearly average of 2 g of kale per person per day is consumed. Using a dioxin level of 1 pg TEQ/g dry weight and an average dry matter content of 15 wt%, and additional daily intake of 0. 3 pg TEQ per person can be calculated. When compared to an earlier reported median intake of 70 pg TEQ per person per day by consumption of food products mainly derived from animal fats and oils, a negligible additional intake is obtained by consumption of kale. By extrapolation of these figures to other (leafy) vegetables and fruits, a maximal additional daily intake has been estimated of about 8 pg TEQ per person per day. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} the {{development}} and validation of analytical methods for the de-tection and quantification of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in biological matrices, namely food and feed samples. POPs are a group of chemical compounds listed after the Stockholm Convention in 2001, with demonstrated toxicity and dangerousness for envi-ronment, animals and humans. In this work of thesis, special attention was reserved to some selected POPs: polychlo-rodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), <b>polychlorodibenzofurans</b> (PCDFs), usually referred to as “dioxins”, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as there is a}} big concern about these contaminants in Taranto, a city in the Southern Italy very close to Bari, my home town. Taranto, indeed, is characterized by a large industrial area with a steel mill, several incin-erators and a refinery in few kilometre radius (Di Leo et al., 2014). This work has been done in collaboration with the University of Liège (Belgium) where a consolidated exper-tise in the field of POP measurements was available, especially in terms of dioxin anal-yses. In Chapter 1 the main steps, from sample preparation to data elaboration, of a validated confirmatory method for dioxin and PCB detection in food and feed using gas chromatog-raphy coupled to tandem mass spectrometry Triple Quad instrument (GC-MS/MS Triple Quad) have been described. This method was developed at the University of Liège in the framework of the last updates of the EU Regulation that in 2014 allowed confirmatory quantitative analysis of dioxins with Triple Quad. This method was the starting point of this work of thesis, because it was used for all dioxin and PCB quantifications. In Chapter 2 and chapter 3 alternative clean-up approaches for dioxin analysis in fatty food matrices have been developed using different automated systems. These works have been done in the framework of solvent and time saving for high throughput analytical methods in dioxin analysis. In chapter 2, an already existing automated system, DEXTechTM from LCTech GmbH (LCTech GmbH, Bahnweg 41, 84405 Dorfen, Germany) was used for sample clean-up, but a completely new clean-up approach was developed with this. GC-MS/MS Triple Quad instrument, as well as Magnetic Sector High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) instrument were employed for final quantification, to demonstrate the suitability of our newly developed clean-up approaches whatever the instrumental detection. In Chapter 3 PowerPrepTM automated system from Fluid Management System (FMS Inc., 580 Pleasant Street, Watertown, MA 02472, USA) was used and our routine sample clean-up approach was modified in order to enhance the efficiency and to reduce cost and solvent consumption of the analysis. In Chapter 4 the main method for dioxin analysis was adapted for the integration of Dechloranes in the list of the analytes targeted in the regular control for dioxins in food and feed. Dechloranes are a family of 6 organo-chlorinated compounds with structure similar to Mirex, also called Dechlorane, a POP listed in the Stockholm convention. Dechloranes have been found in human blood of people from Europe (Brasseur et al., 2014) and in this work an analytical method for Dechlorane detection was developed and validated to investigate food as a possible route of exposure for humans in Europe, where no production plant has been identified so far. The analytical method was used to analyse 88 food and feed real sample and to give an idea of Dechlorane daily dietary intake...|$|R
