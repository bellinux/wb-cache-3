In Exp 1, 30 dysphoric Ss found <b>positive</b> and negative <b>responses</b> toward the self equally informative. 30 nondysphoric Ss found <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> toward the self more informative. When responses were directed toward others, dysphorics found <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> more informative than negative responses, while nondysphorics found <b>positive</b> and negative <b>responses</b> directed toward others equally informative. Exp 2 replicated these results with 27 clinically depressed and 27 nondysphoric Ss, showing that remitted depressed Ss found <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> more informative, regardless of direction to self or others. Results suggest that positive and negative constructs are differentially accessible for these groups...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{response}} to skin prick tests (SPTs) to food antigens (FAs) and inhalant allergens (IAs) in patients with two subtypes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy controls. METHODS: We compared the results of SPTs for IAs and FAs in 87 volunteers divided into three groups: diarrhea predominant IBS (D-IBS) GroupI(n = 19), constipation predominant IBS (C-IBS) Group II (n = 17), and normal controls Group III (n = 51). RESULTS: Of the 285 tests (171 for FAs and 114 for IAs) performed in GroupIwe obtained 45 (26. 3 %) <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> for FA and 23 (20. 1 %) for IA. Of the 153 tests for FA in Group II, we obtained 66 (20. 1 %) <b>positive</b> <b>responses,</b> and of the 102 tests for IA, we obtained 20 (19. 6 %) <b>positive</b> <b>responses.</b> Of the 459 tests for FA performed in Group III, we obtained 39 (84 %) <b>positive</b> <b>responses,</b> and of the 306 for IA, we obtained 52 (16. 9 %) <b>positive</b> <b>responses.</b> The numbers of <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> {{were not significantly different}} between the three groups, but in the D-IBS group, the number of SPT FA responses differed significantly from those for the other two groups (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of cases studied, the higher reactivity to FAs in GroupIcompared to Groups II and III adds new information, and suggests the presence of a possible alteration in intestinal epithelial function...|$|R

40|$|Background: Juvenile myoclonic {{epilepsy}} (JME) {{is characterized}} by myoclonic seizures on awakening and giant somatosensory evoked potentials. Those characteristics suggest that JME is related with dysfunction of the brainstem reticular formation. Cardiovascular reflex is also closely related with the brainstem reticular formation, and head-up tilt-table test (HUT) is frequently employed to evaluate the cardiovascular reflex. We performed HUT to assess the cardiovascular reflex in patients with JME and syncope/presyncope. Methods: We included 52 patients with alleged JME. HUT was performed in 20 of them {{with a history of}} presyncope or syncope. The protocol of HUT included 70 degree table tilting test and isoproterenol infusion test (1 ~ 5 μg/min). We determined the <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> according to the change of blood pressure and heart rate. The <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> were classified as vasodepressive, cardioinhibitory, or mixed types. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical findings and responses of HUT. Results: Syncope or presyncope occurred during the seizure-prone situation in 3 (15 %), and during the syncope-prone situation in 17 (85 %) patients. Fifteen (75 %) patients had <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> in HUT. The <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> were during the baseline test in 1 (5 %), during the low dose (≤ 3 μg/min) of isoproterenol infusion in 10 (50 %), and during the high dose (≥ 4 μg/min) of isoproterenol infusion in the remaining 4 (20 %) patients. All the <b>positive</b> <b>responses</b> were vasodepressive type...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{threat of}} hospital-acquired infections {{persists}} despite {{advances in the}} health care system. A lack of knowledge regarding infection control practices among health care workers decreases compliance with these practices. We conducted a study to assess the knowledge of infection control practices among nursing professionals at our hospital. MethodsIn total, 100 nurses in the intensive care units at our hospital were given a questionnaire with 40 multiple choice questions, including 10 questions each regarding hand hygiene, standard and transmission-based precautions, care bundles and general infection control practices. The responses were scored as percentages. ResultsThe overall knowledge and awareness regarding different infection control practices were excellent (> 90 % <b>positive</b> <b>responses)</b> in 5 % of the nursing professionals, good (80 – 90 % <b>positive</b> <b>responses)</b> in 37 %, average (70 – 80 % <b>positive</b> <b>responses)</b> in 40 % and below average (< 70 % <b>positive</b> <b>responses)</b> in 18 %. ConclusionThe infection control knowledge among the nurses was fairly good; however, there is still a wide scope of improvement with regular educational programs and in-house training...|$|R
