Compared to the former structure, {{new kind of}} structure has many advantages over that of the old structure. The hydraulic driving system in the traditional derrick car is: hydraulic motor drives a reducer, and then the reducer in turn drives a capstan. Another hydraulic driving system is: an axial piston motor and an internal cycloid pinwheel drive are applied, so that the reducer and the capstan are combined into one so that simplified the transmission system. In the third version, a hydraulic motor is applied, which can be considered as the combination of hydraulic motor with axial piston and the <b>planetary</b> <b>reducer</b> and then drives the capstan, so that simplified the transmission system as well. The new kind of hydraulic motor with offset swing planetary drive of bevel gears, which combined the hydraulic motor, the internal <b>planetary</b> <b>reducer</b> with bevel gears, and the capstan together, is the most compact structure. It is of more advantage in the occasion when space is extremely limited.

40|$|Abstract. 3 K {{type and}} 2 K- 2 H type {{planetary}} gear trains {{can be designed}} to have high reduction ratios. Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of planetary gear trains with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K type <b>planetary</b> gear <b>reducer</b> only contain two ring gears and one carrier, hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H type <b>planetary</b> gear <b>reducers.</b> Also, in general, the gear reducers with high reduction ratio are compound gear system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose 2 K type <b>planetary</b> simple gear <b>reducers</b> with high reduction ratios. Based on the concept of train value equation, the kinematic design of 2 K type planetary gear trains with high reduction ratio are synthesized.

40|$|<b>Planetary</b> speed <b>reducers</b> {{are applied}} {{in a wide}} range of applications. Their main {{advantages}} are the compact design and high power density. For this reason, the demand for high effi ciency gearboxes is continuously increasing and this is also why models to predict the additional churning loss, characteris-tic of this kind of gearing, are required. The particular confi guration of the <b>planetary</b> speed <b>reducers,</b> in fact, entails an additional motion with a circular path around the gearbox axis of the planetary gears due to the rotation of the planet carrier on which they are mounted and this induces an additional source of loss. Having effi ciency prediction models allows, in fact, comparison of different solutions during the design step. Literature provides some prediction models for ordinary gears but no models are still avail-able for planetary gears. This report introduces a computational and experimental analysis of this kind of loss. Many simulations have been performed and the infl uence of many operating conditions like lubricant level and temperature and the rotational speed of the planet carrier have been studied.

Multiple gear surfaces share the instantaneous impact loading evenly which make them more resistant to the impact from higher torque.

Also the more and more restric-tive euro standards for the reduction of pollutant emissions from light vehicles impose to improve the effi ciency of the engines but also of the gear transmissions.

40|$|Abstract. The two gears of {{the double}} circular-arc helical gear is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} is close to each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for double circular-arc helical gear (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a double circular-arc helical gear set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new double circular-arc helical gear according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line {{of the double}} circular-arc helical gear and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the double circular-arc helical gear has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth. Thus, the decrease in the driving gears’ number of module and can further increase the reduction gear ratio. For heavily-loaded <b>planetary</b> gear <b>reducer,</b> it’s quite obvious in the miniaturizing and high torque superiority.

40|$|Maurer Engineering {{developed}} special high-temperature geothermal turbodrills for LANL in the 1970 s {{to overcome}} motor temperature limitations. These turbodrills {{were used to}} drill the directional portions of LANL`s Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Wells at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. The Hot Dry Rock concept is to drill parallel inclined wells (35 -degree inclination), hydraulically fracture between these wells, and then circulate cold water down one well and through the fractures and produce hot {{water out of the}} second well. At the time LANL drilled the Fenton Hill wells, the LANL turbodrill was the only motor in the world that would drill at the high temperatures encountered in these wells. It was difficult to operate the turbodrills continuously at low speed due to the low torque output of the LANL turbodrills. The turbodrills would stall frequently and could only be restarted by lifting the bit off bottom. This allowed the bit to rotate at very high speeds, and as a result, there was excessive wear in the bearings and on the gauge of insert roller bits due to these high rotary speeds. In 1998, Maurer Engineering developed an Advanced Geothermal Turbodrill (AGT) for the National Advanced Drilling and Excavation Technology (NADET) at MIT by adding a <b>planetary</b> speed <b>reducer</b> to the LANL turbodrill to increase its torque and reduce its rotary speed.
