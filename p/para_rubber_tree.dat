25|$|South America {{remained}} {{the main source}} of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was heavily protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was a capital offense, although no law prohibited it. Nevertheless, in 1876, Henry Wickham smuggled 70,000 <b>Pará</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> seeds from Brazil and delivered them to Kew Gardens, England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to India, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), Singapore, and British Malaya. Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber. In the early 1900s, the Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced labor. Liberia and Nigeria started production.|$|E
500|$|Latex is {{a sticky}} {{defensive}} secretion that protects plants against herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured {{but the main}} source of the latex used to make natural rubber is the <b>Pará</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> (Hevea brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for which synthetic materials have proved less durable. The latex exuded by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the [...] "getah perca" [...] tree Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely been replaced by synthetic materials.|$|E

500|$|Included in {{the charter}} of these gardens was the {{investigation}} of the local flora for its economic potential to both the colonists and the local people. Many crop plants were introduced by or through these gardensoften in association with European botanical gardens such as Kew or Amsterdamand included cloves, tea, coffee, breadfruit, cinchona, sugar, cotton, palm oil and Theobroma cacao (for chocolate). During these times, the rubber plant was introduced to Singapore. Especially in the tropics, the larger gardens were frequently associated with a herbarium and museum of economy. The Botanical Garden of Peradeniya had considerable influence on the development of agriculture in Ceylon where the <b>Para</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> (...) was introduced from Kew, which had itself imported the plant from South America. Other examples include cotton from the Chelsea Physic Garden to the Province of Georgia in 1732 and tea into India by Calcutta Botanic Garden. The transfer of germplasm between the temperate and tropical botanical gardens was undoubtedly responsible for the range of agricultural crops currently used in several regions of the tropics.|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} rubber plantation litter beetle, Luprops tristis Fabricius 1801 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) was assessed {{in relation to the}} phenology of leaf shedding and defoliation pattern of <b>para</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>trees,</b> Hevea brasiliensis Müll. Arg (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), during a two year study period. The abundance of adults, larvae and pupae per 1 m 2 of litter sample was recorded. Post dormancy beetles appeared in leaf litter following annual leaf shedding, whereas larvae, pupae and teneral adults were present after leaf flush. No stages were recorded from plantations following the summer rains until the annual litter fall in the next season. Parental adults peaked at the time of leaf sprouting and tender leaf fall. Larvae and teneral adults peaked at the time of premature fall of green leaves and flowers. Teneral adults of six age classes were recorded and all entered dormancy irrespective of the feeding time available to each age class. Females outnumbered males in the parent generation, while the sex ratio of new generation adults was not biased towards either sex. The phenological stages of <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> included leaf fall in late December and early January, leaf sprouting and new leaf production in January and flowering in February. All feeding stages of L. tristis peaked in abundance when premature leaves are most abundant in the leaf litter. Prediction of the timing of appearance of various developmental stages of L. tristis in plantations, invasion into buildings and intensity of population build up in rubber belts is possible by tracking the phenology of leaf fall in rubber plantations, time of return of post dormancy adults and the onset of summer rainfall. Perfect synchrony was recorded between the field return of parental adults with annual leaf shedding, the oviposition phase of parental adults with tender leaf fall at the time of leaf sprouting, and larval and teneral adult stages with premature fall of leaves. Premature leaf availability is suggested as contributing to the reproductive efficiency of parental adults, the survival of early developmental stages and of new generation adults during dormancy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Para</b> <b>rubber</b> (Hevea brasiliensis) <b>trees</b> are {{naturally}} {{adapted to the}} Amazonian tropical climate. In India <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> are traditionally cultivated in the warm humid tropics of the south. Northeast India is a non-traditional area for rubber cultivation. A major limiting factor on tree growth in the northeast region is stress due to low temperature. Being a deciduous <b>tree,</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> exhibit annual natural defoliation prior to the winter season, and ensuing new leaf growth usually coincides with the low temperature period. Flushing behaviour of trees during this period provides an opportunity to assess their winter hardiness. A study was carried out on five clones, RRIM 600, SCATC 93 / 114, GT 1, PB 5 / 51 and Haiken 1, to evaluate phenological behaviour of leaf growth {{during the period of}} low temperature stress. Trees were monitored for expansion of leaf area, internode length, petiole length and development of chlorophyll. Wide variation was observed among these clones for all the traits. SCATC 93 / 114 was better adapted for low temperature stress as this clone was found to have faster expansion of leaf area and better chlorophyll development, followed by Haiken 1. PB 5 / 51 was found to show poor performance during low temperature. Haiken 1 and PB 5 / 51 also exhibited better relative growth rate during winter months confirming their low temperature tolerance. Ontogenetic variations in leaf development are good indicators of assessing inherent cold tolerance in Hevea clones. </span...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Para</b> <b>Rubber</b> was an {{economic}} wood growing in Northeast Thailand playing {{economic and social}} role. The objectives of this research were to study: (1) the economic, social and cultural lifestyle and (2) the appropriate adjustment model of agriculturists or farmers growing <b>Para</b> <b>Rubber</b> in Northeast Thailand. Approach: The research area covered 6 provinces: Mahasarakam, Roi-ed, Khon Kaen, Nongkai, Udontani and Loei. The samples were selected by Purposive Sampling including: 90 experts, 60 practitioners and 60 general people. The instruments using for collecting data were: (1) The Interview Form, (2) The Observation Form, (3) Focus Group Discussion and (4) Workshop, investigated by Triangulation. Data were analyzed according to the specified objectives and presented in descriptive analysis. Results: The farmers' lifestyle in traditional period of Northeast Thailand was to earn their living from producing by themselves and sharing resources with each other including: rice farming, farm rice growing, vegetable garden growing, searching for natural food without cost wasting one's capital. When it was period of changing, the price of traditional industrial crop was lowered, the agriculturists began to grow <b>Para</b> <b>Rubber</b> instead since the promotion of governmental industrial section.

30|$|NIR spectroscopy, {{which is}} rapid, inexpensive, {{non-destructive}} and precise technology, {{is one of}} the best methods for the prediction of TSC and DRC. NIR spectroscopy has been investigated in evaluation of wood properties such as chemical components, anatomical or pulping traits and mechanical properties [3 – 8]. Furthermore, Rittiron et al. [9] recently reported that a handheld NIR spectrometer could be useful as an evaluation of moisture content of rubber sheet. Marinho and Monteiro [10] reported the determination of cis- and trans-polyisoprene, which are main chemical components of rubber, using NIR spectroscopy. Sirisomboon et al. [11] reported the accurate prediction of apparent viscosity of <b>Para</b> <b>rubber</b> field latex and concentrated latex over the range of 1000 – 2500  nm.

As time-effective and cost-effective evaluation tool is required in latex processing factory, we investigated the application of ultra violet–near infrared (UV–NIR) spectra of latex collected for the quality control of latex. The UV–NIR spectrophotometer is cheaper and smaller than NIR spectrometer.

40|$|Phloem turgor {{pressure}} (PTP) is the initial driving force for latex flow after a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> is tapped and therefore {{plays an important}} role in <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> latex production.

The aim of this study was to investigate these relations and examine whether PTP can be used as an index for <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clone assessment and tapping system optimization. The results showed that: (1) the daily change of PTP in the foliation season suggests that a high PTP can ensure a high latex yield and tapping could be moved forward to midnight or earlier in the night; (2) the decrease of PTP from the basal to distal stem indicates the benefit of a controlled upward tapping system; (3) the logarithmic increase in PTP with <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> planting age and age-based mean girth suggests that the preferred age for the commencement of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> tapping is eight years; (4) the change of PTP with regenerated bark age suggests that the regenerated bark could be exploited again after the second year; (5) PTP is positively related to the yield potential of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clones; (6) although Ethrel stimulation could not significantly increase the initial PTP of a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> it delays the recovery of PTP after tapping.
