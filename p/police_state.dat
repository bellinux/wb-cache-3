5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until 1944 Guatemala was {{governed by a}} series of authoritarian rulers. Between 1898 and 1920 Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted {{significant}} concessions to the United Fruit Company and dispossessed many indigenous peoples of their communal land. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified, with the institution of brutal labor regulations and the establishment of a <b>police</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a <b>police</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until 1944 Guatemala was {{governed by a}} series of authoritarian rulers who sought to {{strengthen}} the economy by supporting the export of coffee. Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company, an American corporation that traded in tropical fruit, and dispossessed many indigenous people of their communal lands. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified, with the institution of harsh labor regulations and a <b>police</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

5|$|In private, Thơ {{expressed}} his displeasure with Diệm's rule to U.S. officials. He complained of Diệm's reliance on Nhu {{in the running}} of the country, Nhu's attempt to run a <b>police</b> <b>state</b> through his secret Cần Lao apparatus and the lack of success against the Việt Cộng. During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Thơ confided his belief that the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Diệm to reform his policies. He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional.|$|E

Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but {{only one of the}} bucks. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a <b>police</b> <b>state</b> led by the despotic General Woundwort. Holly and the other rabbits dispatched there have managed to return with little more than their lives intact.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Rademacher foresaw {{roles for}} other {{government}} agencies. Ribbentrop's Foreign Affairs Ministry would negotiate {{terms with the}} French for the handover of Madagascar to Germany. It would also {{play a part in}} crafting other treaties to deal with Europe's Jews. Its Information Department, along with Joseph Goebbels and his Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, would control the flow of information at home and abroad. Viktor Brack, a division chief in the Chancellery of the Führer, would oversee transportation. The SS would undertake the expulsion of the Jews from Europe and govern the island as a <b>police</b> <b>state.</b> The Nazis expected that after the invasion of the United Kingdom in Operation Sea Lion that they would commandeer the British merchant fleet to transport the Jews to Madagascar. Many deportees were expected to perish in the harsh conditions or die {{at the hands of the}} SS.|$|E

5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual <b>police</b> <b>state</b> set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1958, Nasser formed a {{tripartite}} committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments in Syria. By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a <b>police</b> <b>state</b> by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected {{to the introduction of}} Egyptian agricultural reform in Syria, as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably. On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis.|$|E
5|$|Rademacher {{recommended}} on 3 June 1940 that Madagascar {{should be}} made available as a destination for the Jews of Europe. With Adolf Hitler's approval, Adolf Eichmann released a memorandum on 15 August 1940 calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years, with the island being governed as a <b>police</b> <b>state</b> under the SS. They assumed that many Jews would succumb to its harsh conditions should the plan be implemented. The plan was not viable due to the British naval blockade. It was postponed after the Nazis lost the Battle of Britain in September 1940, and it was permanently shelved in 1942 with the commencement of the Final Solution, towards which it had functioned as an important psychological step.|$|E

5|$|The SS {{established}} a <b>police</b> <b>state</b> within Nazi Germany, using the secret state police {{and security forces}} under Himmler's control to suppress resistance to Hitler. In his role as Minister President of Prussia, Hermann Göring had in 1933 created a Prussian secret police force, the Geheime Staatspolizei or Gestapo, and appointed Rudolf Diels as its head. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract {{the power of the}} SA, Göring handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934. Also on that date, in a departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler named his deputy and protégé Reinhard Heydrich chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Heydrich also continued as head of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; security service).|$|E
5|$|Thảo's Catholic {{background}} {{helped him}} to avoid detection as a communist. He and his brother were the only {{members of the family}} who were not anti-communist. The remainder of the relatives were followers of Diệm's brother, Archbishop Thục, who had been Bishop of Vĩnh Long during the war against France. Thảo was known to have a face that revealed nothing of his inner feelings. Thục's intervention helped Thảo rise in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Thục put Thảo in touch with Trần Kim Tuyến, {{who was in charge of}} intelligence operations under Diệm's younger brother Nhu, who was the head of the secret police and controlled the ARVN Special Forces. Thảo began as a propagandist for various units of the army and for the secret Catholic Cần lao Party, whose system of informants and secret cells helped create the atmosphere of a <b>police</b> <b>state</b> and maintained the Ngô family's grip on power.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{were made}} {{against the state}} <b>police,</b> <b>state</b> {{government}} and the chief minister Narendra Modi, citing that government authorities were involved and various police personnel {{played a role in}} the massacre: a number of eyewitnesses reported police officers favouring the mob by allegedly injuring or killing Muslims and damaging public and private property. All allegations were proved to be false and the government and police were cleared of wrongdoing by a Special Investigation Team. The initial report on the case was filed by the Gujarat police, accusing 46 people, all of whom the Special Court deemed unreliable. In 2008, the Supreme Court of India formed a Special Investigation Team to investigate the case. In 2009, the team submitted its report, which accused 70 people of wrongdoing, 61 of whom were charged. On 29 August 2012, the Special Court convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 due to insufficient evidence. Among those convicted were Maya Kodnaniformer Cabinet Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat and former Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Narodawho was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment, and Bajrang Dal's Babu Bajrangi, who received a life sentence.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nsara (and all the Muslim nations) becomes {{increasingly}} difficult as {{they face the}} effects of defeat in the war. Since casualties were so massive, {{there is a great}} shortage of men over women and many men who survived the fighting returned as disabled veterans (Budur volunteers to help veterans blinded by gas at a hospital by reading to them). The Muslims were forced to pay reparations to the victorious countries and to make various humiliating concessions such as allowing Buddhist monasteries to open in their cities. There is a general depression and malaise in post-war Muslim society, made worse by the economic difficulties; hyperinflation, food shortages and strikes. In many counties this leads to governments being overthrown in coups of various kinds. In Nsara itself, order begins to break down as people are near starvation and the military attempts to overthrow the government and impose a <b>police</b> <b>state.</b> However many liberals, including Budur and Kirana start mass street protests against this reactionary dictatorship. Eventually the Hodenosaunee League (who have become very powerful after their victory in the war) intervene by sending a fleet (from their naval base at Orkney) to Nsara, insisting that the military relinquish power, which they do. After this, things slowly start to improve, but most of the Muslim states continue to suffer grave problems. Even in China, a victorious country, there is unrest which turns into a civil war.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in Half-Life 2 states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by {{a range of}} species. The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is {{shown to be a}} brutal <b>police</b> <b>state.</b> In City 17, an Eastern European city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains. Vortigaunts, alien creatures from the original Half-Life, are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to , the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds; both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{broached}} {{the subject with}} Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was simultaneously developing a similar scheme. By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop spoke of the Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France. Once he learned of the plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview. Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub-Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year {{for four years and}} abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects of the program. While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a <b>police</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
