40|$|The {{influence}} of spectral bandwidth on the perceptual identifi-cation of fricatives has been studied. Stimuli were CV syllables formed by /T, f, s, S / and /a, e, <b>i,</b> <b>o,</b> u/. Two <b>conditions</b> were tested: 1) isolated fricative noise (C condition), and 2) fricative noise plus 100 ms {{of the following}} vowel (CV condition). Sev-eral low-pass filtered cutoff frequencies (16, 11, 8, 5. 5, 4 and 3 kHz) were considered. Multidimensional scaling provided us with {{a representation of the}} perceptual space of every fricative for every spectral bandwidth which helps us to interpret the re-sults of the experiment. Results show that recognition rates are 10 % higher in the CV condition than in the C condition for the widest bandwidths and approximately 20 % higher for the nar-rowest bandwidths. Fricatives are well identified with a band-width of 6 kHz in the C condition. In the CV condition, band-width can be reduced up to 4 kHz without a significant loss of performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION. Some {{manufacturers}} of reduced oxygen (O 2) breathing devices claim a comparable hypobaric hypoxia (HH) training experience by providing F(sub <b>I)</b> <b>O</b> 2 < 0. 209 {{at or near}} sea level pressure to match the ambient O 2 partial pressure (iso-pO 2) of the target altitude. METHODS. Literature from investigators and manufacturers indicate that these devices may not properly account for the 47 mmHg of water vapor partial pressure that reduces the inspired partial pressure of <b>O</b> 2 (P(sub <b>I)</b> <b>O</b> 2). Nor do they account for the complex reality of alveolar gas composition {{as defined by the}} Alveolar Gas Equation. In essence, by providing iso-pO 2 conditions for normobaric hypoxia (NH) as for HH exposures the devices ignore P(sub A) O 2 and P(sub A) CO 2 as more direct agents to induce signs and symptoms of hypoxia during acute training exposures. RESULTS. There is not a sufficient integrated physiological understanding of the determinants of P(sub A) O 2 and P(sub A) CO 2 under acute NH and HH given the same hypoxic pO 2 to claim a device that provides isohypoxia. Isohypoxia is defined as the same distribution of hypoxia signs and symptoms under any circumstances of equivalent hypoxic dose, and hypoxic pO 2 is an incomplete hypoxic dose. Some devices that claim an equivalent HH experience under NH conditions significantly overestimate the HH condition, especially when simulating altitudes above 10, 000 feet (3, 048 m). CONCLUSIONS. At best, the claim should be that the devices provide an approximate HH experience since they only duplicate the ambient pO 2 at sea level as at altitude (iso-pO 2 machines). An approach to reduce the overestimation is to at least provide machines that create the same P(sub <b>I)</b> <b>O</b> 2 (iso-P(sub <b>I)</b> <b>O</b> 2 machines) <b>conditions</b> at sea level as at the target altitude, a simple software upgrade...|$|R

All {{the samples were}} irradiated with 2 MeV fast electrons. Radiation-produced defects are studied using infrared spectroscopy by monitoring the relevant bands in optical spectra. For the VO defects, it is established that the doping with Ge affects the thermal stability of VO (830 cm - 1) defects {{as well as their}} fraction converted to VO 2 (888 cm - 1) defects. In Ge-free samples containing carbon, it was found that carbon impurity atoms do not affect the thermal stability of VO defects, although they affect the fraction of VO defects that is converted to VO 2 complexes. Considering the oxygen-carbon complexes, it is established that the annealing of the 862 cm - 1 band associated with the C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> defects is accompanied with the emergence of the 1048 cm - 1 band, which has earlier been assigned to the C s <b>O</b> 2 <b>i</b> center.

Ge doping does not seem to affect the thermal stability of the C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> and C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> I defects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the stability of the defect clusters (VO, C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i,</b> C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> I) at an atomic level. Both experimental and theoretical results are consistent with the viewpoint that Ge affects the stability of the VO but does not influence the stability of the oxygen-carbon clusters.

40|$|Abstract. A binary {{sequence}} A = A(0) A(1) [...] . is called infinitely often (<b>i.</b> <b>o.)</b> Turing-autoreducible if A is reducible to itself via an oracle Turing machine that never queries its oracle {{at the current}} input, outputs either A(x) or a don’t-know symbol on any given input x, and outputs A(x) for infinitely many x. If in addition the oracle Turing machine terminates on all inputs and oracles, A is called <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> truth-table-autoreducible. We obtain the somewhat counterintuitive result that every Martin-Löf random sequence, in fact even every rec-random or p-random sequence, is <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> truth-table-autoreducible. Furthermore, we investigate {{the question of how}} dense the set of guessed bits can be when <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> autoreducing a random sequence. We show that rec-random sequences are never <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> truth-table-autoreducible such that the set of guessed bits has positive constant density in the limit and that a similar assertion holds for Martin-Löf random sequences and <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> Turing autoreducibility. On the other hand, we show that for any rational-valued computable function r that goes nonascendingly to zero, any rec-random sequence is <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> truth-table-autoreducible such that on any prefix of length m at least a fraction of r(m) of the m bits in the prefix are guessed. We include a self-contained account of the hat problem, a puzzle that has received some attention outside of theoretical computer science. The hat problem asks for guessing bits of a finite sequence, thus illustrating the notion of <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> autoreducibility in a finite setting. The solution to the hat problem is then used as a module in the proofs of the positive results on <b>i.</b> <b>o.</b> autoreducibility...|$|R
