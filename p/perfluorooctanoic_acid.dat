5|$|Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence {{due to the}} {{strength}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{specimen}} {{banks are}} {{an essential part}} of the infrastructure of environmental sciences. They have various functions: (1) evaluation of governmental environmental policy-making and regulations; (2) a resource for animal health evaluation; (3) research tools to investigate time trends in ecosystems; (4) detection of newly emerging chemicals in the time trends; (5) validations of computer models for environmental phenomena; (6) source identification of contaminants; (7) a tool for food safety; (8) evaluation of genetic selection pressure due to environmental changes. In this review paper, we present a detailed description of the Kyoto University Human Specimen Bank (history, protocol and questionnaires) and provide brief outlines of other representative environmental specimen banks. We then review two illustrative cases in which environmental specimen banks have unveiled insidious contaminations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> <b>acids.</b> Finally, we give a perspective of new functions for environmental specimen banks in the next 20  years...|$|R
40|$|Perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) {{have been}} shown to cause abnormal levels of thyroid hormones (THs) in experimental animals, but the molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here, a fluorescence displacement assay was used to determine the binding affinities of 16 PFASs with two major TH transport proteins, transthyretin (TTR) and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). Most of the tested PFASs bound TTR with relative potency (RP) values of 3 x 10 (- 4) to 0. 24 when compared with that of the natural ligand thyroxine, whereas fluorotelomer alcohols did not bind. Only perfluorotridecanoic acid and perfluorotetradecanoic acid bound TBG, with RP values of 2 x 10 - 4 when compared with that of thyroxine. Based on these results, it was estimated that displacement of T 4 from TTR by perfluorooctane sulfonate and <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> <b>acids</b> would be significant for the occupationally exposed workers but not the general population. Structure-binding analysis revealed that PFASs with a medium chain length and a sulfonate acid group are optimal for TTR binding, and PFASs with lengths longer than 12 carbons are optimal for TBG binding. Three mutant proteins were prepared to examine crucial residues involved in the binding of PFASs to TH transport proteins. TTR with a KI 5 G mutation and TBG with either a R 378 G or R 381 G mutation showed decreased binding affinity to PFASs, indicating that these residues play key roles in the interaction with the compounds. Molecular docking showed that the PFASs bind to TTR with their acid group forming a hydrogen bond with K 15 and the hydrophobic chain towards the interior. PFASs were modeled to bind TBG with their acid group forming a hydrogen bond with R 381 and the hydrophobic chain extending towards R 378. The findings aid our understanding of the behavior and toxicity of PFASs on the thyroid hormone system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Parkersburg is {{on average}} a low-income community, {{with a median}} {{household}} income of $31,876 compared to $41,751 {{for the state of}} West Virginia. Parkersburg is also more impoverished compared to the state, with 24.3% of Parkersburg residents being below the poverty line compared to 18.0% for the state. In 2004, blood tests revealed higher than average concentrations of PFOA in blood serum in residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia. A DuPont Teflon producing plant operated near Parkersburg, and that plant has been identified as the likely source. It was discovered that the DuPont plant had contaminated the local water supply with <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> (PFOA) <b>acid</b> thus residents in the area are advised to drink filtered water for the time being. For decades, studies have suggested that PFOA has been linked to many drinking water supplies and other fluorochemical-containing consumer products which can cause health problems.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perfluorooctanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PFOA) (conjugate base perfluorooctanoate), {{also known}} as C8, is a {{synthetic}} perfluorinated carboxylic acid and fluorosurfactant. One industrial application is as a surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of fluoropolymers. It {{has been used in}} the manufacture of such prominent consumer goods as polytetrafluoroethylene (commercially known as Teflon). PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities. It is also formed by the degradation of precursors such as some fluorotelomers.|$|E

40|$|Numerous organic {{contaminants}} {{are increasingly}} found in U. S. waterways; {{some of these}} pose health hazards to plants, animals, or humans. Removal of some organics by adsorption onto activated carbons is a standard technique used to remediate some waters, depending on the organics involved, and the volume of contaminated water. However, some organic compounds are resilient to removal by some carbons {{for a variety of}} reasons. In this study, the molecular interactions of 1, 4 -dioxane and water with various functional groups known to exist on some activated carbon surfaces (carbonyls, carboxyls, and hydroxyls) were investigated. Additionally, binding energies and Henry 2 ̆ 7 s Law constants were determined for 1, 1 -dichloroethylene (1, 1 -DCE) and <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> (PFOA) <b>acid</b> in all-silica molecular sieve zeolites to predict adsorption affinities in an attempt to design suitable adsorbents for their removal. It is shown that these relatively less demanding calculations are sufficient to reveal favorable and unfavorable sorbate/sorbent combinations, which can ultimately lead to rational selection of remediation systems...|$|R
2500|$|Fluorosurfactants, {{which have}} a polyfluorinated [...] "tail" [...] and a {{hydrophilic}} [...] "head", serve as surfactants because they concentrate at the liquid-air interface due to their lipophobicity. Fluorosurfactants have low surface energies and dramatically lower surface tension. The fluorosurfactants perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PFOA) {{are two of the}} most studied because of their ubiquity, toxicity, and long residence times in humans and wildlife.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began {{investigating}} perfluorinated chemicals {{after receiving}} {{data on the}} global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and PFOS-related product production in May 2000. Perfluorinated compounds produced by 3M were used in non-stick cookware and stain-resistant fabrics. The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFCs from the 1940s to 2002. In response to PFC contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be [...] "cleaned {{through a combination of}} groundwater pump-out wells and soil sediment excavation". The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands. The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing the PFCs, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River. The clean-up cost estimate was $50 to $56 million, funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other {{persistent}} organic pollutants, <b>perfluorooctanoic</b> <b>acid</b> persists indefinitely and {{is completely}} resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The {{only way to}} reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation. In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as [...] "possibly carcinogenic" [...] in humans. One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages {{in the amount of}} $10.5 million. This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA [...] "reasonably and responsibly" [...] based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. [...] However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.|$|E
