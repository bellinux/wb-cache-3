50|$|About 40 {{minutes after}} the aborted launch, the booster and {{spacecraft}} were safed and the service tower raised up to it.

Testing revealed that some <b>plugs</b> came <b>out</b> more easily than others, so they were replaced by different ones that would stay in place properly.|$|R
30|$|Considering the microgridplugs in and <b>plugs</b> <b>out,</b> {{this paper}} proposes a hybrid {{hierarchical}} architecture for MGC control, {{consisting of a}} upper layer using distributed control and a lower layer using centralized control. In the upper layer, each microgrid in an MGC coordinates with others using distributed control based on flexible communication between microgrids, which means there is no centralized controller for the MGC. Meanwhile, the lower layer employs centralized control to manage all units within each microgrid. The advantage of hierarchical architecture lies on combining MGC global targets and each microgrid’s local targets. Meanwhile, distributed optimization in the upper layer can manage microgrid plug-in and plug-out.|$|R
30|$|Microgrid control {{architecture}} can {{be classified}} into three modes: centralized, decentralized and distributed. The centralized control architecture features a control center, which sends control command to all dispatchable units (loads and generators) in the microgrid, and receives information from them. The advantage of this control mode is speedy and accurate control, addressing voltage fluctuations, frequency variation, harmonic distortion [10], and maintaining reliable supply [11]. Efficient centralized control would construct efficient and stable communication links from the control center to every unit. Microgrid plugs in and <b>plugs</b> <b>out,</b> without stable communication links with the control center, which would increase the realization difficulties of the control center.|$|R
6000|$|Tarring Wheels.--Tar is {{absolutely}} essential in a hot country, to mix with the grease that {{is used for the}} wagon-wheels. Grease, alone, melts and runs away like water: the object of the tar is to give consistency to the grease; a very small proportion of tar suffices, but without any at all, a wagon is soon brought to a standstill. It is, therefore, most essential to explorers to have a sufficient quantity in reserve. Tar is also of very great use in hot dry countries for daubing over the wheels, and the woodwork generally, of wagons. During extreme heat, when the wood is ready to crack, all the paint should be scraped off it, and the tar applied plentifully. It will soak in deeply, and preserve the wood in excellent condition, both during the drought and the ensuing wet season. (See [...] "Tar, to make.") It is not necessary to take off the wheels in order to grease the axles. It is sufficient to bore an auger-hole right through the substance of the nave, between the feet of two of the spokes, and to keep a plug in the hole. Then, when you want to tar a wheel, turn it till the hole is uppermost, take the <b>plug</b> <b>out,</b> and pour in the tar.|$|E
6000|$|Towards the {{beginning}} of this century, in the vigorous times of the old French wars, there was a Monsieur Appert, who had his attention directed to the preservation of things that ordinarily perish, such as meats and vegetables, and in fact he laid the foundation of our modern method of preserving meats; and he found that if he boiled any of these substances and then tied them so as to exclude the air, that they would be preserved for any time. He tried these experiments, particularly with the must of wine and with the wort of beer; and he found that if the wort of beer had been carefully boiled and was stopped {{in such a way that}} the air could not get at it, it would never ferment. What was the reason of this? That, again, became the subject of a long string of experiments, with this ultimate result, that if you take precautions to prevent any solid matters from getting into the must of wine or the wort of beer, under these circumstances--that is to say, if the fluid has been boiled and placed in a bottle, and if you stuff the neck of the bottle full of cotton wool, which allows the air to go through and stops anything of a solid character however fine, then you may let it be for ten years and it will not ferment. But if you take that <b>plug</b> <b>out</b> and give the air free access, then, sooner or later fermentation will set up. And there is no doubt whatever that fermentation is excited only by the presence of some torula or other, and that that torula proceeds in our present experience, from pre-existing torulae. These little bodies are excessively light. You can easily imagine what must be the weight of little particles, but slightly heavier than water, and not more than the two-thousandth or perhaps seven-thousandth of an inch in diameter. They are capable of floating about and dancing like motes in the sunbeam; they are carried about by all sorts of currents of air; the great majority of them perish; but one or two, which may chance to enter into a sugary solution, immediately enter into active life, find there the conditions of their nourishment, increase and multiply, and may give rise to any quantity whatever of this substance yeast. And, whatever may be true or not be true about this [...] "spontaneous generation," [...] as it is called in regard to all other kinds of living things, it is perfectly certain, as regards yeast, that it always owes its origin to this process of transportation or inoculation, if you like so to call it, from some other living yeast organism; and so far as yeast is concerned, the doctrine of spontaneous generation is absolutely out of court. And not only so, but the yeast must be alive in order to exert these peculiar properties. If it be crushed, if it be heated so far that its life is destroyed, that peculiar power of fermentation is not excited. Thus we have come to this conclusion, as the result of our inquiry, that the fermentation of sugar, the splitting of the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid, glycerine, and succinic acid, is the result of nothing but the vital activity of this little fungus, the torula.|$|E

30|$|Microgrids {{are usually}} capable of both islanded and {{grid-connected}} operation, and being autonomous to switch between these states, {{which is called}} as—plug-in or plug-out [8]. It is a difficult problem {{how to deal with}} microgrid plugs in and <b>plugs</b> <b>out</b> in MGC in real operating time. Chen proposed microgrid economic scheduling and developed a mathematical model [9], based on the integration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), that may be solved using a generic optimisation algorithm. Whereas, the problem of microgrid plug-in and plug-out in a MGC would not be solved in [9]. A solution to this problem is expected to be found on a feasible control architecture in MGCs. The following section lists control architectures used for microgrids and considers their suitability for controlling MGCs.|$|R

50|$|However, the {{electrical}} <b>plugs</b> turned <b>out</b> {{to not be}} the only problem with the booster. Examination of telemetry also showed that the Titan had actually began experiencing thrust decay before the <b>plug</b> dropped <b>out.</b> Engine No. 1 was unaffected and nearly reached 100% thrust at shutdown, while Engine No. 2 never transitioned to in-flight performance levels. Engineers spent all night combing through the first stage, but failed to find any cause for the thrust decay. Eventually however, one technician identified the problem, which was a plastic dust cover inside the gas generator that had been carelessly left inside when the booster was assembled months earlier at the Martin-Marietta plant, blocking the flow of oxidizer. The cover was removed and the Titan II cleared for another launch attempt.|$|R
