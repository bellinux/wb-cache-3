The concentrations of: As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni, Fe i Cu in grasses grown on two media were compared. Grass samples have been collected in tillering stage, {{when they were in}} full development. During the vegetative period three replications cut was conducted at about 3 - 5 cm height, imitating mowing and grazing. The concentrations of As and Ni were elevated in media samples collected from TENT A ash deposit, while the level of all studied elements in soil samples collected from cultivated land were within allowed limits. The variance of certain elements amounts in plant material collected from TENT A ash deposit was less homogeneous; the concentrations of As, Fe and Ni were higher in grasses collected from ash deposit, but Pb and Cu concentrations were higher in grasses grown on cultivated land. The concentrations of Zn were approximately the same in plants collected from the sites, whereas Cd concentrations were slightly increased in grasses grown on ash deposit. In general, it can be concluded from {{the results of this study}} that the concentrations of heavy metals in plants collected from both sites do not exceed maximal tolerant levels for fodder.

The document has {{to be seen in}} the light of the preface which describes the objectives of the document and its use. This BREF document has two parts, one for the cement industry and one for the lime industry, which each have 7 chapters according to the general outline. Cement industry Cement is a basic material for building and civil engineering construction. Output from the cement industry is directly related to the state of the construction business in general and therefore tracks the overall economic situation closely. The production of cement in the European Union stood at 172 million tonnes in 1995, equivalent to about 12 % of world production. After mining, grinding and homogenisation of raw materials; the first step in cement manufacture is calcination of calcium carbonate followed by burning the resulting calcium oxide together with silica, alumina, and ferrous oxide at high temperatures to form clinker. The clinker is then ground or milled together with gypsum and other constituents to produce cement. Naturally occurring calcareous deposits such as limestone, marl or chalk provide the source for calcium carbonate. Silica, iron oxide and alumina are found in various ores and minerals, such as sand, shale, clay and iron ore. <b>Power</b> <b>station</b> <b>ash,</b> blast furnace slag, and other process residues can also be used as partial replacements for the natural raw materials. To produce 1 tonne of clinker the typical average consumption of raw materials in the EU is 1. 57 tonnes. Most of the balance is lost from the process as carbon dioxide emission to air in the calcination reaction (CaCO 3 → CaO + CO 2). The cement industry is an energy intensive industry with energy typically accounting for 30 - 40 % of production costs (i. e. excluding capital costs). Various fuels can be used to provide the heat required for the process. In 1995 the most commonly used fuels were petcoke (39 %) and coal (36 %) followed by different types of waste (10 %), fuel oil (7 %), lignite (6 %) and ga...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{environmental}} impact of trace elements, in particular selenium in the selenite form, from the discharge of ash dam water from Vales Point Power Station into Wyee Bay on Lake Macquarie New South Wales Australia is of concern, and {{has been the subject}} of a number of scientific investigations. These include both control of discharge and studies of effects on aquatic flora and fauna including the biomagnification or bioaccumulation and biotransference of selenium in fish and benthic organisms. Cost-effective and efficient chemical control of trace elements discharged to the environment is at the core of this study. Measures to control the quantity and quality of ash water discharges from Vales Point Power Station has been proactively managed by the electricity generation industry over the past decade in the form of plant modifications and reduction in catchment inflows. Studies have been undertaken looking at a range of treatment options inclusive of precipitation (coagulation/flocculation), bioreactors and oxidised metallic iron. The latter treatment and sole focus of this thesis has been found to potentially the most viable treatment option owing to its high efficiency of removal of selenium and other trace elements including arsenic, vanadium, antimony, chromium and to a lesser extent aluminium and molybdenum. Metallic iron was found to be the most viable treatment option owing to its availability, low cost and minimum operating and maintenance requirements. Pilot plant investigations undertaken at Vales Point Power Station from 2002 to 2008 exploring the use of a number of iron products including iron bars, steel plates and steel wool revealed that the iron oxides and oxyhydroxides formed on the surface of metallic iron and responsible for the core processes of adsorption and coprecipitation of selenium and targeted trace elements were goethite, lepidocrocite, hematite and magnetite. Characterisation of these iron oxides and oxyhydroxides formed by the pilot plant employed X-Ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscope Imagery, involving comparisons with synthetic samples. The efficiency of selenium and trace element removal was found to be influenced by a number of parameters inclusive of surface area of metallic iron, crystal structure and surface area of iron oxiedes and oxyhydroxides formed on the iron surface, pH, solution matrix and concentration of targeted trace elements in ash water. Pilot plant test results with loosely packed steel wool over a six month period yielded the highest efficiency of removal owing to its high surface area with selenium reduced by 85 % (on average), arsenic by 87 %, antimony by 87 %, chromium by 80 %, vanadium by 97 %, aluminium by 21 % and molybdenum by 48 %. Adsorbed ions are generally not leached under natural environmental conditions over extended periods of time. Leachate studies of oxidised material from pilot plant operations were performed during 2003 - 2004. Samples stored with ash water over extended periods exhibited very little redissolution in the case of selenium, arsenic, antimony and aluminium with some test results indicating only 1 % redissolution back into solution. Molybdenum was the only trace element that did display limited leaching with final levels being two to three times that in the initial ash water. Further studies in 2007 and 2008 by the USEPA Method 1311 leaching procedure provided no detectable levels of selenium, arsenic, antimony, chromium, vanadium and molybdenum. The only element which had modest levels above the detection limit was aluminium. The surface area measured for synthetic commercial samples of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides of goethite, hematite, lepidocrocite and magnetite differed, and influenced removal efficiency. Test results of laboratory trials with solution matrices and ash water yielded overall efficiency of removal of selenite with each oxide in the following order: lepidocrocite>goethite>hematite>magnetite. During laboratory trials at pH 8 and above, all systems displayed the folowing efficiency of removal of selenite in terms of the matrix of the solution: ash water > sodium chloride solution > sodium sulphate solution > demineralised water. This is an important aspect as the pH of Vales Point <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> <b>ash</b> water fluctuated between 7. 5 and 8. 5 in the pilot plant trails, whereby high efficiency of trace element removal was achievable. The rate profiles during laboratory trials for selenium, arsenic, chromium, vanadium, antimony, aluminium and molybdenum revealed that, overall, these trace elements were very rapidly adsorbed with the observed half-life of the initial process being in the order of one to two minutes. This rapid uptake highlights the benefits of this process, which can successfully deal with large flowing volumes for extended periods without reaching uptake capacity. Overall, this research has exposed mechanistic aspects of the chemistry involved in iron-based trace element removal, and highlighted the beneficial nature of the process as being a highly efficient low-cost option for the treatment of process water (ash water) in high salinity or estuarine waters for the removal of trace elements of concern to the receiving environment such as selenium and arsenic...|$|E

It is a fact that coal {{combustion}} yields enormous quantities of fly ash some of which are either hydraulically placed or dry dumped. The current study attempts to provide a comprehensive characterisation of a disused alkaline fine coal ash dam (FCAD) towards assessing environmental impact, rehabilitation and utilisation potential. Fine coal ash refers to a combination of approximately 83 % <b>power</b> <b>station</b> fly <b>ash</b> and 17 % gasification and bottom ash fines (particles < 250 lm) at SASOL Synfuels. The hydration products found in Weathered Fine Coal Ash (WFCA) using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) are analcime, calcite, C–S–H gel, ettringite, hydrated gehlenite (Strätlingite), magnetite, periclase, pyrrhotite and sillimanite. High resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) results provide additional proof that hydration products are present in WFCA. No indication of appreciable leaching was given by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) results except calcium and silicon. Thus evidence exists that pollutants from saline brines are immobilised in WFCA and an insight of reaction kinetics was obtained. High content of amorphous phase and lack of alteration in some geotechnical properties suggest that WFCA can be reutilised with lime addition to increase alkalinity and activate pozzolanic reactions. The authors would like to thank SASOL Technology R&D (Pty) Ltd for sponsoring this project...|$|R
40|$|This article {{results from}} an ongoing {{investigation}} aimed at {{developing a new}} validated test-design procedure for the accurate prediction of pressure drop for dense-phase pneumatic conveying of powders. Models for combined pressure drop coefficient (“K”) for solids-gas mixture were derived using the concept of “suspension density” by using the steady-state “straight pipe” pressure drop data between two different tapping locations of the same pipe and also for two different diameter pipes. It was observed that the derived models were different depending on the location of tapping points (for the same pipe) and selected pipe diameters. The derived models were then evaluated by predicting the pressure drop for pipelines with various diameters or lengths (69 mm I. D. × 168 m, 105 mm I. D. × 168 m, 69 mm I. D. × 554 m) for the conveying of <b>power</b> <b>station</b> fly <b>ash.</b> A comparison between the predicted pneumatic conveying characteristics (PCC) and the experimental plots showed that the models resulted in significant over-predictions. In {{the second part of}} the article, the “system” approach of scaleup was evaluated. “Total” pipeline pressure drop characteristics for test-rig pipelines were scaled up to predict the PCC for larger/longer pipes. It was found that the “system” approach generally resulted in grossly inaccurate predictions. It was concluded that further studies are needed for a better understanding of the solids-gas flow mechanism under dense-phase conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} and {{utilization of the}} industrial wastes and by-products {{in the construction industry}} is a key issue from an environmental and economic point of view. The increased use of lignite has substantially increased the available quantities of lignite fired power plant fly ash, which can be mainly classified as class C fly ash. The utilization of such raw material however has some difficulties. In the present paper lignite fired <b>power</b> <b>station</b> fly <b>ash</b> and metallurgical converter slag were used for the production of geopolymer concrete. The fly ash was used as a geopolymer based binder material, and a converter slag as aggregate, thus created a geopolymer concrete which contains mainly industrial wastes. As preliminary test experimental series were carried out using andesite as aggregate. The optimal aggregate/binder ratio was determined. The effect of the amount of alkaline activator solution in the binder, the aggregate type on the geopolymer concretes’ compressive strength and density was investigated. Furthermore, the physical properties - freeze-thaw resistance and particle size distribution - of the applied aggregates were measured as well. As a result of the experiments it was found that physical properties of the andesite and converter slag aggregate was close. Therefore andesite can be replaced by converter slag in the concrete mixture. Additionally, geopolymer concrete with nearly 20 MPa compressive strength was produced from class C fly ash and converter slag...|$|R
