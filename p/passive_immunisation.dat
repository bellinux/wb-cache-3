In patients with an impaired immune system the prevalence of HBsAg is even higher and the course of hepatitis B infection is often aggravated. In HIV/HBV co-infected patients, liver related morbidity and mortality can be reduced by implementing highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) that contains substances active against HBV. Reactivation of HBV during chemotherapy may occur in HBsAg positive patients but can even occur in serologically recovered anti-HBc positive, HBsAg negative patients resulting in high mortality from liver disease. HBsAg positive patients irrespective of HBV DNA levels should receive preemptive treatment with HBV polymerase inhibitors which should be continued for 12 months after cessation of chemo- and or immunosuppressive therapy.

40|$|To {{examine the}} timing and {{duration}} of RSV bronchiolitis hospital admission among term and preterm infants in England and to identify risk factors for bronchiolitis admission. A population-based birth cohort with follow-up to age 1 year, using the Hospital Episode Statistics database. 71 hospitals across England. We identified 296618 individual birth records from 2007 / 08 and linked to subsequent hospital admission records {{during the first year}} of life. In our cohort there were 7189 hospital admissions with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, 24. 2 admissions per 1000 infants under 1 year (95 %CI 23. 7 - 24. 8), of which 15 % (1050 / 7189) were born preterm (47. 3 bronchiolitis admissions per 1000 preterm infants (95 % CI 44. 4 - 50. 2)). The peak age group for bronchiolitis admissions was infants aged 1 month and the median was age 120 days (IQR =  61 - 209 days). The median length of stay was 1 day (IQR =  0 - 3). The relative risk (RR) of a bronchiolitis admission was higher among infants with known risk factors for severe RSV infection, including those born preterm (RR =  1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 2. 0) compared with infants born at term. Other conditions also significantly increased risk of bronchiolitis admission, including Down's syndrome (RR =  2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 3. 7) and cerebral palsy (RR =  2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 4. 0). Most (85 %) of the infants who are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis in England are born at term, with no known predisposing risk factors for severe RSV infection, although risk of admission is higher in known risk groups.

40|$|SUMMARY. Serological {{investigation}} of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus revealed a new antigen to which antibody in high titre {{is present in the}} serum of many mammalian species. The passive haemolysis test showed that antibody, in titres ranging from 32 - 4096, was invariably present in the serum of mice, rats, guinea-pigs, and horses. Rabbits and human beings had lower and more variable titres (< 2 - 512). The antigen persisted after prolonged hydrolysis of the LPS in 1 % acetic acid at 100 °C. Acinetobacter lipid A, which resembled antigenically the lipid A of many gram-negative bacteria, could be distinguished from the new antigen by inhibition and absorption experiments. Antibody to the new antigen could be completely absorbed with acinetobacter lipid A but not with enterobac-terial lipid A; moreover, the latter failed to react with the antibody in the <b>passive</b> haemolysis test. <b>Immunisation</b> of rabbits with lipid A-immuno-genic acinetobacter cells gave rise to antibodies against the new antigen and to lipid-A antibodies.

This setback highlights the need for new approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions. Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases. However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling approaches in many areas of biomedical research.

40|$|Active {{immunisation}} against GnRH inhibits reproductive function by inducing a hypogonadotropic condition {{associated with}} gonadal atrophy. Despite economic, ethical and environmental advantages of GnRH immunisation in cattle over conventional castration methods, {{the technology has}} not yet been commercially adopted. Primarily because of the requirement for numerous booster vaccinations because of the reversibility of physiological effects, the commercial efficacy of immunocastration is currently poor. However, neonatal GnRH immunisation in sheep can result in a permanent suppression of reproduction (Brown et al., 1994; 1995; Clarke et al., 1998). These findings and a study in pigs (Molenaar et al., 1993) indicate that, the hypothalamic/pituitary gland unit (HPU) may be particularly susceptible to GnRH antibodies during a specific window of development in the pre-pubertal animal, but no long-term studies in cattle have been conducted. Therefore the primary objective of this project was to determine the effect of neonatal immunisation against GnRH in cattle. Beef cross bull (n= 9; Chapter 3) and heifer calves (n= 9; Chapter 4) were vaccinated against a newly developed (Pfizer®) GnRH construct vaccine at - 2, 6 and 13 weeks of age. Nine calves of each sex served as negative controls, receiving saline injections only. The GnRH vaccine had proved effective (Dr. A. R. Peters, personnel communication 2000) in inducing immune responses and reducing variation between animals in unpublished industrial studies, compared to earlier vaccines, and hence was reasoned to be capable of raising GnRH antibodies despite the relative immaturity of the neonatal immune system. Following vaccination, circulating GnRH antibodies and reproductive hormones, such as FSH (Chapters 3 and 4), testosterone (Chapter 3), progesterone (to assess onset of puberty) and oestradiol (Chapter 4) were measured and additional intensive serial bleeds were carried out to assess LH parameters up to and beyond puberty (puberty defined by testes circumference in bulls). Gonadal (antral follicles and testes growth) and accessory gland development was quantified throughout the trial using ultrasound scanning. Sexual behaviour (Chapter 3) was studied from 38 weeks of age, while an assessment of sperm quality (Chapter 3), and anabolic response to vaccination was also performed post-mortem (Chapters 3 and 4). GnRH immunisation in neonatal calves did not permanently impair reproduction. A temporary suppression in reproductive function was evident through the disruption of pituitary gland function, as indicated by a reduction of LH pulse amplitude and mean plasma LH concentrations (Chapters 3 and 4). In addition, a reduction in medium- sized follicle numbers, testes growth, plasma testosterone concentration, vesicular gland length and juvenile aggression occurred. Some beneficial anabolic effects were observed e. g., carcass composition grades. Changes all occurred subsequent to increased GnRH antibody titres in immunised cattle. Despite some evidence of prolonged effects on LH amplitude and circulating testosterone after anti-GnRH titres had dissipated, all inhibited parameters, except carcass quality, returned to levels comparable to control animals by 72 weeks of age. No treatment effects on FSH concentrations, large follicle numbers, reproductive tracts (post mortem) or peri- and post-pubertal behaviours were observed following treatment. Sperm morphological abnormalities tended to be more prevalent in GnRH immunised bulls. A significant increase in GnRH antibody titres occurred at - 23 weeks of age (Chapter 4), this may have been a rebound in antibody titre, possibly caused by an anti-idiotype immune response (antibody response to GnRH antibodies), or due to significant maturational changes in immune function at this time causing a delayed response to vaccination. Alternatively a novel "auto-immune" response may have been detected, which if confirmed/repeatable might be incorporated into an immunisation protocol to act as a "self-booster". However, no previous reports of such an event have been published and further investigation is urgently required. A more prolonged or permanent suppression of reproductive function may be possible following an earlier, greater and more sustained elevation of antibody titres during the neonatal period. Further development of GnRH vaccines and/or protocols (prime-boost, cytokine modulation vaccines, concomitant <b>passive</b> and active <b>immunisation</b> and pregnant cow GnRH vaccination), and studies of performance and GnRH antibody mechanism(s) of action in cattle are required. Chapters 3 and 4 provide a comprehensive study on pubertal development and neonatal GnRH vaccination, thus contributing significantly to knowledge in these fields. Currently, the vaccine used in this trial may be used to delay puberty in older calves or transiently suppress reproductive function to aid management. The economical viability of animal production systems such as beef and lamb are closely related to rates of reproduction. The Fec B gene in ewes increases ovulation rate and litter size, possibly through the development of precocious follicles, which can switch their primary dependence from FSH to LH. As a result, more follicles are selected to continue growth to an ovulatory size. The precise mechanisms by which these processes occur have recently been shown to involve oocyte follicle interactions (see section 1. 1. 5). Follicle development is modulated by GHIIGF and inhibin, however attempts to increase follicular development and ovulation through active inhibin immunisation alone have been variable and hence not commercially attractive. To develop successful protocols to induce twin ovulations in cows· and ewes, without superovulation, a clearer, more details understanding of follicullogenesis is required. The objective of the current study was to better understand these mechanisms through investigating interactions of GH/GF and inhibin in the ovary, follicle development, steroidogenesis, and receptor populations using an anoestrous sheep model. Spring born Mule x Charolais ewe lambs were actively immunised (n= 8) against porcine inhibin α-C 1 - 26 peptide conjugated to KLH in NUFCA (primary and 3 boosters (NUFA», while 8 served as negative controls. Seven days following the final booster, the ewes were subdivided to give four groups: (1) controls + saline (n= 4); (2) controls + rbGH (4 ml s. c; 1 mg. mr 1; n= 4); (3) inhibin immunised + saline (n= 4); and (4) immunised + rbGH (n= 4). Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) was given (Lm.) for 6 days. On day 4 GnRH (Receptal®; 1 ml) was injected s. c, to all animals to initiate {{the beginning of a new}} follicular wave. Blood samples were collected fortnightly to measure inhibin antibody titres, IGF-I, FSH and steroids. On the seventh day ensuing slaughter serum antibodies and ovaries were harvested. Left ovaries were intended for ISH (mRNA for P 450 arom) and/or immunohistochemical analysis. Follicles from right ovaries were dissected out, counted, measured and cultured in M 199 at 37 °C for 2 hours. Culture media was then assayed for oestradiol. Follicle shells were stored at - 180 °C for LH receptor binding studies. This work reports on the influence of different treatments on follicle populations. All immunised animals produced antibodies, which bound to 1251 -inhibin. Using ANOVA to compare treatments it was observed that, Inhibin immunisation significantly (P 3. 5 mm in diameter, but did not affect the smaller 3. 5 mm follicle numbers. These findings are in agreement with previous research. The molecular studies of left ovaries are not presented herein as due to time constraints the work was not completed and is currently on going. In conclusion, additional results of this study are required to meet the objectives of the experiment. Further research is required on dominant follicle selection if superovulatory programmes in both livestock and humans are to be more precisely controlled and readily accepted. An increased twinning rate in beef suckler cows is acknowledged as an optimal means of improving production efficiency (Diskin et al, 1987), and preliminary observations (Campbell, Webb and Gong, unpublished) suggests that following oestrous cycle synchronisation, a <b>passive</b> inhibin <b>immunisation</b> protocol gives a more predictable twin ovulation response than active inhibin vaccination. Therefore, using inhibin antiserum raised in ewes (Chapter 5), the final thesis objective was to investigate the efficacy of a bolus and booster antiserum administration protocol in heifers and the effects of <b>passive</b> inhibin <b>immunisation</b> on hormone parameters (FSH and progesterone), folliculogenesis (in vivo) ovulation rate and conception. Beef cross heifers (n= 18; used earlier in Chapter 4 study) were randomly allocated to receive inhibin antiserum or NSS (controls). Following the Chapter 4 study, and 4 months summer break at pasture, heifers were considered to be exhibiting typical cyclic reproductive function based on hormone measurements and scanning of ovaries. Oestrous cycles' were synchronised using 2 injections (Lm.) of PG 11 days apart and antiserum 'bolus' (108 ml) was injected into the jugular vein 4 days after 2 nd PG treatment. Subsequently, at 24 h intervals for 5 days 14 ml booster infusions were administered. Five days after ovulation, as confirmed by twice daily scanning, a 3 rd PG was given and 72 and 96 h later, heifers were A. 1. Blood samples were collected every 8 hours from 2 nd PG to 2 nd A. 1. Dominant follicle number and ovulation rate was unaffected by treatment due to inadequate inhibin antibodies in antiserum compared with the earlier trial (Campbell, Webb and Gong, unpublished), however, recruited follicle numbers were enhanced in inhibin immunised heifers. In addition, further evidence that inhibin antibodies act at the ovarian level to enhance recruitment, or reduce atresia was provided, as FSH concentrations were similar between groups. Higher inhibin antibody titre may be necessary to over-ride the strong dominant follicle selection mechanism in heifers. In addition, the results of this and a previous trial demonstrate that a threshold inhibin antibody titre range is required to obtain a reproducible increase in ovulation rate on which future <b>passive</b> inhibin <b>immunisation</b> studies may be based. Finally, this approach of a bolus followed by subsequent small antiserum injections has successfully been shown to give a steady and consistent concentration of circulating inhibin antibody titres...|$|R

An immunodominant epitope shares sequence homology with a peptide found on bacterial adhesion protein fimH (Kain et aI., Manuscript in Preparation).

40|$|Due to the omnipresent risk of epidemics, insect {{societies}} have evolved sophisticated disease defences {{at the individual}} and colony level. An intriguing yet little understood phenomenon is that social contact to pathogen-exposed individuals reduces susceptibility of previously naive nestmates to this pathogen. We tested whether such social immunisation in Lasius ants against the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is based on active upregulation {{of the immune system}} of nestmates following contact to an infectious individual or passive protection via transfer of immune effectors among group members [...] that is, active versus <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation.</b> We found no evidence for involvement of <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation</b> via transfer of antimicrobials among colony members. Instead, intensive allogrooming behaviour between naive and pathogen-exposed ants before fungal conidia firmly attached to their cuticle suggested passage of the pathogen from the exposed individuals to their nestmates. By tracing fluorescence-labelled conidia we indeed detected frequent pathogen transfer to the nestmates, where they caused low-level infections as revealed by growth of small numbers of fungal colony forming units from their dissected body content. These infections rarely led to death, but instead promoted an enhanced ability to inhibit fungal growth and an active upregulation of immune genes involved in antifungal defences (defensin and prophenoloxidase, PPO). Contrarily, there was no upregulation of the gene cathepsin L, which is associated with antibacterial and antiviral defences, and we found no increased antibacterial activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed ants. This indicates that social immunisation after fungal exposure is specific, similar to recent findings for individual-level immune priming in invertebrates. Epidemiological modeling further suggests that active social immunisation is adaptive, as it leads to faster elimination of the disease and lower death rates than <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation.</b> Interestingly, humans have also utilised the protective effect of low-level infections to fight smallpox by intentional transfer of low pathogen doses ("variolation" or "inoculation") ...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{a severe}} age-related {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{and is the}} most common form of dementia. Although the pathogenesis of AD remains unknown, the deterioration of the cerebrovascular system constitutes a risk factor associated with the development of the disease. Notably, brain hypoperfusion, a feature of healthy ageing brain and AD, occurs prior to the onset of cognitive decline in AD and correlates with the severity of dementia. Although there is a clear link between hypoperfusion and cognitive alterations in AD, a causal relationship remains to be established. It was hypothesised that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion leads to the accumulation of parenchymal and vascular amyloid-β (Aβ), triggering the development of vascular lesion (microinfarcts (MIs) and haemorrhages) and altering the neurovascular unit (NVU) integrity. Second to this, it was hypothesised that reductions in Aβ levels by immunotherapy targeted to amyloid in young mice, reduce amyloid levels, and prevent vascular lesions improving cognitive performance. Three studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. In the first study, the aim was to characterise age-dependent changes in amyloidrelated pathology in a transgenic mouse model (Tg-SwDI). The temporal amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, accumulation of parenchymal and cerebrovascular Aβ and Aβ-related microglial and astrocytic activation in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of the Tg-SwDI mice at 3, 6 and 9 months of age was compared to wild-type controls. Significantly higher APP expression (p < 0. 05), as well as Aβ aggregation (p < 0. 001) as the animals aged was found in the Tg-SwDI mice in all the brain regions analysed, which was accompanied by extensive and progressive activation of microglial (p < 0. 001) and astrocytic (p < 0. 01) cells. These data provided a basis to design the next studies, as it was planned to induce hypoperfusion in these mice before significant Aβ deposition occurs. In the second study, the aim was to investigate the effect of hypoperfusion on Aβ dynamics and subsequently, to study the contribution of hypoperfusion and Aβ pathology to the development of MIs and haemorrhages, and to the potential alteration of astrocyte and tight junction (TJ) integrity. To address this, mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was induced in Tg-SwDI and wild-type mice by bilateral common carotid stenosis for 1 and 3 months. A significant increase in soluble Aβ 40 / 42 levels was initially found after 1 month of hypoperfusion in the parenchyma (Aβ 40, p = 0. 0239; Aβ 42 p = 0. 0198) in parallel with elevated APP levels and APP proteolytic cleavage products (p < 0. 05). Thereafter, following 3 months, a significant increase in insoluble Aβ 40 / 42 levels was determined in the parenchyma (Aβ 40, p = 0. 0024; Aβ 42 p = 0. 008) and vasculature (Aβ 40, p = 0. 0046; Aβ 42 p = 0. 0118) of Tg-SwDI mice. There was no change in the levels of Aβ co-localised to vessels following 1 month of hypoperfusion; however Aβ levels were significantly increased in cerebral vessels after 3 months (p = 0. 0483). The proportion of Aβ containing vessels was significantly higher in the small vessels of the hypoperfused animals compared to sham mice (p < 0. 05). MIs associated with microglial proliferation were present in the Tg-SwDI mice and the burden was exacerbated by hypoperfusion at 1 and 3 months (p < 0. 05). Significantly higher levels of NADPH Oxidase- 2 (NOX 2) were found in the transgenic mice compared to the wild-type controls at both time-points analysed (p < 0. 05), and this was exacerbated after 1 month of hypoperfusion in the Tg-SwDI mice (p < 0. 05). There was a positive correlation between NOX 2 and soluble parenchymal Aβ levels (r = 0. 6643, p = 0. 0019). A minimal effect on the development of haemorrhages at these time-points was observed. In parallel to this, astrocyte activation was significantly higher in the Tg-SwDI mice compared to the wild-type controls at both time-points studied (p < 0. 05); however, no effect of hypoperfusion was observed. Also, significantly higher levels of aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) in the Tg-SwDI mice compared to the wild-type controls following 1 month of hypoperfusion were found (p < 0. 001). There was a positive correlation between AQP 4 and soluble parenchymal Aβ levels (r = 0. 4735, p = 0. 0095). Claudin- 5 levels were significantly higher in the Tg-SwDI mice compared to the wild-type controls at both time-points analysed (p < 0. 0001), and this was exacerbated following 1 month of hypoperfusion in the transgenic model (p < 0. 05). A positive correlation between claudin- 5 and vascular Aβ levels was observed (r = 0. 6113, p = 0. 0004). Together, these data suggest a synergistic contribution of amyloid and hypoperfusion pathologies to the tissue damage and implicate a role of oxidative stress and inflammation. In the third study, the aim was to determine the effects of <b>passive</b> amyloid <b>immunisation</b> on Aβ levels, development of MIs and haemorrhages and behavioural performance in the Tg-SwDI mice. To address this, the mice underwent weekly intraperitoneal injections with either 3 D 6 or 10 D 5 antibodies during 3 months. Although there were no significant changes between control and 10 D 5 / 3 D 6 treated mice in amyloid levels, appearance of MIs and cognitive performance, it was noted that there was a trend towards a reduction in amyloid levels and MI area in the 10 D 5 / 3 D 6 treated mice compared to the control animals. Furthermore, there was no evidence of microhaemorrhages in response to the immunisation. These results demonstrate that Aβ immunotherapy with the antibodies 3 D 6 and 10 D 5 may potentially decrease parenchymal and vascular amyloid accumulation, reducing the appearance of MIs and notably without triggering the development of microhaemorrhages. Collectively, the findings presented in the current thesis demonstrate that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion increases parenchymal and vascular Aβ levels and point towards a mechanism in which the cascade of events including inflammation and oxidative stress, triggered synergistically by hypoperfusion and Aβ, resulted in the widespread development of MIs and NVU changes which may further induce the alteration of cognition networks. A mixed therapy, aimed at improving cerebrovascular health and targeting the accumulation of Aβ, represents a promising strategy to prevent neurodegenerative processes and further cognitive decline in AD...|$|R

Blood samples for analysing markers of hepatitis B virus were available at 1 year from 147 of the 223 infants given <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation,</b> 54 of the 72 given passive followed by active immunisation, and 102 of the 155 given passive and active immunisation at birth. At 1 year 11 of the 127 (9 %) infants given four or more doses of specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen compared with four of the 20 given three or fewer doses; 11 had levels of hepatitis B surface antibody greater than 50 IU/l. Only one of the 54 infants given passive then active immunisation was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen at 1 year and four infants had low (less than or equal to 50 IU/l) levels of hepatitis B surface antibody. Four of the 102 infants who received passive and active immunisation at birth were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen. Two had received the fill course of vaccine, whereas in the other two vaccination was incomplete or unstated. In 79 of the 89 infants who received a complete course of vaccination the level of hepatitis B surface antibody was known, and 70 had levels at 1 year greater than 100 IU/ 1. Reactions to immunisation were not severe at any age. The incidence of side effects was 8 % for the immunoglobulin, 11 % for the vaccine, and 9 % when immunoglobulin and vaccine were given together.

40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) {{infection}} {{is a substantial}} risk for travellers from low endemic countries to high endemic destinations. Costs and effects of alternative options for prevention were compared using formal decision analysis. General indications for the optimal prevention of hepatitis A were derived from a cost-effectiveness analysis. Various possible strategies for prevention of hepatitis A in travellers were compared to doing nothing: active immunisation using either the existing vaccine (HAVRIX 720) or the new vaccine (HAVRIX(tm) 1440); first screening {{for the presence of}} HAV antibodies and then vaccinating only susceptibles; and <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation</b> with immunoglobulin. Using a number of assumptions as baseline and for an average duration and frequency of travel from low to high endemic countries, threshold values were obtained for the choice between passive and active immunisation. <b>Passive</b> <b>immunisation</b> remains the most cost-effective prevention strategy for those expected to travel not more frequently than twice over the next 10 years and for short stays (£ 7, 000 - 9, 000 per infection prevented). For travellers expected to travel three or more times in 10 years or for trips exceeding a period of 6 months, active immunisation before the first trip is the most cost-effective option (£ 7, 500 or less per infection prevented). When travel frequency increases to once a year in the next 10 years, costs per infection prevented decrease to about £ 3, 500. Screening for the presence of antibodies before vaccination is only justified for older travellers or those leaving from countries with moderate endemicity, i. e., with an average HAV prevalence Of at least 30 %...|$|E

40|$|Humoral autoimmune-mediated {{inflammation}} {{plays a role}} in atherogenesis, {{and potentially}} in arterial thrombosis. Anti-apolipoprotein A- 1 (apoA- 1) IgG have been reported to represent emergent mediators of atherogenesis through Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 4 and CD 14 signalling. We investigated the role of anti-apoA- 1 IgG on tissue factor (TF) expression and activation, a key coagulation regulator underlying atherothrombosis. Atherothrombosis features were determined by immunohistochemical TF staining of human carotid biopsies derived from patients with severe carotid stenosis undergoing elective surgery (n= 176), and on aortic roots of different genetic backgrounds mice (ApoE-/-; TLR 2 -/-ApoE-/- and TLR 4 -/-ApoE-/-) exposed to <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation</b> with anti-apoA- 1 IgG. Human serum levels of anti-apoA- 1 IgG were measured by ELISA. In vitro, on human-monocyte-derived-macrophages (HMDM) the anti-apoA- 1 IgG increased TF expression and activity were analysed by FACS and chromogenic assays in presence of different pharmacological inhibitors. Human serum anti-apoA- 1 IgG levels significantly correlated to intraplaque TF expression in carotid biopsies (r= 0. 31, p< 0. 001), which was predictive of clinically symptomatic lesions. On HMDM, anti-apoA- 1 IgG induced a TLR 2, 4 /CD 14 -dependent increase in TF expression and activity, involving NF-kappaB and a c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent AP- 1 transcription factors. In ApoE-/- mice, anti-apoA- 1 IgG <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation</b> significantly enhanced intraplaque TF expression when compared to control IgG. This effect was lost in both TLR 2 -/-ApoE-/- and TLR 4 -/-ApoE-/- backgrounds. These results demonstrate that anti-apoA- 1 IgG are associated with TF expression in human atherosclerotic plaques, induce TF expression in vitro and in vivo through TLR 2 and 4 signalling, supporting a possible causal relationship between anti-apoA- 1 IgG and atherothrombosis...|$|E

Convalescent blood products could be a valid option in the treatment/prophylaxis of several infectious diseases both in association with other drugs/preventive measures and as the only therapy when a speciﬁc treatment is not available.

40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>immunisation</b> {{has been}} used in {{clinical}} practice since the end of last century, mainly for prophylaxis. Success of early treatments was marred by anaphylactic reactions and serum sickness because antibodies or antitoxins were not raised in humans. Recombination of gene segments during antibody synthesis means that specific antibodies for numerous antigens can be produced from a limited gene pool. Killer lymphocytes, phagocytes, and complement then bind to the constant region of the antibody facilitating elimination of the pathogen. Development of a method of obtaining large quantities of antibodies against a specific antigen (monoclonal antibodies) offers the possibility of initiating host defence mechanisms against any unwanted antigen, though some problems still remain in preventing the body from attacking the monoclonal antibody...|$|E
40|$|In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{genetic and}} {{biochemical}} data {{have established a}} crucial role for the amyloid-b (Ab) peptide that forms extracellular deposits known as amyloid plaques. A second key player in AD is the microtubule-associated protein Tau that forms intracellular deposits referred to as neurofibrillary tangles. Given that elevated Ab levels in human AD brains are due to an increased production and reduced clearance of this peptide, recent therapeutic strategies either aim to reduce Ab production by inhibition of enzymes such as c- and b-secretase, or to assist in its clearance, pursuing active and, in particular, <b>passive</b> <b>immunisation</b> approaches. Increasingly, Tau is also recognised as an attractive target for therapeutic interventions, although it is lagging behind Ab therapies.
