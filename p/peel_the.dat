5|$|Over the {{lifetime}} of the wind farm, Peel Holdings' energy subsidiary, Peel Wind Power Ltd, will provide up to £500,000 to help landowners create biodiverse areas on the land surrounding the moor. A prime target habitat envisaged to be enhanced and re-created under the Habitat Enhancement Plan is upland blanket bog and important habitats for skylarks and wading birds on the moorland fringe. To receive funding, landowners within an identified area will need to apply to a panel made up of representatives from <b>Peel,</b> <b>the</b> local authorities and independent ecological experts. This panel will meet regularly throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Various authors regard Suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript taste. It is advisable, as for {{all species}} of Suillus, to pick only young {{specimens}} and to <b>peel</b> <b>the</b> cuticle before preparation. The mushroom contains several tocopherols, {{a class of}} chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin E, and which confer antioxidant activity. They also contain several organic acids, most predominantly the pairs malic and quinic acids, and citric and ketoglutaric acid, which respectively make up 42% and 30% of total organic acids. The composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour; some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It was {{investigated}} that {{the influences of}} <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> behavior of adhesive tapes in peeling tests on IC chip pick-up performance. Needles peel off an IC chip with an adhesive film from the base material in the pick-up process, by sticking out the backside of the base material. In the case that <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> forces of <b>the</b> adhesive tape decrease as <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> speeds increase in peeling tests, only two kinds of behaviors were observed in pick-up test; <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> propagated little and the IC chip was not peeled off under critical needle displacement while the pick-up was completed instantaneously over critical needle displacement. In the case that <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> forces of <b>the</b> adhesive tape increase as <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> speeds increase, <b>the</b> pick-up time decreased as the needle displacement increased. As a result, {{it can be concluded}} that the needle displacement where <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> propagates instantaneously is critical for succeeded pick-up if <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> forces of <b>the</b> adhesive tape decrease as <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> speeds increase. If <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> forces of <b>the</b> adhesive tape increase as <b>the</b> <b>peeling</b> speeds increase, <b>the</b> information of <b>peeling</b> speeds at each needle displacement are needed to estimate {{how long it takes to}} pick-up a chip...|$|R
5|$|In {{first-class}} matches during 1892, Peel scored 772 runs at 19.79 {{and took}} 121 wickets at 16.80. Additionally, in a non-first-class games against Leicestershire, he scored 226 {{as well as}} taking five wickets in Leicestershire's first innings. In the 1893 season, he took slightly more wickets at a lower average (126 at 14.51) but his run aggregate fell to 550 runs at 13.75. He {{was part of a}} successful Yorkshire team. The county won their first official County Championship title and the team was no longer as dependent on Peel with the ball—Ted Wainwright took more wickets than he did. The Australians toured England once again, but Peel played in just one of the three Test matches. He did not take a wicket, did little with the bat, and was left out of the team for the second Test. As the Australians had proved poor on the field, Lord Hawke withdrew Peel and Stanley Jackson from the team for the third Test so that they could play for Yorkshire. In 1894, Peel scored 699 runs at 16.25, failing to score a half-century. With the ball, he took 145 wickets at 13.44. During the season, he was awarded a benefit match at Bradford, which raised £2,000. The retirement of George Ulyett that season made <b>Peel</b> <b>the</b> team's senior professional, an important position at the time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert <b>Peel,</b> <b>the</b> Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E
