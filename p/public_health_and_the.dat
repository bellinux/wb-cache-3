25|$|From the outset, Brazil’s {{nuclear program}} has been {{shrouded}} in secrecy. Nuclear issues are still considered {{a matter of national}} security and sovereignty, despite Brazil’s democratic makeup and transition away from military dictatorship. There is little transparency regarding the various nuclear activities under the government’s purview and the potential impact these can have on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. Moreover, numerous attempts to keep radioactive accidents and incidents secret have undermined credibility of nuclear enterprises and led to distrust among the public.|$|E

Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.|$|E

25|$|Today, several unrecognized {{villages are}} in the process of recognition. They have been {{incorporated}} into the Abu Basma Regional Council created for the purpose of dealing with specific problems of the Bedouin. So far they remain without water, electricity and garbage services, although there is a certain improvement - for example, in al-Sayyid two new schools were built and a medical clinic has been opened since its recognition in 2004. Development has been hampered by urban planning difficulties and land ownership problems. Due to the lack of municipal waste services and trash pickup, backyard burning has been adopted on a large scale, impacting badly on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} sewage sludge is {{controlled}} under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants {{and those that do}} not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.|$|E
