40|$|International audienceThe {{occurrence}} of 20 human <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds</b> and metabolites from 10 representative therapeutic classes was analysed from resource and drinking water in two catchment basins located in north-west France. 98 samples were analysed from 63 stations (surface water and drinking water produced from surface water). Of the 20 human <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds</b> selected, 16 were quantified {{in both the}} surface water and drinking water, with 22 % of the values above the limit of quantification for surface water and 14 % for drinking water). Psychostimulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, iodinated contrast media and anxiolytic drugs were the main therapeutic classes of human <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds</b> detected in the surface water and drinking water. The results for surface water were close to results from previous studies in spite of differences in prescription rates of human <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds</b> in different countries. The removal rate of human <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds</b> at 11 water treatment units was also determined. Only caffeine proved to be resistant to drinking water treatment processes (with a minimum rate of 5 %).

50|$|Pharmacometabolomics {{is thought}} to provide {{information}} that complements that gained from other omics, namely genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Looking at the characteristics of an individual down through these different levels of detail, there is an increasingly more accurate prediction of a person’s {{ability to respond to}} a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compound.</b> The genome, made up of 25 000 genes, can indicate possible errors in drug metabolism; the transcriptome, made up of 85,000 transcripts, can provide information about which genes important in metabolism are being actively transcribed; and the proteome, >10,000,000 members, depicts which proteins are active in the body to carry out these functions. Pharmacometabolomics complements the omics with direct measurement of the products of all of these reactions, but with perhaps a relatively smaller number of members: that was initially projected to be approximately 2200 metabolites, but could be a larger number when gut derived metabolites and xenobiotics are added to the list. Overall, the goal of pharmacometabolomics is to more closely predict or assess the response of an individual to a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compound,</b> permitting continued treatment with the right drug or dosage depending on the variations in their metabolism and ability to respond to treatment.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} the {{occurrence}} and fate of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds</b> in drinking or waste water processes has become very popular in recent years. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical tool often used to determine pharmaceutical residues at trace level in water.

A list of 27 environmentally relevant molecules, including various therapeutic classes and (cardiovascular, veterinary and human antibiotics, neuroleptics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones and other miscellaneous <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds),</b> was selected. In this work, a method was developed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and solid-phase extraction to determine the concentration of the 27 targeted <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compounds</b> at the nanogram per litre level. The matrix effect was evaluated from water sampled at different treatment stages.

50|$|Pharmacometabolomics, {{also known}} as pharmacometabonomics, is a field which stems from metabolomics, the {{quantification}} and analysis of metabolites produced by the body. It refers to the direct measurement of metabolites in an individual’s bodily fluids, in order to predict or evaluate the metabolism of pharmaceutical compounds, and {{to better understand the}} pharmacokinetic profile of a drug.

This provides detailed mapping of drug effects on metabolism and the pathways that are implicated in mechanism of variation of response to treatment. In addition, the metabolic profile of an individual at baseline (metabotype) provides information about how individuals respond to treatment and highlights heterogeneity within a disease state. All three approaches require the quantification of metabolites found in bodily fluids and tissue, such as blood or urine, and can be used in the assessment of pharmaceutical treatment options for numerous disease states.|$|E

5000|$|Pharmacometabolomic analyses, {{through the}} use of a {{metabolomics}} approach, can provide a comprehensive and detailed metabolic profile or “metabolic fingerprint” for an individual patient. Such metabolic profiles can provide a complete overview of individual metabolite or pathway alterations, providing a more realistic depiction of disease phenotypes. This approach can then be applied to the prediction of response to a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compound</b> by patients with a particular metabolic profile. [...] Pharmacometabolomic analyses of drug response are often coupled or followed up with pharmacogenetics studies. Pharmacogenetics focuses on the identification of genetic variations (e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphisms) within patients that may contribute to altered drug responses and overall outcome of a certain treatment. The results of pharmacometabolomics analyses can act to “inform” or “direct” pharmacogenetic analyses by correlating aberrant metabolite concentrations or metabolic pathways to potential alterations at the genetic level. This concept has been established with two seminal publications from studies of antidepressants serotonin reuptake inhibitors [...] where metabolic signatures were able to define pathway implicated in response to the antidepressant and that lead to identification of genetic variants within a key gene within highlighted pathway as being implicated in variation in response. These genetic variants were not identified through genetic analysis alone and hence illustrated how metabolomics can guide and inform genetic data.|$|E
50|$|Pharmacometabolomics {{may be used}} in a {{predictive}} {{manner to}} determine the correct course of action in regards to a patient about to undergo some type of drug treatment. This involves determining the metabolic profile of a patient prior to treatment, and correlating metabolic signatures with the outcome of a pharmaceutical treatment course. Analysis of a patient’s metabolic profile can reveal factors that may contribute to altered drug metabolism, allowing for predictions of the overall efficacy of a proposed treatment, as well as potential drug toxicity risks that may differ from the general population. This approach has been used to identify novel or previously characterized metabolic biomarkers in patients, which can be used to predict the expected outcome of that patient following treatment with a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>compound.</b> One example of the clinical application of pharmacometabolomics are studies that looked to identify a predictive metabolic marker for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD)., In a study with antidepressant Sertraline, the Pharmacometabolomics Network illustrated that metabolic profile at baseline of patients with major depression can inform about treatment outcomes. In addition the study illustrated the power of metabolomics for defining response to placebo and compared response to placebo to response to sertraline and showed that several pathways were common to both. In another study with escitalopram citalopram, metabolomic analysis of plasma from patients with MDD revealed that variations in glycine metabolism were negatively associated with patient outcome upon treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), an important drug class involved in the treatment of this disease.|$|E
