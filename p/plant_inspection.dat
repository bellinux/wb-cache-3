500|$|The [...] {{portion of}} I-8 {{bypassing}} Holtville began construction in December1969, and was nearing completion in May1971, {{to result in}} a continuous freeway that connected two existing segments from Crestwood in San Diego County to just west of Winterhaven. It was estimated that the bypass would save travelers 20minutes of travel time through the Imperial Valley. The cost of this project was $11.2million (about $ in [...] dollars). However, Holtville residents raised concerns about SR115 providing the only access to {{the eastern part of the}} city, notably the narrow and curved portion leading from the freeway into town. Work on the Holtville portion began at 3:30a.m. daily during the summer in order to avoid the desert heat. In addition to this, construction of the Highline Canal overpass involved a [...] steel span that was prefabricated and made of girders that were hoisted into position by barges. The Matich Construction Company attempted to set the world record for laying the most concrete in a day, aided by the level terrain, but failed to do so after the concrete mixer malfunctioned. That same year, bids for an Arizona <b>plant</b> <b>inspection</b> station near Winterhaven, next to the California agricultural inspection station, were submitted.|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{trust the}} quality of organic farming {{products}} and pay higher prices for organic food. For this reason controls are necessary to ensure that legal standards under the EC Organic Farming Regulation are being followed in production and processing of animal and crop products. Collected in this book are reference figures to be applied in controls for calculating product flow, appraising plausibility and also reliably assessing yields and wastage. Target groups are inspectors conducting on-location farm or <b>plant</b> <b>inspections</b> or those wishing to learn about new aspects within this sector. Farm managers or advisors preparing for such controls can likewise find valuable information. In addition to its role as control point reference, the book is also aimed at establishing uniformity of control methods for farm and <b>plant</b> <b>inspections...</b>|$|R

None of these had any inter-agency coordination, creating chaos.|$|E

50|$|On 7 January 2007 a {{contractor}} {{working on the}} decommissioning of the station noticed water leaking on {{to the floor of}} the laundry where he was washing his clothes. The water was found to be cooling water from the pond that holds the reactor's spent nuclear fuel which had dropped more than 1 ft without activating any of the alarms. It is estimated that up to 40,000 gallons (151,500 litres) of radioactive water had leaked from a 15 ft (4.6 m) split in a pipe, with some spilling into the North Sea. According to the HM Nuclear Installation Inspectorate's report of the incident, without the chance intervention of the contractor, the pond could have drained before the next scheduled <b>plant</b> <b>inspection.</b> If the exposed irradiated fuel had caught fire, it would have resulted in an airborne off-site release of radiation.|$|E
