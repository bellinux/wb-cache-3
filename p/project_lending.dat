40|$|For many {{developing}} countries, {{alternative forms of}} external finance—all forms of finance that are not guaranteed by or mediated through the public sector— have become increasingly important as traditional financing to the public sector has ebbed.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{accelerating}} {{construction of}} new wind energy capacity in Finland has created a strong demand for project finance in the country. This thesis has two main goals. Firstly, this thesis aims to discover the main risks in financing Finnish wind energy projects from banks' point of view. Secondly this thesis examines whether increasing bank regulation {{is expected to have}} an impact on the availability or pricing of project finance loans in the coming years. DATA AND METHODS The data of this study is based on interviews. Representatives of four banks that provide project finance were interviewed for this study. In total five project finance professionals were interviewed. From the interviewees four represent Nordic banks and one represents a German bank. The interviews were conducted as theme interviews and the topics and questions are based on prior literature on project finance and renewable energy as well as the author's own experience in the wind energy sector. RESULTS According to the interviewees Finnish wind energy projects are generally low risk investments, but the cold Finnish climate still poses additional challenges. Wind energy know-how in Finland has increased rapidly over the past few years, as a result risks related to project sponsors and project planning have decreased. The interviewees were unanimous that it is unlikely that the current subsidy system for wind energy would be cut, but unscheduled cuts of wind energy subsidies would have crippling effect on the investment environment. The interviewees believe that the implementation of Basel III does bring new challenges for project finance and may lower the profitability of long-term <b>project</b> <b>lending,</b> but so far the impact has been very limited. At least to date Basel III has not affected the pricing of project loans, however it has caused some polarization on how banks perceive project finance's business potential. The way Basel III affects an individual bank's <b>project</b> <b>lending</b> is up to its desired business mix, funding base and strategic choices. Based on the interviews it is clear that project finance will have a major role in financing the growth of the Finnish wind power industry in the following years. Even though the amount of banks actively providing project finance loans to wind energy projects may decrease in the following years, a financing gap is unlikely to occur. The current feed-in tariff system in Finland has made the market an attractive wind power market in Europe and the availability of project loans from foreign project financiers has increased especially during 2014...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to examine}} the new {{regulatory}} framework of project finance in the economics of banking firms. In particular, the paper investigates {{the uniqueness of the}} project finance, the significant importance of the project finance in bank activity, {{and the role of the}} new bank capital requirements to promote the innovative financial scheme. In the project finance business loans terms and characteristics are primarily based on the assets and quality of the project to be financed. It means that the usual bank rating models for lending business might not been implemented in the <b>project</b> finance <b>lending.</b> Quantitative estimates of credit risk could not be always possible in <b>project</b> finance <b>lending.</b> Consequently, the new regulatory capital requirements framework gives banks the option to implement a qualitative method – a supervisory slotting criteria approach – to evaluate credit risk in <b>project</b> finance <b>lending</b> business. The regulatory capital requirement recognizes project finance as specialized lending. The paper provides a summary of the treatment of the project finance in the New Basel Capital Accord. The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a general description of project finance. Section 2 identifies the economic and financial uniqueness of project finance loans and credit risk assessment process. Section 3 delineates the impact of the new regulatory capital requirements framework on <b>project</b> finance <b>lending.</b> Final sections concludes. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{foreign aid}} or foreign lending policy that focuses {{exclusively}} on project financing may have unintended consequences, report the authors. New {{research shows that}} aid intended for crucial social and economic sectors often merely substitutes for spending that recipient governments would have undertaken anyway and the funds that are thereby freed up are spent for other purposes. If the aid funds something {{that would have been}} done anyway, traditional ways of evaluating the aid's effectiveness are not really accurate. Ifaid funds are fungible and the recipient's public spending program is unsatisfactory, <b>project</b> <b>lending</b> may not be cost-effective. If the recipient's public spending program is satisfactory, perhaps the donor should finance a portion of it instead of financing individual projects. One {{solution to the problem of}} fungibility, then, is that donors could tie assistance to an overall public spending program (in the recipient country) that provides adequate resources to crucial sectors. To make this kind of reform operational, the authors propose a new lending instrument: a public expenditure reform loan (PERL). A PERL would tie an institution's lending strategy to the recipient country's achievement of mutually agreed-upon development goals. Everyone agrees that better donor coordination is needed, but it has been difficult to achieve because some donors tend to prefer projects (usually with the national flag flying over them). By agreeing on a public expenditure program and financing a portion of it, the World Bank credibly ask other donors to do the same.

The spread of disease was tracked over two years, and clinical signs of URTD spread from the core area to adjacent, outlying locations during this time.
