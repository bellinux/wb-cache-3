5|$|The marsh shrew and the American {{water shrew}} (Sorex pallustris) share many {{physical}} characteristics. The former {{is found in}} a narrower area from the northwest coast to the lower slopes of the inland mountains. The American water shrew is more widely distributed across the western mountains and through the subarctic regions of Canada and the eastern U.S. The species' ranges are primarily allopatric; although they may overlap (sympatry) in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, differences in elevation tend to separate them. Early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera; Merriam assigned the marsh shrew to Atophyrax, and Jackson (1928) assigned the <b>Pacific</b> <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> to Neosorex. A closer, dentition-based relationship was assigned by Findley (1955), with both species assigned to the subgenus Otisorex. Findley hypothesized {{that in the early}} Pleistocene, the ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews (Sorex cinereus and Sorex vagrans, respectively) diverged; during the Yarmouth interglacial, the American water shrew and marsh shrew diverged from their vagrant-shrew ancestors. Three other Sorex species evolved during the Sangamonian: the dwarf shrew (S. nanus), the southeastern shrew (Sorex longirostris) and the ornate shrew (Sorex ornatus). Findley's assignment of the marsh shrew and the American water shrew to Otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies. In 2005, findings were published (based on mitochondrial DNA analysis) which better defined the nature of the relationships between marsh shrews, Pacific water shrews and their respective subspecies. Variations in the sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were assessed, and the results of the 2005 phylogeny for the marsh shrew are shown below in detail.|$|E

40|$|The Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Neomys fodiens) is a {{semi-aquatic}} predator {{of freshwater}} invertebrates.

5000|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1884 by Clinton Hart Merriam with its original name, Atophyrax bendirii (a monotypic taxon at the time). The first specimen was obtained 18 mi southeast of Fort Klamath in Klamath County, Oregon, at a location 1 mi from the Williamson River. Merriam obtained the specimen from Charles Bendire, an ornithologist and army captain stationed at Fort Klamath. The shrew was caught in late July or early August {{by one of the}} dogs in the camp, and a soldier gave it to Bendire. Merriam named it Bendire's shrew (Atophyrax bendirii) in appreciation of Bendire's contribution. Merriam reported that the animal represented a new genus, Atophyrax, deriving from the Greek and meaning [...] "anomalous sorex".

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>shrews</b> (Sorex palustris) depend {{heavily on}} their {{elaborate}} whiskers to navigate their environment and locate prey. They have small {{eyes and ears}} with correspondingly small optic and auditory nerves. Previous investigations have shown that <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> neocortex is dominated by large representations of the whiskers in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S 1 and S 2). Flattened sections of juvenile cortex processed for cytochrome oxidase revealed clear borders of the whisker pad representation in S 1, but no cortical barrels. We were therefore surprised to discover prominent barrelettes in brainstem of juvenile <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> in the present investigation. These distinctive modules {{were found in the}} principal trigeminal nucleus (PrV), and in two of the three spinal trigeminal subnuclei (interpolaris [...] SpVi and caudalis [...] SpVc).

Thus in contrast to mice and rats, which have obvious barrels in primary somatosensory cortex and less clear barrelettes in the principal nucleus, <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> have clear barrelettes in the brainstem and no barrels in the neocortex.

This species {{is one of the}} least studied small mammal species not only of the Portuguese but also of the whole European fauna. As such, it is still unclear what are the major factors determining the fragmentation of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> populations. The present work intended to better understand the influence of climate and other ecological factors on the distribution of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> by following a time-scaled multidisciplinary approach, that included: i) the study of the evolutionary history of the species; ii) the analysis of ecological and behavioural aspects determining its current niche space; and iii) the determination of the effects of future climate changes on the species’ distribution. Two factors were identified as significantly contributing to the current distribution pattern of the Mediterranean water shrew: severe climatic alterations, that were extremely important in the evolutionary history of the species and that are also projected to have a significant impact in its future distribution, and the interspecific competition with a congeneric species, {{which is one of the}} main factors regulating the current habitat preferences of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew.</b> The followed multidisciplinary and time-scaled approach provided relevant insights on the ecological factors determining the presence of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew,</b> ultimately defining its geographical distribution.
