30|$|In 2010 / 11, an {{innovative}} index-based livestock insurance (IBLI) {{was introduced in}} Northern Kenya through the joint effort of the International Livestock Research Center (ILRI), Cornell University in USA, a private insurance company in Ethiopia and Swiss Re. Initial results from this initiative indicate that high <b>premium,</b> <b>basis</b> risk and risk preferences have strong effects on the uptake of insurance, similar to earlier findings (Mude and Barrett 2012). Using the NDVI index for vegetative cover on rangeland, Chantarat et al. (2012) found that risk preference, perceived basis risk and the subjective expectation of loss were important factors affecting Northern Kenyan pastoralists’ willingness to pay for index-based livestock insurance. Besides index-based livestock insurance pilots, index-based crop insurance schemes (Kilimo Salama, meaning safe farming) are being tested. In {{an effort to reduce}} delivery costs, mobile phones are in use to pay premiums, receive payouts and weather information (see Syngenta 2012). The delivery mechanism is based on linking insurance with input marketing. When farmers buy seeds, fertilizer or other agricultural inputs, they can also buy insurance for their inputs by paying 5  % of the input cost. Covered farmers need to register in one of the weather stations close to their farm.|$|E

Shippers now confront alternatives ranging from nearby and unguaranteed ordering to various durations of forward and guaranteed shipment. Each has varying penalties for cancellation and payments from the railroad for nonperformance, and differing risks and payoffs.

The model includes the effects of uncertainties in tariff rate changes, car <b>premiums,</b> <b>basis</b> levels, forward and spot grain purchases, and receiving railcars under each of three alternatives. Shipping demand is determined by inter-month commodity price differences, carrying costs, transport costs, and storage capacity. Considering these factors, the shipper chooses grain sales and shipping strategies that maximize net payoffs and confronts a tradeoff between expected profits and risk. Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} insurability of risks in microinsurance markets. Our aim is to enhance the understanding of impediments to and facilitators of microinsurance from an economic perspective and outline potential solutions. The motivation for conducting this analysis arises from two important aspects. (1) Despite strong growth of microinsurance markets in recent years, more than 90 per cent of the poor population in developing countries have limited or no access to insurance. (2) Industry practitioners frequently highlight problems in the insurability of risks that hinder the development of microinsurance. We review 131 papers and find that the most severe problems stem from insufficient resources for risk evaluation, small size of insurance groups, information asymmetries {{and the size of}} the insurance <b>premium.</b> On the <b>basis</b> of the analysis, we discuss a number of potential solutions such as, for example, a cooperative microinsurance architecture. ...|$|R

As Duffie (1999) shows, {{there is a clear}} theoretical link between CDS premia and bond prices if the two quantities are viewed as a pure measure of credit risk. However, many studies provide evidence that factors other than credit risk seem to affect bond prices and CDS premia, and these factors may partially obscure the relationship. We focus on the difference between the yield spread and the CDS <b>premium,</b> the bond-CDS <b>basis,</b> and show that the basis is highly sensitive to firm-specific and market wide credit risk and liquidity. If CDS and bonds are used in a dynamic hedging strategy or in a basis trading strategy that depends on the convergence of CDS and bond markets, it is necessary to correctly quantify the associated risks of these strategies.

In fact, a negative risk <b>premium</b> of 10 <b>basis</b> points (in line with recent estimates) is enough to deter investors from holding these bonds almost completely. However, we also show that, small misperceptions about future improvements in mortality rates are enough to induce very large welfare gains from investing in longevity bonds: between 0. 5 % and 1 % of annual consumption. This indicates that investors might not actually buy these bonds even if they actually stand to gain significantly from investing in them...|$|R
50|$|Community rating, as a <b>basis</b> for <b>premium</b> calculation, is {{fundamentally}} different from the usual method of determining insurance premiums, i.e. risk rating. In a risk rated insurance market, an insurer calculates the premium payable by a potential policy holder in order to enter into an insurance contract {{on the basis of}} various factors particular to that individual, such as the risk of a claim occurring, and the value of any such claims during the term of an insurance policy. In a community rated market, the insurer may not calculate <b>premium</b> on the <b>basis</b> of the risk factors attaching to the particular person wishing to purchase an insurance contract, but rather the risk factors applying to all persons within the market as a whole. Thus, in a community rated market, the insurer evaluates the risk factors of market population, and not those of any one person when calculating premiums. Some form of risk equalization also often exists in a community rated system.|$|R
40|$|Based on the Officer (1994) model, Gray and Hall (2006) derive a {{relation}} between franking credits {{and the market}} risk <b>premium.</b> On the <b>basis</b> of this relation, the authors show that traditional estimates {{of the value of}} franking credits imply dividend yields that are inconsistent with historical equity market data. This inconsistency arises from assumptions about the franking credit payout ratio and the value of franking credits retained. With less than a 100 per cent payout ratio some franking credits are retained within the firm. Assuming that the retained franking credits have no value leads to the inconsistency in dividend yields. Current practice in the application of Officer's model makes this assumption and, therefore, leads to inconsistent results. Gray and Hall suggest resolving the inconsistency by setting the value of all franking credits to zero. An alternative solution is to recognize that retained franking credits might have a positive value. Copyright (c) The Authors. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Public {{health policy}} {{promotes}} {{the use of}} risk-rating health insurance and payment for smoking cessation as economic incentives to encourage smoking cessation. This study was undertaken {{to learn more about}} the adoption of these policies in large corporations. METHODS. A random sample survey of 280 private California corporations with more than 500 employees was undertaken to document the prevalence of policies integrating smoking control into employee benefit designs. RESULTS. Only 8. 6 % of large corporations had ever considered risk-rating health insurance premiums using smoking status and only 2. 15 % had implemented a risk-rating policy. Nearly 20 % of the companies offered health insurance plans that covered smoking cessation services. Subsidization or payment for smoking cessation outside health insurance was provided by over 37 % of the companies surveyed, and 87 % had adopted formal work-site smoking policies. CONCLUSION. Benefit policies that provide financial support to smokers to participate in smoking cessation services are much more prevalent and are viewed more positively by the benefits managers in large corporations than are policies to risk-rate health insurance <b>premiums</b> on the <b>basis</b> of smoking...|$|R

Tests of whether observed market values incorporate operating flexibility is central {{to our understanding of}} the processes that drive market values and has implications for the relevance and suitability of known theoretical pricing frameworks. This paper assesses the relevancy of the option to close for mining firm valuation. This is achieved by examining 41 Australian gold mining firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange from 1987 to 1994 that are actively engaged in gold mining extraction and production. A pooled cross-sectional regression analysis analyses 234 firm-year observations to identify the degree of association between the actual (market determined) and theoretical option <b>premiums</b> on the <b>basis</b> of the overall sample. Further robustness checks are then undertaken for sub-sample quartiles ranked on a specific firm characteristic, moneyness.

40|$|ABSTRACT:Pricing for an {{insurance}} policy {{can be described as}} the process of calculation of expected compensation to be paid to property losers as well as associated costs of potential risks. Loss forecast is accurate if the risks will be identified appropriately in order to calculate the frequency and expected severity of losses. This is particularly important about environmental risks since most of them appear in the long run. Environmental risk assessment model is both able to estimate the environmental liability premium for environmental pollution and degradation, and it can play a valuable role in promoting this industry. ELIS (Environmental Liability Insurance) software calculates the environmental risk number in industry sector and insurance charges for events resulting in environmental pollution. This paper deals with designing the model and outputs of the software. The user selects the type of project, and input the descriptive information concerning the occurrence of possible environmental pollutions. The model calculates risk numbers, the type of accidents, classification and weighting of severity of environmental impacts, risk priority numbers (RPN); pollutant volume and environmental sensitivity, environmental cost of contaminates, and finally Net premium for Possible Accidents. The case study indicated the applicability of then model. For this case an oil refinery in Iran was selected with a capacity of 85, 000. barrels of refined oil per day. The calculated <b>premium</b> on the <b>basis</b> of losses arising from air pollution was evaluated to be equivalent to 70, 000 $ US. The same procedur...|$|R
40|$|In the {{classical}} Arrow-Borch-Raviv problem {{of demand for}} insurance contracts, it is well-known that the optimal insurance contract for an insurance buyer – or decision maker (DM) – is a deductible contract, when the insurer is a risk-neutral Expected-Utility (EU) maximizer, and when the DM is a risk-averse EU-maximizer. In the Arrow-Borch-Raviv framework, however, both parties share the same probabilistic beliefs about the realizations of the underlying insurable loss. This paper argues for heterogeneity of beliefs in {{the classical}} insurance model, and considers a setting where the DM and the insurer have preferences yielding different subjective beliefs. The DM seeks the insurance contract that will maximize her (subjective) expected utility of terminal wealth with respect to her subjective probability measure, whereas the insurer sets <b>premiums</b> on the <b>basis</b> of his subjective probability measure. I show that in this setting, and under a consistency requirement on the insurer’s subjective probability that I call vigilance, there exists an event to which the DM assigns full (subjective) probability and on which an optimal insurance contract for the DM {{takes the form of}} what I will call a generalized deductible contract. Moreover, the class of all optimal contracts for the DM that are nondecreasing in the loss is fully characterized in terms of their distribution under the DM’s probability measure. Finally, the assumption of vigilance is shown to be a weakening of the assumption of a monotone likelihood ratio, when the latter can be defined, and it is hence a useful tool in situations where the likelihood ratio cannot be defined. ...|$|R

In response, congressional leaders have promised to introduce legislation by this summer, and they hope for an initial vote in the Senate before the Labor Day recess. While the Obama administration has not, and does not seem likely to, put forward a specific reform plan, it is possible to discern the key components of any plan likely to emerge from Congress: At a time of rising unemployment, the government would raise the cost of hiring workers by requiring employers to provide health insurance to their workers or pay a fee (tax) to subsidize government coverage. Every American would be required to buy an insurance policy that meets certain government requirements. Even individuals who are currently insured [...] and happy with their insurance [...] will have to switch to insurance that meets the government's definition of "acceptable insurance. " A government-run plan similar to Medicare would be set up in competition with private insurance, with people able to choose either private insurance or the taxpayer-subsidized public plan. Subsidies and cost-shifting would encourage Americans to shift to the government plan. The government would undertake comparative-effectiveness research and cost-effectiveness research, and use the results of that research to impose practice guidelines on providers [...] initially, in government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, but possibly eventually extending such rationing to private insurance plans. Private insurance would face a host of new regulations, including a requirement to insure all applicants and a prohibition on pricing <b>premiums</b> on the <b>basis</b> of risk. Subsidies would be available to help middle-income people purchase insurance, while government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid would be expanded. Finally, the government would subsidize and manage the development of a national system of electronic medical records. Taken individually, each of these proposals would be a bad idea. Taken collectively, they would dramatically transform the American health care system in a way that would harm taxpayers, health care providers, and [...] most importantly [...] the quality and range of care given to patients...|$|R

Domestic {{road transport}} of passengers in Croatia is {{regulated by the}} provisions of the Obligations Act of 2005 providing for the contracts of passenger transport, since, so far, there is no lex specialis applying to road transport. Among other things, these provisions recognise carriers’ rights to the limitation of liability for property and non-property damages suffered by passengers, such as death, bodily injury or impairment of health. However, information regarding the amounts can be found in other acts or international conventions. According to the CVR Convention providing for the international transport of passengers, the specific amounts of limitation are expressed in Germinal francs which can be calculated in two ways: through the stock-exchange price of gold or through the value of a special drawing right (SDR). In the case of the latter method, the limitation amounts in SDRs, envisaged in the CVR Protocol of 1978 (still not effective), must be applied. The amounts calculated by the first method practically annul the right of carriers to any limitation, whereas the amounts calculated by the second method are more than ten times smaller and constitute a realistic and acceptable possibility of limiting liability with respect to the achievable amounts for similar events in Croatia. Such liability of carriers is covered by compulsory insurance of auto-liability up to the minimum premium provided in the law. This amount (about EUR 900, 000) is far from sufficient to cover big accidents involving an average-sized coach full of passengers (50 passenger seats). For the remaining amount of damage, the carrier is liable alone. In this paper, it is recommended to contract voluntary insurance against liability arising from transport activity, or to contract auto-liability insurance of a higher amount. In addition, according to the new Compulsory Insurance in Traffic Act, every passenger, cumulatively with this right arising from a transport contract, exercises his or her right to a <b>premium</b> on the <b>basis</b> of the compulsory insurance of passengers in public transport amounting to a range from EUR 5. 5 – 11, 000 for every injury in the vehicle, regardless of the cause...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Achieving {{universal}} coverage as an objective needs {{to confront the}} reality of multiple mechanisms, with healthcare financing and provision occurring in {{both public and private}} settings. South Africa has both large and mature public and private health systems offering useful insights into how they can be effectively harmonized to optimise coverage. Private healthcare in South Africa has also gone through many phases and regulatory regimes which, through careful review, can help identify potential policy frameworks that can optimise their ability to deepen coverage in a manner that complements the basic coverage of public arrangements. Research question Using South Africa as a case study, this review examines whether private health systems are susceptible to regulation and therefore able to support an extension and deepening of coverage when complementing a pre-existing publicly funded and delivered health system? Methods The approach involves a review of different stages {{in the development of the}} South African private health system and its response to policy changes. The focus is on the time-bound characteristics of the health system and associated policy responses and opportunities. A distinction is consequently made between the early, largely unregulated, phases of development and more mature phases with alternative regulatory regimes. Results The private health system in South Africa has played an important supplementary role in achieving {{universal coverage}} throughout its history, but more especially in the post-Apartheid period. However, the quality of this role has been erratic, influenced predominantly by policy vacillation. The private system expanded rapidly during the 1980 s mainly due to the pre-existence of a mature health insurance system and a weakening public hospital system which could accommodate and facilitate an increased demand for private hospital services. This growth served to expand commercial interest in health insurance, in the form of regulated medical schemes, which until this point took the form of non-commercial occupational (employer-based) schemes. During the 1980 s government acquiesced to industry lobbies arguing for the deregulation of health insurance from 1989, with an extreme deregulation occurring in 1994, evidently in anticipation of the change of government associated with the democratic dispensation. Dramatic unintended consequences followed, with substantial increases in provider and funder costs coinciding with uncontrolled discrimination against poor health risks. Against significant industry opposition, including legal challenges, partial re-regulation took effect from 2000 which removed the discretion of schemes to discriminate against poor health risks. This included: the implementation of a strong regulator of health insurance; the establishment of one allowable vehicle able to provide health insurance; open enrolment, whereby schemes could not refuse membership applications; mandatory minimum benefit requirements; and a prohibition on setting contributions or <b>premiums</b> on the <b>basis</b> of health status. After a two-year lag, dramatically reduced cost trends and contributions became evident. Aside from generally tighter regulation across a range of fronts, this appears related to the need for schemes to compete more on the basis of healthcare provider costs than demographic risk profiles. Despite an incomplete reform improved equitable coverage and cost-containment was nevertheless achieved. A more complete regulatory regime is consequently likely to deepen coverage by: further stabilising and even decreasing costs; enhanced risk pooling; and access for low income groups. This would occur if South Africa: improved the quality of free public services, thereby creating competitive constraints for medical schemes; introduced risk-equalisation, increasing the pressure on schemes to compete on the cost and quality of coverage rather than their risk profile; and through the establishment of improved price regulation. Conclusions The objective of universal coverage can be seen in two dimensions, horizontal extension and vertical deepening. Private systems play an important role in deepening coverage by mobilising revenue from income earners for health services over-and-above the horizontal extension role of public systems and related subsidies. South Africa provides an example of how this natural deepening occurs whether regulated or unregulated. It also demonstrates how poor regulation of mature private systems can severely undermine this role and diminish achievements below attainable levels of social protection. The mature South African system has demonstrated its sensitivity to regulatory design and responds rapidly to changes both positive and negative. When measures to enhance risk pooling are introduced, coverage is expanded and becomes increasingly fair and sustainable. When removed, however, the system becomes less stable and fair as costs rise and people with poor health status are systematically excluded from cover. This susceptibility to regulation therefore presents an opportunity to policymakers to achieve social protection objectives through the strategic management of markets rather than exclusively through less responsive systems based on tax-funded direct provision. This is especially relevant as private markets for healthcare are inevitable, with policy discretion reduced to a choice between functional or dysfunctional regimes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Though {{sovereign}} debts {{are often}} viewed as risk-free assets, some extreme events {{may lead to the}} repudiation of these debts. A large literature has been devoted to the motivations of repayment and to the causes of default. The impact of wars, which may lead to the repudiation of sovereign debt, on sovereign bond prices has also been analyzed. However, the impact of other types of seldom occurring but dramatic events, which may lead to the repudiation of debts, on bond prices has been overlooked. My current research aims to analyze three of them: the repudiation of debts because of their alleged "odiousness", the introduction of common debt after a state's unification and the debt partition following the break-up of a country. Since the events under consideration don't happen frequently, the dissertation will rely on four historical examples: Cuba, Russia, Italy and Belgium. The time period considered is the 19 th century. Based on a historical analysis and the set-up of an original database, this project determines the effects of these events on sovereign debt valorization, using an econometric approach. The first part of the research estimates the risk premium required by investors to hold debts which could be denounced as odious. Bondholders could require a premium to compensate for the higher default risk due to the odious character of the debts. The paper quantifies the risk premium required by investors to hold debts which could be denounced as odious and it analyses the relation between the value of the government bond and extreme "odious debt" events. In order to identify if such a premium exists, I focus on a Cuban case study. Based on an original database of Cuban bonds, the paper reveals the existence of a risk premium of at least 200 basis points which penalises bonds issued by dictatorial regimes. The bond market "odious" shocks are provided by a Structural VAR analysis. In a second case study, my research analyses the Tsarist bonds of 1906 and the premium to hold despotic regime debt. The paper shows that the market required a premium despite the attempts made by the Russian government to present the loan as clean. The second and third parts of my research look at the effects of state succession on the sovereign bonds market. They analyze respectively the two subsets of state succession: state unification and "country break-up". The second part of the dissertation provides an empirical study of sovereign debt integration and analyses the evolution of sovereign bond prices when several countries merge to become a "unified country" or when the probability of such an event exists. Based on an original database made of pre-unification and post-unification Italian bonds, the paper shows the impact of Italy's unification on the bonds. The analysis puts forward that prior to the unification in 1862, the bonds issued by the future parts of the kingdom reacted in an idiosyncratic way. Around the sovereign debt integration, the paper highlights a large risk increase for low-yield bonds. Using a break point analysis and a Dynamic Factor Model, the paper proves that until the late 1860 's the financial market did not believe in Italy's Unification. The third part of my research analyzes the financial impact on state bonds of a country which faces a risk to break up. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the evolution of sovereign debt prices when a state breaks up, or when it faces such an event. Based on an original database of Dutch and Belgian bonds, this research shows the impact of Belgian independence in 1830 on the Belgium bonds. This article analyses two risk premiums which may affect the sovereign debt of a state: the first one is linked to the country break-up (or the probability that one may occur) and the second one is due to the instability experienced by the new country. This analysis puts forward a "country break-up" risk <b>premium</b> of 142 <b>basis</b> points. The role of the debt underwriter has also been highlighted in the case of Belgian independence. Financial markets required no "new country" risk premium for Belgian bonds which were underwritten by Rothschild, but the risk premium remained for the Belgian authorities. This was likely due to the role of Rothschild as underwriter whose reputation persuaded the market that the risk is low, but who charged a premium to the Belgian government for their services.
