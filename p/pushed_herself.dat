500|$|On 17 April 1910, Wallis was {{confirmed}} at Christ Episcopal Church, Baltimore, and between 1912 and 1914 her uncle Warfield {{paid for her}} to attend Oldfields School, the most expensive girls' school in Maryland. There she became a friend of heiress Renée du Pont, a daughter of Senator T. Coleman du Pont of the du Pont family, and Mary Kirk, whose family founded Kirk Silverware. A fellow pupil at one of Wallis's schools recalled, [...] "She was bright, brighter than all of us. She {{made up her mind}} to go {{to the head of the}} class, and she did." [...] Wallis was always immaculately dressed and <b>pushed</b> <b>herself</b> hard to do well. A later biographer wrote of her, [...] "Though Wallis's jaw was too heavy for her to be counted beautiful, her fine violet-blue eyes and petite figure, quick wits, vitality, and capacity for total concentration on her interlocutor ensured that she had many admirers." ...|$|E

500|$|American Life {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, holding {{a score of}} 60/100on music review website Metacritic, based on 17 professional reviews. Billboards Michael Paoletta noted the lyrical differences from past albums such as Ray of Light positively, saying [...] "American Life relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman-in-the-mirror confrontation." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker generally responded well, saying that at its best, the album offers blunt, questing and decisive music but the weakest point was Madonna sounding like a girl who's grown content {{with her husband and}} kids and the ability to hire help to do her bidding. Dimitri Ebrlich of Vibe magazine gave a positive review for American Life, saying that Madonna [...] "stayed still" [...] in the album, and commenting that [...] "This may be the first time Madonna hasn't <b>pushed</b> <b>herself</b> to explore new ground, but at least she's chosen a good place to rest." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a mixed review, stating that American Life is not a [...] "masterpiece" [...] compared to her 1992 studio album, Erotica. [...] "It's frequently self-indulgent, misguided, unpleasant, difficult to listen to, silly and humorless, but it's also consistent, uncompromising and unapologetic," [...] Cinquemani opined, ending with the deduction that American Life stood for the last time Madonna made music without the primary objective of making a hit.|$|E
2500|$|Victor Entertainment {{contacted}} Shōnen Gahōsha about adapting Excel Saga into an anime, and the {{two companies}} approached Rikdo. Shinichi Watanabe was chosen as director. Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements. He says that the Great Will in the manga was [...] "conveyed just as words", and he himself developed its appearance, eventually settling on the [...] "swirling, talking cosmos". He also increased Pedro's role in the story from a single frame in the manga. Watanabe says he was pleased with that aspect of his work, noting that [...] "Pedro's situation was considered unsuitable for broadcast in Japan". The anime production staff was given the freedom to do anything they wanted {{as long as they}} kept the theme of the series intact, and Rikdo requested they created a separate timeline. Rikdo would later become influenced by the anime series due to its quick broadcast in comparison to the monthly schedule of the manga. The anime makes frequent use of parody and in-jokes as comedic devices, with each episode having a genre-based theme. This extends to the animation, with several characters designed in the style of other works, such as those by Leiji Matsumoto. Kotono Mitsuishi was chosen {{to play the role of}} Excel, and Watanabe was impressed with Mitsuishi's rapid delivery of her lines, saying that [...] "she really <b>pushed</b> <b>herself</b> to the limit and beyond". He also says, [...] "at times she was too fast, and there was plenty of time left to match the lip-synch". In such cases, either he would add new material or Mitsuishi would ad-lib. At first Rikdo felt stunned and uncomfortable at hearing Excel speak, but he called the casting [...] "amazing" [...] and was pleased to hear his favourite voice actors read lines from his work.|$|E

60|$|Much of Gertrude's {{society had}} {{consisted}} of that into which Alaric was thrown by {{his friendship with}} Undy Scott.

She had been the widow of Jonathan Golightly, Esq., umquhile sheriff of the city of London, and stockbroker, and when she gave herself and her jointure up to Captain Val, she also brought with her, to enliven the house, a daughter Clementina, the only remaining pledge of her love for the stockbroker.|$|E
6000|$|Then Miss Prettyman paused awhile, {{thinking}} what {{words of wisdom}} would be most appropriate in the present conjuncture. But words of wisdom {{did not seem to}} come easily to her, having for the moment been banished by tenderness of heart. [...] "Come here, my love," [...] she said at last. [...] "Come here, Grace." [...] Slowly Grace got up from her seat and came round, and stood by Miss Prettyman's elbow. Miss Prettyman pushed her chair a little back, and <b>pushed</b> <b>herself</b> a little forward, and stretching out one hand, placed her arm round Grace's waist, and with the other took hold of Grace's hand, and thus drew her down and kissed the girl's forehead and lips. And then Grace found herself kneeling at her friend's feet. [...] "Grace," [...] she said, [...] "do you not know that I love you? Do you not know that I love you dearly?" [...] In answer to this, Grace kissed the withered hand she held in hers, while the warm tears trickled down upon Miss Prettyman's knuckles.

60|$|This was {{a narrow}} escape to me, and I was so frighted that I ventured no more at gold watches a great while. There {{was indeed a}} great many concurring {{circumstances}} in this adventure which assisted to my escape; but the chief was, that the woman whose watch I had pulled at was a fool; that is to say, she was ignorant {{of the nature of}} the attempt, which one would have thought she should not have been, seeing she was wise enough to fasten her watch so that it could not be slipped up. But she was in such a fright that she had no thought about her proper for the discovery; for she, when she felt the pull, screamed out, and <b>pushed</b> <b>herself</b> forward, and put all the people about her into disorder, but said not a word of her watch, or of a pickpocket, for a least two minutes' time, which was time enough for me, and to spare. For as I had cried out behind her, as I have said, and bore myself back in the crowd as she bore forward, there were several people, at least seven or eight, the throng being still moving on, that were got between me and her in that time, and then I crying out 'A pickpocket,' rather sooner than she, or at least as soon, she might as well be the person suspected as I, and the people were confused in their inquiry; whereas, had she with a presence of mind needful on such an occasion, as soon as she felt the pull, not screamed out as she did, but turned immediately round and seized the next body that was behind her, she had infallibly taken me.|$|E
