40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling {{of a typical}} high-speed robotic palletizing process involving two robots using queuing theory {{with the aim of}} providing design guidelines of such a system for dynamic material flows. Under this concept, the two robots are integrated into packaging process by pre-positioning the quickly moving cartons as materials flow on the conveyor, and the specific patterns are formed at a palletizer that is usually located {{at the end of the}} production line. The palletizer stocks the patterned materials on the pallet for delivery or storage. This type of machine is becoming the dominant paradigm in the modern highspeed material handling industries, although its existing design seldom takes the material flow property into consideration. The entire palletizing process is modeled as a One Job-Two Machine model with the queuing theory, and both the stochastic features of arrival and service processes are extracted from the production process using the operational parameters. The established model offers scientific insight into such a highspeed <b>palletizing</b> <b>system.</b> With the theoretical prediction of the performance calculated from this mathematic model, main working parameters can be determined and the design of high-speed <b>palletizing</b> <b>system</b> can be optimized to successfully handle various types of dynamic material flows...|$|E

The tests with the prototype installation show that the <b>palletizing</b> <b>system</b> works more efficient than workers do today. The whole system consists of a two meter parcel-buffer in front of the industrial robot (ABB IRB 6000), a robot control unit, a vision system to detect the parcels dimensions, a new developed gripper system and a PC serving as cell controler. The system can therefore substitute any manual palletizing station. The most important part to maintained is the fast on-line palletizing algorithm and the flexible gripper system.

40|$|When {{designing}} {{the layout of}} the material handling system for a warehouse {{there is a need for}} the analysis of overall system performance. Since warehouses are typically very large and complex systems it is infeasible to build a simulation model for the entire system. Our approach is to divide the system into subsystems that are small enough to be captured in simulation models. These models can then later be assembled to acquire a simulation model of the entire system. In this case study we assess the feasibility of this approach by creating a simulation model of a part of a warehouse and verify whether it can be used to embed it in a larger simulation model. The subsystem we use for our case study is a container unloading and automatic <b>palletizing</b> <b>system.</b> This system is chosen because it has already been studied extensively using another simulation tool. We also do a performance analysis of this system in order to come to an optimal layout for this subsystem as well as to reproduce the results of the earlier study for validation. For our performance analysis we created a chi model of the unloading and palletizing area. The process algebra chi has been extensively used for modeling and simulation of real-time manufacturing systems. Our case study is also used as a means to assess the suitability of chi for modeling and simulation in a logistics environment. Our experiments resulted in roughly the same outcomes as the earlier study. It turns out that for the required throughput the layout chosen in that study is optimal. We also concluded that chi is perfectly suitable for modeling logistic systems. Considering the extensive time it takes to run simulations of a rather small part of a warehouse using chi, we conclude that it is infeasible to perform simulations of entire warehousing systems by integrating the simulation models of all subsystems into one simulation model. To overcome this problem, aggregate modeling can be used...|$|E
40|$|A {{recent report}} {{evaluating}} silica exposure {{levels in the}} metal/nonmetal mining industry noted that bag packaging and loading {{are some of the}} occupations at the greatest risk. In addition to dust problems, the bag-stacking process is labor intensive, making lost-time injuries common due to back fatigue and strains. During the bag-stacking process, a significant amount of dust can be generated, mainly from product {{on the outside of the}} bags and from dust escaping the bag valve upon impact of the bag on the pallet. In an effort to address dust-exposure and back-fatigue issues, Malvern Minerals Co., Hot Springs, Ark., made two major improvements to its ground silica stacking facility. First, the company purchased a semi-automated bag <b>palletizing</b> <b>system</b> (Figure 1). With this system, the bag stacker does not lift the bags, but slides them across a metal table. Small jets of air exit through perforations in the table top (similar to an air hockey game), allowing workers to more easily slide each bag into the proper position. After each layer of bags is completed, the table slides open, and the entire layer of bags is loaded onto an underlying pallet. The table then closes, readying it for another layer of bags. After the entire pallet is loaded, the unit delivers the pallet to a shrink wrap and forklift pick-up area. In addition to this semi-automated palletizing unit, Malvern Minerals purchased an Overhead Air Supply Island System (OASIS) to lower the bag stacker's dust exposure. The OASIS takes outside air, directs it through MEASURING RESPIRABLE DUST The bag stacker's respirable dust exposure was monitored using a RAM- 1 instantaneous dust monitor to evaluate the impact of the various changes on the palletizing process and dust-control equipment. The bag stacker wore a vest that held the 10 -mm Dorr-Oliver cyclone, which classifies the respirable portion of dust. Flexible tygon tubing was used to connect the cyclone to the RAM- 1 dust unit, allowing the bag stacker to perform the palletizing process with minimal interference. The RAM- 1 measures respirable dust concentrations by light scattering with a sensing chamber. This device closely simulates gravimetric measurements when calibrated for a specific dust. This instrument is ideal for comparative evaluations, as was the case in this study. Since the RAM- 1 is not an MSHA-approved instru 2 for dust compliance sampling, the dust concen 2 listed in this article should be used as a com 2 value of respirable dust concentration and not to determine actual dust concentrations from a com 2 standpoint...|$|E

40|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{plants in the}} United States and throughout the world process material that is finely ground and placed into bags for shipping to the consumer. These bags normally range from 50 to 100 pounds in weight. Once the material is placed in these bags, a bag stacker loads the bags onto pallets. A bag stacker is exposed {{to a lot of}} dust that is mainly released by the force from loading the bag onto the pallet. The two main sources are the dust {{on the outside of the}} bag and the dust that escapes from inside the bag as it is loaded. The Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) records indicate the bag stacker's dust exposure is one of the highest of all workers at mineral processing operations. Ways to reduce the dust exposure and strain to the bag stacker are in constant development. Recently, automated systems have been built. These systems range from fully automated, which totally remove the worker from the bag-stacking process, to semi-automated systems, in which the bag stacker still performs some of the functions. This Hazard Control deals with controlling the bag stacker's dust exposure during use of a semi-automated palletizing machine. The worker slides the bags into position on the palletizing machine. Once an entire layer of bags is positioned, the bag stacker operates the controls on the palletizing machine to lower the layer of bags onto the pallet. An air slide is built into the semi-automated palletizing machine so the bags are easier to move. This slide uses a metal table with air jets that exit through small holes at high velocities, similar to an air hockey game. The dust problem occurs because the air slide causes dust to blow up onto the bag stacker, significantly increasing the dust exposure. NIOSH researchers became aware of this problem while working at a mineral processing operation that was having problems with a bag stacker who was overexposed to dust. The air slide on the semi-automated palletizing unit was determined to be the main cause for the high dust concentrations. The impact of the air slide on the bag stacker's dust exposure was found by using real-time dust monitors. Figure 1 shows the bag stacker's average respirable dust exposure while working with product bags of three different mesh sizes when the air slide was either on or off. The bag stacker's respirable dust exposure was 5 to 11 times higher when the air slide was on compared with when it was off. This mineral processing operation used an exhaust ventilation system with an exhaust hood at the back of the palletizing unit. The exhaust ventilation system was not powerful enough to immediately capture the dust blown up from the air slide. An overhead air supply island system (OASIS) was also used to provide an envelope of clean air over the bag stacker. The OASIS at this operation brings in outside air through two different filter stages and directs the clean air down over the bag stacker. This envelope of clean air was not powerful enough to overcome the dust that was being blown up into the bag stacker's breathing zone from the air slide. The key to lowering the bag stacker's dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable concentrations was to make a few simple changes and to slightly modify the bag stacker's work habits. The bag stacker had been leaning out over the air slide table and placing his upper torso in the front part of the exhaust ventilation system capture hood. Therefore, NIOSH researchers suggested that the exhaust hood be modified to make it physically impossible for the bag stacker to place his or her upper torso into the hood (Figure 2). The next modification involved installing plastic stripping around the perimeter of the OASIS. The plastic stripping gave the bag stacker a physical indication of the clean air boundary provided by the OASIS. Testing was repeated after the changes were made to the semi-automated <b>palletizing</b> <b>system.</b> This time, the testing showed that the changes to the system had minimized the impact of air slide contamination to the bag stacker. Once again, three product sizes of mesh bags were evaluated. No increase was found in the bag stacker's dust exposure with two of the products, and only a very slight increase was found with the other product. The changes made to the bag palletizing process accounted for the reductions of the bag stacker's respirable dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable dust concentrations. NIOSH researchers believe that all operators using this type of semi-automated <b>palletizing</b> <b>system</b> need to be aware of the serious dust contamination that can occur to the bag stacker from the air slide. To control high dust exposures from air slides on semi-automated palletizing units (Figure 3), make the following modifications: 1. Use an exhaust ventilation system with an effective hood design to capture the dust generated during the bag stacking process. 2. Use an OASIS to provide an envelope of clean air over the bag stacker. 3. Place plastic stripping around the OASIS to provide a boundary of the clean air from the system. 4. Modify the bag stacker's work practices to have the worker stay within the envelope of clean air provided by the OASIS. NIOSH No. 2002160...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Modern <b>palletizing</b> <b>systems</b> are {{designed}} mainly for performance and flexibility. In today’s competitive scenario, {{the cost of}} palletizing system,its installation lead time and its proper integration with material transport system present inside the plant are the factors of major concern for any industrial engineer. At {{the same time the}} system he designs, should be flexible enough to accommodate some basic anticipated changes with minimum setup time. Industrial Robots and Automated Inline Palletizers are widely used in industries for the palletizing operation. But neither of these provides a complete solution. Eg Automated Inline Palletizers are fast enough but cannot handle situations involving 1. drastic changes in carton sizes and 2. different pallet layer configurations. It is because of lack of programmability. On the contrary, robots are programmable but consumes programming downtime. The present paper proposes a model of an entire palletizing cell which is not only cost effective, but also flexible enough to accommodate frequent changes in sizes of cartons with almost negligible setup time and therefore negligible downtime. The paper describes the schematic configuration of proposed model as well as it explains how this model conquers the limitations of present available palletizing facilities mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} in obtaining high productivity on machining centers is the reduction of auxiliary times consumed with the tool and workpiece change. In the case of workpiece change the auxiliary time is reduced by adopting {{the use of an}} automatic pallet changer system and implicitly of pallets, while in the case of tool change this time is reduced using an automatic tool changer system. The optimization of the constructive and functional parameters of <b>palletizing</b> <b>systems,</b> in the purpose of decreasing auxiliary times, implies increased speed and accelerations, inertia reduction, an optimum transmission ratio, component mechanisms coupled movements, increasing the positioning accuracy of the pallet on the machine table. This paper presents the methodology of transmission ratio optimization of an electric driven pallet changer mechanism; the main purpose is to obtain the maximum acceleration. In order to find the maximum acceleration of the electric driven pallet changing mechanism considered, and thus minimizing the total changing time, we use the equilibrium equation of the moments reduced to the motor shaft. Following the proposed methodology we obtain the maximum acceleration of the considered pallet changer mechanism. Also we issue some constructive indications for future designing of electric driven pallet changer mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the modeling {{of a typical}} high-speed robotic palletizing process involving two robotsusing queuing theory {{with the aim of}} providing design guidelines of such a system for dynamic material flows. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, our calculation is carried out using the queue models and theproduction parameters as given in Section 2. We select three types of performance indexes, i. e. average lengthof queue (Lq), utilization of server (US) and mean waiting time (MWT) in the queue to interpret the predictionof performance of the high-speed <b>palletizing</b> <b>systems</b> to handle the prescribed material flow. Findings: The time average properties of the system, such as the average number of cartons in the system, meanwaiting time, the congestion probability, utilization of machine have been calculated. The calculation resultshave shown that the work performance of the system is related to the characteristics of the material flow, and theproduct design should consider both the time-average parameters and the dynamic features of the material flow. Practical implications: The paper has described a methodology of modeling a high-speed palletizing processwith two robotic servers to handle high-speed dynamic materials flow using the queuing theory technique. Originality/value: Based on the established model, a general design scheme can be derived to show howto consider the dynamic properties through the system design while meeting the prescribed utilization andcongestion requirements of such a process...|$|R
