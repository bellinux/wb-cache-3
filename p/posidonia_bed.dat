40|$|Patterns of {{phytoplankton}} {{in areas}} with seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) and areas without seagrass were quantified in the coast of Chebba (East of Tunisia). Replicate samples were collected at August 2011, from four stations (separated by 500 of metres). The diversity of phytoplankton was high around P. oceanica meadows compared to area without seagrass. A possible explanation to this finding is that water motion and hydrodynamics forces cause leaves agitation allowing the passage of epiphytic species in the water column. Our results also show an increase of abundance of potentially toxic dinoflagellates around <b>Posidonia</b> <b>bed</b> such as Alexandrium minitum, Amphidinium carterae, Karenia selliformis, Coolia monatis, Karlodinium veneficum, Ostreopsis ovata, Prorocentrum concavum, P. minimum, P. rathymum, and P. lima. Installation of fish farms on Posidonia beds should be avoided, not only to preserve this vulnerable habitat, but also to avoid fish contamination by toxic species derived from the resuspension of epiphytic community on seagrass substrata to the water column...|$|E

In all systems investigated, organic matter (as biopolymeric carbon) accumulated in aquaculture impacted sediments. Among the main biochemical classes, lipids appeared to be a good tracer of aquaculture impact, especially in fish-farm sediments. Exoenzymatic activities displayed higher values in sediment beneath the cages, indicating faster organic matter cycling. A significant accumulation of chloroplastic pigments was observed under mussel farms (related to the deposition of faeces and pseudo faeces), but also on fish-farm sediments. The presence of newly deployed cages induced rapid changes in the benthic compartment, and sediments reached rapidly (6 weeks) reducing conditions. Bacterial and total microbial density increased significantly in impacted sediments. Although the contribution of prokaryotic auto-fluorescent cells was very low, fthis component displayed a clear response to organic biodeposition, increasing significantly beneath the cages. Conversely, eukaryotic auto-fluorescent cells decreased. The ratio of benthic auto-fluorescent cells to total bacterial number proved to be a new, sensitive descriptor of biodeposition impact. Heterotrophic bacteria (CFU, and particularly the number of gram-negative bacteria: Cytophaga/Flexibacter-like bacteria) increased significantly in sediments beneath the farm. The similarities and differences observed among sites, latitudes, microbial components and typology of impact (mussel vs. fish farm) are analysed and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{a habitat}} mapping project {{completed}} in 2011, Deakin University {{was commissioned by}} Parks Victoria (PV) to apply the same methodology and ground-truth data to a second, more recent and higher resolution satellite image to create habitat maps for areas within the Corner Inlet and Nooramunga Marine and Coastal Park and Ramsar area. A ground-truth data set using in situ video and still photographs was used to develop and assess predictive models of benthic marine habitat distributions incorporating data from both RapidEye satellite imagery (corrected for atmospheric and water column effects by CSIRO) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) bathymetry. This report describes {{the results of the}} mapping effort as well as the methodology used to produce these habitat maps. Overall accuracies of habitat classifications were good, with error rates similar to or better than the earlier classification (> 73 % and kappa values > 0. 58 for both study localities). The RapidEye classification failed to accurately detect Pyura and reef habitat classes at the Corner Inlet locality, possibly due to differences in spectral frequencies. For comparison, these categories were combined into a ‘non-seagrass’ category, similar to the one used at the Nooramunga locality in the original classification. Habitats predicted with highest accuracies differed from the earlier classification and were Posidonia in Corner Inlet (89 %), and bare sediment (no-visible seagrass class) in Nooramunga (90 %). In the Corner Inlet locality reef and Pyura habitat categories were not distinguishable in the repeated classification and so were combined with bare sediments. The majority of remaining classification errors were due to the misclassification of Zosteraceae as bare sediment and vice versa. Dominant habitats were the same as those from the 2011 classification with some differences in extent. For the Corner Inlet study locality the no-visible seagrass category remained the most extensive (9059 ha), followed by Posidonia (5, 513 ha) and Zosteraceae (5, 504 ha). In Nooramunga no-visible seagrass (6, 294 ha), Zosteraceae (3, 122 ha) and wet saltmarsh (1, 562 ha) habitat classes were most dominant. Change detection analyses between the 2009 and 2011 imagery were undertaken as part of this project, following the analyses presented in Monk et al. (2011) and incorporating error estimates from both classifications. These analyses indicated some shifts in classification between Posidonia and Zosteraceae as well as a general reduction in the area of Zosteraceae. Issues with classification of mixed beds were apparent, particularly in the main <b>Posidonia</b> <b>bed</b> at Nooramunga where a mosaic of Zosteraceae and Posidonia was seen that was not evident in the ALOS classification. Results of a reanalysis of the 1998 - 2009 change detection illustrating effects of binning of mixed beds is also provided as an appendix. This work has been successful in providing baseline maps at an improved level of detail using a repeatable method meaning that any future changes in intertidal and shallow water marine habitats may be assessed in a consistent way with quantitative error assessments. In wider use, these maps should also allow improved conservation planning, advance fisheries and catchment management, and progress infrastructure planning to limit impacts on the Inlet environment. <br /...|$|E

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the effects of the large Mediterranean {{seagrass}} Posidonia oceanica on coastal waves and wave-induced flows, which has significant implications for coastal protection. Investigations were made on both a natural shallow Posidonia oceanica bed and, in controlled conditions of full-scale Posidonia mimics under regular and irregular waves. In the field, waves and currents were monitored during low energy conditions and a Mistral wind event. Data were collected on the distribution of Posidonia patches, density and canopy height, as well as bed sediment type and bathymetry. In the flume, measurements were made of water surface elevation along the flume and oscillatory flows at 3 locations and 4 elevations, under several wave conditions, water depths and for 2 canopy densities. The mimics were designed carefully to recreate the hydraulic behaviour of Posidonia plants under waves. Field results indicate that shallow Posidonia meadows are effective at reducing wave energy under low wave energy conditions and small wave amplitudes. The flume experiments confirm this trend. Under both regular and irregular waves, drag coefficients decrease with increasing Reynolds vegetation numbers; wave dissipation factors decrease with wave orbital amplitude. Under spectral waves, most wave energy dissipation occurs at the peak spectral frequency and it is largest for the least energetic wave spectra. At high wave Reynolds numbers, the canopyinduced hydraulic roughness (r) appears to be a function of the canopy element density only, and the empirical formula of Nielsen (1992) is successfully applied. However, more work is required in low energy conditions to examine the range of validity of the formula. In natural conditions under small amplitude waves, attenuation of wave-induced flows is negligible in the upper canopy; flume experiments confirm this trend. The typical flow intensification at the canopy top, measured for other seagrasses, occurs only for tests with the largest wave amplitudes, whilst, under smaller waves, flow intensification is located within {{the upper part of the}} canopy. In the lower canopy, flows are always reduced and flows decelerate exponentially with increasing orbital amplitude. This is a novel observation in flexible canopies. The artificial canopy, like the natural <b>Posidonia</b> <b>bed,</b> enhances flow asymmetries at the canopy top, especially under waves with large wave orbital amplitudes. This is thought to be a mechanism to enhance shoreward drift. Turbulence in the artificial canopy, under regular waves, peaks at the canopy top, as occurs under unidirectional flows and for other seagrass beds exposed to waves. Vertical turbulent exchanges are enhanced at the edge of the seagrass patch and are larger for lower submergence ratios (the ratio of canopy height to water depth). A reduction in submergence ratio in the flume, also causes increased shear stresses at the top of the canopy, lower wave height decay and reduced oscillatory flow attenuation in the lower part of the canopy. The denser canopy, in the conditions tested, increases relative roughness (r/A), wave attenuation, in canopy oscillatory flow reduction and turbulent kinetic energy at the top of the canopy. Oscillatory flows characterised by small orbital amplitudes can penetrate further into the canopy than larger orbital velocities, inducing a larger drag, thus increasing wave dissipation, as proposed for rigid canopies (corals). This is manifested as a thinner canopy boundary layer under small orbital amplitude waves than the large amplitude waves. A conceptual model is proposed to summarise these findings. Under storm conditions Posidonia is believed to be less efficient at reducing wave energy, however it remains effective at reducing sediment transport locally and, by inducing a preferential shoreward drift, at preventing sand dispersal offshor...|$|E

40|$|Sea. Abstract. During 1986 and 1987 a decapod {{crustacean}} taxocoenosis of <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>beds</b> {{from the}} southeast of Spain has been studied. Data on abundance-dominance of the 50 species found {{and other information}} such as reproduction and the selective use of gastropod shells by the dominant hermit crabs are given. Differences in richness and equitability between shallow (3 ^ 1 m) and deeper (5 - 7 m) samples are also shown. The taxocoenosis presents a geometrical distribution in which only 9 species have a relative abundance higher than 1 % and in which the structure is basically controlled by the two dominant hermit crabs, Cestopagurus limidus and Calcinus lubularis, and hydrodynamic conditions.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{detailed}} cartographic survey carried out by Side Scan Sonar and a towed underwater video camera during 2005, and from a series of historical maps (1959, 1980, 1990), an extensive regression of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile beds was evidenced for a vast area of the central Tyrrhenian Sea (Latium coast, Italy). The total loss of P. oceanica surface was assessed through GIS estimate. In 1959, the <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> extended over 7290 ha, while in the 2005 survey they had regressed to 2899 ha, a loss of about 60 % of their coverage. Also the seagrass lower limit showed a general depth decrease in time. Total seagrass coverage loss and lower limit regression were not uniform along the whole investigated areas and three main sub-areas have been identified with different degrees of regression somehow related with coastal potential human-mediated impacts. From different coverage estimates of the present survey and of the previous maps, minimum sampling areas were calculated through bootstrapping simulation routines from small sampling areas (Landscape Units) to reach the nearest estimate of the observed condition in the different periods...|$|R
30|$|In each case, a {{large and}} rather {{symmetric}} peak between C 21 and C 32 with a maximum at C 27 {{is followed by a}} smaller, asymmetric peak displaced towards C 23 (Fig.  5 b). We can make a reasonable hypothesis on the origins of these variations. The scuttling of the French Mediterranean fleet on the 27 th of November 1942 (Antier 1992) is the only recent event that might have initiated such a massive release of hydrocarbons. One hundred and seventeen ships were sunk, and all naval dockyard facilities destroyed. While the sabotage operation lasted for 2  h, fires and explosions continued for several days. Huge quantities of toxic waste released from the destroyed ships, docks, buildings, munitions and fuel were added to the harbour sediments. This massive and rapid pollution of the entire Toulon Bay was followed by a long period of recovery which prolonged, even though more moderately, the contamination of the bay. The 1942 cataclysm also has biological correlates in the sediment record. The level (20 – 30  cm) corresponding to the scuttling of the fleet is associated with a transition from grey, clay <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds</b> to grey <b>beds</b> of decaying <b>Posidonia</b> debris, testimony to a strong perturbation of the underwater biological habitat.|$|R

Among motile invertebrates associated to Posidonia meadows,  polychaete borers of the plant sheaths represent a unique group which exploit a peculiar microhabitat. They belong to the family Eunicidae with three dominant species, Lysidice collaris, L. ninetta and L. unicornis. Due to their strong association with Posidonia shoots, these animals are particularly suitable to study the plant and animal spatial relationships and their pattern of variability. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of these animals (Index of Borer, IB) at different spatial and temporal (summer vs winter) scales in two Posidonia meadows off the Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples, Italy), which are exposed to different degrees of human impact and of hydrological conditions.

40|$|Mariculture in Croatia {{could play}} a more {{important}} role in development of rural communities along coastline. However, by increase of fish farming, public concern over environmental issues has been raised, {{and the need for}} more responsible mariculture development and management has been asked. There are opportunities and challenges for effectively integrating mariculture into coastal zone management with equal rights and obligations. This is primarily because of its social and economic mission consisting in preventing de-population of rural coastal areas and islands and meeting the growing needs of tourist market for seafood. Although intensive mariculture production is accused of producing negative environmental effects, many of these effects still need to be scientifically documented. The effect of nitrogen and phosphorous releases from farmed fish faeces or uneaten food is not of significant issues for marine ecosystem, and it is generally of little importance compared to the inflow of nutrients from other coastal sources. The impact on sediment and benthic communities is mainly local and short-term ones, and depends on the number and extent of the farms and their location. Recovery of some benthic communities after the cessation of farming activities may be delayed over several years (i. e. <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds)</b> due to the accumulated organic matter. Bluefin tuna farming if not properly located and managed might cause pollution problems, either from uneaten feed and metabolic waste or from harvesting and processing the fish. In most cases the problem comes from smell pollution during the summer time and the oily water surface that may be widespread much outside of the farm areas.

The above are considered in the context of the initial assessment of the hydrocarbon potential of specific locales. The structure of the entire Ionian zone is the result of its evolution from the initial stages, through the formation of boundary faults comprising its limits, to its final emergence during the compressional phase that caused the tectonic inversion of the initially formed extentional structures. During the incipient stages in the evolution of the Ionian basin the activation of listric normal faults brought about its internal differentiation into rotational sub-basins. Those listric faults were reactivated during the compressional orogenetic phase as overthrusts. The diversity which characterizes the assembling parts of the Ionian zone is best depicted in the distribution of the Jurassic formations. Their presence or absence is indicative of the paleogeograghical setting ranging from the deepest to the totally emergent parts of the distinctive sub-basins respectively. Structures indicative of the presence of a ‘‘decollement’’ surface at depth are present in the studied part of the Ionian zone. These structures were formed during the compressional phase. The ‘‘decollement’’ zone is represented by the level of the Triassic evaporites. Structures encountered along E-W generally oriented sections are studied in the context of the ‘‘ramp-flat geometry’’ prevailing in such cases and are interpreted either as ‘‘ramp anticlines’’, or ‘‘imbricate faults’’, or ‘‘fault-propagation folds’’. Areas characterized by the presence of the above structures are mainly the zones adjacent to the present-day principal tectonic lines representing eminent overthrust surfaces such as the Paramythia and the Margariti thrusts in the central and external Ionian zone respectively. The local presence of the entire Jurassic sequence, and especially the Lower <b>Posidonia</b> <b>Beds,</b> along the crestal part of anticlinal structures provides a manifestation of the effect of tectonic inversion, along previously formed listric faults, on the relocation of originally deep-seated parts of the sub-basins. The present-day distribution of the Jurassic facies combined with the observed structures provide the means for the further division of the Ionian zone into distinctive paleogeographic-structural units. The internal Ionian zone extends up to the first appearance of the Epirus-Akarnania flysch, the central Ionian zone is composed of three units while two units can be distinguished in the external Ionian zone. The tectonic movements which caused the internal differentiation of the Ionian basin into sub-basins, combined with the locally suitable physico-chemical conditions, favored the deposition in the deepest parts of the rotational sub-basins of the most important source-rock of the Ionian zone, i. e. the Lower <b>Posidonia</b> <b>beds.</b> The rest of the potential source-rocks are the shale interbeds that make part of the Triassic evaporites and the shale horizons in the Upper Siliceous Zone of the Vigla limestones. In the northern part of the Ionian zone, close to the borders with Albania, a very rich organic-matter horizon was first located, spanning the Cenomanian-Touronian boundary. This horizon is representative of an anoxic event which has been recorded on a global scale. The maturation degree of the potential source rocks appears to vary from place to place. The possible effect of thrust tectonics, with the ensuing more pronounced burial, on the acceleration of the maturation process should also be considered. On the basis of microscopic observations effected on limestone samples collected along sections located in the distinctive assembling parts of the Ionian zone and ranging in age from the Lower Cretaceous Vigla formation to the Paleocene-Eocene limestones, three (3) principal facies were distinguished. The above facies entity comprises on the whole a tourbiditic sequence with the low energy facies on bottom of the sequence and the respective high energy ones on top. Their distribution frequency is a function of both, the particular formation concerned and the specific prevailing sedimentological conditions. Porosity and permeability measurements on the above mentioned samples exemplify in the vast majority of the cases the negligible values of their petrophysical properties. The determining crucial factor is the high content of lime mud observed in the samples. Relatively high measurable values of the above petrophysical properties, recorded in a few samples, are mainly ascribed to secondary solution related mechanisms. Under those circumstances secondary processes, and especially the formation of fracture porosity, become of crucial importance in light of the evaluation of the calcareous series formations as potential reservoir rocks.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} fish farm biodeposition on benthic bacteria, thraustochytrid protists, and heterotrophic protozoa (nanoflagellates and ciliates) in an oligotrophic area of the Mediterranean Sea. The fish farm impact was investigated both on a seagrass (<b>Posidonia</b> oceanica) <b>bed</b> and on soft bottom sediments. In both systems, sediment samples were collected with a multicontrol sampling strategy (i. e., beneath the fish farm and at three control sites per system). The uneaten food pellets supplied to the fish determined the accumulation of sediment organic matter and the enhancement of protein content in impacted sediments (both seagrass bed and soft sediments). In both systems, the abundance and biomass of heterotrophic protists increased significantly beneath the fish farm, but {{the structure of the}} protist assemblages responded differently in vegetated and unvegetated sediments. Thraustochytrid abundance increased significantly in impacted seagrass. These results provide evidence that the structure of protist assemblages respond significantly to fish farm biodeposition and indicate that the monitoring of these benthic components provides complementary information for the assessment of the fish farm impact on the benthic systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Posidonia oceanica meadow {{constitutes}} a key ecosystem in the sub-littoral {{zone of the}} Mediterranean, from both an ecological and physical equilibrium per-spective. In addition, it harbors a very high species diversity. <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>beds</b> {{are very sensitive to}} disturbances caused by human activity (e. g. coastal development, pol-lution, turbidity, anchoring, etc.) and their loss has been observed in a number of regions. The aim of the monitoring of P. oceanica meadows along the Provence and French Riviera coasts is (i) to evidence possible new losses and (ii) to evaluate through a biological indi-cator the efficiency of regional policies (e. g. setting up of sewage treatment plants, reduc-tion in industrial and domestic pollution levels in the rivers flowing towards the Mediterranean, establishment of Marine Protected Areas, banning of new harbors and reclamations). Monitoring tools operate at three scales: (i) system scale (aerial photo-graphs, measurement of bottom cover, permanent transects), (ii) meadow scale (e. g. photographs of Posidonia around cement markers positioned along meadow limits, shoot-density, permanent quadrats) and (iii) shoot scale (e. g. plagiotopic to orthotropic rhizome ratio, laying bare of the rhizomes, lepidochronology, leaf epiphytes, leaf biome...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} of one week, from May 8 to 15, 2013, {{acoustic}} data was gathered at three locations over a <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>bed</b> in the Bay of Revellata, Corsica. Preliminary analysis of the acoustic data shows that the environmental noise field in the band 2 - 7 kHz was dominant during the period. The noise in this band is generally associated with wind and surface agitation. However, the noise power was not significantly correlated with wind speed. On the contrary, the diel cycle of the noise power at three locations was highly correlated with the water column concentration of O 2, as measured by optodes. These measurements of environmental noise have confirmed the correlation between active acoustic signals transmitted along a seagrass meadow and the photosynthetic activity of the plants observed in a previous experiment conducted in the same area. The results suggest that acoustic noise {{can be used as}} a proxy for the photosynthetic oxygen production of a Posidonia oceanica meadow. Therefore, this work is a contribution for the development of a low cost passive acoustic system to assess the primary production of coastal ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{abundance}} {{and diversity of}} organisms along habitat edges {{has long been a}} key research focus in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Previous investigations into edge effects in seagrass ecosystems have predominantly focussed on the seagrass–sandy substrate boundary. However, little is known about what role other habitats (e. g. rocky algal reefs) may play in faunal assemblage patterns. This study investigated the strength to which habitat type influenced gastropod assemblages within seagrass (<b>Posidonia</b> australis) <b>beds,</b> bordered by both sandy substrate and rocky algal reef. We found that benthic invertebrate community composition significantly changed with distance from rocky algal reef, but not with distance from sandy substrate. Proximity to rocky reef had a stronger effect on community composition than other local drivers examined (seagrass biomass and sand particle size). We hypothesise that gastropod affinity for rocky algal reef may be a result of both species-specific habitat preference, and lower predation pressure along adjacent rocky algal reef habitats. This study provides evidence that heterogeneous habitats within close proximity to seagrass beds may exert previously overlooked effects on the distribution of gastropod assemblages, highlighting the need for the inclusion of adjacent habitat type in experimental design for gastropod assemblage distribution studies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the ambient noise acquired {{during the period}} of one week, from May 8 to 15, 2013 over a <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>bed</b> in the Bay of la Revellata, Calvi, Corsica. The acoustic receivers were moored at 3 locations with water depth ranging from 2 to 20 m. Simultaneously with acoustic measurements, the dissolved O 2 was measured by an array of optodes. The noise field in the band 2 - 7 kHz was dominant. The noise directionality and bottom reflectivity estimated using a short vertical array show a diurnal variability pattern. The mean noise power measured at all receivers shows also a diurnal variability pattern, which is negatively correlated with the O 2 dissolved in the water. Changes in noise power between the night (highest noise power) and day period (lowest noise power) as high as 5 dB were observed at the various locations. These results suggest that the ambient noise power and directionality are correlated with the photosynthetic activity of the seagrass meadow and that a passive acoustic system can be used to monitor the O 2 production of the meadow. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Seagrass {{communities}} are {{considered one of}} the most productive and complex marine ecosystems. Seagrasses belong to a small group of 66 species that can form extensive meadows in all coastal areas of our planet. <b>Posidonia</b> oceanica <b>beds</b> are the most characteristic ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea, and should be constantly monitored, preserved and maintained, as specified by EU Habitats Directive for priority habitats. Underwater 3 D imaging by means of still or video cameras can allow a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of these meadows, but also of the seafloor morphology and integrity. Video-photographic devices and open source software for acquiring and managing 3 D optical data rapidly became more and more effective and economically viable, making underwater 3 D mapping an easier task to carry out. 3 D reconstruction of the underwater scene can be obtained with photogrammetric techniques that require just one or more digital cameras, also in stereo configuration. In this work we present the preliminary results of a pilot 3 D mapping project applied to the P. oceanica meadow in the Marine Protected Area of Capo Rizzuto (KR, Calabria Region – Italy) ...|$|R
