40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reap the {{benefits}} promised by the Smart Grid, communications between the IEDs in IEC 61850 Substation Automation System (SAS) will need to be made much more secure. Traditional security solutions based on <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> Infrastructure (PKI) are calculation intensive and introduces latency that will be difficult to meet substation environmental and electrical requirements, so they are not well suited for IEC 61850 SAS. Identity based encryption (IBE) schemes, introduced by Shamir in 1984 [5] are based on the idea to use participant’s unique identities as <b>public</b> <b>key</b> and <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>directories</b> are unnecessary. Thus, utilizing IBE in IEC 61850 SAS is a reasonable choice. This paper briefly introduces the features of IEC 61850 SAS communication security and IBE and then propose an IBE-based Self Private Key Generated (SPKG) encryption scheme to establish encryption system in IEC 61850 SAS. Advantages of this SPKG Scheme are also discussed in the paper...|$|R

QCM programs maintain a database distributed among the nodes of a loosely-coupled network and interact by exchanging digitally-signed database queries and responses.

Target applications range from basic network services, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), to high-level applications, such as certificate-based content filtering for web browsers.

The chip contains a file (SOD) that stores hash values of all files stored in the chip (picture, fingerprint, etc.) and a digital signature of these hashes. The digital signature is made using a document signing key which itself is signed by a country signing key. If a file in the chip (e.g. the picture) is changed, this can be detected since the hash value is incorrect. Readers need access to all used public country keys to check whether the digital signature is generated by a trusted country. Using PA is mandatory. According to a September 2011 United States Central Intelligence Agency document released by Wikileaks in December 2014, [...] "Although falsified e-passports {{will not have the}} correct digital signature, inspectors may not detect the fraud if the passports are from countries that do not participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Directory</b> (ICAO PKD).

40|$|At present, {{electronic}} payment activities constructed on the Internet mainly employ the certificate-based <b>public</b> <b>key</b> cryptosystems to solve related security issues. But {{it is based}} on the condition that the certificate authority (CA) must be honest and needs to manage the <b>key</b> <b>directory.</b> Furthermore, it needs to spend extra time to verify the signature signed in the digital certificate by the CA. For the considerations of efficiency, a secure {{electronic payment}} system proposed in this paper is developed by using elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) instead of modular exponentiation schemes, because ECC possess fewer bits achieving the same security level as other <b>public</b> <b>key</b> cryptosystems. In this paper we have designed a session key exchange scheme and a blind signature scheme for the e-cash based payment systems using the self-certified <b>public</b> <b>key</b> cryptosystems based on ECC. In summary, the proposed efficient self-certified <b>public</b> <b>key</b> cryptosystems make the on-line electronic payment system securely workable.

50|$|Using {{asymmetric}} key cryptography, the originator obtains a <b>public</b> <b>key</b> from the <b>directory</b> node {{to send an}} encrypted message to the first ("entry") node, establishing a connection and a shared secret ("session key"). Using the established encrypted link to the entry node, the originator can then relay a message through the first node to a second node in the chain using encryption that only the second node, and not the first, can decrypt. When the second node receives the message, it establishes a connection with the first node. While this extends the encrypted link from the originator, the second node cannot determine whether the first node is the originator or just another node in the circuit. The originator can then send a message through {{the first and second}} nodes to a third node, encrypted such that only the third node is able to decrypt it. The third, as with the second, becomes linked to the originator but connects only with the second. This process can be repeated to build larger and larger chains, but is typically limited to preserve performance.|$|R

The Marine Corps wants to further leverage the capabilities of the Internet by moving more applications to the NIPRNET, however, security threats have restricted the type of information that can be exchanged across public networks. The Internet's open design enables message interception, monitoring and forgery; therefore, the Marine Corps is reluctant to use the Internet for transmitting sensitive information. <b>Public</b> <b>key</b> cryptography is becoming the foundation for electronic operations that require security and authentication in open networks. The use of <b>public</b> <b>key</b> cryptography requires a <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> Infrastructure (PKI) to publish and manage <b>public</b> <b>key</b> values. The objective of a PKI is to provide authentication, confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation of data. In conjunction with DoD PKI development efforts, the Marine Corps will develop and implement PKI services to protected information currently exchanged across the Internet and to enable the use of automated applications. This thesis begins by describing <b>public</b> <b>key</b> cryptography, the requirements for a PKI, and the components necessary to operate a PKI. Next, a preliminary USMC PKI roadmap is developed, including objectives and strategies for Marine Corps implementation efforts.
