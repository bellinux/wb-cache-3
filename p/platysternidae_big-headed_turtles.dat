50|$|The Madagascan <b>big-headed</b> <b>turtle</b> (Erymnochelys madagascariensis) is {{a turtle}} {{native to the}} waters of {{permanent}} slow moving rivers and lakes in western Madagascar. These turtles, although they are critically endangered (the 13th most endangered turtle, according to the top 25 most endangered turtles list, issued May 2003), they are commonly eaten for food {{but they are still}} commonly shipped from Madagascar to Asia to help meet the demand of Asia's traditional medicine market. A captive breeding program has also been started to prevent the species from becoming extinct. The Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF) intends to raise USD$5.6 million to cover a five-year 'Global Action Plan' which includes captive breeding and reintroduction projects, trade monitoring, new rescue centers, local conservation plans, and educational programs.|$|R
40|$|Asian turtles have {{declined}} substantially {{in recent decades}} because of the large-scale collection of wild individuals for the food, pet, and medicine trades. This has hampered studies into the ecology and natural history of turtles in their natural habitats because many species have become so rare that they are simply unavailable for study. One way to re-establish or supplement these turtle populations is through translocation (either of wild-caught individuals or those raised in farms). However, successful translocation is partly dependent upon released individuals maintaining site fidelity. We translocated 16 <b>big-headed</b> <b>turtles,</b> Platysternon megacephalum, in southern China to study their movements and microhabitat use in the wild and use this information to evaluate the feasibility of translocation as a conservation technique for this species. Translocated turtles generally moved short distances (daily range: 0 - 89. 6 m), with males moving further than females and both sexes moving further at night than during the day. Additionally, <b>big-headed</b> <b>turtles</b> rarely used terrestrial habitats (the maximum distance an individual was located from the stream was 5. 8 m) and remained hidden in refugia most of the time. Some sex differences in microhabitat use were also apparent; females were visible less often, spent more time on land (which coincided with the nesting season), remained closer to the stream bank, used shallower water, and used different types of refugia than males. The very short distances that bigheaded turtles moved, combined with their consistent fidelity to the stream and cryptic behavior, all suggest that this species {{would be a good}} candidate for larger-scale translocation experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first published study of movement patterns and habitat use of translocated semiaquatic or aquatic turtles outside of Europe and the first published radiotelemetry study of turtles from mainland China...|$|R

Instead, we analyzed the embryos of a soft-shelled turtle species with highly emarginated skull. In fact, soft-shelled turtles have only a narrow bar of bone across the temporal region lateral to the external adductor muscles due to large scale emargination from the dorsal and ventral margins of the cheek (Ogushi, 1911, Sheil, 2003). In normal development of soft-shelled turtles, the postorbital bone does not grow in a posterior direction significantly, keeping its relatively small size within the dermatocranium (Sheil, 2003;Sánchez-Villagra et al.,, Sánchez-Villagra et al., Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2009). Therefore, the small postorbital bone of soft-shelled turtles does not largely contribute {{to the formation of}} a bony roof at the temporal region of the skull.|$|R

50|$|Turtle Conservancy began a {{collaborative}} effort - along with assistance from the Andrew Sabin Family foundation, Josiah T. Austin, and the Desert Tortoise Council - of acquiring 43,000 acres {{of land in the}} state of Durango, Mexico. Located in the Chihuahuan Desert, this land is noted for being prime habitat of Bolson Tortoise (Gopherus flavomarginatus), as well as other species of plants and animals essential to maintaining the biodiversity of the area. The goal of this project is to preserve the largest intact population of Bolson Tortoise remaining, and would be functioning as a long-term re-introduction plan with the Turner Endangered Species Fund. Founder Eric Goode traveled to Madagascar to meet with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) to discuss the status of the Critically Endangered Ploughshare Tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora). The following year, the IUCN held a Red List workshop in Madagascar to reclassify the endemic IUCN listed species, at which the Turtle Conservancy attended and assisted in drafting an Action Plan for Radiated Tortoise (Astrochelys radiata), Flat-tailed Tortoise (Pyxis planicauda), Madagascar <b>Big-headed</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), and the Critically Endangered Ploughshare Tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora).|$|R
40|$|Populations of the <b>big-headed</b> <b>turtle</b> Platysternon megacephalum {{are declining}} at {{unprecedented}} rates across {{most of its}} distribution in Southeast Asia owing to unsustainable harvest for pet, food, and Chinese medicine markets. Research on Asian freshwater turtles becomes more challenging as populations decline and basic ecological information is needed to inform conservation efforts. We examined fecal samples collected from P. megacephalum in five streams in Hong Kong to quantify the diet, and we compared the germination success of ingested and uningested seeds. Fruits, primarily of Machilus spp., were most frequently consumed, followed by insects, plant matter, crabs and mollusks. The niche breadth of adults was wider than that of juveniles. Diet composition differed between sites, which may be attributable {{to the history of}} illegal trapping at some sites, which reduced the proportion of larger and older individuals. Digestion of Machilus spp. fruits by P. megacephalum enhanced germination success of seeds by about 30 %. However, most digested seeds are likely defecated in water in this highly aquatic species, which limits the potential benefit to dispersal. The results of our study can be used by conservation-related captive breeding programs to ensure a more optimal diet is provided to captive P. megacephalum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract.; The <b>big-headed</b> <b>turtle</b> (Platysternon megacephalum) {{is heavily}} {{harvested}} to support tremendous demands from food and pet markets, and thus its ecology remains poorly understood. The presence of self-sustaining pop-ulations in Hong Kong (22 ° 09 ’- 22 ° 37 ’N, 113 ° 50 ’- 114 ° 30 ’E) provides important opportunities to advance our under-standing of this species. We employed mark-recapture surveying, radio-tracking of two gravid females, and directed streamside searches {{to document the}} reproductive ecology of the species between September 2009 and June 2011 in Hong Kong. We found seven gravid females between 20 - 27 June 2010 and 2011, and which subsequently oviposited on average three eggs (range 2 - 8), with mean length and width of 36 mm and 21 mm, in early July. There was positive correlation between the size of females and clutch sizes. We found one clutch in leaf litter 1. 6 m away from the stream, which hatched between 14 to 18 October. The incubation period {{was estimated to be}} between 103 and 110 days. The results of this study provide important information to formulate conservation plan for this endangered species...|$|R
40|$|The <b>big-headed</b> <b>turtle</b> Platysternon megacephalum is a stream-dwelling species whose ecology {{is poorly}} known. We carried out field and {{laboratory}} investigations to determine field body temperatures and thermal preference of this species. In the field, the body temperatures of the turtles conformed {{to the water}} temperature, with little diel variation in either summer or autumn. Over the diel cycle, the mean body temperatures ranged from 20. 8 °C to 22. 2 °C in summer and from 19. 3 °C to 21. 2 °C in autumn; the highest body temperatures ranged from 22. 1 °C to 25. 0 °C in summer and from 20. 6 °C to 23. 8 °C in autumn. In the laboratory, the preferred body temperature (Tp) was 25. 3 °C. Food intake was maximized at 24. 0 °C, whereas locomotor perfor­mance peaked at 30. 0 °C. Consequently, Tp was closer to the thermal optimum for food intake than for locomotion. Therefore, this freshwater turtle has relative low field body temperatures corresponding to its thermal environment. In addition, the turtle prefers low temperatures and has a low optimal temperature for food intake [Current Zoology 59 (5) : 626 – 632, 2013]...|$|R

The now extinct tortoises species, Aldabrachelys grandidieri and Aldabrachelys abrupta, {{as well as}} the extant species, Astrochelys yniphora, Astrochelys radiata, Pyxis planicauda, and Pyxis arachnoides, all occurred in the arid bush and in the mosaic of dry forests and wooded savannahs from south to northwestern regions of the island. The aquatic Madagascar <b>Big-headed</b> <b>Turtle,</b> Erymnochelys madagascariensis, occurs in rivers and large lakes in western Madagascar. These species all have delayed maturity offset by a prolonged reproductive lifespan. They also have a moderate annual reproductive output that includes multiple small clutches of eggs within a season, thus their intrinsic population growth rates are low. The last two decades have brought an increased under-standing of the demographic vulnerability of Madagascan chelonians to overexploitation. Particularly significant are the drivers of population dynamics relating to adult mortality and fecundity. The maximum level of harvest that their populations can sustain is low and is already greatly exceeded in most locations.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>big-headed</b> <b>turtle</b> (Platysternon megacephalum) {{from east}} Asia {{is the sole}} living {{representative}} of a poorly-studied turtle lineage (Platysternidae). It has no close living relatives, and its phylogenetic position within turtles {{is one of the}} outstanding controversies in turtle systematics. Platysternon was traditionally considered to be close to snapping turtles (Chelydridae) based on some studies of its morphology and mitochondrial (mt) DNA, however, other studies of morphology and nuclear (nu) DNA do not support that hypothesis. Results We sequenced the complete mt genome of Platysternon and the nearly complete mt genomes of two other relevant turtles and compared them to turtle mt genomes from the literature to form the largest molecular dataset used to date to address this issue. The resulting phylogeny robustly rejects the placement of Platysternon with Chelydridae, but instead shows that it {{is a member of the}} Testudinoidea, a diverse, nearly globally-distributed group that includes pond turtles and tortoises. We also discovered that Platysternon mtDNA has large-scale gene rearrangements and possesses two, nearly identical, control regions, features that distinguish it from all other studied turtles. Conclusion Our study robustly determines the phylogenetic placement of Platysternon and provides a well-resolved outline of major turtle lineages, while demonstrating the significantly greater resolving power of comparing large amounts of mt sequence over that of short fragments. Earlier phylogenies placing Platysternon with chelydrids required a temporal gap in the fossil record that is now unnecessary. The duplicated control regions and gene rearrangements of the Platysternon mtDNA probably resulted from the duplication of part of the genome and then the subsequent loss of redundant genes. Although it is possible that having two control regions may provide some advantage, explaining why the control regions would be maintained while some of the duplicated genes were eroded, examples of this are rare. So far, duplicated control regions have been reported for mt genomes from just 12 clades of metazoans, including Platysternon. </p...|$|R
