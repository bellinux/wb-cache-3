5|$|A New York Metropolitan staging was in 1996 under James Levine, {{a revival}} of John Dexter's 1978 {{production}} with stage designs by Josef Svoboda. In 2005 The Bartered Bride returned to New York, at the Juilliard School theatre, in a new production by Eve Shapiro, conducted by Mark Stringer. In its May 2009 <b>production</b> <b>at</b> the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Opera Boston transplanted the action to 1934, in the small Iowan town of Spillville, once {{the home of a}} large Czech settlement.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near Blackbird canyon {{in the side of}} a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started <b>production</b> <b>at</b> the site.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of <b>production</b> <b>at</b> the time. The 1902 total annual <b>production</b> <b>at</b> Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E

5|$|Aluminum production, shipbuilding, {{and nuclear}} <b>production</b> <b>at</b> the Hanford site {{contributed to a}} rapid {{increase}} in regional demand for electricity.
