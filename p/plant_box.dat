50|$|Following World War II, Ashdown's economy {{began to}} diversify. Its {{location}} near two rivers attracted manufacturing plants, such as Coca-Cola bottling <b>plant,</b> <b>box</b> factory, clothing plant, ice plant and a pallet plant. The United States Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Little River and Saline River at their confluence in 1966, forming Millwood Lake. The lake's recreational value attracted a Nekoosa Paper Company paper mill two years later, still in operation today after being purchased by Domtar. The Little River Memorial Hospital was also built {{during this period}} of rapid building and development.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{financier}} {{to bring}} about Ireland's vision was James J. Hill, a Methodist {{and the president of}} the Great Northern Railway. Despite being Protestant, Hill's wife, Mary, was a devout Roman Catholic and the half-million-dollar gift and endowment to start the seminary were in honor of her. Being overly dedicated to even the smallest aspects of the new seminary project, Hill's influence over the completed project could be seen on a larger scale in that the six initial buildings were made to look like a train depot (the seminary administration building), a steam engine (gymnasium and physical <b>plant),</b> <b>box</b> cars (Cretin, Grace (though constructed in 1913), and Loras halls), a refectory, and a roundhouse (school building). The seminary complex was designed by architect Cass Gilbert, who also designed the Minnesota State Capitol. When the seminary was finally completed, Archbishop John Ireland shared his inspiration and desires for the new seminary in his address at the seminary's dedication on September 4, 1895 saying, ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} pilot data {{derived from}} a newly installed 3 -dimensional instrumented pole <b>plant</b> <b>box</b> and offers comparisons between the forces produced in vaults performed over three difference approach distances. Data was collected from an elite male pole vaulter performing 2 -step, 4 -step and 8 -step approaches, with the resulting force profiles compared to determine differences in forces produced during the vaults. Utilising the force data a typical vault was characterised into four phases. Noticeable force increases were observed in the two horizontal planes as the approach distance increased, especially {{in the first and}} third phases of the vault. Timing changes in the phases of the vault were also observed, with {{the second phase of the}} vault decreasing in time and the third phase increasing in duration as the approach distance increased. Further investigation is required, however it appears the middle two phases are the most likely to change with different vaults, and therefore may be crucial to the execution of successful jumps in pole vault...|$|E

40|$|Eucalyptus largiflorens (Black Box) is {{the most}} common tree in the Chowilla anabranch system on the Murray River floodplain. It {{typically}} has dull, glaucous, grey-green leaves. Occasional trees with smaller, glossy green leaves (Green Box) occur scattered amongst the Black Box. In areas with increasing salinity, they usually appear much healthier than adjacent, normal Black Box trees. Green <b>Box</b> <b>plants</b> are intermediate between normal Eucalyptus largiflorens plants and Eucalyptus gracilis plants in many morphological and allozyme characters, strongly suggesting that they are hybrids between those species. Green <b>Box</b> <b>plants</b> tolerate salinity better and use water more conservatively than normal Black <b>Box</b> <b>plants,</b> traits that they have probably inherited from Eucalyptus gracilis. In 1994, the Botanic Gardens of Adelaide used tissue culture and micropropagation to produce nearly 9, 000 cloned Green <b>Box</b> <b>plants</b> which were planted out on Riverland floodplains. Since the 1990 s, the high cost of producing clonal plants has meant that no further such plantings have occurred.

50|$|The {{building}} {{has been considered}} one of the best examples of modernisme architecture, but Noucentisme supporters performed several modifications to the original structure. In 1943, Raimon Duran i Reynals signed a refurbishing project for the ground floor, designed by Francisco Ferrer Bartolomé according to an assignment by Loewe so as to open a store. This project included the disappearance of the modernist windows and the ground floor feminine modernist <b>plant</b> <b>boxes</b> made by Eusebi Arnau, which were destroyed on the sidewalk using picks. The building caretaker later recovered the feminine heads, which were sold to Salvador Dalí, who installed them in Figuere's Teatre-Museu Dalí's patio.|$|R

50|$|Sub-irrigated planter (SIP) is {{a generic}} {{name for a}} special type of <b>planting</b> <b>box</b> used in {{container}} gardening and commercial landscaping. A SIP is any method of watering plants where the water is introduced from the bottom, allowing the water to soak upwards to the plant through capillary action. It is possible to automate the watering and thus SIPs are popular with professional landscapers in buildings or urban settings. SIPs are available as products, under brand names such as Planter Technology (commercial) and EarthBox (consumer), Ollie Plant Sipper (consumer), Octopot (consumer), The Refuge Garden (consumer/commercial) or as do-it-yourself projects made from plastic buckets and boxes.|$|R
