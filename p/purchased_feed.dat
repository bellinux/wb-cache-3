40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{explains}} {{the status of}} livestock feed resources and market situations in Welmera and Dendi weredas of West Shoa Zone, Ethiopia. The objective of the survey {{was to assess the}} potentials and constraints of feed resources and related marketing practices and suggest appropriate intervention options to overcome the constraints. Majority (76 %) of the interviewed farmers have faced shortage of livestock feeds. The diminishing trend of grazing land from time to time, roughage, concentrate feeds are the factors contributing to feed shortage. Moreover, the increasing trend in selling price of hay and concentrate feeds aggravates more to the problem. This situation is limiting livestock productiv in the highlands of Ethiopia. Under this condition, farmers <b>purchase</b> <b>feeds</b> to both local and crossbred animals.

40|$|This study quantifies the {{environmental}} impact of milk production of Italian Mediterranean buffaloes and points out the farm characteristics that mainly affect their environmental performance. Life cycle assessment was applied in a sample of 6 farms. The functional unit was 1 kg of normalized buffalo milk (LBN), with a reference milk fat and protein content of 8. 3 and 4. 73 %, respectively. The system boundaries included the agricultural phase of the buffalo milk chain from cradle to farm gate. An economic criterion was adopted to allocate the impacts on milk production. Impact categories investigated were global warming (GW), abiotic depletion (AD), photochemical ozone formation (PO), acidification (AC), and eutrophication (EU). The contribution to the total results of the following farm activities were investigated: (1) on-farm energy consumption, (2) manure management, (3) manure application, (4) on-farm feed production (comprising production and application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides), (5) <b>purchased</b> <b>feed</b> production, (6) enteric fermentation, and (7) transport of purchased feeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides from producers to farms. Global warming associated with 1 kg of LBN resulted in 5. 07 kg of CO₂ Eq [coefficient of variation (CV) = 21. 9 %], AD was 3. 5 × 10 (- 3) kg of Sb Eq (CV= 51. 7 %), PO was 6. 8 × 10 (- 4) kg of C₂H₄ Eq (CV= 28. 8 %), AC was 6. 5 × 10 (- 2) kg of SO₂ Eq (CV= 30. 3 %), and EU was 3. 3 × 10 (- 2) kg of PO₄(3 -) Eq (CV= 36. 5 %). The contribution of enteric fermentation and manure application to GW is 37 and 20 %, respectively; on-farm consumption, on-farm feed production, and <b>purchased</b> <b>feed</b> production are the main contributors to AD; about 70 % of PO is due to enteric fermentation; manure management and manure application are responsible for 55 and 25 % of AC and 25 and 55 % of EU, respectively. Methane and N₂O are responsible for 44 and 43 % of GW, respectively. Crude oil consumption is responsible for about 72 % of AD; contribution of CH 4 to PO is 77 %; NH₃ is the main contributor to AC (92 %); NO₃(-) and NH₃ are responsible for 55 and 41 % of EU, respectively; contribution of P to EU is only 3. 2 %. The main characteristics explaining the significant variability of life cycle assessment are milk productivity and amount of <b>purchased</b> <b>feed</b> per kilogram of LBN.

About 67 % (32 kg ha- 1 yr- 1) of farm inputs of P in <b>purchased</b> <b>feeds</b> and fertilisers do not leave in milk or cattle. The Dutch government defined decreasing maximum permitted nutrient surplusses for the period 1998 – 2008, at 9 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 for P.

40|$|A {{nutrient}} balance approach {{is often used}} to quantify losses of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, that contribute to environmental problems such as eutrophication. A {{nutrient balance}} generally is computed at farm level, implying that nutrient losses related to pre-farm processes, such as production of <b>purchased</b> <b>feed,</b> are neglected. Using a nutrient balance at farm level to benchmark livestock systems or individual farms that differ in, for example, amount of purchased concentrates, however, may lead to biased conclusions. To determine whether a nutrient balance that accounts for losses during production of <b>purchased</b> <b>feed</b> (i. e. a chain balance from cradle-to-farm-gate) are more suited to benchmark nutrient losses of milk production systems or individual farms than a nutrient balance at farm level, we analysed 19 Irish grass-based dairy farms and 13 Dutch concentrate-based dairy farms. For each farm, we computed nitrogen and phosphorus losses at farm and chain level (i. e. from cradle-to-farm-gate, including losses from <b>purchased</b> <b>feed</b> production), and expressed these losses per ton fat-and-protein-corrected milk. An independent T-test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test were used to examine the difference in mean losses at farm and chain level between Irish and Dutch systems. Regression analysis was used to determine if the ranking of the farms changes using a nutrient balance at farm or chain level. Results show that on average, Irish farms had higher nitrogen losses per ton milk than Dutch farms, both at farm (Irish = 20; Dutch = 8 in kg N/ton milk) and chain level (Irish = 22; Dutch = 11 in kg N/ton milk). Phosphorus losses per ton milk, on the other hand, did not differ between Irish and Dutch farms at farm (Irish = 0. 3; Dutch = 0. 1 in kg P/ton milk) or chain level (Irish = 0. 8; Dutch = 1. 0 in kg P/ton milk). Regression analysis revealed that the nutrient balance at chain level could be accurately predicted from the nutrient balance at farm level (R 2 = 0. 992 for N; R 2 = 0. 910 for P); whereas in case of phosphorus, the slope tended to differ between Irish and Dutch farms (p < 0. 10). Ranking 32 farms based on the nitrogen balance at farm or chain level, therefore, showed a similar pattern, whereas the ranking pattern based on the phosphorus farm balance differed from the pattern based on the chain balance. We concluded, therefore, that to benchmark nutrient losses of dairy systems, a nutrient balance at farm level can be used if differences in on-farm losses between systems are large, and pre-farm losses related to, e. g. production of purchased concentrates, are relatively unimportant. To benchmark individual farms, a nutrient balance at farm level can be used only if changes in pre-farm losses per unit change in on-farm losses are similar across farms. A chain level balance of a sample set, however, is required to verify these conditions. </p...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of the project were to assess heavy metal flows on livestock farms {{and to develop a}} strategy to reduce heavy metal inputs into animal manures. For the experiments 20 farms with animal husbandry in various regions of Germany were selected. On the farms the inputs and outputs of the elements copper and zinc, as well as lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel were balanced at the stable level. The effect of abatement measures was evaluated using a calculation tool for stable balances. It is shown, the main input pathways for heavy metals into animal manures are, apart from copper disinfectants, feeding stuffs and feed supplements. Home grown feeds are the major source of heavy metal input into the stable because they are fed in large quantities. However, the heavy metal content of the home grown feeds in particular of roughages for ruminants is low. <b>Purchased</b> <b>feed</b> stuffs (supplementary feeding stuffs and complete feeding stuffs) were found to have a higher content of heavy metals (due to supplementation with trace elements) compared to home grown feeds. Thus, pig and poultry husbandry rather than ruminant husbandry is susceptible to heavy metal accumulation of manures. Heavy metals are cycling within the farm which is of importance when discussing the environmental impact. The turnover within the farm can hardly be controlled by the farmer. Thus, effective strategies have to be targeted at the inputs, e. g. the <b>purchased</b> <b>feed</b> stuffs. A main option to reduce the heavy metal input is to lower the trace element concentrations in supplementary feed stuffs either by legislation of maximum threshold values (e. g. EG 1334 / 2003) or by volunteer agreements of the feed industry and agriculture. In addition, the absorption of copper and zinc by the animals should be improved using better absorbable trace element compounds and phytase. (orig.)
