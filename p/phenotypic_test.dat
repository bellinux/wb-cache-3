50|$|In {{patients}} who have persistently detectable viral loads while taking ART, tests {{can be done to}} investigate whether there is drug resistance. Most commonly a genotype is sequenced which can be compared with databases of other HIV viral genotypes and resistance profiles to predict response to therapy. If there is extensive resistance a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> of a patient's virus against a range of drug concentrations can be performed, but is expensive and can take several weeks, so genotypes are generally preferred. Using information from a genotype or phenotype, a regimen of 3 drugs from at least 2 classes is constructed that will have the highest probability of suppressing the virus. If a regimen cannot be constructed from recommended first line agents it is termed salvage therapy, and when 6 or more drugs are needed it is termed mega-HAART.|$|E

40|$|Sugar beet, Beta vulgaris, is an {{important}} crop for the global sugar industry {{being one of the}} two major crops cultivated for sugar production. In the USA, the sugar beet root aphid, Pemphigus betae, is a regionally occurring pest which damages sugar beets by feeding on their secondary roots which results in reduced biomass and hence a lower yield. To date, the best alternative to control the aphids is by use of resistant varieties. To find such resistance and to introduce it in plant material by plant breeding it is necessary to have a precise and fast selection method for the resistance. In modern plant breeding more and more of useful plant characteristics are selected for via molecular markers. 	A locus on sugar beet chromosome I is known to harbor resistance to the root aphid, but the markers flanking the locus were too far from the actual gene(s) to be really useful for selections. The aim of this master thesis was to fine map the resistance locus by means of sequencing to enable identification of SNPs in close proximity of the locus and by conducting a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> under greenhouse conditions. The <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> showed varying results, but was still a useful complement to the marker analysis. Several lines scored fairly consistent, while other lines had plants which scored anything between susceptible and resistant. However, in most cases the results from the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> were comparable to earlier phenotypic data from a field test, and part of the variation was because there still was segregation among sugar beet offspring but most likely also due to escapes from infestation. Since the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> was a pilot test there were some aspects that could be improved, for instance the selection of soil type. 	The results from the sequencing showed that nearly 50 % of the DNA targets were polymorphic. The other half of the DNA targets turned out to be either monomorphic or failed due to technical reasons or difficulties in amplification of the locus. From the fine mapping, five SNP markers were found {{in the vicinity of the}} interval where the resistance locus was previously mapped, making it possible to narrow down the resistance locus. The recombination frequency of the two markers closest to the resistance locus was 1. 6 %. Although the new markers can be utilized in marker-assisted breeding for the sugar beet root aphid resistance, recombinant events are still present between the two markers suggesting that further narrowing-down of the interval would be feasible...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two ways}} to assess the {{susceptibility}} of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to ganciclovir (GCV) : one is a genotypic test that detects resistance-related mutations and the other is a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> that actually assesses susceptibility. The advantages of genotyping the UL 97 gene are its rapidity and accuracy. However, to detect novel mutations or mutations affecting the UL 54 DNA polymerase, a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> such as the plaque reduction assay (PRA) is also required. To avoid the shortcomings of PRA such as its time-consuming nature and labor-intensiveness, we developed a time-saving fluorescence-activated cell sorting (TS-FACS) technique. We obtained a GCV 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) from five clinical isolates and an HCMV laboratory strain (AD 169) and compared the results with those from the PRA. The laboratory strain and three clinical isolates were sensitive to GCV. Although there was a minor discrepancy in the case of one of the three isolates, the GCV IC 50 values obtained by TS-FACS analysis correlated well with the results of the PRA. The remaining two isolates were resistant to GCV; one was GCV resistant due to the mutation M 460 V, and the GCV IC 50 results obtained by TS-FACS analysis and by PRA were also comparable. The advantages of TS-FACS analysis are the shorter time required, the possibility of automation, and its comparability to PRA, considered the gold standard. Thus, TS-FACS analysis may be useful as an alternative to PRA in the clinic...|$|E

Seventeen patients who were tested by Trofile were enrolled. UDPS of the V 3 loop region was carried out on both plasma RNA and proviral DNA. Genotypic prediction of co‐receptor usage was established by position‐specific score matrices (PSSM) and confirmed, in discordant cases, with geno 2 pheno. Genetic heterogeneity of the RNA and DNA quasispecies was assessed as well. A total of 196   729  V 3 sequences were considered (mean coverage per site, 6346). Concordance between <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> and UDPS with PSSM was 0. 82. Geno 2 pheno results were in line with those obtained with PSSM.

40|$|Laribacter hongkongensis is a gram-negative {{emerging}} bacterium {{that has}} been isolated from patients with underlying liver diseases and is associated with gastroenteritis and traveler’s diarrhea. Freshwater fish are postulated to be the reservoir of this bacterium and a possible source for human infections. Previous study showed that the bacterium targets liver and causes histopathological changes in adult zebrafish. The {{first part of the}} present study therefore aims to evaluate the histopathological effect of the bacterium in liver of grass carps and to investigate the association between recovery of L. hongkongensis and liver histopathological changes. The livers of the grass carps were grossly unremarkable and they were categorized into either necrosis, steatosis, or no abnormality detected upon professional examinations of the tissue sections. Statistical analysis indicated that there was no association between the recovery of L. hongkongensis from the intestines and the histopathological changes in the livers of grass carps. The second part of the study aims to study the extended-spectrum ß- lactamase (ESBL) phenotype and ESBL genes in L. hongkongensis fish isolates. Using the ESBL <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test</b> recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), 8 out of 14 fish isolates were shown to be ESBL-positive. However, further PCR tests could not detect the presence of any ESBL genes (TEM, SHV, OXA- 1 or CTX-M). Among these 8 isolates, ampC gene was detected in 6 of 8 isolates using PCR. The inconsistent phenotypic and genotypic results prompted the investigation of the role of AmpC on the ESBL phenotype. To examine the effect of AmpC on ESBL phenotype, boronic acid (BA), which was shown to be an effective AmpC inhibitor, was included in the ESBL <b>phenotypic</b> <b>test.</b> Addition of BA diminished the ESBL phenotype in all the 8 isolates. The absence of AmpC amplification in 2 of 8 isolates with ESBL phenotype may be due to primer mismatch and deserves further follow-up to confirm its presence. Altogether, these results suggested that the CLSI ESBL phenotypes previously identified were possibly due to the presence of AmpC β-lactamase. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E
