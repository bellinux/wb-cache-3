The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study brain biomechanics between contact and non-contact head impact during vehicle crash tests in head kinematics, global brain injury metrics, and region brain strain. Nine array accelerometer package data from dummy head were extracted from 13 lateral and 14 rigid <b>pole</b> crash <b>tests</b> conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Head accelerations, HIC values and their duration were computed. Cumulative strain damage measure 15 % (CSDM), dilatational damage measure (DDM), and relative motion damage measure (RMDM) were studied using SIMon finite element head model (FEHM). Averaged regional brain strains were conducted by grouping brain element in SIMon FEHM into frontal, parietal, occipital, cerebellum, fronix and brain stem region. Head contact occurred in two lateral and six rigid <b>pole</b> <b>tests.</b> Head contact durations were less than one millisecond in rigid <b>pole</b> <b>tests</b> and ranged from 3 - 7 ms in lateral impact tests. The ratio of biomechanical measurements between contact and non-contact cases in lateral tests were: translational acceleration 4 x, rotational acceleration 3. 5 x, HIC 12 x, and CSDM 5 x, regional brain 1. 5 x. The ratios were higher for rigid pole tests: translational acceleration 14 x, rotational acceleration 25. 7 x, HIC 29. 5 x, CSDM 12 x, regional brain strain 1. 5 - 3 x. Head accelerations, HIC values, DDM and RMDM increased with increasing rotational accelerations. They were the lowest in non-head contact rigid <b>pole</b> <b>tests,</b> followed by non-contact lateral impact tests, contact lateral impact tests, and the highest in head contact rigid <b>pole</b> <b>tests.</b> However, CSDM values were higher in lateral <b>tests</b> than rigid <b>pole</b> <b>tests</b> for head contact cases, indicating a higher chance of diffused axonal injury in head contact lateral impact tests.

This is in contrast with that commonly obtained in a laboratory test, in which strength is generally related to wood density. Using pole circumference data obtained in the field, an attempt was made to establish equation which describes pole height - circumference relationship for some selected species. Two forms of equations were tried, namely: Y = AXB and Y = A + BX. The exponential form turned out to be of a better fit.

Methods:twenty-five legs in 23 diabetic patients suffering from leg ischaemia were examined prospectively. A laser Doppler probe was attached to the pulp of the first toe to monitor perfusion continuously before and after occluding the arterial inflow with a cuff and during elevation of the leg until perfusion disappeared (the <b>pole</b> <b>test).</b> At ankle level the examinations were made similarly but with an ankle cuff and a hand-held Doppler. Results:in the 44 % (11 / 25) of the legs where it was possible to compare cuff blood pressure at ankle level with the <b>pole</b> <b>test,</b> the cuff measurements were significantly higher (p< 0. 01).
