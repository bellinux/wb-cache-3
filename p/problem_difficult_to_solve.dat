Configurable on chip {{multiprocessor}} systems combine {{advantages of}} task-level parallelism and {{the flexibility of}} field-programmable devices to customize architectures for parallel programs, thereby alleviating technological limitations due to memory bandwidth and power consumption.

Under strong convexity assumptions, we show that our algorithm converges linearly. In addition, we give a finite convergence result about the support of the solution, based on which we further accelerate the algorithm by a two-stage method. We present extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets which demonstrate the superiority of our methods over some state-of-the-art methods for both binary- and multi-class SVMs. Comment: in Pattern analysis and application, 201...|$|E
40|$|Scene graph based {{applications}} for 3 D graphics normally supports event listeners {{in order to}} interact with displayed data.

Visual Value 3 D should mainly {{be used as a}} complement framework for scene graphs with demands on complex dependencies. Designing dependencies between scene graph objects and attributes is easily made with Visual Value 3 D since the entire scene graph with including dependencies is expressed in xml. ...|$|E

In such interaction, either absolute breakup of the system to three independent bodies, survival of the binary star, or replacement of one component of the binary by the heavier body would occur - an exchange collision. If the replacement is to happen, the exchanged body is ejected away from the system with high velocity and such effect we call Hills mechanism. In such case the binary star usually has higher binding energy and is much more resistant if such situation were to occur again. However, Hills' results are not sufficient e. g. for effects within {{the core of our}} galaxy. Using numerical integration we modelled approximations of binary stars to a third, heavier body, thanks to which we could verify Hills' results and expand on them with initial conditions which are more suited to situations occuring within the core of our galaxy...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the decoherence of a solid-state spin qubit, ei-ther that of a localized electron spin or a donor nucleus, caused by a nuclear spin bath relevant to semiconductor quantum computer architectures.

The qubit spin dephasing due to this random magnetic field depends intricately on the quantum dynamics of the nuclear spin bath, making the coupled decoherence <b>problem</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve.</b> We pro-vide a formally exact solution of this non-Markovian quantum decoherence problem which numerically calculates accurate spin decoherence at short times, of particular relevance in solid-state spin quantum computer architectures.
