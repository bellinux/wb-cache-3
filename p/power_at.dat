5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their <b>power</b> <b>at</b> GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply <b>power</b> <b>at</b> the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more <b>power</b> <b>at</b> lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations.

Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

A total of 300poer poles were brought down; consequently, {{nearly a quarter of}} Taiwan residents lost <b>power</b> <b>at</b> the height of the storm.
