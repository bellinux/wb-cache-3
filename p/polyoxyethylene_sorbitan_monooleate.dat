40|$|In this {{manuscript}} a synthetic methodology for developing sub 20 nm sized polymeric micellar nanoparticles designed for extravascular imaging and therapy is revealed. A simple, one-pot method is followed, which involves a rapid co-self-assembly of an amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PS-b-PAA) and <b>polyoxyethylene</b> (80) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> in water. <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> imparts stability to the micelles {{and helps to}} drive down the particle size below 20 nm. The particles are incorporated with a water soluble dye ADS 832 WS, which absorbs in the near infrared range (λ_(ex) = 832 nm) for sensitive detection with optical and photoacoustic imaging techniques. A candidate lipophilic anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent fumagillin was also incorporated with high entrapment (> 95 %) efficiency. The effectiveness of this theranostic platform for real-time, high-resolution intraoperative photoacoustic imaging for facilitating direct assessment of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in breast cancer staging is demonstrated. The technique offers huge potential providing faster resection of SLN and may minimize complications caused by axillary exploration due to mismarking with dyes or low-resolution imaging techniques. Finally, the biodistribution and organ accumulation of the intravenously and intradermally injected particles are studied in a rodent model by optical imaging.

We previously reported that the bioavailability of CoQ 10 powder was less than 10 %. In this study, we investigated various preparations to improve the intestinal absorption of CoQ 10 with focus {{on the effect of}} emulsification. We prepared a suspension and some emulsions with four types of surfactants and investigated the plasma concentration profile after oral administration to rats. The absorption of CoQ 10 was improved by an emulsion formulation although there was little absorption of CoQ 10 when a suspension was administered. However, little CoQ 10 was absorbed in the bile duct-ligated group even when the emulsion formulation was administered (about 50 % of the control group). Bile and emulsion formulation are essential for absorption of CoQ 10. When the preparations containing Tween 20 (polysorbate (20) sorbitan monolaurate) and Tween 80 (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> (20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> were administered, plasma concentrations of CoQ 10 were higher than those obtained with preparations containing Tween 65 (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> (20) <b>sorbitan</b> tristearate) and Span 20 (sorbitan monolaurate).

SANS data suggests that some d-P 80 already penetrates the particle core at 5 %. However, the content of d-P 80 is still low enough not to significantly change the internal Fd (3) over barm structure of the LCNP. At higher fractions of P 80 a phase separation occurs, in which a SPC and P 80 rich phase is formed at the particle surface.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the potential of cellulose acetate membrane for preparation of formulated water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsions by repeated premix membrane emulsification. The effects of selective membrane emulsification process parameters (concentration of the emulsifiers, number of passes of the emulsions through the membrane, and storage temperature) on the properties and stability of W/O/W emulsions were also investigated. The preparation of multiple W/O/W emulsions by repeated premix membrane emulsification (ME) using cellulose acetate membrane (0. 8 µm mean pore size) has proposed in this study to reduce low stability problem of the emulsions. A coarse emulsion was passed through the same membrane five times at a constant pressure of 0. 3 MPa to minimize the droplets size and to increase the uniformity of droplets size. About 7 wt. % polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and 0. 5 - 10 wt. % Tween 80 (<b>Polyoxyethylene</b> (20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> were used as lipophilic and hydrophilic emulsifiers, respectively. In addition, 1, 3, 6, 8 -pyrenetetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTSA) was used as a hydrophilic model ingredient for the encapsulation of bioactive substances. By using 7 wt. % PGPR concentration and 0. 5 wt. % Tween 80 concentrations, the most uniform particles with minimum mean size of oil drops (9. 926 µm) were obtained after four passes through the membrane. The encapsulation efficiency greater than 70 % was achieved after emulsions storage at 4 °C for seven days with amount of serum about 41. 02 %. It can be concluded that cellulose acetate membrane does not possess very high potential for preparing a stable W/O/W emulsion by repeated premix membrane emulsification.

The MSKE-loaded microemulsions were prepared by using the spontaneous emulsification method. Isopropyl myristate (IPM) was selected as the oil phase. A <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> and sorbitan monododecanoate (1 : 1, w/w) system was used as the surfactant phase; an aqueous mixture of different cosurfactants (absolute ethanol, 96. 3 % v/v ethanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -propanol or 1, 2 -propanediol) at a weight ratio of 1 : 1 was used as the aqueous phase. Among the cosurfactants studied, the 1 -propanol aqueous mixture had the largest microemulsion region (48. 93 %) in the pseudo-ternary phase diagram. Microemulsions containing 1 % MSKE demonstrated good physicochemical stability during a six-month study period at 25 ± 2 °C/ 60 % ± 5 % RH. The ex vivo skin permeation study demonstrated that the microemulsions exhibited a potent skin enhancement effect allowing MSKE to penetrate skin layers up to 60 -fold higher compared with the control. Neither skin irritation nor skin corrosion was observed in ex vivo studies. The present study revealed that IPM-based microemulsion systems may be promising carriers to enhance skin penetration and delivering MSKE for topical treatment...|$|E
40|$|Emulsifiers {{are used}} in ice cream to produce a dry, smooth {{textured}} product with desireable melting properties. They function by promoting a partial destabilization of the fat emulsion. Polyoxythylene sorbitan monooleate is used very commonly in the ice cream industry for this purpose. The objective {{of this research was}} to examine by transmission electron microscopy the differences in the fat globules in typical ice cream mix emulsions prepared with and without 0. 08 % <b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate.</b> Ice cream mix was combined 3 : 1 with a 2 % solultion of ultralow gelling temperature agarose at 20 degrees C, fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde, postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in imidazole/phosphate buffer, embedded in Spurr resin and thin-sectioned for viewing. The emulsifier reduced the number of casein micelles adsorbed to the fat globules as determined by both TEM and quantification of membrane protein with Kjeldahl analyses. The fat/Serum interfacial tension was also significantly reduced by the presence of emulsifier in the mix. The data suggest that emulsifiers promote fat destabilization through reduction of membrane protein, based on their ability to reduce the fat serum interfacial tension. In the presence of crystallized fat, the emulsion then becomes less stable to shear forces during the whipping and freezing of ice cream...|$|E
40|$|Micro-nanoencapsulated {{phase change}} {{materials}} (M-NEPCMs) are proposed {{to be useful}} in liquid desiccant dehumidification by restraining the temperature rise in the moisture-removal process and improving the dehumidification efficiency. In this paper, the n-octadecane M-NEPCMs with desirable thermal properties for internally-cooled dehumidification were fabricated by using compound emulsifiers through the in-situ polymerization method. Melamine-formaldehyde resin {{was used as the}} shell material. The effects of the mixing ratio, emulsification methods and amount of the compound emulsifiers on the morphology, size and thermal properties of the M-NEPCMs were investigated experimentally. The optimum weight mixing ratio of the compound emulsifiers is SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) :Tween 80 (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> :Span 80 (sorbitan monooleate) = 0. 1 : 0. 6 : 0. 3, which achieves the best stability of the n-octadecane emulsion. When the compound emulsifiers are 10 wt. % of the core material, the melting enthalpy of M-NEPCMs reaches its maximum of 145. 26 J/g of capsules, with an encapsulation efficiency of 62. 88 % and a mean diameter of 636 nm. The sub-cooling of the prepared M-NEPCMs is lower than 3 °C, with an acceptable thermal reliability after the thermal cycling test. A pre-emulsification prior to the addition of deionized water in the emulsification is beneficial to the morphology of the capsules, as the phase change enthalpy can be increased by 123. 7 %...|$|E
50|$|The use of biosurfactants {{as a way}} {{to remove}} {{petroleum}} from contaminated sites has been studied and found to be safe and effective in the removal of petroleum products from soil. Other studies found that surfactants are often more toxic than the oil that is being dispersed, and the combination of the oil and the surfactant can be more toxic than either alone. Biosurfactants were not used by BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. However, unprecedented amounts of Corexit (active ingredient: dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> (Tween-80)), were sprayed directly into the ocean at the leak and on the sea-water's surface, the theory being that the surfactants isolate droplets of oil, making it easier for petroleum-consuming microbes to digest the oil.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of coconut oil and different surfactants on stability of nanoemulsions that were prepared by simple homogenization (13, 500 rpm, 10 minutes). Coconut oil, sunflower oil and castor oil at the concentration of 20 - 40 % w/w were used as the oil phase. Polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80 and Cremophore RH 40 were used as surfactant whereas <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> and polyethylene glycol 400 were used as co-surfactants. The formulations containing coconut oil in the range of 20 - 40 % w/w and the ratio of polysorbate 80 to <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> of 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 provided nano-sized emulsions (100 - 500 nm). The zeta potential values ranged from- 41. 51 to- 16. 97 mV. The prepared nanoemulsions were stable for at least 7 days at 8 C. The temperature cycling test (storage at 4 C for 24 hours and at 45 C for 24 hours) was performed. It was found that the formulation containing 30 % w/w of coconut oil, 22. 5 % w/w of polysorbate 80 and 7. 5 % w/w of <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> was stable for 1 cycle. The results indicated that a decrease in the concentration of surfactant and an increase in the concentration of oil affected the stability of nanoemulsions...|$|R
