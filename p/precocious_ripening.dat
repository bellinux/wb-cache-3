Recent studies on thinning olives using ethephon (ethylene-releasing product) have shown that it can induce precocious pigmentation of drupes when pulverized just after fruit set [8]. Ethylene-releasing chemicals cause the <b>precocious</b> <b>ripening</b> of climacteric fruits, both attached and detached, {{but only if they}} are treated during the pre-climacteric period [9]. It also causes <b>precocious</b> <b>ripening</b> of non-climacteric fruits (i.e., cherries and grapes) when applied only a few days before normal ripening [10 – 13].|$|E

Nevertheless, the fruits from olive trees treated at fruit set reached veraison 2  weeks before the control olives. This advancement in fruit ripening {{is accompanied by a}} significant and rapid increase in fruit accumulation of anthocyanin. In fruit from treated olive trees at veraison, ethephon leads to an immediate and intense stimulation of the anthocyanins’ synthesis which accompanies the precocious softening of the fruits. These results are in agreement with those of Rujini and his collaborators [30] who showed that ethephon applied 30  days after pit hardening at 2000  ppm causes precocity of the olives « Giarraffa » variety with a significant increase in anthocyanin content. The same authors assume that the effect of ethylene is dependent on the respiratory ratio: ethephon treatments will have a marked effect on olive ripening only when applied prior to the appearance of the maximum respiratory ratio. This is why ethylene-releasing chemical treatments, generally applied to olive trees during the pre-harvest period to facilitate fruit abscission, do not appreciably affect fruit ripening. On the other hand, some work on non-climacteric fruits (cherries, figs, and grapes) showed that ethephon causes <b>precocious</b> <b>ripening</b> when applied only a few days before normal maturation [10 – 13].|$|E
