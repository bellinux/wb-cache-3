Although the Christmas tree had been {{introduced}} in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country. In the early 19th century {{there had been a}} revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in <b>popularity</b> over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's <b>popularity</b> in Britain.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the rising musical styles, {{especially}} grunge, {{began to take}} their places as the dominant styles in the mainstream, which resulted in heavy metal music losing <b>popularity</b> and going underground for a decade. Many Christian metal musicians began to play extreme metal, and soon death metal replaced thrash metal in <b>popularity.</b> Audiences in many underground metal scenes began favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular styles. As with other glam metal acts of the time, Stryper lost <b>popularity</b> and split up in 1993.|$|E

40|$|Caching at {{the base}} {{stations}} brings the contents closer to the users, reduces the traffic through the backhaul links, and reduces the delay experienced by the cellular users. The cellular network operator may charge the content providers for caching their contents. Moreover, content providers may lose their users if the users are not getting their desired quality of service, such as maximum tolerable delay in Video on Demand services. In this paper, we study the collaborative caching problem for a multicell-coordinated system {{from the point of}} view of minimizing the total cost paid by the content providers. We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program and prove its NP-completeness. We also provide an online caching algorithm that does not require any knowledge about the contents <b>popularities.</b> We prove that the online algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O((n)), and we show that the best competitive ratio that any online algorithm can achieve is Ω((n) /(n)). Therefore, our proposed caching algorithm is provably efficient. Through simulations, we show that our online algorithm performs very close to the optimal offline collaborative scheme, and can outperform it when contents <b>popularities</b> are not properly estimated...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} data {{broadcasting}} over multiple channels consists in partitioning data among channels, depending on data <b>popularities,</b> and then cyclically transmitting them over each channel {{so that the}} average waiting time of the clients is minimized. Such a problem {{is known to be}} polynomially time solvable for uniform length data items, while it is computationally intractable for non-uniform length data items. In this paper, two new heuristics are proposed which exploit a novel characterization of optimal solutions for the special case of two channels and data items of uniform lengths. Sub-optimal solutions for the most general case of an arbitrary number of channels and data items of non-uniform lengths are provided. The first heuristic, called Greedy+, combines the novel characterization with the known greedy approach, while the second heuristic, called Dlinear, combines the same characterization with the dynamic programming technique. Such heuristics have been tested on benchmarks whose <b>popularities</b> are characterized by Zipf distributions. The experimental tests reveal that Dlinear finds optimal solutions almost always, requiring good running times, while Greedy+ is faster and scales well when changes occur on the input parameters, but provides worse solutions than Dlinear...|$|R

Our model integrates two basic properties of nodes in social networks: homophily and preferential connection to popular nodes. We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference, based on a novel nonconjugate variant of stochastic variational inference. We evaluate the link prediction accuracy of our algorithm on nine real-world networks with up to 60, 000 nodes, and on simulated networks with degree distributions that follow a power law. We demonstrate that the AMP predicts significantly better than the MMSB. ...|$|R

By combining the results contained in these papers, we obtain the limiting behavior for any moments of the stationary search cost as n tends to infinity...|$|R
