40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{structure}} of the pairing interaction and superconducting gap in LiFeAs by decomposing the pairing interaction for various kz cuts into s- and d-wave components and by studying the leading superconducting instabilities. We use the ten orbital tight-binding model, derived from ab-initio LDA calculations with hopping parameters extracted from the fit to ARPES experiments. We find that the pairing interaction almost decouples between two subsets, one consists of the outer <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> and two electron pockets, which are quasi- 2 D and are made largely out of dxy orbital, and the other consists of the two inner <b>hole</b> <b>pockets,</b> which are quasi- 3 D and are made mostly out of dxz and dyz orbitals. Furthermore, the bare inter-pocket and intra-pocket interactions within each subset are nearly equal. In this situation, small changes in the intra-pocket and inter-pocket interactions due to renormalizations by high-energy fermions give rise to a variety of different gap structures. We find four different configurations of the s-wave gap immediately below Tc: the one in which superconducting gap changes sign between two inner <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> and between the outer <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> and two electron pockets, the one in which the gap changes sign between two electron <b>pockets</b> and three <b>hole</b> <b>pockets,</b> the one in which the gap on the outer <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> differs in sign from the gaps on the other four pockets, and the one in which the gaps on two inner <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> have one sign, and the gaps on the outer <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> and on electron pockets have different sign. Different s-wave gap configurations emerge depending on whether the renormalized interactions increase attraction within each subset or increase the coupling between particular components of the two subsets. We argue that the state with opposite sign of the gaps on the two inner <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> has the best overlap with ARPES data. Comment: 23 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

However, a d-wave gap is inconsistent with recent laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements. We propose the scenario for a nodal s-wave superconductivity induced by a non-magnetic intra-band and inter-band interactions between fermions near <b>hole</b> <b>pockets.</b> The superconducting gap changes sign between the <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> and has cos 4 θ angular dependence and accidental nodes on one or several <b>hole</b> <b>pockets.</b> We argue that strong angle dependence is the consequence of near-degeneracy between inter-pocket and intra-pocket interaction on the <b>hole</b> <b>pockets.</b> We also analyze cos 4 θ angular dependence of the gap in other Fe-pnictides and compare theoretical results with the photoemission experiments of LiFeAs.

40|$|Inspection is {{a process}} used to {{determine}} whether a component deviates from a given set of specifications. In industry, we usually use a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) to inspect CAD-based models, but inspection using vision sensors has recently drawn more attention because of advances that have been made in computer and imaging technologies. In this dissertation, we introduce active vision inspection for CAD-based three-dimensional models. We divide the dissertation into three major components: (i) planning, (ii) error analysis, and (iii) tolerance design. In inspection planning, the inputs are boundary representation (object centered representation) and an aspect graph (viewer centered representation) of the inspected component; the output is a sensor arrangement for dimensioning a set of topologic entities. In planning, we first use geometric reasoning and object oriented representation to determine a set of topologic entities (measurable entities) to be dimensioned based on the manufactured features on the component (such as slot, <b>pocket,</b> <b>hole</b> etc.) and their spatial relationships. Using the aspect graph, we obtain a set of possible sensor settings and determine an optimized set of sensor settings (sensor arrangement) for dimensioning the measurable entities. Since quantization errors and displacement errors are inherent in an active vision system, we analyze and model the density functions of these errors based on their characteristics and use them to determine the accuracy of inspection for a given sensor setting. In addition, we utilize hierarchical interval constraint networks for tolerance design. We redefine network satisfaction and constraint consistency for the application in tolerance design and develop new forward and backward propagation techniques for tolerance analysis and tolerance synthesis, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Recent quantum {{oscillation}} {{experiments in}} underdoped high temperature superconductors seem to imply two paradoxes. The first paradox concerns the apparent non-existence of {{the signature of}} the electron pockets in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear signature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no evidence as yet of the corresponding <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> of approximately double {{the frequency of the}} electron <b>pocket.</b> This <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> should be present if the Fermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming that Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number of charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these apparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address the first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to correlated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the materials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral function is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate range of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer matrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder affects the electron pocket more significantly than the <b>hole</b> <b>pocket.</b> However, when, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included, it wipes out the frequency corresponding to the <b>hole</b> <b>pocket.</b> Thus, if we are correct, {{it will be necessary to}} do measurements at higher magnetic fields and even higher quality samples to recover the <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> frequency.

40|$|The {{symmetry}} {{of the order}} parameter in iron-based superconductors, especially {{the presence or absence}} of nodes, is still a question of debate. While contradictory experiments can be explained by appropriately tuned theories of nodeless superconductivity in the iron-arsenide compounds, for LaOFeP all experiments clearly point to a nodal order parameter. We put forward a scenario that naturally explains the difference between the order-parameter character in these two sets of compounds, and use functional renormalization group (fRG) techniques to analyze it in detail. Our results show that, due to the orbital content of the electron and hole bands, nodal superconductivity on the electron <b>pockets</b> (<b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> gaps are always nodeless) can naturally appear when the third <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> which lies at wavevector (pi,pi) in the unfolded Brillouin zone is absent, as is the case in LaOFeP. When present, the third <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> has overwhelming d_{xy} orbital character, and the intra-orbital interaction with the d_{xy} dominated part of the electron Fermi surface is enough to drive the superconductivity nodeless (of s^+- form). However, in its absence, pair hopping, inter-orbital, and electron-electron intra-orbital interactions render the gap on the electron pockets softly nodal. Comment: 4. 3 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Similar to the known iron pnictides we observe <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> at the center and electron pockets {{at the corner of}} the Brillouin zone (BZ). However, on a finer level, the electronic structure around the Γ- and Z-points in k-space is substantially different from other iron pnictides, in that we observe two <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> at the Γ-point, and more interestingly only one <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> is seen at the Z-point, whereas in 1111 -, 111 -, and 122 -type compounds, three <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> could be readily found at the zone center. Another major difference noted in the Fe_ 1 +yTe_ 1 -xSe_x superconductors is that the top of innermost hole-like band moves away from the Fermi level to higher binding energy on going from Γ to Z, quite opposite to the iron pnictides. The polarization dependence of the observed features was used to aid the attribution of the orbital character of the observed bands. Photon energy dependent measurements suggest a weak k_z dispersion for the outer <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> and a moderate k_z dispersion for the inner <b>hole</b> <b>pocket.</b> By evaluating the momentum and energy dependent spectral widths, the single-particle self-energy was extracted and interestingly this shows a pronounced non-Fermi liquid behaviour for these compounds.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detailed}} electronic structure of WTe_ 2 by high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Unlike the simple one electron plus one <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> type of Fermi surface topology reported before, we resolved a rather complicated Fermi surface of WTe_ 2. Specifically, there are totally nine Fermi <b>pockets,</b> including one <b>hole</b> <b>pocket</b> at the Brillouin zone center Γ, and two <b>hole</b> <b>pockets</b> and two electron pockets {{on each side}} of Γ along the Γ-X direction. Remarkably, we have observed circular dichroism in our photoemission spectra, which suggests that the orbital angular momentum exhibits a rich texture at various sections of the Fermi surface. As reported previously for topological insulators and Rashiba systems, such a circular dichroism is a signature for spin-orbital coupling (SOC). This is further confirmed by our density functional theory calculations, where the spin texture is qualitatively reproduced as the conjugate consequence of SOC. Since the backscattering processes are directly involved with the resistivity, our data suggest that the SOC and the related spin and orbital angular momentum textures may be considered in the understanding of the anomalous magnetoresistance of WTe_ 2.

In this paper we focus on elucidating all these pocket features of a protein (from its atomistic description), via a simple and practical geometric algorithm. We use a two-step level set marching method to compute a volumetric pocket function φP (x) as the result of an outward and backward propagation. The regions inside pockets can be represented as φP (x) > 0 and pocket boundaries are computed as the level set φP (x) =, where > 0 is a small number. The pocket function φP (x) can be computed efficiently by fast distance transforms. This volumetric representation allows pockets to be analyzed quantitatively and visualized with various techniques.
