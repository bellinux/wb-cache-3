2500|$|Both fighters wore [...] gloves with {{brands of}} their choosing. Mayweather wore custom Grant gloves with a multicolored <b>paisley</b> <b>pattern,</b> red & purple trim, {{and the letters}} TBE on the cuff. Pacquiao wore {{standard}} red Cleto Reyes gloves with black & white trim. [...] In Pacquiao's third professional loss, {{he was forced to}} use Winning brand gloves during his first bout versus Érik Morales. Pacquiao's complaints were that the gloves felt like [...] "pillows," [...] and they did not give him the same power as his Reyes [...] "puncher's gloves." [...] More recently, Mayweather had glove issues in his first bout with Marcos Maidana, stating that Maidana's Everlast MX gloves did not provide sufficient padding for the knuckles. The issue was later resolved with Maidana resorting to using Everlast Powerlock type gloves, leaving Maidana's trainer, Robert Garcia, unhappy with the negotiation.|$|E

50|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century weaving had become the town's {{principal}} industry. The Paisley weavers' most famous products were the shawls, which bore the <b>Paisley</b> <b>Pattern</b> made fashionable after being worn by a young Queen Victoria. Despite being of a Kashmiri design and manufactured {{in other parts of}} Europe, the teardrop-like pattern soon became known by Paisley's name across the western world. Although the shawls dropped out of fashion in the 1870s, the <b>Paisley</b> <b>pattern</b> remains an important symbol of the town: the Paisley Museum maintains a significant collection of the original shawls in this design, and it has been used, for example, in the modern logo of Renfrewshire Council, the local authority.|$|E

50|$|The 1960s {{brought about}} {{an influx of}} pop art {{influenced}} designs. The first was designed by Michael Fish when he worked at Turnbull & Asser, and was introduced in Britain in 1965; the term Kipper tie was a pun on his name, {{as well as a}} reference to the triangular shape of the front of the tie. The exuberance of the styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s gradually gave way to more restrained designs. Ties became wider, returning to their 4+1/2 in width, sometimes with garish colors and designs. The traditional designs of the 1930s and 1950s, such as those produced by Tootal, reappeared, particularly <b>Paisley</b> <b>patterns.</b> Ties began to be sold along with shirts, and designers slowly began to experiment with bolder colors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{intricately}} woven, {{and delicate}} woollen Paisley shawls were a fashionable item of women's clothing in the 19th century.

50|$|Kashmiri shawls were high-fashion {{garments}} in Western Europe in the early- to mid-19th century.

50|$|By the 19th century, Paisley had {{established}} {{itself as a}} centre of the weaving industry, giving {{its name to the}} Paisley shawl and the <b>Paisley</b> <b>Pattern.</b> The town's associations with political Radicalism were highlighted by its involvement in the Radical War of 1820, with striking weavers being instrumental in the protests. As of 1993, all of Paisley's mills had closed, although they are memorialised in the town's museums and civic history.|$|E
5000|$|Mérédith Caron, costume designer, drew much {{inspiration}} from the 17th through the 19th centuries, including the Victorian era. The fabrics chosen reflected the themes of desire, seduction, and dreams. The many materials for the characters include linen, cotton netting, crushed velvet, jute, hemp, and crinyl. As an example, Kayala wears a bodice of black crinyl and organza train which is highly influenced by 18th-century decadence. The dolls, on the other hand, are inspired by 17th-century paintings and enlarged <b>paisley</b> <b>patterns.</b> Crimson is seen wearing a costume made of leather and [...] "Mirror of Holland" [...] linen. Her costume's skin effect was created by using two layers of linen covered by black netting which was slashed and sewn back together {{to give the impression}} of scars.|$|R

The Slab Boys Trilogy was revived in 2003 by the Traverse Theatre starring Paul Thomas Hickey and Iain Robertson in the lead roles. This is the first time that the Traverse Theatre have ever done a revival and it was received to great critical success.

50|$|By 1947 the Burgh Engineer, John McGregor, a Castlehead resident, had {{outlined}} {{plans of}} his own for a new <b>Paisley</b> <b>pattern.</b> Canal Street and George Street would be redeveloped and the overspill from the overcrowded homes there {{and elsewhere in the}} town centre re-housed in new garden suburbs to the south and west—Glenburn and Foxbar. There were many pitfalls and many objections before McGregor’s dream became a reality in the 1950s. But Abercrombie’s eccentric vision was receding. Castlehead and common sense had prevailed.|$|E
5000|$|From roughly 1800 to 1850, the weavers of {{the town}} of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland, became the {{foremost}} producers of these shawls. Unique additions to their hand-looms and Jacquard looms allowed them to work in five colors when most weavers were producing paisley using only two. [...] The design became known as the <b>Paisley</b> <b>pattern.</b> By 1860, Paisley could produce shawls with 15 colors, which was still only a quarter of the colors in the multicolor paisleys then still being imported from Kashmir.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} period, women's {{clothing}} was much thinner {{than in the}} eighteenth century so warmer outerwear became important in fashion, especially in colder climates. Coat-like garments such as pelisses and redingotes were popular, as were shawls, mantles, mantelets, capes and cloaks. The mantelet was a short cape that was eventually lengthened and made into a shawl. The redingote, another popular example, was a full-length garment resembling a man's riding coat (hence the name) in style, that could be made of different fabrics and patterns. Throughout the period, the Indian shawl was the favoured wrap, as houses and the typical English country house were generally draughty, and the sheer muslin and light silk dresses popular during this time provided less protection. Shawls were made of soft cashmere or silk or even muslin for summer. <b>Paisley</b> <b>patterns</b> were extremely popular at the time.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the loom-woven fabric, Paisley became a major site for the manufacture of printed cotton and wool in the 19th century, according to the Scotland's Paisley Museum and Art Gallery. [...] The <b>paisley</b> <b>pattern</b> was being printed, rather than woven, onto other textiles, including cotton squares which were the precursors of the modern bandanna. Printed paisley was cheaper than the costly woven paisley and this added to its popularity. The key places of printing paisley were Britain and the Alsace region of France.|$|E

This use of visual motifs to hint at possible narratives which are rarely straightforward or easy to decode led to some critics dismissing Campbell's work, with the critic of The Independent newspaper in London calling it as a 'soup of arcane motifs'. But following his death Campbell's store amongst art critics seemed to rise, with The Times newspaper calling him 'one of the most forceful and original artists to have emerged lately in Britain’, and The Guardian ‘The most exciting painter to emerge anywhere for many years’.|$|E

50|$|Traditionalist skinheads {{sometimes}} wear a silk handkerchief in {{the breast}} pocket of a Crombie-style overcoat or tonic suit jacket, in some cases fastened with an ornate stud. Some wear pocket flashes instead. These are pieces of silk in contrasting colours, mounted {{on a piece of}} cardboard and designed to look like an elaborately folded handkerchief. It was common to choose the colours based on one's favourite football club. Some skinheads wear button badges or sewn-on fabric patches with designs related to affiliations, interests or beliefs. Also popular are woollen or printed rayon scarves in football club colours, worn knotted at the neck, wrist, or hanging from a belt loop at the waist. Silk or faux-silk scarves (especially Tootal brand) with <b>paisley</b> <b>patterns</b> are also sometimes worn. Some suedeheads carried closed umbrellas with sharpened tips, or a handle with a pull-out blade. This led to the nickname brollie boys.|$|R
50|$|Aside from pious interpretations, {{there was}} much {{speculation}} that the painting had a more disapproving meaning. Some suggested the painting was a comment on the sin of vanity. The Chapel clock suggests Siân Owen is arriving belatedly at {{a few minutes after}} ten (during the traditional Welsh silence before the morning service), possibly to ensure her presence is noted and appears to be wearing comparatively ostentatious clothing. The interpretation was often synonymous with a popular belief that Vosper had hidden an image of the devil in the folds of Siân Owen's shawl.
