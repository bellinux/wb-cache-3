40|$|A {{carboxylic}} acid functional trimer {{made from the}} reaction of isosorbide with maleic anhydride was used to cross-link epoxidized sucrose soyate (ESS), resulting in bio-based, degradable thermosets having a good combination of hardness and flexibility. This work addresses some critical needs for thermosets such as improving the sustainability of raw materials, enabling recycling, and achieving both good material hardness and flexibility/ductility simultaneously. In this paper, a di{{carboxylic acid}}, MI, was synthesized from isosorbide and maleic anhydride and characterized in detail by FTIR and H- 1 NMR It was utilized to cross-link ESS without using extra catalyst or toxic compounds except for ethanol and water. For comparison, a dicarboxylic acid from 1, 3 -propanediol and maleic anhydride (MP) was also synthesized and used to cross-link ESS. Because of the carbon carbon double bond in conjugation with the carboxylic acid group, both MI and MP showed high reactivity toward ESS and could cross-link ESS {{with the assistance of}} water and ethanol.

Inks and varnishes based on epoxide, oxetane or vinylether monomers which undergo photoinitiated cationic polymerization are less commercially successful alternative. Both of these polymerization mechanisms have different advantages and disadvantages. Radical polymerization is strongly inhibited by oxygen which easily diffuses into {{a thin layer}} of low viscosity system. Cationically polymerizable systems undergo slow premature polymerization during storage. This is a result of insufficient thermal stability of onium salts generally used as photoinitiators. Varnishes and inks studied in this work contained a mixture of radically and cationically polymerizable materials and photoinitiators of both polymerization types. As a result of the UV exposition, both types of the polymerization proceeded simultaneously. This experimental work proceeded in five stages. In the first stage, two mixtures of radically or cationically polymerizable monomers (and oligomer) with a required low viscosity for an inkjet printing was formulated. In the second stage, an influence of selected materials on a rate of cationic polymerization was tested with the aim to formulate a cationically polymerizable system with a required high reactivity. In the third stage, the process of the photopolymerization and mechanical properties of thin layers of the unpigmented experimental varnishes were studied. The varnishes contained different portions of the radically and cationically polymerizable components. The polymerization of acrylate and oxetane functional groups was studied by means of FTIR with and without air presence. The pull tests of the cured thin varnish layers were done using a dynamometer. The <b>pendulum</b> <b>hardness</b> of the cured thin varnish layers were measured by the Persoz method. In the fourth stage, the experimental UV curable inks containing a prepared pigment preparation and equal portions of the radically and cationically polymerizable components were studied. Their photopolymerization was studied by means of FTIR. The print tests of the selected experimental varnish and ink were done using the laboratory printing machine equipped with the inkjet printhead Xaar XJ 500 / 80. In the fifth stage, the long-therm stability tests of the liquid varnish containing equal portions of the radically and cationically polymerizable components were done. During several weeks of the thermal exposition of the liquid samples, the increase of viscosity as result of premature polymerization was monitored. The experimental inks and varnishes consisted of radically polymerizable low viscosity acrylates, cationically polymerizable epoxide and oxetane monomers, photoinitiators of the radical and cationic polymerization (á-hydroxyketone, iodonium salt) and additives. The cationically polymerizable monomers and the photoinitiators were chosen to achieve the sufficiently fast cationic polymerization to affect the simultaneous radical polymerization of the acrylates. The simultaneous cationic polymerization positively affected the radical polymerization of the acrylates in air. The rate of the radical polymerization of the acrylates increased with the content of the cationically polymerizable components in the mixture. The cured thin layers of the experimental varnishes containing mixture of the radically and cationically polymerizable components were more plastic and less hard than the layers containing just one type of these components. The radiation dose needed to cure the experimental inks containing the pigment preparation was higher than in case of the unpigmented varnishes. An adverse effect of the pigment on the UV curing was partially compensated by an addition of a photosensitizer absorbing radiation of longer wavelengths emitted by a Hg lamp used as UV radiation source in printing machines.
