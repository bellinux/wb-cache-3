The timbers were generally converted from comparatively young trees with an average age of 75 years at the time of felling.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Inadequate {{supply of}} wood raw {{material}} {{is one of}} the major obstacles for the global furniture industry’s growth. Several secondary timbers/Lesser-Utilized-Species (LUS) that could substitute the scarce traditional timbers for furniture production exist in tropical forests. However, the industry continuously faces persistent timber shortages. The extent to which manufacturers utilize LUS as alternatives is unclear, which this study sought to ascertain. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from 300 Timber Firms from Ghana primarily through questionnaires using the stratified random sampling technique. Results: Continuous decline and non-availability of preferred traditional timbers and competition from imported furniture were the main challenges confronting the furniture industry. Data obtained indicated that most manufacturers (85 %) hardly use any LUS; 44 % of these mentioned lack of information on their properties and prospective uses and 32 % attributed it to non-availability on the domestic timber markets. However, 22 % of these producers rely on traditionally ‘well-known’ timbers (e. g. mixed red wood, Guarea cedrata and Tectona grandis) owing to their strength properties, 20 % due to their strength and durability and 14 % because of their strength and aesthetic properties. Many LUS (with prospects for furniture-making) available in great quantities in many tropical forests could substitute the over-dependent timbers. However, information on their properties and uses are hardly available to local producers, which affects their popularity among timber suppliers and manufacturers. Conclusion: To improve on the level of utilization of secondary timbers, wood workers must be supplied with comprehensive information about their properties and economic values. This will contribute to reducing pressure on the <b>primary</b> <b>timbers,</b> ensuring consistent supply of timber and keeping the sector operational...|$|E

40|$|The European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), and Australia {{have adopted}} {{specific}} measures {{to avoid the}} placing of illegal timber on their markets. These measures might encourage the diversion of timber products from traditional large importers to destinations with a less stringent regulatory framework. During 2001 – 2013, the international trade in tropical <b>primary</b> <b>timber</b> products (logs; sawnwood; veneers and plywood) decreased by 13 % in volume and increased by almost 5 % in value.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for wood to meet EU {{renewable}} energy targets has increasingly come under scrutiny for potentially increasing EU import dependence and inducing land use change abroad, with associated impacts on the climate and biodiversity. This article builds on research accounting for levels of <b>primary</b> <b>timber</b> consumption - e. g., toward forest footprints - and developing reference values for benchmarking sustainability - e. g., toward land use targets - {{in order to improve}} systemic monitoring of timber and forest use. Specifically, it looks at future trends to assess how current EU policy may impact forests at an EU and global scale. Future demand scenarios are based on projections derived and adapted from the literature to depict developments under different scenario assumptions. Results reveal that by 2030, EU consumption levels on a per capita basis are estimated to be increasingly disproportionate compared {{to the rest of the}} world. EU consumption scenarios based on meeting around a 40 % share of the EU renewable energy targets with timber would overshoot both the EU and global reference value range for sustainable supply capacities in 2030. Overall, findings support literature pointing to an increased risk of problem shifting relating to both how much and where timber needed for meeting renewable energy targets is sourced. It is argued that a sustainable level of timber consumption should be characterized by balance between supply (what the forest can provide on a sustainable basis) and demand (how much is used on a per capita basis, considering the concept of fair shares). To this end, future research should close data gaps, increase methodological robustness and address the socio-political legitimacy of the safe operating space concept towards targets in the future.

40|$|Trees in {{plantations}} {{established for}} timber production are usually grown at a sufficiently high density that canopy closure occurs within {{a relatively short}} time after planting. The trees then shade and outcompete most herbs, shrubs or grasses growing at the site. The closer the spacing (i. e. the greater the density) the faster this will occur. Subsequently, as the trees grow larger, this between-species competition is replaced by within-species competition. If unmanaged, this competition can reduce the commercial productivity of the plantation. Thus, there are two management dilemmas. One is knowing the best initial planting density. The second is knowing how to management the subsequent between-tree competition in order to optimize overall plantation timber productivity. In this chapter we consider initial spacing and thinning for high value timber trees grown in single and mixed species plantations. From growth studies in stands of different ages recommendations are proposed for managing both types of plantations where the <b>primary</b> objective is <b>timber</b> production.

In this study, we used LANDIS, a spatially explicit forest landscape model, to evaluate the effects of 21 alternative forest management initiatives which were drafted for forests in the upstream region of the Hun River in northeastern China. These management initiatives included {{a wide range of}} planting and harvest intensities for Pinus koraiensis, the historically dominant tree species in the region. Multivariate analysis of variance, Shannon’s Diversity Index, and planting efficiency (which indicates how many cells of the target species at the final year benefit from per-cell of the planting trees) estimates were used as indicators to analyze the effects of planting and harvesting regimes on forests in the region. The results showed that the following: (1) Increased planting intensity, although augmenting the coverage of P. koraiensis, was accompanied by decreases in planting efficiency and forest diversity. (2) While selective harvesting could increase forest diversity, the abrupt increase of early succession species accompanying this method merits attention. (3) Stimulating rapid forest succession may not be a good management strategy, since the climax species would crowd out other species which are likely more adapted to future climatic conditions in the long run. In light of the above, we suggest a combination of 30 % planting intensity with selective harvesting of 50 % and 70 % of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>timber</b> species, respectively, as the most effective management regime in this area.

In order to optimize the production cycle, first should be analyze and account the based resource of the transformation procedure, which is the raw material base that leads the market made in each industry. The availability and supply of raw materials for initial conversion, largely defines the productive capacity of an industrial cycle, along with the monitoring technology defendant, as well the precision manufacturing methods and specialized equipment to determine quality and yield of the final product. In this context the production of pulp for paper {{is a part of}} industrial sector, also with extremely important analytical parameters in all the circuit of manufacturing. The following work is an analysis of consumption capacity and conversion, of raw material based on pulp and paper industry, this is the wood of Eucalyptus globulus, {{as one of the best}} chosen species for paper manufacture. The efficiency of the industrial cycle, necessarily begins with the constant supply and receiving of the <b>primary</b> product processing, <b>timber,</b> this is where is determined the daily production capacity and the turn in profitability of the final product, pulp. The analysis of the profitability of eucalyptus wood at an industrial level, was determined by quantification and inventory of the main percentage losses in the processing of roundwood in pulp, in peeling, chipping and Kraft processes in a factory of Portucel Soporcel in Setubal. For the same purpose, were analyzed each transformation process manufacturing employment, in order to delineate how and where does the losses procedural associated belong, as well as the mechanism of the receiving system and supply of wood in roundwood with bark Eucalyptus globulus, as the initial and primary flow of processing industries. The definition of the main objectives of producibility and profitability of the industrial cycle plants, to meet the needs and demands of the trading market, depend on the ability to supply the raw material for converting the initial factory. In this way, is necessary to maintain an influent receiving wood and precise quantification of the industrial entry. Quantification methods of reception and production of a product, which may be more stringent, in industrial scale are constantly monitored and evaluated in order to detect the limitations and inaccuracies that can be improved or even eliminated if interfere in the accuracy of measurement daily production capacity of manufacturing. So throughout the study in question, were determined the error margins associated in each method of quantification of reception, as well in the determination of losses and production of pulp from Eucalyptus globulus wood, prepared in different ways throughout the process analysis. The margin of error was determined calculating the average error of each measurement made, using records of system measurement and quantification defendant, using the m 3 standard as the volume unit of the process of industrial measurement adopted. Using the theory of propagation of errors in all weights and samples made in the inventory of the main and side timber flows, was associated a error of 2. 76 % for a cubic meter of wood in the quantification by the method of immersion in water, ± 20 kg the margin of error of reading made in weighing the side streams and ± 0. 001 kg in weighing samples. The main procedural losses of wood were identified on the flow of processed bark peeling, mechanic performed by a rotating drum. For greater accuracy, were analyzed the two-line debarking industrial, by selecting identical time bases of four hours on average, and collecting four samples with about 5 kg of bark along the processing, at the end, on average there were about 5 % losses in wood taken from the bark peeling in each line. Carried out on different days receptionist wood, on each line analyzed in duplicate, was noted that in days of heavy rainfall and especially in finer flows of roundwood, losses in mechanical processing chips were the most highlighted, revealing the section shelling the area, the greatest percentage loss of timber industry. With about 1 % on average in each line peel, chips of shattered dimensions too thin for processing pulp, represent the second procedural losses in mechanical processing of roundwood into chips to Kraft cooking. The resulting wood of procedural losses in the plant in question, are use as biomass, converted into green energy that is self consumption and sold by the industrial core analyzed. Once converted into chips for paper pulp production, wood is directed to cooking, screening and bleaching through the process of Kraft delignification. Lignin removed through the black liquor, is recycled for conversion of biomass and green energy, while the liquor is bleach to white liquor, in recovered for reuse in other pulping processes. In the Kraft process is defined a yield of 52 % of wood for Kraft pulp production, the main losses of processed wood are revealed in the content of knots and uncooked shives, riddled sequentially and removed from the production system, due the unfit features for industrial purpose. The knots and uncooked shives were determined by inventory and final weights, on the end of the industrial cycle production of pulp in similar conditions and temporal basis. Being carried out six tests and sampling weights, we can conclude that the knots and uncooked shives represent about 1, 5 % of the wood processed in Kraft pulp. In the end, it was concluded on average, about 6 % wood losses along the industrial processing of roundwood Eucalyptus globulus into chips for paper pulp production and 1, 5 % in pulping, mainly represented by the wood-drag carried by the bark, then the knots and uncooked shives content riddled and finally the chips due the size too thin called “sawdust”...|$|R
