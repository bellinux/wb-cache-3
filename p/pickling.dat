5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of hydrochloric acid is in the <b>pickling</b> of steel, to remove rust or iron oxide scale from iron or steel before subsequent processing, such as extrusion, rolling, galvanizing, and other techniques. Technical quality HCl at typically 18% concentration is the most commonly used <b>pickling</b> agent for the <b>pickling</b> of carbon steel grades.|$|E
5|$|Vinegar is {{typically}} 4–18% acetic acid by mass. Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, {{and in the}} <b>pickling</b> of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar {{tends to be more}} diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food <b>pickling</b> employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.|$|E
5|$|The {{spent acid}} {{has long been}} reused as iron(II) {{chloride}} (also known as ferrous chloride) solutions, but high heavy-metal levels in the <b>pickling</b> liquor have decreased this practice.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} in a {{fermentation}} process to make yoghurt, cheese, curd, kefir, ayran, xynogala, {{and other types of}} food.

5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, <b>pickling</b> and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties.

The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus {{mushrooms}} are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, soaking in brine for several days, or <b>pickling,</b> after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste.

The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel <b>pickling,</b> glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and <b>pickling</b> onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes {{inside and outside}} cells. Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for <b>pickling</b> and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The Dietary Reference Intake for sodium is 1.5grams per day, but {{most people in the}} United States consume more than 2.3grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.|$|E

Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A <b>pickling</b> plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings. The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April.

In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II.

5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and food preservation techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and <b>pickling)</b> made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E
