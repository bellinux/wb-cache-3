To investigate fasting & <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> <b>response</b> of DPP-IV enzyme as indirect marker of incretin response failure after chronic treatment with metformin in type 2 diabetes. The study included twelve nondiabetic subjects, ten patients with glycosylated hemoglobin values (6 - 8 %) and fifteen patients with glycosylated hemoglobin greater than 8 % of type- 2 diabetes patients of either sex with metformin treatment above 3 years were recruited. Fasting and post prandial DPP-IV levels were calculated. HbA 1 c was used to assess diabetes status. DPP-IV activity (fasting) in type 2 diabetic subjects with HbA 1 c> 8 % was significantly higher DPP-IV (44. 67 ± 2. 19 U/l) than in non diabetic subjects (24. 39 ± 3. 97 U/l). A significant correlation between DPP-IV (fasting / post prandial) and HbA 1 c (r = 0. 821 & r = 0. 732, P< 0. 01) was observed in both diabetic (HbA 1 c 6 - 8, HbA 1 c < 8) patients. Hyperglycemia induces significant increase in serum DPP-IV activity in fasting condition and might contribute to the reduction in active glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) in type 2 diabetic subjects. In normal subjects during post prandial condition, there is sudden increase followed by decrease of GLP- 1 due t...|$|E
40|$|This {{extended}} abstract {{describes the}} background to the 14 research papers that the author, as staff candidate, is submitting for the award of PhD by published works. The core part of this work refers {{to the development of}} volumetric biomarkers within the human digestive tract using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and their application to answer novel biomedical research questions. In particular the author’s work has focussed on applying these techniques within the human colon and the first two papers (which detail this work) were led and written by the author. This work was pioneering in its field, the first time that physiologically undisturbed colon volumes were measured in healthy human subjects and in patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and provided novel insights into the post-prandial symptoms experienced. Subsequently the effect of an experimental stress on this <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> <b>response</b> was evaluated in healthy subjects, also the first time such an effect had been measured. The third paper, also written by the author, describes her work on the first clinical application of similar volumetric techniques to assess the human nasal airways and their response to pharmacological intervention, in this case the efficacy of a nasal decongestant. This document seeks to set the gastro-intestinal papers within their scientific and physiological background and to show their original contribution to the current understanding of the physiological processes within the human gastro-intestinal tract. Between mouth and anus, a complex myriad of mechanical, chemical and biological procedures interact to liquefy and transport food; to break it down into increasingly simpler chemical forms; absorb nutrients and then eject what is no longer required. MRI provides a unique window into the functions and form of this environment at the macroscopic level; a non-invasive tool for detecting and measuring the structure and physical movements of the abdominal organs and their contents, monitoring fluid transport and providing insights into the biological processing therein. This can provide quantitative biomarkers to rigorously assess the normal undisturbed physiology in health and disease and the effect of pharmacological interventions. It is a hitherto relatively unexplored area and it is the development and application of such measurements that form the bulk of the author’s research contained within the presented publications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Postprandial {{lipidemia}} (PPL), {{defined as}} an increase in plasma levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins following the consumption of a high fat meal (HFM) is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Acute exercise reduces PPL and maintains endothelial function (EF) in healthy adults. The effect of acute exercise on PPL and endothelial function has not been studied in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Purpose: To {{examine the effect of}} an acute bout of exercise on PPL, vascular inflammation and endothelial function in men with PAD. Methods: Men (n= 8) with PAD underwent two oral fat tolerance tests (OFTT). On the evening prior to each OFTT, participants rested (control), or exercised until they expended 200 Kcal. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 30 min, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h postprandial. Endothelial-dependent dilation (EDD) and endothelial-independent dilation (EID) were measured in the brachial artery using ultrasonography at baseline, 2 h and 4 h postprandial. Results: Postprandial TG increased significantly and EDD decreased significantly following the OFTT. An acute bout of discontinuous exercise that resulted in a 200 Kcal expenditure did not significantly attenuate the <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> TG <b>response</b> or significantly ameliorate the decrease in endothelial vasomotor function. Compared to baseline values, circulating leukocytes, and TNF-α increased (p< 0. 05) in both conditions 4 h postprandial. There were no changes in C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Conclusion: Prior exercise has no effect on PPL or EDD following an OFTT in men with PAD. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Cardiovascular disease, {{obesity and}} {{diabetes}} mellitus have become major causes of premature death and disability in affluent countries. Diet and lifestyle factors are leading causative {{factors contributing to}} these escalating epidemics. An individual’s diet {{plays a significant role}} in the digestion and absorption of CHO. Pasta is a staple food known to have a low glycaemic index. Resistant starch which is found naturally in pasta may have auspicious health benefits and functional properties. The resistance of starch, however, can be significantly influenced by food preparation techniques. Recent research has demonstrated that the ingestion of pasta that has been reheated after being chilled overnight may be a healthier alternative to freshly cooked pasta. Materials and Methods Four healthy female subjects aged 21 - 22, were recruited from Queen Margaret University. The participants attended three consecutive tests days, where they each consumed a portion of white pasta with a basic tomato sauce. The study measured <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> glucose <b>responses</b> via the blood and saliva after the consumption of three pasta meals; freshly prepared pasta, pasta that had been chilled in fridge overnight and pasta that had been chilled and then reheated. Blood and salivary glucose responses where both measured at baseline and at 15, 30, 45, 75 and 120 minute intervals, post consumption of the test meal. One way ANOVAs with Bonferonni post hoc corrections were used to determine significant differences. Results Analysis of the blood glucose data using one way ANOVA revealed that there was no significant difference between the preparation methods. Blood glucose analysis determined that the highest peak was observed following consumption of the reheated pasta. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the preparation methods and the salivary glucose responses. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that consuming chilled or reheated pasta instead of freshly prepared pasta does not produce a lower spike in blood glucose concentrations when tested on healthy individuals. For firm conclusions to be reached further studies must be carried out with a higher number of subject participants...|$|R

However, <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> plasma glucose at 2 hour after their usual meal exhibited a significantly higher level than the fasting and post glucose level ((p< 0. 05 – p< 0. 001).

Diabetic dyslipidemia is an important and common risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Aims: This study examined the effect of glycemic control on <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> insulin and lipid parameters {{in response to a}} standardised meal challenge among Type 2 diabetes patients with good and poor glycemic control. Methods: We cross-sectionally studied 31 T 2 DM patients with good glycemic control and 32 T 2 DM patients with poor glycemic control. Subjects were given, after minimum 10 hours of fasting, a standard meal containing 58 % fat. Fasting and serial postprandial blood samples were taken over 8 hours to determine levels of triglyceride, direct LDL-C, apoB lipoprotein, non-esterified-fatty-acid, insulin and blood glucose. Results: <b>Post</b> <b>prandial</b> NEFA was significantly higher in poor controlled diabetes patients compared to good control diabetes patients (p = 0. 019), and post-hoc analysis showed significant difference from 3 hours <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> to 4 hours <b>post</b> <b>prandial,</b> where p= 0. 021.

40|$|Background Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is a heterogeneous disease which {{is characterized by}} variable degrees of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Uric acid {{has been identified as}} a marker for a number of metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities. In diabetic patients, there is biochemical interaction between serum glucose and purine metabolism, with increased excretion of uric acid during hyperglycemia and glycosuria. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the correlation of serum uric acid levels with glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients. Methods A cross sectional study from May until July 2014 had been done in 82 type 2 diabetes patients. Serum was analyzed for uric acid, fasting and 2 -hour <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> blood glucose and lipid profile. Spearman correlation test was used to assess associations of HbA 1 c, fasting and <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> blood glucose with serum uric acid levels.

Hyperglicemi is one of the stress response after head injury. The aim of this study are to prove that there are increasing blood glucose level and is there any correlation with the outcome of the patients. Method : We performed a prognostic study with a cohort design. Subject of the study was moderate and severe close head injury patients with normal Ct scan during 14 days hospitalization. We obtained blood glucose level, fasting and 2 hours <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> blood glucose level on first day of hospitalization and the next 14 days. We assessed neurological deficit based on the Disability Rating Scale (DRS). For Statistical Analysis we used Wilcoxon test to assess the differences between means of blood glucose level, fasting and 2 hours <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> blood glucose level. Spearman Corelation test were calculated to explore the relationships between GCS, Blood glucose level on first day of hospitalization with DRS score on day 14.

40|$|In acute studies guar flour, guar {{powder and}} guar {{granules}} reduced mean <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> insulin levels in normal subjects following liquid glucose. The flour and powder also reduced mean plasma GIP levels compared to glucose alone. Guar granules {{had no effect}} on the mean plasma glucose, insulin or GIP responses of either normal or non insulin dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects to a solid mixed meal but guar powder reduced mean <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> plasma glucose, insulin, and GIP levels in both groups. Guar flour was not investigated. The mean glycosylated haemoglobin level of seven NIDDM subjects taking 25 g guar powder in bread daily for eight weeks was reduced after four weeks. Mean total serum cholesterol levels were also reduced whilst subjects were following the regimen but on termination returned to pretrial levels. In addition, the response to a meal immediately before and after supplementation was similar indicating guar powder has no carry over effect. Guar flour prevented the hypoglycaemia caused in two of six subjects by consumption of a drink containing alcohol and sucrose and a high carbohydrate snack. However it also caused higher blood alcohol levels and they appeared more intoxicated for five hours after the meal. When guar gum was given with a fat load it did not affect chylomicronaemia implying it is unlikely to impair bile salt reabsorption as has been suggested. Guar flour incorporation into a predominantly protein meal did not affect the rate of liquid or solid gastric emptying in normal subjects but significantly increased mean <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> gastrin secretion.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of diabetes mellitus {{is continuing to}} increase and is predicted to effect 439 million adults worldwide by 2030 (Shaw et al. 2010). The disease and its associated complications are a growing epidemic {{and there is a}} need for dietary intervention, for both management and prevention of the disease. The majority of the most popular staple sources of carbohydrates tend to be found in the upper glycaemic index range, rapidly increasing blood glucose levels post ingestion, resulting in poor glycaemic control. Recent research suggests these popular everyday carbohydrates can be readily made “healthier” via the way they are cooked and prepared, related to the consumption of resistant starch and its ability to lower blood glucose during the <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> period. This discovery has the potential to target poor glycaemic control and alleviate the risk of diabetes to the population. The aim of the current study was to investigate and compare the postprandial glycaemic effects of freshly cooked, chilled overnight and chilled and reheated pasta. Subjects consumed 75 g of pasta in a simple tomato sauce, on the first day the pasta was freshly cooked, the second day it had been chilled overnight and the final day it was reheated after being chilled over two nights. Blood glucose was measured at baseline and for 2 hours <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> at 15, 30, 45, 75 and 120 minutes. Salivary glucose samples were also taken to examine the potential replacement of blood sampling. Mean blood glucose increased greater initially at 15 minutes following ingestion of the chilled and reheated pasta, however appeared lower during the remainder of the <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> phase than the freshly cooked and chilled pasta. Reflecting the ability of resistant starch to reduce blood glucose during the <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> phase. However, there was no significant difference between the three pastas. Salivary glucose also did not appear to mirror blood glucose samples, suggesting it may not be a suitable replacement for blood sampling. However, the current study examined non-diabetic individuals, evidence suggests correlation is only found between salivary and blood glucose in diabetics. Further research is required on a larger scale to critically assess pasta that has been chilled and reheated as a “healthier” alternative for glycaemic control.

METHODS; 50 obese and 50 nonobese young healthy females aged 18 - 25 years were selected based on body mass index. Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure was recorded using digital electronic blood pressure monitor in both pre and <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> state. Heart rate and heart rate variability was recorded in both pre and postprandial state using ECG V: 52 HRV power spectral analysis to identify separate frequency components, i. e,total power, low frequency power and high frequency power. RESULTS: All the statistical methods were carried out through the SPSS for windows version 16. 0 and Minitab version 11. 0. The paired samples T test procedure was done to compare the means of two variables for a single group. The independent samples T test procedure was done to compare the mean...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of using {{free amino acids}} (AAs) as dietary constituent is sometimes {{lower than that of}} AAs derived from intact protein. The aim of the project was to evaluate dietary management conditions, which can determine the {{efficiency of}} utilization of crystalline AAs in animal diets or in clinical nutrition. The studies in this thesis were focused mainly on differences in short-term catabolism between protein bound and free AAs during the <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> phase of a meal. The stable isotope technique was used in model studies with laboratory Wistar (WU) rats. In different experiments, so-called [13 CO 2]-breath test studies were used to compare the metabolic fate of free and protein-bound [1 - 13 C]-labeled AAs in a meal in various nutritional situations. The influence of free AA supplementation strategies on weight gain development was also studied. Moreover, protein and fat content in the liver and carcass were analysed. The {{results of the present study}} confirm literature that showed a higher <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> catabolic losses of the tracer when dietary protein is replaced with crystalline AAs. In some, but not all situations a lower weight gain was observed for growing animals. Our results showed that short-term c atabolic losses of endogenous leucine were modulated by exogenous AA supply. It increased or decreased depending on the adequacy of the dietary supply. The common practice for free AA supplementation is to mix it with the deficient protein. In our study we showed that during the <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> period the best utilization of methionine deficient protein did not occur when methionine supplement was given simultaneously with methionine deficient meal. The best utilisation occurred when there was a delay between the supply of deficient meal and free methionine. Therefore, introducing time interval of free amino acid supplementation to poor quality protein should be considered as a factor with potential to improve physiological utilization of dietary amino acids. A 1 h time interval for free methionine supplementation influenced the weight gain, but differently depending on the protein level. Animals fed very deficient protein diet (5 %) showed higher weight gain when supplementation of the deficient free methionine was provided with a 1 h delay (1 h interval). With protein deficient diets and less than 7. 5 % protein we found fatty livers in our experiment. We concluded that <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> AA oxidation influences the post absorptive AA catabolism. This does not always mean effect on growth. For growth in rats lysine deficiency is most limiting but it seems that even a 34 % methionine deficiency below the NRC recommendation did not limit growth. We found that methionine deficiency influenced fat metabolism and from the literature we concluded that the mechanism probably works via choline and carniti...|$|R

However, an acute bout of exercise in the <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> period has anti-inflammatory and lipid lowering effects. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate whether an acute bout of moderate intensity physical activity post-HFM would attenuate <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> lipemia (PPL) and protect against airway inflammation in active individuals. We hypothesized that an acute bout of exercise would attenuate the increase in PPL and airway inflammation after a HFM. Methods: Twenty healthy, physically active college-aged participants (13 M/ 7 F) completed the study. Subjects were required to undergo DEXA scans, pulmonary function testing and performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion to determine VO 2 peak.

40|$|MMed, Paediatrics, University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health SciencesBackground: To {{reduce the}} risks and prevent {{progression}} of diabetic complications average blood glucose and glucose variability need to be kept {{as close to the}} non diabetic range as possible. <b>Post</b> <b>prandial</b> glucose excursions contribute significantly to average blood glucose and to glycemic variability. Dietary carbohydrate is the primary determinant of meal related blood glucose excursions. Carbohydrate counting is a method of insulin dosing that matches carbohydrate load to insulin dose using a fixed ratio. Many patients and current insulin pumps, calculate insulin delivery for meals based upon a linear carbohydrate to insulin relationship. Hypothesis: A non-linear relationship exists between the amount of carbohydrate consumed and the insulin required to cover it. Rather, an exponential increase in insulin is needed to cover an increasing load of carbohydrate. Aim: To document blood glucose exposure, as measured by AUC, in response to increasing carbohydrate loads on fixed carbohydrate to insulin ratios. Sample and Methods: 5 Type- 1 diabetic adolescents and young adults on insulin pump therapy with good control were recruited. Morning basal rates and carbohydrate to insulin ratios were optimized prior to the study start. A Medtronic glucose sensor was worn by each participant for 5 days on which standardized meals of increasing carbohydrate content were consumed. After the 5 days the glucose sensors were downloaded and the glucose area under the curve was analyzed for each carbohydrate load for each participant. Results: Only subjects with 5 days of complete recordings covering the test meals were included for analysis, resulting in 5 complete analyses. Sensor failure and hypoglycaemic v episodes prior to test meals accounted for failures. Increasing carbohydrate loads on a fixed carbohydrate to insulin ratio resulted in increasing glucose area under the curve (AUC). The log (Average AUC) was linear confirming that this relationship is exponential. An Analysis of Covariance performed on the log (AUC) data confirmed a highly significant exponential relationship (p< 0. 0001) although {{no significant differences were found}} between the profiles of the 5 individuals. Late <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> hypoglycaemia followed carbohydrate loads greater than 60 grams and this was often followed by rebound hyperglycaemia that lasted more than 6 hours. Conclusion: A non linear relationship exists between carbohydrates consumed and the insulin required to cover them when using premeal bolus insulin. This has implications for control of postprandial blood sugars, especially when consuming large carbohydrate loads. Because of the late <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> hypoglycaemia that follows the larger doses of insulin used with larger amounts of carbohydrate it is not possible to simply increase the amount of the insulin bolus using an exponential formula. Further studies need to be done looking at the optimal ratios of insulin needed for increasing carbohydrate loads, the duration and type of boluses needed to cover these high carbohydrate loads and the possibility of changing the linear equation used in current insulin pumps to one that would better cover the increase in <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> glucose load with large carbohydrate meals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{has become}} a global epidemic. Tinospora cordifolia is {{being used in the}} treatment of type 2 diabetes since ancient times. It is a common misconception that Ayurvedic medicines are always safe. In fact, they also pose serious health risks either in the form of adverse reactions or in the form of drug interactions. Hence this study was undertaken to study the efficacy and safety of Tc on human subjects. Methods: We recruited 40 type 2 diabetic patients who were on oral hypoglycaemic agents. These patients were then randomly divided into two groups, A and B. Patients in group A continued with their anti-diabetic medications while in group B Tc was given at a dose of 500 mg three times daily along with their conventional medications. The fasting and <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> blood glucose levels, renal function tests and liver function tests were recorded at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Results: During the course of study we observed a decrease in the fasting and <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> blood glucose levels of the patients. No significant change was observed in the renal function tests and liver function tests and no other event of any adverse drug reactions were recorded. Conclusion: Tinospora cordifolia (Tc) is effective as an add-on therapy in patients with type- 2 diabetes. There is no negative impact of Tc on the renal as well as liver function tests.

Trudgill 2 1 Università Federico II, Napoli; 2 Sandwell General Hospital, Birmingham; 3 St Thomas Hospital, London Background and aim: Transient Lower Oesophageal Sphincter Relaxation (TLOSR) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} mechanism among several mechanical patterns associated with reflux episodes. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate TLOSR in twin pairs who are discordant for gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) symptoms, i. e. only one of the pair has GORD symptoms to establish whether differences in TLOSR may contribute to the aetiology of GORD. Material and methods: 4 monozygotic (MZ) and 12 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, who were repeatedly discordant for GORD symptoms over 2 years, were studied. LOS function using a sleeve sensor and oesophageal pH were monitored for 30 mins before and 60 mins after a 300 mls (1200 kcal) lipid meal. Results: MZ twins were aged mean 63 (range 53 - 75) yrs and DZ twins 57 (44 - 74) years. TLOSR frequency increased from 1 (0 - 2) to 2. 5 (1 - 8) per hour post-prandially (p= 0. 001) in the symptomatic twins and from 0 (0 - 2) to 3 (1 - 6) post-prandially in the asymptomatic twins (Median (range), p= 0. 001). Comparison between groups revealed that there was no difference in pre-prandial and <b>post</b> <b>prandial</b> TLOSR frequency. However no pre prandial TLOSR were associated with acidic reflux (pH< 4) compared with 38 % of post-prandial TLOSR. Acid reflux episodes (pH< 4) increased post-prandiallyin both symptomatic and asymptomatic twins, but there was no differences between the groups in pre or post-prandial acid reflux episode frequency or total post-prandial acid exposure (symptomatic twins median 11 (range 0 - 1051) s, asymptomatic twins 4 (0 - 487) s (p= 0. 4). Moreover preprandial LOS pressure of 13 (4 - 29) mmHg fell to 8 (2 - 13) after the meal (p= 0. 0001).
