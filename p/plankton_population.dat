40|$|A key {{question}} in biological oceanography is how <b>plankton</b> <b>populations</b> maintain themselves in regions of favorable {{growth and survival}} {{in the face of}} horizontal transport by ocean currents. Plankton are thought to be retained on the highly productive Georges Bank by the clockwise flow, which intensifies with vernal warming. The extent to which plankton are transported off the bank to the southwest or transported northward and retained on the bank remains poorly understood. This thesis examined the relationship between plankton and physical properties in the southwest corner of the bank, the retention-loss region (RLR). Analysis of field data (Video Plankton Recorder, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and satellite-tracked drifters) and modeling results was performed to quantify the relationships between plankton, hydrography, and currents and the fluxes through the RLR. Temperature-salinity-plankton diagrams and factor analysis revealed that most plankton taxa had characteristic relationships to the hydrography, with the exception of copepods which were everywhere abundant. The flux of plankton during a complete tidal cycle and in the de-tided current data indicated this region was not retentive to plankton, since the bulk of the flow remained to the southwest, despite the presence of a vernally warmed surface layer. A Lagrangian particle trajectory model was used to further examine transport of plankton through the RLR during late spring /early summer (June) when vernal stratification was established. Passive particles were used, since no diel vertical migration by plankton was found in the data. The model revealed that the bulk of the plankton was carried out of the RLR through the southern and western boundaries. (cont.) The modeling and data analysis show clearly that the plankton were lost from the bank to the southwest rather than being re-circulated to the north. These results have important implications for the <b>plankton</b> <b>populations</b> on Georges Bank and can be used in future modeling efforts that examine the factors controlling <b>plankton</b> <b>populations</b> in this region. by Qingling Du.

40|$|The annual and {{periodical}} {{recurrence of}} events and processes in marine <b>plankton</b> <b>populations</b> plays {{a central role in}} pelagic food webs. Annual cycles of light and temperature trigger the seasonality of marine <b>plankton</b> <b>populations.</b> Here we analyse phenological variability of 26 phytoplankton species (diatoms and dinoflagellates) monitored at Helgoland Roads during the period 1962 - 2014. We derive temporal indices based on the cumulative percentage of annual abundance to approximate timing and length of annual growth periods. Differences in species-specific preferences in combination with seasonally varying trends in environmental parameters led to a non-homogeneous phenological response on the decadal scale. The median phenological response of spring species (diatoms) is reflected by a shift towards earlier timing due to warming and improved light conditions, but single species show a remarkable constancy in timing over the entire period. During early summer several diatoms and dinoflagellates exhibit a trend towards earlier timing, responding to the temporal expansion of the warm water phase around the annual maximum. Related to this during late summer and early autumn several species show prolonged growing periods. These displacements are characterized by shifts in the centre or the end of the growing period. Cross-comparisons with the total abundances associated with the individual timing points show that phenological trends are not necessarily related to shifts of relevant proportions in phytoplankton abundance.

40|$|Although stochasticity in oceanographic {{conditions}} {{is known to}} be an important driver of temporal genetic change in many marine species, little is known about whether genetically distinct <b>plankton</b> <b>populations</b> can persist in open ocean habitats. A prior study demonstrated significant population genetic structure among oceanic gyres in the mesopelagic copepod Haloptilus longicornis in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and we hypothesized that populations within each gyre represent distinct gene pools that persist over time. We tested this expectation through basin-scale sampling across the Atlantic Ocean in 2010 and 2012. Using both mitochondrial (mtCOII) and microsatellite markers (7 loci), we show that the genetic composition of populations was stable across two years in both the northern and southern subtropical gyres. Genetic variation in this species was partitioned among ocean gyres (FCT = 0. 285, P < 0. 0001 for mtCOII, FCT = 0. 013, P < 0. 0001 for microsatellites), suggesting strong spatial population structure, but no significant partitioning was found among sampling years. This temporal persistence of population structure across a large geographic scale was coupled with chaotic genetic patchiness at smaller spatial scales, but the magnitude of genetic differentiation was an order of magnitude lower at these smaller scales.

40|$|This study applies a metapopulation {{dynamics}} {{approach to}} modelling a distribution of plankton by representing {{a region of}} ocean as an ensemble of <b>plankton</b> <b>populations</b> interacting through the stirring and mixing eects of the ow. The methods of synchronisation theory are applied within this framework to gain insight into emergent spatial structure in biophysical simulations. The manifestation of synchronisation, including statistically stable local clustering of populations, frequency-locking or phase-locking of the entire ensemble and fully synchronised dynamics, is found to depend upon: the biological model used; the strength of mixing between populations; the number of populations or, equivalently, spatial resolution of the modelled region; the level of mismatch between and spatial arrangement of population natural frequencies; the strength of stirring of the ensemble at spatial scales larger than the grid-cell. The study therefore highlights a number of biophysical modelling parameters determining the properties of emergent spatial structure in simulations of surface ocean biological dynamics. This study shows that persistent spatial heterogeneity (patchiness) can result from what intuitively should be a homogenising in uence: mixing can increase the level of disorder between the <b>plankton</b> <b>populations.</b> Furthermore, the work shows that synchronisation eects occur generically under a range of simulation scenarios, giving condence that synchronisation theory can {{explain some of the}} spatial structure, or `patchiness', observed in plankton distributions, and providing one possible answer as to how populations of planktonic organisms maintain coherent spatial structures under the mixing and stirring action of the oceanic flow.
