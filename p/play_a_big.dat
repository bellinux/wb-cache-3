5|$|Buildings <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> role in gameplay, as {{they are}} used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers.|$|E

25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with the semantic web. The semantic web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the semantic web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and automatic classification <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part in the vision for the future semantic web. The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The 2001–02 {{season was}} a banner one for both Shanahan and the Red Wings. Having picked up future Hall-of-Famers Brett Hull, Luc Robitaille and Dominik Hašek in the off-season, {{the team was}} primed to win its third Cup since 1997. They cruised to victory and Shanahan {{continued}} to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> role in their success, scoring 37 goals {{during the regular season}} and 19 points in their ultimately-victorious Stanley Cup run. Shanahan also picked up an Olympic gold medal in Salt Lake City with Team Canada and was named to the Second NHL All-Star Team. The season was also of particular statistical significance for Shanahan, as shortly preceding his Olympic gold medal victory, he recorded his 1,000th point in the NHL after scoring two goals against Marty Turco in a 4–2 victory over the Dallas Stars on January 12, 2002. Then, later in the season, Shanahan also reached the 500-goal mark, scoring the game-winner against Patrick Roy in a 2–0 victory over Colorado on March 23. The win also marked a team accomplishment as it clinched a Presidents' Trophy as the top ranked regular-season team.|$|E

25|$|Jacob Grimm's work tied in {{strongly}} to {{his views on}} Germany and its culture. His work with fairy tales and his philological work dealt with German origins. He loved his people and wished for a united Germany, {{he and his brother}} were vocal proponents of expansionist Pan-Germanism. In the German revolution of 1848, he was given a chance to make these views known when {{he was elected to the}} Frankfurt National Parliament. The people of Germany had demanded a constitution, so the Parliament, formed of elected members from various German states, met to form one. Grimm was selected for the office in a large part because of his part in the University of Goettingen's refusal to swear to the king of Hanover expounded upon above. He then went to Frankfurt, where he did not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part, but did make some speeches, which tended to stray into the realms of history and philology rather than whatever political question was at hand. Grimm was adamant on one subject, however; he wanted the Danish-ruled but German-speaking duchy of Holstein to be under German control. He talked passionately on this subject, which showed his fierce German nationalism.|$|E
500|$|The episode's main storylines {{revolve around}} Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia) and Hiro Nakamura's (Masi Oka) quest {{to stop the}} release of the Shanti virus, and Sylar's (Zachary Quinto) attempt to regain his powers. The end of the episode {{features}} a brief prologue of the third volume, [...] "Villains", which features Sylar regaining his powers. Originally, the virus was going to be released, and Tim Kring said that it was to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> role in Volume 3. Kring stated that the ending had to be rewritten because they did not know when the show would return to air, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.

[...] Goldman {{felt that the}} episode did not back down from the deeply powerful storylines from the past, and praised the emotions of the fleet after finding Earth in ruins. The Guardian received the episode positively, stating how many events happened {{during the course of}} the episode, and felt that the episode played fair with its audience, despite the number of new questions being addressed. It was anticipated that Dualla would <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part in the episode after her appearance from the cold open. Her suicide was compared with Boomer shooting Adama in the closing scene of season 1 in a dramatical sense.

500|$|The {{game was}} first {{unveiled}} at E3 2006. From early previews of the game, inevitable comparisons of {{elements such as}} platforming and shooting between Uncharted and the well-known Tomb Raider series were drawn, earning the title the nickname of [...] "Dude Raider". However, the developers saw their game as concentrating more on third-person cover-based play, in contrast to Tomb Raiders [...] "auto-aiming" [...] play and greater puzzle-solving elements. Other influences they cited include Resident Evil 4, Kill Switch, and Gears of War. Throughout the game's development the staff tried to remain flexible and detached from the original design concepts; attention {{was focused on the}} features that worked well, while features that did not work were removed. The development team intended the game's main setting, the island, to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> role in the overall experience. Feeling too many games used bleak, dark settings with monochromatic color schemes, they wanted the island to be a vibrant, believable game world that immersed the player and encouraged exploration.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Heike Görtemaker {{noted that}} {{women did not}} <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> role in the {{politics}} of the Third Reich. Braun's political influence on Hitler was apparently minimal. She was never allowed to stay in the room when business or political conversations took place, and was sent out of the room when cabinet ministers or other dignitaries were present. She was {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. In his post-war memoirs Hoffmann characterized Braun's outlook as [...] "inconsequential and feather-brained"; her main interests were sports, clothes, and the cinema. By all accounts, she led a sheltered and privileged existence and seemed uninterested in politics. One instance when she took an interest was in 1943, shortly after Germany had fully transitioned to a total war economy. Among other things, this meant a potential ban on women's cosmetics and luxuries. According to Speer's memoirs, Braun approached Hitler in [...] "high indignation"; Hitler quietly instructed Speer, who was armaments minister at the time, to halt production of women's cosmetics and luxuries rather than instituting an outright ban.|$|E

Executive producer Cameron Welsh promised viewers that the storyline would <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of the serial in 2011. He also stated: [...] "Fans will definitely take sides on this one. Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are having a great time with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions." [...] Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: [...] "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby never really had a father figure. There's a lot of looking to belong and looking for love because she's had a displaced family life, and she feels like Romeo is her family. Romeo has some issues of his own. He is struggling with his relationship with Indi. The pair find themselves in a similar place of understanding." [...] After Romeo sleeps with Ruby, Mitchell said Romeo immediately regrets it. Ruby then decides to reveals the truth to Indigo. This ruins their friendship and Weaving said: [...] "I think that friendship is pretty much over now!".|$|E

500|$|Several {{elements}} of the machine had to be properly adjusted to match the timing for the song. The group broke the song into sections, triggered when the machine passed certain gates, to account for small changes in timing that could occur (up to 0.5 sec, according to Brett Doar, one of the machine's chief designers), allowing the band to continue to lip synch while the machine operated. Smaller objects like dominoes {{were found to be}} the trickiest to set, as their patterns would be less predictable than larger and bulkier objects, which are more predominant in the later parts of the machine. Once the machine transitioned to the downstairs portion, it would generally run the rest of the course untouched. Furthermore, the time of day and temperature would <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> factor in how some small components would behave, forcing the team to readjust the timing. Ball tracks and other features had to be wiped clear of dust and debris to prevent slowing down rolling objects. A carved wooden ball track shown early in the video was created to have motions timed to the music, but required a low inclined angle that would often cause the balls to skip out of the tracks.|$|E
500|$|The {{event was}} contested in Hyde Park in Central London, a park opened in 1637. The [...] swim {{started on the}} north side of The Serpentine and the course was just one lap. After {{competing}} in the London leg of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series on the Olympic course Laura Bennett said that the swim was the hardest part of the course: “The swim was the most difficult, it was hard to get away from everyone.” Erin Densham said that: [...] "“The swim is going to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> role.

[...] Honestly there is no knowing how it’s going to go but it’s going to be hard and fast."After the swim there was then a [...] transition zone in front of the main grandstand. The competitors then started a [...] bike leg consisting of seven [...] laps. The cyclists first rode down Serpentine Road towards West Carriage Drive before changing direction and cycling to Hyde Park Corner. The course then quickly turned left towards Hyde Park to go past Buckingham Palace on Constitution Hill. Once passing Buckingham Palace, the cyclists turned and went back towards Hyde Park and eventually crossed through the transition area before starting the next lap. The final discipline was the run. It was four-laps of a [...] loop around The Serpentine on flat ground.|$|E
