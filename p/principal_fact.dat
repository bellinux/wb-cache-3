But this <b>principal</b> <b>fact</b> we have learned by our {{experiment}} with the white paper, that, taken all in all, the calm sky, with such light and shade as are in it, is brighter than the earth; brighter than the whitest thing on earth which has not, {{at the moment of}} comparison, heaven's own direct light on it. Which fact it is generally one of the first objects of noble painters to render. I have already marked one part of their aim in doing so, namely, the expression of infinity; but the opposing of heavenly light to earth-darkness is another most important one; and of all ways of rendering a picture generally impressive (see especially ยง 12. of the chapter just referred to), this is the simplest and surest. Make the sky calm and luminous, and raise against it dark trees, mountains, or towers, or any other substantial and terrestrial thing, in bold outline, and the mind accepts the assertion of this great and solemn truth with thankfulness.|$|E

6000|$|I have printed {{the letters}} {{as they are}} placed in the inscription, in order that the reader may form {{some idea of the}} {{difficulty}} of reading such legends when the letters, thus thrown into one heap, are themselves of strange forms, and half worn away; any gaps which at all occur between them coming in the wrong places. There is no doubt, however, as to the reading of this fragment:--"T ... Sancte Marie Domini Genetricis et beati Estefani martiri ego indignus et peccator Domenicus T." [...] On these two initial and final T's, expanding one into Templum, the other into Torcellanus, M. Lazari founds an ingenious conjecture that the inscription records the elevation of the church under a certain bishop Dominic of Torcello (named in the Altinat Chronicle), who flourished {{in the middle of the}} ninth century. If this were so, as the inscription occurs broken off on a fragment inserted scornfully in the present edifice, this edifice must be of the twelfth century, worked with fragments taken from the ruins of that built in the ninth. The two T's are, however, hardly a foundation large enough to build the church upon, a hundred years before the date assigned to it both by history and tradition (see above, ยง VIII.): and the reader has yet to be made aware of the <b>principal</b> <b>fact</b> bearing on the question.|$|E

Of this I am certain, that it was my design originally to have concealed the receipt of all the sums, except the second, even from the knowledge of the Court of Directors. They had answered my purpose of public utility, and I had almost totally dismissed them from my remembrance. But when fortune threw a sum in my way of a magnitude which could not be concealed, and the peculiar delicacy of my situation at the time in which I received it made me more circumspect of appearances, I chose to apprise my employers of it, which I did hastily and generally: hastily, perhaps to prevent the vigilance and activity of secret calumny; and generally, because I knew not the exact amount of the sum, of which I was in the receipt, but not in the full possession. I promised to acquaint them with the result as soon as I should be in possession of it, and in the performance of my promise I thought it consistent with it to add to the account all the former appropriations of the same kind: my good genius then suggesting to me, with a spirit of caution which might have spared me the trouble of this apology, had I universally attended to it, that, if I had suppressed them, and they were afterwards known, I might be asked what were my motives for withholding part of these receipts from the knowledge of the Court of Directors and informing them of the rest.|$|E
6000|$|Fortune, Minerva, Muse, Holy Ghost,--these are quaint names, {{too narrow}} {{to cover this}} {{unbounded}} substance. The baffled intellect must still kneel before this cause, which refuses to be named,--ineffable cause, which every fine genius has essayed to represent by some emphatic symbol, as, Thales by water, Anaximenes by air, Anaxagoras by (Nous) thought, Zoroaster by fire, Jesus and the moderns by love; and the metaphor of each has become a national religion. The Chinese Mencius {{has not been the}} least successful in his generalization. [...] "I fully understand language," [...] he said, [...] "and nourish well my vast-flowing vigor."--"I beg to ask what you call vast-flowing vigor?"--said his companion. [...] "The explanation," [...] replied Mencius, [...] "is difficult. This vigor is supremely great, and in the highest degree unbending. Nourish it correctly and do it no injury, and it will fill up the vacancy between heaven and earth. This vigor accords with and assists justice and reason, and leaves no hunger."--In our more correct writing we give to this generalization the name of Being, and thereby confess that we have arrived {{as far as we can}} go. Suffice it for the joy of the universe that we have not arrived at a wall, but at interminable oceans. Our life seems not present so much as prospective; not for the affairs on which it is wasted, but as a hint of this vast-flowing vigor. Most of life seems to be mere advertisement of faculty; information is given us not to sell ourselves cheap; that we are very great. So, in particulars, our greatness is always in a tendency or direction, not in an action. It is for us to believe in the rule, not in the exception. The noble are thus known from the ignoble. So in accepting the leading of the sentiments, it is not what we believe concerning the immortality of the soul or the like, but the universal impulse to believe, that is the material circumstance and is the <b>principal</b> <b>fact</b> in the history of the globe. Shall we describe this cause as that which works directly? The spirit is not helpless or needful of mediate organs. It has plentiful powers and direct effects. I am explained without explaining, I am felt without acting, and where I am not. Therefore all just persons are satisfied with their own praise. They refuse to explain themselves, and are content that new actions should do them that office. They believe that we communicate without speech and above speech, and that no right action of ours is quite unaffecting to our friends, at whatever distance; for the influence of action is not to be measured by miles. Why should I fret myself because a circumstance has occurred which hinders my presence where I was expected? If I am not at the meeting, my presence where I am should be as useful to the commonwealth of friendship and wisdom, as would be my presence in that place. I exert the same quality of power in all places. Thus journeys the mighty Ideal before us; it never was known to fall into the rear. No man ever came to an experience which was satiating, but his good is tidings of a better. Onward and onward! In liberated moments we know that a new picture of life and duty is already possible; the elements already exist in many minds around you of a doctrine of life which shall transcend any written record we have. The new statement will comprise the skepticisms as well as the faiths of society, and out of unbeliefs a creed shall be formed. For skepticisms are not gratuitous or lawless, but are limitations of the affirmative statement, and the new philosophy must take them in and make affirmations outside of them, just as much as it must include the oldest beliefs.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{too much}} reason to fear that {{the account of the}} death of Mr Bathurst, late envoy to the Emperor of Austria, {{inserted}} in a Paris journal, is correct as to the <b>principal</b> <b>fact.</b> It was stated, as an article of Berlinnews, of the date of December 10, that Mr Bathurst had evinced symptoms of insanity on his journey through the city, and that he had subsequently fallen by his own hand in the vicinity of Perleberg. Information, however, has been received within these few days, which forcibly tends to fix the guilt of Mr Bathurst's death, or disappearance, on the French Government. It appears that Mr Bathurst left Berlin with passports from the Prussian Government, and in excellent health, both of mind and body. He was to proceed to Hamburg, but Hamburg he never reached. At some town near the French territories he was seized, as is supposed, by a party of French soldiers. What happened afterwards is not accurately known. His pantaloons have been found near the town where he was seized, and a letter in them to his wife; but nothing else. The Prussian Government, upon receiving the intelligence, evinced the deepest regret, and offered a large reward for the discovery of his body. No success, however, has attended the offer.

Mercury and arsenic where present in sufficient concentrations are considered to be hazardous substances. They may be naturally occurring, of anthropogenic origin, or some combination thereof.

In the future, the possibility exists that adversaries might exploit the tools and techniques of the information revolution to hold at risk (not of destruction, but of large-scale or massive disruption) key national strategic assets, such as elements of various key national infrastructure sectors (energy, telecommunications, transportation, financial, etc.). This potential danger constitutes the <b>principal</b> <b>fact</b> of the SIW environment as conceptualized here. Both regional adversaries and peer competitors may find SIW tools and techniques of use to them in challenging the United States, its allies, and/or its interests. In the near term, SIW weapons may be most useful to regional adversaries applying asymmetric strategies (See Figure 9. 1) {{as a way to}} avoid directly challenging U.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that anomaly {{cancellations}} for D_ 16 Lie algebra are {{at the root of the}} first string revolution. For E_ 8 Lie algebra, cancellation of anomalies is the <b>principal</b> <b>fact</b> leading to the existence of heterotic string. They are in fact nothing but the 6 th order cohomologies of corresponding Lie algebras. Beyond 6 th order, the calculations seem to require special care and it could be that their study will be worthwhile in the light of developments of the second string revolution. As we have shown in a recent article, for A_N Lie algebras, there is a method which are based on the calculations of Casimir eigenvalues. This is extended to E_ 8 Lie algebra in the present article. In the generality of any irreducible representation of E_ 8 Lie algebra, we consider 8 th and 12 th order cohomologies while emphasizing the diversities between the two. It is seen that one can respectively define 2 and 8 basic invariant polinomials in terms of which 8 th and 12 th order Casimir eigenvalues are always expressed as linear superpositions. All these can be easily investigated because each one of these invariant polinimials gives us a linear equation to calculate E_ 8 weight multiplicities. Our results beyond order 12 are not included here because they get more complicated though share the same characteristic properties with 12 th order calculations.

The resulting database contains 59, 911 stations (Figure 1), and represents a significant improvement in size, completeness of information, and data quality. The database {{in its present form}} should serve the needs of the MGS and the broader geologic community for many years to come. The <b>principal</b> <b>fact</b> gravity database in Minnesota is comprised of over 59, 000 measurements collected since 1950.

Because much of the Precambrian bedrock in Minnesota lies beneath thick glacial deposits, gravity measurements, which are sensitive to density variations, are particularly helpful at inferring structures and rock types deep in the subsurface. The state-wide gravity data is most commonly used in conjunction with the high- resolution aeromagnetic data from Minnesota, which is highly sensitive to magnetic variations in the underlying Precambrian rocks. In 2003, the MGS released a state-wide gravity database with 57890 stations (gravity meter readings). This is an update to that database.
