5|$|To {{identify}} {{postage stamps}} used in Ireland between 1840 and 1922, {{it is necessary}} to identify the <b>postmark</b> cancelling the stamp as being from an Irish town. Stamps used during this period are referred to as Great Britain used in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete <b>postmark</b> visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the <b>postmark</b> can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E
