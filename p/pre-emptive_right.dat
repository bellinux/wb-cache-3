In March 1999 SIA made a formal offer of A$500 million for a half share. Given SIA's industry-leading status, ability to fund Ansett's re-equipment and expansion and global marketing network, industry observers were enthusiastic about the move. However, as part of its original deal to buy TNT's half of Ansett, Air New Zealand had a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> to News Limited's half, provided only that it matched or bettered other offers.|$|E
25|$|Davey later partnered in {{the cattle}} run of Captain Benjamin Baxter, the first Postmaster and former Clerk of Petty {{sessions}} for the Port Phillip District, during the early-1850s. Their run covered {{the majority of}} what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Langwarrin and Langwarrin South. The fisherman James Oliver built his house on northern Olivers Hill around this time, so he could keep watch for schools of fish in the waters below, and after whom the locality is now known by its current name. The explorer and surveyor Charles Wedge also arrived around this time, gaining a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> to land license over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Carrum Downs and Seaford.|$|E

The basic hypothesis is that this law institute disturbs efficiency of resource allocation, and decreases social welfare. There are a few better and more efficient institutes {{which can be used}} for gaining of goods in public ownership. To prove this hypothesis, we used neo-institutional economy method and normative method. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we presented the law of <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>rights</b> in the legal system of Serbia. After that, we analyzed effects of <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>rights</b> on a deviation from resource allocation. The third part represents an analysis of institutional frame for optimal resource allocation. There is a special view on imprecise definition of property rights, as well as the increased transaction costs due to the existence of the right of pre-emption...|$|R
40|$|Choice {{of capital}} {{financing}} sources {{is one of}} the most relevant element of companies strategies. So as to keep long term growth enterprises are either investing in technology, distribution channels and in production capacity or just purchasing their competitors and building vertical or horizontal-merged groups. Both ways of development require additional capital. In the first part of the article some ways of companies financing were presented. Primarily equity-related sources of financing were described, in particular issues with <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>rights</b> and option/warrant embedded instruments. In the second part debt-related and leasing instruments were analyzed. Author focused on each product separately, presenting its construction, types and the best ways of application in enterprise. In the empirical part of the paper author concentrated on influence of the issue with preemptive rights on company's stock price. The analysis was based on Polish Stock Exchange data for the period of 2000 - 2006 (i. e. value of the issue, parity of new shares to existing shares, issue price). In particular it was analyzed how the stock price changes in <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>rights</b> day in comparison with the closing price from the day before. It was also presented how stock rates fluctuates in the period between the shareholders decision on the issue and <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>rights</b> day in comparison with the changes of major stock index. Finally it was presented whether it is possible to reach extraordinary profits from investing in companies issuing with <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>rights</b> or not.

25|$|While this {{movement}} {{had been going}} on, the question of granting responsible government had come much to the front. In 1850 an act for the better government of the Australian colonies was passed, which provided that the existing nominee councils should frame electoral acts for new elected councils. A council of 16 members was elected in Tasmania, all supporting the Anti-Transportation movement, and the governor's power was now much reduced. He, however, incurred some criticism by proclaiming <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> land regulations before the new Council met. The proclamation was intended to help to keep small holders of land in Tasmania, but the large graziers and speculators defeated this by taking up large tracts of land. Denison, however, became more popular {{towards the end of}} his term. In September 1854 he received word that he had been appointed Governor of New South Wales, and when he left Hobart on 13 January 1855 he received a cheque for £2000 from the colonists to purchase a piece of plate as a memento of his sojourn among them. After correspondence with the Secretary of State he was allowed to accept this. One of his last official acts was to support the Legislative Council's request that the colony's name be changed to Tasmania.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham {{acquired}} {{the right of}} pre-emption to the lands at issue in Fellows v. Blacksmith from Massachusetts in 1788 {{as part of the}} Phelps and Gorham Purchase. However, Phelps and Gorham only consummated the right of pre-emption for a tract east of the Genesee River in 1788. [...] Phelps and Gorham defaulted on their payments to Massachusetts in 1790, causing the pre-emption rights to return to the state. Massachusetts then conveyed the pre-emption rights to Samuel Ogden on behalf of Robert Morris on May 12, 1791. Morris retained the <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> to the Morris Reserve for himself, but sold the <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> to the lands in question to the Holland Land Company on July 20, 1793 (the Holland Purchase).|$|E
500|$|The Holland Land Company consummated {{much of its}} <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> in the Treaty of Big Tree (1797), {{extinguishing}} all Seneca aboriginal title west of the Genesee River {{except in}} ten reservations. The dispute concerned one of those reservations. [...] The Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) had provided for the relocation of the Seneca people from New York to present-day Kansas, {{with the exception of}} four reservations: the Buffalo Creek Reservation, the Cattaraugus Reservation, the Allegany Reservation, and the Tonawanda Reservation. However, the Seneca refused to be relocated. [...] Another treaty with the Senecas from 1842 modified the prior treaty: [...] the Senecas were to keep Cattaraugus and Allegany, but still cede Buffalo Creek and Tonawanda. The Seneca Nation of New York was established in 1848. The Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians seceded from the Seneca Nation and achieved independent federal recognition (after the decision) in 1857.|$|E

2500|$|James Davey {{arrived in}} the Frankston area in 1840, gaining a 640 acre <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> to land license over what are now the suburbs of Frankston and Frankston South from Olivers Hill south to Daveys Bay. Davey built the Cannanuke Inn in the mid-1840s, {{which was the first}} {{permanent}} building in the Frankston area, and was located {{on the site of the}} present Frankston Mechanics' Institute at 1 Plowman Place in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD). He built the first permanent wooden house in the southern Frankston area located near Daveys Bay on Olivers Hill in 1851—which was originally known as [...] "Old Man Davey's Hill".|$|E
2500|$|As {{there appear}} to be no {{licensing}} records for the Cannanuke Inn, {{it is difficult to determine}} if this is in fact true. However, Charlwood does mention that Stone had purchased the Cannanuke Inn from [...] "a man named Standring". Licensing records state that Benjamin Standring was the owner of the Frankston Hotel from 1857 to 1860. Also, according to the terms of his <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> to land licence, Davey did not have the right to sell or sub-let the Cannanuke Inn. It is therefore unlikely that Stone purchased or leased the Cannanuke Inn from Davey or Standring before the formal land sales for Frankston in 1854—and after which the name [...] "Frankston" [...] was already in use.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Franks {{arrived in}} Melbourne aboard the Champion from Van Diemen's Land in 1836 {{and made a}} squatter's claim {{to land on the}} western side of Port Phillip near Mount Cottrel (northeast of what is now the Melbourne outer-western suburb of Wyndham Vale). Franks' land neighboured that of the early Melbourne {{explorer}} and surveyor John Helder Wedge, which was managed by his nephew Charles Wedge—prior to him gaining a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>right</b> to land license of his own for the Frankston area. The correspondence with the Department of Lands and Survey states that, at the time of surveying the area for the land sales of 1854, the name [...] "Frankston" [...] was probably suggested to honour the Wedge's deceased former neighbour.|$|E
