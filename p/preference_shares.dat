5|$|As {{business}} {{improved in}} 1904 the enterprise moved to larger premises in Pendleton, where an annual rent of £90 was payable. On 1 January 1906, this operation became a limited company, The Churchill Machine Tool Co, with an authorised share capital of £50,000, split as £20,000 in ordinary shares of £1 and £30,000 in £5 <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> To accomplish {{the transfer of}} manufacturing operations, Charles Churchill & Co sold the Pendleton business to the new company for £15,000, of which £7,500 was in cash and a similar amount in £1 ordinary shares. The directors were Charles Churchill, J W W Gabriel, Walter Chamberlain and C H Churchill. Herbert Chamberlain had died in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that HM Government would take a stake of up to 58% in the Royal Bank of Scotland in a move aimed at recapitalising the Group. HM Treasury subscribed for £5billion in <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> and underwrote the issuance of £15bn of new ordinary shares offered to RBS shareholders and new institutional shareholders at the fixed price of 65.5p. As a consequence of the mismanagement which necessitated this rescue, the chief executive, Fred Goodwin (who secured the takeover of NatWest), offered his resignation, which was duly accepted. Chairman Sir Tom McKillop also confirmed he would stand down from that role when his contract expired in 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously chief executive of British Land.|$|E
25|$|The {{cosmetic}} {{benefits in}} (1) reported pro-forma diluted earnings per share, (2) debt gearing (for a while) and (3) pro-forma consolidated pre-tax profits (for convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares)</b> led to UK convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> being the largest European class of convertibles {{in the early}} 1980s, until the tighter terms achievable on Euroconvertible bonds resulted in Euroconvertible new issues eclipsing domestic convertibles (including convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares)</b> from the mid 1980s.|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> scheme devised in practice to acquire a company (with the assessed loss of the acquired company still intact) in terms of the procedures as provided for in section 311 of the Companies Act (Act 61 of 1973; hereafter referred to as the Companies Act). The study mainly aims at discussing and analysing the standard scheme, the <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> scheme and the future of the <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> scheme in light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in CIR v Datakor Engineering (Pty) Ltd 1998 CLR 574 (A) (hereafter referred to as the Datakor case) which has thrown the proverbial cat amongst the pigeons with reference to schemes of arrangements. In order to properly focus this study it is limited to an analysis of the provisions of section 20 (1) (a) (ii) of the Income Tax Act (Act 58 of 1962) (hereafter referred to as the Act) with reference to the Datakor case, and the antiavoidance provisions contained in section 103 (2) of the Act...|$|R
25|$|Voting {{dilution}} deferred. With {{a convertible}} bond, dilution {{of the voting}} rights of existing shareholders only happens on eventual conversion of the bond.

50|$|In the Spring of 1866 Hodgson {{declared}} a 3% dividend on ordinary shares, but {{the share price}} continued to decline. In the Autumn of 1866 Hodgson was again proposing a dividend of 3% but a new company secretary, John Walker, alerted the finance committee to the true state of the NBR's finances. A new <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> issue had flopped, and it proved impossible to pay debenture interest and <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> guaranteed dividends. Evidently {{it was intended to}} pay the dividend out of new capital; North British ordinary shares fell overnight by 8% after this revelation. Widespread financial impropriety and falsification of accounts were disclosed, all laid at Hodgson's door, and this was reported to a Special General Meeting on 14 November 1866.|$|R
25|$|In some {{countries}} (such as Finland) convertibles of various structures may {{be treated as}} equity by the local accounting profession. In such circumstances, the accounting treatment may result in less pro-forma debt than if straight debt was used as takeover currency or to fund an acquisition. The perception was that gearing was less with a convertible than if straight debt was used instead. In the UK the predecessor to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{put a stop to}} treating convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> as equity. Instead it has to be classified both as (1) preference capital and as (2) convertible as well.|$|E
25|$|Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{stated that}} UK taxpayers {{would benefit from}} the government's rescue plan, as it will have some control over RBS in {{exchange}} for £5 billion in <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> and underwriting the issuance of a further £15 billion in ordinary shares. If shareholder take-up of the share issue was 0%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 58%; and, if shareholder take-up was 100%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 0%. Less than 56million new shares were taken up by investors, or 0.24pc of the total offered by RBS in October 2008.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{sell the}} mine, or its assets, came to nothing. Eventually Captain Borlase, who had retired in 1919, {{proposed}} a new investment by the old shareholders and negotiated new terms with the landowners. Shareholders agreed to a reconstruction of the company which involved allotting four new £1 ordinary shares {{for each of the}} 7,680 old shares, and issuing 4,280 <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> to raise money needed for development of the mine. The new 1923 Greenside Mining Company Ltd. came into being, and the landowners agreed a dead rent of £225 per year for five years, with a reduced scale of royalties payable on top of the rent after that time.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} share price {{response}} to the announcement of private placements of hybrid securities in Australia. Firstly, the size and direction of {{the share price}} response is examined. Secondly, the determinants of the share price response are examined. Where possible, comparisons are made to evidence from international markets. The sample of data tested consists of 43 announcements of convertible debt issues, 39 announcements of <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> issues and 19 announcements of option issues made between 1983 and 2000 by Australian firms. The analysis of the share price impact in response to the announcements is conducted using Maynes and Rumsey (1993) event study methodology that adjusts for thin trading. The determinants of the share price response are examined using model specifications that are derived from the theoretical literature. The analysis of the announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities finds significant negative abnormal returns for convertible debt issues, insignificant negative abnormal returns for <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> issues and significant positive abnormal returns for option issues. In comparison to international studies, the convertible debt results are similar to public and rights issues, the insignificant <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> results are similar to other findings and the option results are similar to private placements of equity and rights issues of options. The results of the investigation of the determinants of the announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities finds that convertible debt issues are best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry - external monitors hypothesis, the information asymmetry - dynamic hypothesis and the agency cost hypothesis. The impact of <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> issues is best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry - external monitors hypothesis, the agency cost hypothesis and the price pressure hypothesis. The announcement effect of option issues is best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry -dynamic hypothesis and the optimal capital structure hypothesis...|$|R
25|$|In the meanwhile, in 1890 the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Petroleumbronnen in Nederlandsch-Indie (KNMEP) ("Royal Dutch Company for the Working of Petroleum Wells in the Dutch Indies") — part of Royal Dutch Petroleum — was founded. In 1892 {{it found}} oil near Pangkalan Brandan on Sumatra, just some months before Samuels {{kerosene}} arrived in Singapore. At first, chartered ships were used, but in 1896 KNMEP launched its first tankers, the Besitang and Berandan. The {{threat of the}} Tank Syndicate was reduced as the Dutch government excluded them from trading in the Dutch East Indies. To prevent a hostile takeover by Standard Oil, <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> were issued. By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven oil tankers. Standard Oil started building tankers {{the same way as}} Shell and by 1900 owned around 60 tankers.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{regularise}} the financial position of the company, but it was unable to escape from its difficulty and went into receivership {{for a second time}} in 1889. By then it had become obvious that continuing inaction was impossible, and discussion had taken place with the Great Western Railway with a view to the larger company buying the Wye Valley concern. The unsatisfactory situation dragged on, and finally in December 1904 the sale was agreed. The GWR was to pay 2.5% of face value on ordinary shares, and 12.5% on <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> Ordinary shareholders had thus lost nearly all their money. The sale took formal effect on 1 July 1905. As the GWR had been working the line from the beginning, there was no obvious outward change so far as the travelling public were concerned.|$|E

500|$|The act forbade {{the company}} from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for {{ordinary}} people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten {{so they could be}} paid for in instalments. [...] The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as £3 million of ordinary shares and £4million of <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887.
