25|$|I don't {{know why}} <b>people</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I {{was raised in}} it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
500|$|Fidel Castro's {{religious}} beliefs {{have been a}} matter of some debate; he was baptized and raised a Roman Catholic, but he identified himself later in life as an atheist. He criticized use of the Bible to justify the oppression of women and Africans, but commented that Christianity exhibited [...] "a group of very humane precepts" [...] which gave the world [...] "ethical values" [...] and a [...] "sense of social justice", relating, [...] "If <b>people</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare that I am a Christian."

2500|$|In {{the years}} between the wars, feminists fought {{discrimination}} and establishment opposition. In Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, Woolf describes {{the extent of the}} backlash and her frustration at the waste of so much talent. By now, the word [...] "feminism" [...] was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself {{have never been able to}} find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that <b>people</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute." [...] Woolf's writing also examined gender constructs and portrayed lesbian sexuality positively.|$|E

6000|$|... "Is that all?" [...] asked Teacher. Then {{without waiting}} for a reply he added, [...] "It {{is because of the}} way Mrs. Teacher and I build our nest. Some people think it is like an oven and so they call us Oven Birds.

I can't loll all the morning on a sofa, and all the {{afternoon}} in a carriage. I get horribly restless. I must move; I must do something and see something. Mamma suggests a cup of tea. Meanwhile I put on an old dress and half a dozen veils, I take Assunta under my arm, and we start on a pedestrian tour. It 's a bore that I can't take the poodle, but he attracts attention.

Mr. Brott, the bodies and souls of millions of your fellow-creatures were in the hollow of your hand. It was you who might have set them free. It was you who might have made this the greatest, the freest, the happiest country in the world. Not so much for us perhaps as for our children, and our children's children. We didn't expect a huge social upheaval in a week, or even a decade of years. But we did expect to see the first blow struck. Oh, yes, we expected that." ...|$|E
