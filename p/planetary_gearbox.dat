25|$|The vintage era {{lasted from}} the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to {{dominate}} with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed. Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multi-valve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A. Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed <b>planetary</b> <b>gearbox,</b> torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production. (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.) Just {{at the end of the}} vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France. In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).|$|E

40|$|AbstractGearbox {{failure is}} one of the highest risk events in wind turbines. In most of the wind turbines, <b>planetary</b> <b>gearboxes</b> are {{preferred}} over conventional gearboxes due to their significant advantages. But condition monitoring of <b>planetary</b> <b>gearboxes</b> present a huge challenge to the vibration analysts due to complex design and construction of its unit, vibration transducer type and locations, wide frequency range of the vibrations, resolution required to separate frequencies and dynamic range required to observe both low frequency and high frequency components in the spectrum. Due to strong Gear Mesh Frequency (GMF) signals, gear defect vibration characteristics can often be suppressed in the overall vibration signal. So {{there is a need to}} develop or utilize various special signal processing techniques in order to identify and monitor the progression of defects in gears more effectively. This paper focuses on one such technique namely Sideband Energy Ratio (SER) for monitoring of gear defect progression in wind turbine gearboxes. Theory behind SER is and its significance in gear defect monitoring is presented in this paper through three case studies. In all the three case studies, SER of 2 XGMF were found to be more sensitive than 1 XGMF towards gear defect progression...|$|R

(The less-sophisticated Hydra-Matic, which used a simple fluid coupling, would only become an available option on Oldsmobiles in 1940.)

50|$|The Turboglide is a Chevrolet {{constant}} torque 3-speed automatic transmission that {{made its debut}} as an optional transmission on Chevrolet V8 passenger cars for 1957. It consisted of a concurrently geared (as opposed to sequentially geared) <b>planetary</b> <b>gearbox</b> with a 'switch pitch' dual-pitch torque converter stator. Turboglide utilized a die-cast aluminum transmission case, following Packard's Ultramatic of 1956. It was designed to help showcase the engineering features of the '57 Chevy, and was often ordered with the Rochester Ramjet Fuel Injection system on the 283 V8. Turboglide cost about $50 more than Powerglide, and was available in all 1957-1961 V8 engine models except the Corvette.|$|E

However, the commonly used in-phase sidebands have high amplitudes but include gear error effects, consequently leading to poor diagnostic results...|$|R
50|$|After {{generators}} and cable, minor amounts of copper {{are used in}} the remaining equipment. In yaw and pitch auxiliary motors, the yaw drive uses a combination of induction motors and multi-stage <b>planetary</b> <b>gearboxes</b> with minor amounts of copper. Power electronics have minimal amounts of copper compared to other equipment. As turbine capacities increase, converter ratings also increase from low voltage (<1kV) to medium voltage (1kV-5kV). Most wind turbines have full power converters, which have the same power rating as the generator, except the DFAG that has a power converter that is 30% of the rating of the generator. Finally, minor amounts of copper are used in air/oil and water cooled circuits on gearboxes or generators.|$|R
50|$|The HydraMatic was {{designed}} to combine hydraulic operation of a <b>planetary</b> <b>gearbox</b> (allowing much shifting to be automated) with a fluid coupling instead of a friction clutch, {{eliminating the need for}} de-clutching. The transmission would have four forward speeds (3.82:1, 2.63:1, 1.45:1, and 1.00:1) plus reverse, with all acceleration provided by gearing; its fluid coupling did not multiply the engine output as a torque converter does. (In this way, it was less sophisticated than the 1924 Vulcan (Vulcan-Werke Hamburg und Stettin) prototype, which had a torque converter.) It incorporated a parking pawl which was engaged when the shift selector was placed in reverse with the engine off. There was no separate Park position as found with modern transmissions.|$|E
