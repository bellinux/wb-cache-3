5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E
5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> resume playing the game.|$|E
5|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} the PC's choice. If the PC chooses to become a vampire, former allies turn against the PC. Once they are defeated, Orbakh sends the <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> destroy the Ebon Claws. If the PC instead decides to keep the mask, Orbakh attacks; after his defeat, {{the leader of the}} Ebon Claws arrives with a group of {{followers}} and attacks the party. After the party is victorious, they kill the last of the Night Masks and free the player character from the cursed mask.|$|E

A year later AppleShare PC was released, allowing <b>PCs</b> <b>to</b> access AppleShare file servers.|$|R

5|$|The game {{began as}} the private {{development}} of Seow Zong Hui who presented an early build to Christian Svensson, Capcom's Senior VP of consumer software, at EVO 2012. Svensson showed the build to several staff {{members in the}} Capcom office (including senior community manager Brett Elston), and Capcom later decided {{to assist in the}} development of the game. While Zong Hui continued to develop the game based on his original design, Capcom took over tasks such as funding, marketing, and quality assurance. Capcom decided to distribute the game on PC instead of gaming consoles because Zong Hui did not have a license for console development. Svensson has noted that Capcom will consider console releases in the future, but chose to initially distribute the game on <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> keep the game free for fans and meet its December 17 target release date.|$|E
5|$|As a {{video game}} company with {{different}} production teams, Square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know-how and technology even before the merger with its competitor Enix. The desire for a common development infrastructure and engine {{dates back to the}} 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy Tactics, which was created in the transitional period from 2D to 3D game production. Back then, the artists working on the game asked programmer Taku Murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in the final game. As the development was carried out on personal computers, the graphics were displayed on computer monitors. This looked very different from the PlayStation console's actual graphics displayed on a television screen. Initially, a faithful preview of the game's visuals was too time-consuming because all data had to be transferred from <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> console first. To evade this step, Murata created an instant preview tool. With this, he soon witnessed a boost in the artists' productivity and in the quality of their work. For 2000's Vagrant Story, the developers opted to reuse this instant preview tool rather than programming a new one from scratch. Murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified preview and cutscene tool tailored to the game's fully polygonal 3D graphics. With 2001's PlayOnline service, the company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} a new Away Mode power management feature {{that allows a}} machine to conserve power while performing background tasks such as recording or streaming media or files across devices and systems; this functionality essentially allows a <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> operate {{in a manner similar}} to a consumer electronics device. When enabled, Away Mode turns off a PC's display, mutes its audio, and filters access to input devices while allowing it to remain otherwise operational for background tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Wang PC {{was released}} April 1982 {{to counter the}} IBM PC which had been released the previous August and which had gained wide acceptance {{in the market for}} which Wang traditionally positioned the OIS system. It was based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor, a slightly faster CPU than the IBM PC's 8088. A hardware/software package that permitted the Wang <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> act as a terminal to the OIS and VS products was available. The hardware component, the first version was made of two large add-in boards called the WLOC (Wang Local Office Connection), contained a Z-80 processor and 64KB of memory.|$|E
25|$|Arcades {{catering}} to video games began {{to gain momentum}} in the late 1970s with games such as Space Invaders (1978), Asteroids (1979), and Galaxian (1979), and became widespread in 1980 with Pac-Man, Missile Command, Berzerk, Defender, and others. The central processing unit in these games allowed for more complexity than earlier discrete circuitry games such as Atari's Pong (1972). The arcade boom {{that began in the}} late 1970s is credited with establishing the basic techniques of interactive entertainment and for driving down hardware prices to the extent of allowing the <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> become a technological and economic reality.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Amstrad was {{licensed}} by Sega {{to produce a}} system which {{was similar to the}} Sega TeraDrive, going by the name of the Amstrad Mega <b>PC,</b> <b>to</b> try to regain their image in the gaming market. The system didn't succeed as well as expected, mostly due to its high initial retail price of £599. In that same year, Amstrad released the PenPad, a PDA similar to the Apple Newton, and released only weeks before it. It was a commercial failure, and had several technical and usability problems. It lacked most features that the Apple Newton included, but had a lower price at $450.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Dell did not {{emphasize}} the consumer market, {{due to the}} higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.|$|E
25|$|Windows HotStart (formerly Windows Direct {{and also}} known as Direct Media Mode) enables a user to {{immediately}} launch an application after startup or resume by the press of a button or by wireless receiver events; {{it is designed to}} provide the instant on feature availability that is traditionally associated with mobile devices such as cell phones and portable media players. HotStart enables what Microsoft has referred to as appliance-like availability, allowing a <b>PC</b> <b>to</b> take on a number of roles based on the type of application launched—a PC that boots into a multimedia application, for example, can essentially function as a dedicated media device. Original equipment manufacturers can customize HotStart hardware implementation and functionality. Users may also customize application launch functionality through the Windows Registry; instead of launching a multimedia application, a user can, for example, configure a HotStart button or other form of input to instantly launch an e-mail application.|$|E
