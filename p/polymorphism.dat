5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique restriction fragment length <b>polymorphism</b> to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The results suggest that based on the restriction fragment length <b>polymorphism</b> patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) {{that are similar to}} the common A.gallica.|$|E
5|$|Melanistic jaguars are informally {{known as}} black panthers, but (as with {{all forms of}} <b>polymorphism)</b> they do not form a {{separate}} species.|$|E
5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma <b>polymorphism,</b> protein <b>polymorphism,</b> and histocompatibility systems.|$|E

5|$|A 1997 {{study found}} lower protein <b>polymorphism</b> in Antilope in {{comparison}} with Antidorcas, Eudorcas and Gazella. This was attributed to a history of rapid evolution of an autapomorphic phenotype of Antilope. This might have been aided by a particularly strong selection of a few dominant males due to its lekking behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Gryllus firmus {{exhibits}} wing polymorphism; {{some individuals}} have fully functional, long hind wings {{and others have}} short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and produce more eggs, so the <b>polymorphism</b> adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.|$|E
5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, <b>polymorphism,</b> paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. <b>Polymorphism</b> is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.|$|E

5|$|<b>Polymorphism</b> in Lepidoptera is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} and the P. rebeli caterpillar is no exception as it displays <b>polymorphism</b> in its larval form. The P. rebeli caterpillars have two strategies for living and growing underground: to exist as fast-developing larvae (FDL) or slow-developing larvae (SDL). After the ant brood adopts the FDL, which comprise approximately 25% of the total P. rebeli larvae, the FDL complete growth the following spring and eclose (emerge as an adult from the pupa) in early summer to complete their life cycle. The SDL, which comprise 75% of P. rebeli larvae, do not grow much during the first year, but grow rapidly during {{the early part of}} the second summer and remain a second winter within the ant colonies. While both larva types ultimately form similar-sized pupae, their polymorphic growth rates could indicate alternative fitness strategies and different ways to exploit the M. schencki food resources.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polymorphism</b> {{refers to}} the {{occurrence}} of structurally and functionally more than {{two different types of}} individuals within the same organism. It is a characteristic feature of Cnidarians, particularly the polyp and medusa forms, or of zooids within colonial organisms like those in Hydrozoa. In Hydrozoans, colonial individuals arising from individuals zooids will take on separate tasks.|$|E

25|$|<b>Polymorphism</b> {{has a lot}} to do {{with the}} {{adaptation}} of a species to its environment, which may vary in colour, food supply, and predation and in many other ways. <b>Polymorphism</b> is one good way the opportunities get to be used; it has survival value, and the selection of modifier genes may reinforce the <b>polymorphism.</b> In addition, <b>polymorphism</b> seems to be associated with a higher rate of speciation (Hugall & Stuart-Fox 2012).|$|E
25|$|The term <b>polymorphism</b> {{refers to}} the ability of code (especially, {{functions}} or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or {{to the ability of}} different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow <b>polymorphism</b> generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with <b>polymorphism,</b> programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an associative array once, rather than once for each type of element with which they plan to use it. For this reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of <b>polymorphism</b> generic programming. The type-theoretic foundations of <b>polymorphism</b> are closely related to those of abstraction, modularity and (in some cases) subtyping.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} main factor, genetic <b>polymorphism,</b> it is theorized that Euglossini bees have not {{reached a point}} where the {{threshold}} of genetic homogeneity permitting colony fitness has crossed the expected individual fitness. Therefore, euglossine genetic <b>polymorphism</b> levels appear to be higher than those of ordinary solitary bees, and much higher than social bees, since low <b>polymorphism</b> levels is seen as a foundation for advanced social evolution.|$|E

40|$|Transposons and transposon-like {{repetitive}} elements collectively occupy 44 % {{of the human}} genome sequence. In an effort to measure the levels of genetic variation that are caused by human transposons, we have developed a new method to broadly detect transposon insertion <b>polymorphisms</b> of all kinds in humans. We began by identifying 606, 093 insertion and deletion (indel) <b>polymorphisms</b> in the genomes of diverse humans. We then screened these <b>polymorphisms</b> to detect indels that were caused by de novo transposon insertions. Our method was highly efficient and led to the identification of 605 nonredundant transposon insertion <b>polymorphisms</b> in 36 diverse humans. We estimate that this represents 25 – 35 % of ∼ 2075 common transposon <b>polymorphisms</b> in human populations. Because we identified all transposon insertion <b>polymorphisms</b> with a single method, we could evaluate the relative levels of variation that were caused by each transposon class. The average human in our study was estimated to harbor 1283 Alu insertion <b>polymorphisms,</b> 180 L 1 <b>polymorphisms,</b> 56 SVA <b>polymorphisms,</b> and 17 <b>polymorphisms</b> related to other forms of mobilized DNA. Overall, our study provides significant steps toward (i) measuring the genetic variation that is caused by transposon insertions in humans and (ii) identifying the transposon copies that produce this variation...|$|R
25|$|C++ {{supports}} {{several kinds}} of static (resolved at compile-time) and dynamic (resolved at run-time) polymorphisms, supported by the language features described above.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{identify}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) <b>polymorphisms</b> and rare variants that associate with elite Japanese athletic status. Subjects comprised 185 elite Japanese athletes who had represented Japan at international competitions (that is, 100 endurance/middle-power athletes: EMA; 85 sprint/power athletes: SPA) and 672 Japanese controls (CON). The entire mtDNA sequences (16 [*] 569 [*]bp) were analyzed by direct sequencing. Nucleotide variants were detected at 1488 sites in the 857 entire mtDNA sequences. A total of 311 variants were <b>polymorphisms</b> (minor allele frequency 1 % in CON), and the frequencies of these <b>polymorphisms</b> were compared among the three groups. The EMA displayed excess of seven <b>polymorphisms,</b> including subhaplogroup D 4 e 2 - and D 4 g-specific <b>polymorphisms,</b> compared with CON (P&# 60; 0. 05), whereas SPA displayed excess of three <b>polymorphisms</b> and dearth of nine <b>polymorphisms,</b> including haplogroup G- and subhaplogroup G 2 a-specific <b>polymorphisms,</b> compared with CON (P&# 60; 0. 05). The frequencies of 10 <b>polymorphisms,</b> including haplogroup G- and subhaplogroup G 2 a-specific <b>polymorphisms,</b> were different between EMA and SPA (P&# 60; 0. 05) : although none of these <b>polymorphisms</b> differed significantly between groups after correcting for multiple comparison (false discovery rate q-value 0. 05). The number of rare variants in the 12 S ribosomal RNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit I genes were also higher in SPA than in CON (P&# 60; 0. 05).
