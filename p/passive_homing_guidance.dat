It was created in order to replace its stock of American-made Stinger MANPADS, since the Type 91 has a better guidance system, which consist of both light and infrared system options.

50|$|In March 1970, {{additional}} tests begun at different places, including Lushun, Zhoushan, and Qinghai, and lasted 18 months, over 500 times and using 104 samples. The 18-month-long trial tested {{a total of}} 28 designs and finally solved all of the existing problems. However, the Chinese microelectronics industry was not capable to produce the <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> according to the original plan, but due to the urgent need, the original plan changed one last time with unguided version was pressed into service as Yu (鱼) -1 (in September 1971), while the <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> guided version was named Yu-1 Jia (鱼-1甲), sometimes also known as Yu-1G, which would take years to complete.|$|R
50|$|The {{progress}} {{made in the}} development of the Yu-3 torpedo had encouraged the Chinese to resume the development of the Yu-4 torpedo after several years of dormancy which begun in the early 1960s. At the end of 1971, 5 samples were produced based on the experience gained {{in the development of}} the Yu-3 torpedo. However, the speed was low and other results were not satisfactory either. The Chinese researchers decided to take a prudent approach by developing two different versions, one with <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> and the other with combined passive / active acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance.</b> The one with <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> begun its development in the mid-1960s and was named as Yu-4 Jia (鱼-4甲), or sometimes as Yu-4A, while the combined active / <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> version begun its development in the late-1960s and named as Yu-4 Yi (鱼-4乙) or sometimes as Yu-4B. Yu-4A was designed by the East Wind Instrumentation Factory (东风仪表厂) in Xi'an, while Y-4B was designed jointly by Northwestern Polytechnical University (primary contractor) and Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) in Houma, Shanxi. Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) was tasked with manufacturing both Yu-4A and Y-4B.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of Yu-5 torpedo begun {{around the same}} time of Yu-4 torpedo in the early 1970s, but due to the backward of the Chinese technological and industrial base, the initial tests of wire guidance was carried out by using steel wire instead of copper wire, just like when it was done {{more than a decade ago}} in the late 1950s. The propulsion {{development of}} Yu-5 torpedo benefited greatly from the US Mark 46 torpedo recovered by the Chinese fishermen for the Otto fuel II research and then some technological supports for license production of Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo in China of the 1985 deal signed between two countries. Other unconfirmed reports have claimed that during the development of Yu-5 torpedo, advanced American and Japanese commercial off-the-shelf technologies at the time were used, and incorporating these advanced commercial technologies was part of the reason of the prolonged development, which lasted almost two decades. In fact, Yu-5 torpedo program started {{around the same time}} with Yu-4 torpedo program but the latter was completed earlier. Another reason for the prolonged development was the Yu-5 was used as a test vehicle for newer technologies for later torpedoes such as the Yu-6 torpedo, for example, optical fiber wire guidance had been tested on Yu-5 torpedo since 1986 (However, although the tests were considered somewhat satisfactory, it was not adopted for Yu-5 torpedo, which used the traditional copper wire). The Yu-5 torpedo was finally accepted into the service in 1989 and the series production begun the next year in 1990. [...] The torpedo is initially guided by wire guidance for most of the time, and at the final stage, the guidance is changed to active / <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> guidance,and the active / <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> would also automatically activates when the wire is accidentally severed before the final stage. Yu-5 is the first domestic Chinese ASW torpedo for conventionally powered submarines.|$|R

40|$|This brief {{introduces}} a new design methodology for impact angle control guidance (IACG) laws. The proposed methodology can extend any proven <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> laws to their impact angle control versions if the {{expressions of the}} estimated terminal flight path angles under those guidance laws are given. The time derivatives of the estimated terminal flight path angles are obtained as functions of the guidance commands. The IACG versions of the <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> laws are derived from those functions and the desired error dynamics of the estimated terminal flight path angle. The guidance law of each IACG version has two terms: the first term maintains the characteristics and capturability of the original guidance law and the second term drives the estimated terminal flight path angle to converge to the specified flight path angle. When a well-understood <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> law for a certain combination of target and missile models is given, an IACG law for that combination is easily derived without reformulating the guidance problem again. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by several examples, deriving new IACG laws for various target and missile models...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2012, Raytheon {{was ordered}} to {{continue}} developing the Sidewinder into a Block III variant, even though the Block II had not yet entered service. The USN projected that the new missile would have a 60 percent longer range, modern components to replace old ones, and an insensitive munitions warhead, which is more stable {{and less likely to}} detonate by accident, making it safer for ground crews. The need for the AIM-9 to have an increased range was from digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jammers that can blind the onboard radar of an AIM-120D AMRAAM, so the Sidewinder Block III's <b>passive</b> imaging infrared <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> system was a useful alternative. Although it could supplement the AMRAAM for beyond visual range (BVR) engagements, it would still be capable at performing within visual range (WVR). Modifying the AIM-9X was seen as a cost-effective alternative to developing a new missile in a time of declining budgets. To achieve the range increase, the rocket motor would have a combination of increased performance and missile power management. The Block III would [...] "leverage" [...] the Block II's guidance unit and electronics, including the AMRAAM-derived datalink. The Block III was scheduled to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) in 2022, following the increased number of F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters to enter service. The Navy pressed for this upgrade in response to a projected threat which analysts have speculated will be due to the difficulty of targeting upcoming Chinese Fifth-generation jet fighters (Chengdu J-20, Shenyang J-31) with the radar guided AMRAAM, specifically that Chinese advances in electronics will mean Chinese fighters will use their AESA radars as jammers to degrade the AIM-120's kill probability. However, the Navy's FY 2016 budget cancelled the AIM-9X Block III as they cut down buys of the F-35C, as it was primarily intended to permit the fighter to carry six BVR missiles; the insensitive munition warhead will be retained for the AIM-9X program.|$|R

Characteristics of good initial estimates are given, and an exploration method is presented that provides good initial estimates and leads to improved response.
