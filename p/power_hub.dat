40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of smart grid technology acts as new brain {{to the power}} generation and distribution network. Through this technology, the network is not {{only going to get}} integrated and turn communicable all over the country but also the demand will be monitored by the control centers and at peak time the usage of electricity is going to cost higher than the nominal rate with intimation given to the customer through sms and mail. Hence it's time for the consumers to act smart or else they will end up receiving highly billed statements. This project presents an idea of having a <b>power</b> <b>hub</b> which has control over all the loads individually. The hub detects the peak time demand and reduces the load usage by switching off unwanted loads with a priority that is being set by the consumer based on game theory's algorithm which schedules load usage by creating several possible schedule vector for consumers such that demand is never raised. This could be done both individually and among multiple users of a community or area. The <b>power</b> <b>hub</b> can also monitor our energy usage and creates an order of importance among the loads, thus providing intelligence to the consumers...|$|E

40|$|Low <b>power</b> <b>hub</b> motors {{are widely}} used in {{electromechanical}} systems such as electrical bicycles and solar vehicles due to their robustness and compact structure. Such systems driven by hub motors (in wheel motors) encounter previously defined and undefined faults under operation. It may inevitably lead to the interruption of the electromechanical system operation; hence, economic losses take place at certain times. Therefore, {{in order to maintain}} system operation sustainability, the motor should be precisely monitored and the faults are diagnosed considering various significant motor parameters. In this study, the artificial feedforward backpropagation neural network approach is proposed to real-time monitor and diagnose the faults of the hub motor by measuring seven main system parameters. So as to construct a necessary model, we trained the model, using a data set consisting of 4160 samples where each has 7 parameters, by the MATLAB environment until the best model is obtained. The results are encouraging and meaningful for the specific motor and the developed model may be applicable to other types of hub motors. The prosperous model of the whole system was embedded into Arduino Due microcontroller card and the mobile real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis system prototype for hub motor was designed and manufactured...|$|E
