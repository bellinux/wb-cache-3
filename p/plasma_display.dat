25|$|A glass solder is used, e.g., {{for joining}} {{together}} parts of cathode ray tubes and <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> panels. Newer compositions lowered the usage temperature from 450 to 390°C {{by reducing the}} lead(II) oxide content down from 70%, increasing the zinc oxide content, adding titanium dioxide and bismuth(III) oxide and some other components. The high thermal expansion of such glass can be reduced by a suitable ceramic filler. Lead-free solder glasses with soldering temperature of 450°C were also developed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>Displays</b> by Conrac are {{installed}} in stations along the North South Line & East West Line. 2 <b>plasma</b> <b>displays</b> {{are installed}} {{at a single}} location per platform. The reason for the installation of only 2 <b>plasma</b> <b>displays</b> at a single location per platform was because these displays had been retrofitted into the platforms when they replaced the aging flip dot displays which were only sited at 1 location per platform. Thus, the existing infrastructure available could only support <b>plasma</b> <b>displays</b> at 1 location per platform.|$|R

25|$|Although a {{mainstay}} of display technology for decades, CRT-based computer monitors and televisions constitute a dead technology. The demand for CRT screens has dropped precipitously since 2007, and this falloff had accelerated {{in the last two}} years of that decade. The rapid advances and falling prices of LCD flat panel technology, first for computer monitors and then for televisions, has been the key factor in the demise of competing display technologies such as CRT, rear-projection, and <b>plasma</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> {{panel is}} a {{flat panel display}} common to large TV displays. Many tiny cells between two panels of glass hold an inert mixture of noble gases. The gas in the cells is {{electrically}} turned into a plasma which then excites phosphors to emit light. The monochrome plasma video display was co-invented in July 1964 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by Donald Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and graduate student Robert Willson for the PLATO Computer System.|$|E
25|$|One common {{application}} of the RGB color model is the display of colors on a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), <b>plasma</b> <b>display,</b> or {{organic light emitting diode}} (OLED) display such as a television, a computer’s monitor, or a large scale screen. Each pixel on the screen is built by driving three small and very close but still separated RGB light sources. At common viewing distance, the separate sources are indistinguishable, which tricks the eye to see a given solid color. All the pixels together arranged in the rectangular screen surface conforms the color image.|$|E

25|$|Indium's uses can {{be divided}} into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the {{production}} is used for coatings, usually combined as indium tin oxide (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium tin oxide has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.|$|E

Its second floor includes a coffee bar serving lattes, gelato and biscotti and lounges that pay homage via museum display, music, and decor to every decade the chain has been in business. The 2nd floor McCafe is designed to compete with Starbucks by serving cappuccino, espresso, gelato and Italian pastries. The building features a pair of 60foot arches and two stories worth of windows that weigh 800pounds apiece. [...] It has 10 cash register stations to complement its 300 patron capacity, which is about 3 times the normal McDonald's capacity. The restaurant has three front walls of glass.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1975 at the Hannover Fair, Olivetti {{presented}} the P6060, the world's first complete, pre-assembled personal computer system.

It had one or two 8" [...] floppy disk drives, a 32-character <b>plasma</b> <b>display,</b> 80-column graphical thermal printer, 48 Kbytes of RAM, and BASIC language.

50|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>Displays</b> by Advanced System Asia (ADV) are {{installed}} at the concourse levels of stations along the North East Line, Circle Line and Downtown Line. These were {{the first generation of}} <b>plasma</b> <b>displays</b> installed in these stations. However, the normal Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for <b>plasma</b> <b>displays</b> is about 35,000 hours or about 4 years. Because these displays were tested and commissioned for use more than 5 years ago, burnt marks had appeared, brought about by a sharp contrast of the display of a certain combination of colours {{over a long period of}} time. As such, the Land Transport Authority had to replace these displays, though only at the platform level.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{the late}} 2000s, CRTs {{have been largely}} {{superseded}} by newer [...] "flat panel" [...] display technologies such as LCD, <b>plasma</b> <b>display,</b> and OLED displays, which {{in the case of}} LCD and OLED displays have lower manufacturing costs and power consumption, as well as significantly less weight and bulk. Flat panel displays can also be made in very large sizes; whereas 38" [...] to 40" [...] was about the largest size of a CRT television, flat panels are available in 60" [...] and larger sizes. However, since 2015 there has been a significant comeback for old crt sets (similar to the vinyl comeback) with sales of refurbished and used sets steadily increasing {{over the past couple of}} years. One cause of the small comeback is mostly due to the gaming market with gamers preferring crts due to their response time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{small size}} of the {{negative}} glow region of a neon lamp, and the flexible electronic properties that were exploited in electronic circuits, led {{to the adoption of}} this technology for the earliest plasma panel displays. The first monochrome dot matrix plasma panel displays were developed in 1964 at the University of Illinois for the PLATO educational computing system. They had the characteristic color of the neon lamp; their inventors, Donald L. Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and Robert H. Wilson, had achieved a working computer display that remembered its own state, and did not require constant refreshing from the central computer system. The relationship between these early monochrome displays and contemporary, color plasma displays and televisions was described by Larry F. Weber in 2006, [...] "All plasma TVs on the market today have the same features that were demonstrated in the first <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> which was a device with only a single cell. These features include alternating sustain voltage, dielectric layer, wall charge, and a neon-based gas mixture." [...] As in colored neon lamps, plasma displays use a gas mixture that emits ultraviolet light. Each pixel has a phosphor that emits one of the display's base colors.|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, some {{experimentation}} with LCD televisions {{took place during}} this period. In 1988, Sharp Corporation introduced the first commercial LCD television, a 14" [...] model with active matrix addressing using thin-film transistors (TFT). These were offered primarily as boutique items for discerning customers, and were not aimed at the general market. At the same time, <b>plasma</b> <b>displays</b> could easily offer the performance {{needed to make a}} high quality display, but suffered from low brightness and very high power consumption. However, a series of advances led to <b>plasma</b> <b>displays</b> outpacing LCDs in performance improvements, starting with Fujitsu's improved construction techniques in 1979, Hitachi's improved phosphors in 1984, and AT&T's elimination of the black areas between the sub-pixels in the mid-1980s.
