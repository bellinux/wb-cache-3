5|$|Cervical cancer {{nearly always}} {{involves}} human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for cervical cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E
5|$|Human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. Genital warts and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E

CpG dinucleotide depletion has not been extensively studied among <b>papillomaviruses</b> and polyomaviruses. We sought to analyze the relative abundance of dinucleotides and the relative roles of evolutionary pressures in <b>papillomaviruses</b> and polyomaviruses.

We analyzed the relative abundance of dinucleotides, effective codon number (ENC), differences in synonymous codon usage. We examined the association, if any, between the extent of CpG dinucleotide depletion and the evolutionary lineage of the infected host.

All <b>papillomaviruses</b> and polyomaviruses are CpG depleted. Interestingly, the evolutionary lineage of the infected host determines the extent of CpG depletion among <b>papillomaviruses</b> and polyomaviruses. CpG dinucleotide depletion was more pronounced among <b>papillomaviruses</b> and polyomaviruses infecting human and other mammals as compared to those infecting birds. Our findings demonstrate that CpG depletion among <b>papillomaviruses</b> is linked to mutational pressure; while CpG depletion among polyomaviruses is linked to translational selection. We also present evidence that suggests methylation of CpG dinucleotides may explain, at least in part, the depletion of CpG dinucleotides among <b>papillomaviruses</b> but not polyomaviruses. The extent of CpG depletion among <b>papillomaviruses</b> and polyomaviruses is linked to the evolutionary lineage of the infected host. Our results highlight the existence of divergent evolutionary pressures leading to CpG dinucleotide depletion among small ds-DNA viruses infecting vertebrate hosts...|$|R

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
50|$|Most {{homologous}} <b>papillomaviruses</b> {{are actually}} CRPV and HPV1a. This is possibly because {{both of these}} viruses target the skin. From an evolutionary perspective, CRPV and HPV1a could have diverged recently, or they could have converged due to their similar target. CRPV {{is a member of}} the <b>papillomaviruses</b> so it is related to all viruses in this family.|$|R

5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human <b>papillomavirus,</b> which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Four papillomaviruses {{are known}} to infect birds: Fringilla coelebs <b>papillomavirus</b> 1, Francolinus leucoscepus <b>papillomavirus</b> 1, Psittacus erithacus <b>papillomavirus</b> 1 and Pygoscelis adeliae <b>papillomavirus</b> 1. All these species have a gene (E9) of unknown {{function}} suggesting a common origin.|$|E
50|$|The polyoma and <b>papillomaviruses</b> {{appear to}} have evolved from {{single-stranded}} DNA viruses and ultimately from plasmids.|$|R
25|$|New {{infectious}} progeny virus are {{assembled in}} the cell nucleus. <b>Papillomaviruses</b> have evolved a mechanism for releasing virions into the environment. Other kinds of non-enveloped animal viruses utilize an active lytic process to kill the host cell, allowing release of progeny virus particles. Often this lytic process is associated with inflammation, which might trigger immune attack against the virus. <b>Papillomaviruses</b> exploit desquamation as a stealthy, non-inflammatory release mechanism.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the last}} decades, {{a group of}} viruses has {{received}} great attention due to its relationship with cancer development and its wide distribution throughout the vertebrates: the <b>papillomaviruses.</b> In this article, we aim to review {{some of the most}} relevant reports concerning the use of bovines as an experimental model for studies related to <b>papillomaviruses.</b> Moreover, the obtained data contributes to the development of strategies against the clinical consequences of bovine <b>papillomaviruses</b> (BPV) that have led to drastic hazards to the herds. To overcome the problem, the vaccines that we have been developing involve recombinant DNA technology, aiming at prophylactic and therapeutic procedures. It is {{important to point out that}} these strategies can be used as models for innovative procedures against HPV, as this virus is the main causal agent of cervical cancer, the second most fatal cancer in women...|$|R
25|$|Individual <b>papillomavirus</b> types tend to {{be highly}} adapted to {{replication}} in a single animal species. In one study, researchers swabbed the forehead skin {{of a variety of}} zoo animals and used PCR to amplify any <b>papillomavirus</b> DNA that might be present. Although a wide variety of <b>papillomavirus</b> sequences were identified in the study, the authors found little evidence for inter-species transmission. Interestingly, one zookeeper was found to be transiently positive for a chimpanzee-specific <b>papillomavirus</b> sequence. However, the authors note that the chimpanzee-specific <b>papillomavirus</b> sequence could have been the result of surface contamination of the zookeeper's skin, as opposed to productive infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the <b>papillomavirus</b> life cycle {{strictly}} requires keratinocyte differentiation has posed a substantial barrier {{to the study of}} papillomaviruses in the laboratory, since it has precluded the use of conventional cell lines to grow the viruses. Because infectious BPV-1 virions can be extracted from the large warts the virus induces on cattle, it has been a workhorse model <b>papillomavirus</b> type for many years. CRPV, rabbit oral <b>papillomavirus</b> (ROPV) and canine oral <b>papillomavirus</b> (COPV) have also been used extensively for laboratory studies.|$|E
25|$|Only a few <b>papillomavirus</b> types encode a short protein {{from the}} E8 gene. In {{the case of}} BPV-4 (<b>papillomavirus</b> genus Xi), the E8 open reading frame may {{substitute}} for the E6 open reading frame, which is absent in this <b>papillomavirus</b> genus. These E8 genes are chemically and functionally similar to the E5 genes from some human papillomaviruses, and are also called E5/E8.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHead {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell cancers {{are among the}} most aggressive. Their incidence and mortality rates are relatively lower in Middle Africa than worldwide, but in Gabon, these rates tend to be 2 – 3 fold higher than in neighboring countries. The main risk factors are alcohol and tobacco consumption. However, in the last decades, there was cumulated evidence that human <b>papillomaviruses</b> were a significant risk factor, particularly for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. In Gabon, as elsewhere in Africa, assessment of these 3 risk factors need to be improved to determine their respective {{role in the development of}} head and neck squamous cell cancers. The potential differences in alcohol/tobacco consumption habits as well as in infectious ecology between developing and developed countries can make it difficult to transpose current data on this issue. Determining the respective role of alcohol/tobacco consumption and human <b>papillomaviruses</b> in the development of head and neck squamous cell cancers is crucial for the management of these cancers that could become a serious public health issue in Gabon. Human <b>papillomaviruses</b> are not only a risk factor but also a biomarker with promising clinical potential for the follow-up of head and neck squamous cell cancers potentially able to select an adequate treatment. Then, assessing the epidemiological impact of human <b>papillomaviruses</b> in Gabon and in all of Africa would prove useful for the clinical follow-up of head and neck squamous cell cancers, and would also provide essential data to plan a global prevention strategy against head and neck squamous cell cancers due to human <b>papillomaviruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Papillomaviruses</b> are {{an ideal}} model {{system for the}} study of DNA virus evolution. On several levels, phylogenetic trees of <b>papillomaviruses</b> reflect the {{relationship}} of their hosts. <b>Papillomaviruses</b> isolated from remotely related vertebrates form major branches. One branch of human <b>papillomaviruses</b> (HPVs) includes an ape and two monkey <b>papillomaviruses,</b> possibly because the diversification of the viruses predated the separation of the infected-primate taxa. This hypothesis predicts th{{at the root of the}} evolution of some if not all HPV types should point to Africa, since humans evolved from nonhuman primates in this continent. We tested this hypothesis and compared the genomic sequences of HPV type 18 (HPV- 18) isolates from four continents. Diversity within HPV- 18 correlates with patterns of the evolution and spread of Homo sapiens: HPV- 18 variants, just like HPV- 16 variants, are specific for the major human races, with maximal diversity in Africa. Outgroup rooting of the HPV- 18 tree against HPV- 45, which is closely related to HPV- 18, identifies African HPV- 18 variants at the root of the tree. The identification of an African HPV- 45 isolate further reduces the evolutionary distance between HPV- 18 and HPV- 45. HPV- 18 variants from Amazonian Indians are the closest relatives to those from Japanese and Chinese patients and suggest that a single point mutation in the phylogenetically evaluated genomic segment represents at least 12, 000 years of evolution. We estimate that diversity within HPV- 18 and probably within other HPV types evolved over a period of more than 200, 000 years and that diversity between HPV types evolved over several million years...|$|R
40|$|<b>Papillomaviruses</b> can infect epithelia and induce proliferative disorders. Different {{types of}} canine <b>papillomaviruses</b> {{have been found}} to be {{associated}} with distinct pathologies including exophytic warts as in canine oral papillomatosis, endophytic warts, and pigmented plaques and, in some cases, squamous cell carcinomas. Virus infection is followed by a phase of subclinical infection before the onset of symptoms. A diagnosis can in some cases be made clinically but should be verified if there are any doubts. Most papillomas do regress spontaneously within a few months. Preventative vaccination is possible but not on the market...|$|R
25|$|L1 spontaneously self-assembles into pentameric capsomers. Purified capsomers {{can go on}} to form capsids, {{which are}} {{stabilized}} by disulfide bonds between neighboring L1 molecules. L1 capsids assembled in vitro are the basis of prophylactic vaccines against several HPV types. Compared to other <b>papillomavirus</b> genes, the amino acid sequences of most portions of L1 are well-conserved between types. However, the surface loops of L1 can differ substantially, even for different members of a particular <b>papillomavirus</b> species. This probably reflects a mechanism for evasion of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by previous <b>papillomavirus</b> infections.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{are usually}} {{considered}} as highly host- and tissue-tropic, and {{are thought to}} rarely be transmitted between species. Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the basal layer of the body surface tissues. All known <b>papillomavirus</b> types infect a particular body surface, typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals, anus, mouth, or airways. For example, human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet, and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands, where they may cause warts. Additionally, there are descriptions {{of the presence of}} <b>papillomavirus</b> DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{species have}} also been described. Sparus aurata <b>papillomavirus</b> 1 has been {{isolated}} from fish.|$|E
40|$|<b>Papillomaviruses</b> {{have evolved}} a life cycle that is {{perfectly}} coordinated with the differentiation {{process of the}} host epidermal tissue.

Differentiation proceeds in a systematic process to generate the stratum spinosum, granulosum, {{and in some cases}} corneum to provide the epidermis with strength as well as a barrier against water loss and pathogen invasion (see Figure 1). <b>Papillomaviruses</b> capitalize on this proces...|$|R
40|$|<b>Papillomaviruses</b> {{appear to}} be species-specific pathogens, and it was {{suggested}} that each animal species might harbour its own set of <b>papillomaviruses.</b> However, all approaches addressing the underlying evolutionary phenomena still suffer from very limited data about animal <b>papillomaviruses.</b> In case of the horse for example, only three equine <b>papillomaviruses</b> (EcPVs) have been identified. To further address the situation in this host, suspected papillomavirus-associated lesions were tested for EcPV DNA. Four novel EcPV types were detected and their genomes entirely cloned and sequenced. They display the characteristic organization, with early (E) and late (L) regions harbouring the seven classical open reading frames divided by non-coding regions. They were named EcPVs 4, 5, 6 and 7, according to their dissimilarity to other <b>papillomaviruses.</b> Most L 1 nucleotide identities were shared with EcPV 2 in case of EcPV 4 (62 %) and EcPV 5 (60 %) or with EcPV 3 in case of EcPV 6 (70 %) and EcPV 7 (71 %). Thus, EcPVs 4 and 5 may establish novel species within the genus Dyoiota, while EcPVs 6 and 7 might fit into the genus Dyorho and belong to the same species as EcPV 3. They were found in genital plaques (EcPV 4), aural plaques (EcPV 5, EcPV 6) or penile masses (EcPV 7). Interestingly, PCR analysis revealed the DNA of EcPV 2 and EcPV 4 as well as of EcPV 3 and EcPV 6 together in the same tissue samples, respectively. In conclusion, the DNA of four novel EcPV types was identified and cloned. They cluster with the known types and support broad genetic EcPV diversity in {{at least two of the}} known clades. Furthermore, PCR assays also provide evidence for EcPV co-infections in horses...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{specific}} data about the productive cycle of <b>papillomaviruses.</b> Research is not conclusive about which coding regions are expressed before or after replication of viral DNA. The E1 region should carried the DNA required for cis and/or trans. E1 is the largest Open reading frame, which is the set of codons in the genome that code for proteins, encoding a 602 base protein. E1 is similar to COOH-terminal domain of the Simian virus 40, plays a role in viral DNA replication maintaining plasmids within a cell. Results have found that CRPV and BPV1 are found in the same location of the genome, which is indicates that <b>papillomaviruses</b> likely have similar methods of replicating their genomes outside of a chromosome. Notable difference between the genomes of the four strains is that the E6 protein is almost twice as long in the CRPV as in any of the other strains of <b>papillomaviruses.</b> The E6 protein is somewhat homologous with a family of ATP synthases that are found in mitochondria of cattle. The homology is significant enough to imply an evolutionary relationship between E6 and the beta chain of the ATP synthase family, however {{they do not have the}} same function or enzyme activity. The E2 protein overlaps with the E4 open reading frames in the other <b>papillomaviruses.</b> These differences in the E2 proteins likely determine how oncogenic a virus is. The noncoding region has a homologies with BPV1. Other homologies exist, such as the fact that all <b>papillomaviruses</b> have repeated sequences in the noncoding parts of their genomes. CRPV has some notable repeats, some as long as 32 base pairs. Many pairs up stream of the transcription locations are homologous with promoter sequences in of SV40.|$|R

25|$|Human <b>papillomavirus</b> {{infection}} is an infection by human <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV). Most HPV infections cause no symptoms and resolve spontaneously. In some people, an HPV infection persists {{and results in}} warts or precancerous lesions. The precancerous lesions {{increase the risk of}} cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, or throat. Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV with two types, HPV16 and HPV18, accounting for 70% of cases. Between 60% and 90% of the other cancers are also linked to HPV. HPV6 and HPV11 are common causes of genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Papillomaviruses</b> (PVs) {{establish}} a persistent {{infection in the}} proliferating basal cells of the epithelium. The viral genome is replicated and maintained as a low-copy nuclear plasmid in basal keratinocytes. Bovine and human <b>papillomaviruses</b> (BPV and HPV) are known to utilize two viral proteins; E 1, a DNA helicase, and E 2, a transcription factor, which have been considered essential for viral DNA replication. However, growing evidence suggests that E 1 and E 2 are not entirely essential for stable replication of HPV. Results: Here we report that multiple HPV 16 mutants, lacking either or both E 1 and E 2 open reading frame (ORFs) and the long control region (LCR), still support extrachromosomal replication. Our data clearly indicate that HPV 16 has a mode of replication, independent of viral trans-factors, E 1 and E 2, {{which is achieved by}} origin activity located outside of the LCR.
