50|$|Aircraft {{designers}} employed mostly <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> designs {{with simple}} dihedral after World War II, {{prior to the}} introduction of winglets. With the wide acceptance of winglets in new sailplane designs of the 1990s, designers sought to further optimize the aerodynamic performance of their wingtip designs. Glider winglets were originally retrofitted directly to planar wings, with only a small, nearly right-angle, transition area. Once the performance of the winglet itself was optimized, attention was turned to the transition between the wing and winglet. A common application was tapering the transition area from the wing tip chord to the winglet chord and raking the transition area back, to place the winglet in the optimal position. If the tapered portion was canted upward, the winglet height could also be reduced. Eventually, designers employed multiple non-planar sections, each canting up at a greater angle, dispensing with the winglets entirely.|$|E

50|$|Most {{aircraft}} {{have been}} designed with <b>planar</b> <b>wings</b> with simple dihedral (or anhedral). Some older aircraft such as the Vought F4U Corsair and the Beriev Be-12 were designed with gull wings bent near the root. Modern polyhedral wing designs generally cant upwards near the wingtips (also known as tip dihedral), increasing dihedral effect without increasing the angle the wings meet at the root, which may be restricted to meet other design criteria.|$|R
40|$|Some of the {{objectives}} of modern aircraft development {{are related to the}} achievement of reduced fuel consumption and aircraft noise. This investigation is mainly concerned with the aerodynamic aspects of aircraft development, i. e., reduction of induced drag. New studies of wing design, and in particular wing tips, are considered. Induced drag is important since, in cruising flight, it accounts for approximately one-third of the entire drag for the aircraft, and one-half while climbing. A survey is presented for the wing geometries and wing tip designs studied, and theoretical investigations of different <b>planar</b> <b>wings</b> with systematically varied wing tip forms are conducted. Attention is also paid to a theoretical study of some <b>planar</b> and nonplanar <b>wings</b> and their comparison with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Lifting {{line and}} Euler {{techniques}} {{have indicated that}} an elliptical planform cambered in the spanwise direction {{appears to have a}} lower induced drag than the uncambered, planar configuration, when both of then have identical arc lengths and the same wetted areas. In other words, a wing geometry with a lower projected span than the <b>planar</b> <b>wing,</b> only because of spanwise cambering, has been found to have a lower induced drag than the corresponding planar case. It was also noted that in the Euler solutions the theoretical minimum induced drag was not achieved on a planar configuration without applying a twist distribution. The increased efficiency of the non-planar configuration is due to induced lift and without accounting for this induced lift, the induced drag is larger then that of the corresponding unfolded <b>planar</b> <b>wing.</b> Induced lift and aerodynamic efficiency of the spanwise cambered configuration was observed to increase with reduced aspect ratio...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the theoretical limit of the induced drag in non-planar wing congurations optimally shaped. The reduction in the induced drag, with the same value of the maximum dimensions and performances required, entails a reduction in the consumption and relative costs: the knowledge of the theoretical limit of the induced drag of a wing system, hence, is crucial for assess if the choise of a non <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> can be economically justied or not. The adoption of a curvilinear wing system, composed by one or more wings, can be justied not only for a reduction in the induced drag, but also for reasons thatconcern the structure, the maneuverability, the aerodynamic, etc. This discussion shows a method with which it is possible to evaluate the extent of the decrease of the induced drag of a curvilinear wing system with respect to a <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> having the same wingspan...|$|E

Polynomial distributions of source and doublet strength lead to simple, closed form {{solutions for the}} aerodynamic influence coefficients, and a nearly triangular matrix yields rapid solutions for the singularity parameters. The source method {{was found to be}} accurate and stable both for analysis and design boundary conditions. Similar results were obtained with the doublet method for analysis boundary conditions on the portion of the wing downstream of the supersonic leading edge, but instabilities in the solution occurred for the region containing a portion of the subsonic leading edge. Research on the method was discontinued before this difficulty was resolved...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} unsteady airloads on a thin, three-dimensional, <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> oscillating with infinitesimal amplitude in a transonic flow is considered. The flow {{is assumed to}} be governed by the transonic small disturbance equation. The unsteady disturbance is taken to be a small perturbation superposed on a given steady mean flowfield. The equations governing the unsteady field, allowing for induced oscillations of any embedded shocks, are obtained. The linearization is shown to fail, locally, at the intersection of a shock with the wing surface, although the failure has little influence on the sectional characteristics of the wing...|$|E

This system of programs is called FAST for Flutter Analysis System, and consists of five programs. Each program performs certain portions of a flutter analysis and can be run sequentially as a job step or individually. FAST uses natural vibration modes as input data and performs a conventional V-g type of solution. The unsteady aerodynamics programs in FAST are based on the subsonic kernel function lifting-surface theory although other aerodynamic programs can be used.

40|$|Summary The {{induced drag}} of non-planar wings is {{compared}} to that of <b>planar</b> <b>wings</b> which result from unfolding the non-planar ones. It is shown that due to the induced lift, there exist non-planar configurations with positive span camber that have an overall aerodynamic performance increase in comparison to the planar ones. The induced lift and increment of aerodynamic performance increases with decreasing aspect ratio. The effect is opposite for configurations with negative camber. Without the induced lift, the positive non-planar configuration would have more induced drag. Analysis is performed using a lifting line method, which takes into account the induced lift, and using Euler solutions. For the inviscid solutions, the induced drag is obtained with a far-field drag analysis method. ...|$|R

40|$|A 'smart' {{wind tunnel}} concept for V/STOL {{transition}} regime studies is presented and performance is projected with numerical simulations. The wind tunnel {{would provide a}} flow that faithfully represents free air flow and thereby permits accurate lift calculations for V/STOL aircraft. The design concept is based on free-air tunnels used for <b>planar</b> <b>wings.</b> Modifications are necessary {{to account for the}} highly deflected, vortical wake produced in low-speed take-off and landing situations. A three-step numerical procedure covering the potential flow of a high lift system in free-air, controlled flow data with a model in a wind tunnel and addition of the wall conditions to the simulation as a feedback loop to correct the closed-tunnel is described. The initial simulation is for three-dimensional full span jet flapped wings, and is derived from extended two-dimensional calculations. The results indicate that only partial control of the tunnel flow is sufficient to serve as a valid environment for V/STOl studies...|$|R
40|$|A self-consistent {{version of}} the {{compressible}} boundary-value problem for configurations with leading-edge vortex separation is formulated, {{based on the assumption}} that the compressible flow field is controlled by the linearized potential equation. The stream surface boundary condition and the zero pressure jump condition of the compressible free vortex flows are analyzed; application of the Goethert rule permits the compressible nonlinear boundary-value problem for the subsonic flow domain to be transformed into an equivalent nonlinear incompressible problem. The compressibility corrections developed are used in numerical calculations of subsonic leading-edge vortex flows about <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> geometries. The sample calculations, employing an inviscid flow model in which the wing and vortex sheets are represented by piecewise continuous quadratic doublet sheet distributions, are applicable to high subsonic Mach numbers...|$|E

40|$|Nonplanar wings {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of reduced drag compared with <b>planar</b> <b>wings</b> of the same span and lift. However, aircraft are not compared {{on the basis of}} drag with fixed span and lift, making the integration and assessment of nonplanar wing concepts complex. This paper deals with some of these issues. A brief review of several concepts from winglets to ring wings is followed by a more detailed look at recent ideas and their application to future transport aircraft. Results suggest that potential efficiency gains may be significant, although non-aerodynamic and off-design characteristics are critical in determining the utility of these concepts for transport aircraft. 2. Introduction [...] Why Nonplanar Wings? The vortex drag of commercial aircraft accounts for a large fraction of airplane cruise drag (typically about 40 %) and therefore concepts that result in reduction of vortex drag may {{have a significant effect on}} fuel consumption, the hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually by airlines on fuel, and its effect on the environment. Vortex drag is eve...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual wing design {{analysis}} methods are combined with numerical optimization to find minimum-drag wings subject to constraints on lift, weight, pitching moment, and stall speed. Tip extensions and winglets designed for minimum drag achieve similar performance, with the optimal solution {{depending on the}} ratio of the maneuver lift coefficient to the cruise lift coefficient. The results highlight the importance of accounting for the depth of the wing structural box in the weight model and including constraints on stall speed. For tailless aircraft, C-wings show a slight performance advantage over wings with winglets when longitudinal trim and stability constraints are considered. This performance advantage is more significant for span-constrained or low-sweep designs. Finally, to demonstrate other possible applications of the method, <b>planar</b> <b>wings</b> with active load alleviation are optimized, showing drag savings on the order of 15 %.

40|$|The iSTAR Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) is {{a unique}} 9 -inch {{diameter}} ducted air vehicle weighing approximately 4 lb. The configuration consists of a ducted fan with control vanes at the duct exit plane.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the drag {{characteristics}} of optimally span-loaded planar, winglet-ted, and C-wings. The span-load is optimized resulting in minimum induced or total drag. The wing-root bending moment is kept constant for all analyzed wings to ascertain dif-ferent wings have comparable weight. The optimum span-loadings for {{the different types of}} wing are calculated using a fast and simple numerical method. The wings are ana-lyzed in the Trefftz-plane, infinitely far behind the wing. Lagrange multipliers are used to calculate the optimum span-loading resulting in minimum induced or total drag, with the wing-root bending moment and/or the lift coefficient as constraint. The induced drag can be calculated using the optimum span-loading. The profile drag is assumed to be a function of the local lift coefficient. The results indicate that the C-wing does not have real aerodynamic performance advantages compared to a wingletted wing. For wings with span and/or aspect ratio constraints a winglet offers a drag reduction relative to a <b>planar</b> <b>wing...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{investigation of}} wings suitable for supersonic fighter application was undertaken {{to understand the}} flow regions developed by these wings through flow visualization and to evaluate areas in which low-speed testing could provide information for extrapolation to higher Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers. This study involved cranked wings of highly-swept inboard panels and outboard panel of various sweeps with leading- and trailing-edge devices. Both theoretical and experimental results with flow visualization are presented. Flow visualization results show that a mixed flow condition (vortex flow on the highly-swept inboard section and attached flow on the cranked outboard section) is possible for wings with low sweep (20 deg) outboard cranked sections. Lift and drag measurements on the planar (no flap deflection) wings show good agreement with theoretical results for leading-edge vortex flow. There {{is little or no}} change in <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> performance at maneuver conditions due to outboard sweep effects. Results also show that for cambered wings (flap deflected) only small improvements in performance over flat wings were obtained at high-lift maneuver conditions...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} lifting surface formulation, including computed {{results for}} <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> cases is presented. This formulation, {{referred to as}} the vortex spline scheme, combines the adaptability to complex shapes offered by paneling schemes with the smoothness and accuracy of loading function methods. The formulation employes a continuous distribution of singularity strength over a set of panels on a paneled wing. The basic distributions are independent, and each satisfied all the continuity conditions required of the final solution. These distributions are overlapped both spanwise and chordwise. Boundary conditions are satisfied in a least square error sense over the surface using a finite summing technique to approximate the integral. The current formulation uses the elementary horseshoe vortex as the basic singularity and is therefore restricted to linearized potential flow. As part of the study, a non planar development was considered, but the numerical evaluation of the lifting surface concept was restricted to planar configurations. Also, a second order sideslip analysis based on an asymptotic expansion was investigated using the singularity spline formulation...|$|E

40|$|A {{boundary}} element formulation {{has been}} developed for the prediction of the sound field scattered by a finite wing in a low Mach number non-uniform flow. The acoustic field is modelled by the convected wave equation for the acoustic velocity potential {{under the assumption that}} the mean flow is irrotational and homentropic everywhere except for a thin wake extending from the trailing edge. Both the mean-flow potential and acoustic velocity potential may be discontinuous across this wake. Continuity of pressure and normal velocity is expressed on the vortex sheet in terms of the velocity potential and its surface derivatives by manipulation of Myers ’ linearized acoustic boundary conditions. The sensitivity of the calculations to the treatment of the shear terms in the boundary conditions is explored. A sample calculation of a monopole source shielded by a <b>planar</b> <b>wing</b> in a lifting flow is given. Shielding computations on the sample problem show that the effect of the wake on the simulated shielding are weak, with a small increase in the shielding in the sideline region when results were averaged over an octave. Further calculations demonstrated insensitivity to the removal of the shear terms and to the treatment of the wake truncation. It was found that the modelling of the jump in phase across the wake in the transformed acoustic potential was sufficient to capture the main effects of the wake on far-field shielding. I...|$|E
