Several versions of Ocarina of Time were produced, with later revisions featuring minor changes such as glitch repairs, the recoloring of Ganondorf's blood from crimson to green, and the alteration of the music heard in the Fire Temple dungeon to remove a sample of an Islamic prayer chant. The sample was taken from a commercially available sound library, but the developers did not realize it contained Islamic references.

5000|$|Damon {{eventually}} gave up {{acting in}} the mid-1970s to become a film producer.

His goal was to sell important American pictures to international distributors, the first such company to compete with the major studios. [...] Damon’s subsequent success with PSO led to his reputation as the inventor of the foreign sales business and the brains behind independent film production.

In 1925, the firm, renamed the Grey Advertising Agency, became a full-fledged advertising agency and differentiated itself from its competitors by using a team approach to advertising that closely worked with its customers and conducted extensive marketing research.

Stallone said, [...] "We are thinking about different concepts—the third one is the hardest. The second is the natural progression. The third, that's when the air gets rare.

40|$|The thesis {{will examine}} the {{development}} of legislation in Victoria controlling the practice of <b>pre-selling</b> real estate. Attention will {{be paid to the}} problems associated with uncontrolled <b>pre-selling</b> which became evident in the period 1960 - 1962. The effectiveness of the Sale of Land Act 1962 in dealing with <b>pre-selling</b> will be considered. Controls on <b>pre-selling</b> as are now contained in the Sale of Land Act 1962, the Strata Titles Act 1967, the Cluster Titles Act 1974 and which may be contained in the Companies (Victoria) Code 1981 will be analysed. The general contention of this thesis is that properly regulated <b>pre-selling</b> can {{play an important role in}} ensuring a more orderly and efficient property development industry. The present legislative controls are unduly restrictive and have only led property developers to seek artificial means of avoiding the controls and the present means of avoiding legislative restrictions will be considered at length.
