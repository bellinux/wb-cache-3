An interview conducted between Professor Joseph Camilleri and Bruce Kent - the latter a [...] "leading peace and disarmament advocate" [...] - was hosted on Ideapod.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} the Hamble Estuary Partnership, a local voluntary coastal stakeholder partnership that is focused on the coordinated management of a small estuary in the Solent. More specifically, the paper critically examines the relationship between the Hamble Estuary <b>Partnership</b> and Solent <b>Forum</b> in order to determine evidence of duplication or integration between the two partnerships. It was found that the aspirations and working principles of the two partnerships were consistent and the methods of working and focus of activity of each partnership were distinctive yet complementary. However, it was also found that evidence of vertical policy integration was limited. It was concluded that although the two-tier partnership model presented an opportunity to deliver vertically integrated policies in the Hamble estuary, this opportunity was yet to be fully realised.

40|$|This {{case study}} seeks to {{understand}} the scope of governance in addressing HIV/AIDS issues in Ethiopia by making use of HIV/AIDS <b>partnership</b> <b>forums</b> {{that exist in the}} country. All individuals representing the government sector, the NGO sector, the for profit sector and HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) both at the national level and in the three regions namely Oromia Region, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR) and Addis Ababa have been interviewed. Additional data were gathered using a PARTNER tool survey and also relevant documents have been analyzed. The social capital and governance theories create a framework where actors enjoy partnerships and use the benefits in both policy making and implementation. With the help of a problem tree and thematic analysis the study describes the causal effect relationship of the factors affecting partnerships and their ultimate consequence in maximizing social capital and governance. Accordingly, the thesis identifies the specific effects of the 2009 law on partnership endeavors in particular and HIV/AIDS policy implementation in general. Moreover, the study points out the existence of insufficient partnership in both decision making and policy implementation...|$|R

40|$|This article assesses {{socialization}} in the Eastern <b>Partnership</b> Civil Society <b>Forum,</b> an institutionalized {{civil society}} cooperation consisting of nongovernmental organizations from the European Union and the Eastern Partnership countries: Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The article argues that uniting {{the literature on}} socialization and on Eastern <b>Partnership</b> Civil Society <b>Forum</b> adds considerably to scholarly knowledge {{about the role of}} the institutionalized civil society in the world. The analysis of the activities of the Civil Society Forum shows that the conditions for socialization are largely fulfilled. We conclude that the organisation and functioning of the Eastern <b>Partnership</b> Civil Society <b>Forum</b> not only provides a passive framework for transmitting European values and norms, but also results in a middle degree of socialization between civil society organizations of the European Union and the Eastern Partnership countries. There is a large degree of internalization of European Union-sponsored norms and values among the participants of the Civil Society Forum: they fervently promote and defend such norms and values. The little-politicized environment in which discussions take place also allows civil society organisations to make ambitious statements, often more straightforward than political representatives (can) make...|$|R
