5|$|Reports {{emanating from}} World Rugby and its {{business}} <b>partners</b> <b>have</b> frequently touted the tournament's media growth, with cumulative worldwide television audiences of 300 {{million for the}} inaugural 1987 tournament, 1.75 billion in 1991, 2.67 billion in 1995, 3 billion in 1999, 3.5 billion in 2003, and 4 billion in 2007. The 4 billion figure was widely dismissed as the global audience for television {{is estimated to be}} about 4.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both <b>partners</b> <b>have</b> paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much time is spent on her interaction with the computer TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's <b>partners</b> <b>have</b> for Mario.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective <b>partners</b> <b>have</b> been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party {{will not be able}} to defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E

50|$|In {{conjunction}} with the financial problems, {{a large number of}} <b>partners</b> <b>had</b> been leaving in 2012. Of the approximate 1100 lawyers in the firm, about 190 were considered equity partners. In 2012 through May 12, approximately 200 of the 300 total <b>partners</b> <b>had</b> left the firm.|$|R
5|$|These {{characters}} also assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles, where damage inflicted {{against them}} results in temporary paralysis as the characters {{do not have}} individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game {{are similar to those}} in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his <b>partners</b> <b>have</b> a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up. There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulate in number as the player advances through the game. The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game's overworld, which promotes one partner character to a new rank at a time.|$|E
