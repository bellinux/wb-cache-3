40|$|Abstract. The {{majority}} of methods for <b>pollutant</b> <b>elimination</b> assume {{the flow of}} the polluted gas through the pollution control system. The system is made of various devices which have to be chosen based on the characteristics of the pollutant: aerosol, solid particles, droplets or gaseous. The chosen framework and facilities depend on the type of the pollutant: aerosol, solid particles, droplets or gaseous. There are a number of basic parameters which have to be considered in order to define air pollution control devices. This study represents a modeling of the named parameters which are related to the framework and facilities of air pollution control. In order to set the optimal parameters of a purification device, a deterministic model of the process of purification should be determined. Such a model is often difficult to construct, since physical and chemical characteristics of the source of pollution are not completely known. In this paper we propose a black-box modeling tool based on the application of an artificial neural network. Key words: Air pollution control, modeling, neural network 1...|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} performance of a top loading vertical flow submerged bed treatment system (TLVFSBTS) treating primary sewage effluent. Both <b>pollutant</b> <b>elimination</b> and microbial processes were measured. The wetland system is located just west of the Hudson River in upstate New York. The system consists of four 232 -m 2 wetland cells, currently operating in series. Two cells are planted with Phalaris arundineacea and two with Phragmites communis. The data collected were used to evaluate an existing mechanistic compartmental simulation model and to develop an new simulation model for TLVFSBTS wetlands. ^ Treating CBOD 5 to permit levels (3 ̆c 4 mg L- 1) was not difficult to accomplish and occurred in the first wetland cell during much of the study period. At no time during the 17 -month evaluation period did measurable CBOD 5 leave the wetland, although lack of carbon source (CBOD 5) for microorganisms in subsequent wetland cells (cells 3 and 4) may have been a limitation for denitrification.

40|$|Abstract Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are emerging}} pollutants widely distributed in aquatic environ-ment. Although the bioaccumulation of this compound {{has been well}} studied, few studies have investigated their im-pacts on antitoxic systems of invertebrates, considering both genders. Here, we have evaluated the effects of BDE- 47 and BDE- 99 congeners on the antitoxic defence systems of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex, and espe-cially on the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, {{as well as the}} activities of two antitoxic enzymes, the glu-tathione-S-transferase (GST) and the glutathione per-oxidases (GPx). Results revealed that BDE- 47 and BDE- 99 have inhibited the MXR activity whatever the gammarid gender, which could lead to a reduction of the <b>pollutant</b> <b>elimination</b> from the organism. In addition, a gender-biased response and a congener-biased effect on the antitoxic enzymes activities were observed. Indeed, both BDE con-gener exposures increased the GST activity in males, whereas in females, only BDE- 99 congener modified this activity by decreasing it. On the contrary, BDE exposures did not impact the GPx activity in females, while in males BDE- 99 has increased it. Results of the present study highlight that a PBDE exposure at 0. 1 lg L- 1 modify an-titoxic enzymes activities differently according to gender, which could lead to a change in G. pulex sensitivity on the long term. Finally, this work confirms the ecotoxicological implication of gender in the pollutant toxicity assessment, in order to evaluate impact on populations...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} self-organization behaviors {{in different types}} of multi-agent systems, and possible ways to apply interventions on top ofthat to achieve certain goals. A bounded confidence opinion dynamics modelis considered {{for the first two}} papers. Theoretical analysis of the model isperformed and modifications of the model are given so that it will have better properties in some aspect. Leader-follower based models are studied in the third to fifth papers where various optimal control problems are considered. Different methods such as Pontryagin minimum principle and dynamic programming are used to solve those optimal control problem. For complex problems, one may only get approximate solutions or suboptimal solutions. In Paper A and Paper B, we consider the continuous-time Hegselmann-Krause (H-K) model and its variations and target the problem of reaching consensus. A sufficient condition on the initial opinion distribution is givento guarantee consensus for the original continuous-time H-K model. A modified model is provided and proven to be able to lead a larger range of initial opinions to synchronization. An H-K model with an exo-system is also studied where sufficient conditions on the exo-system are given for the purpose of consensus. In Paper C and Paper D, optimal control problems with leader-followerbased multi-agent systems are discussed. Analytic solutions are derived if the dynamics is linear by applying Pontryagin minimum principle. For generalnon-linear leader-follower interactions, we provide a method that use sstatistic moments of the follower crowd to approximate the optimal control. The dynamic programming approach is used and certain approximation ofthe Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations is needed. The computational burdenis so heavy that model predictive control method is required in practical applications. In Paper E, we apply a similar method to the approach used in PaperD to target a <b>pollutant</b> <b>elimination</b> problem. It implies that we can use themethod to attack optimal control problem with partial differential equation constraints by discretization in space. The dimension of the discretization is not related to the computational complexity since only the statistic moments are needed. QC 20161201 </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary Saph Pani was an India-EU {{collaborative}} project {{with a duration}} of three years. The project aimed to improve natural water treatment systems such as bank filtration (BF), managed aquifer recharge (MAR) and natural treatment systems (NTS) for wastewater treatment (e. g. constructed wetlands) in India by building on a combination of local and international expertise. An enhancement of water resources and water supply, particularly in water stressed urban and peri-urban areas was targeted. The means to reach this impact was to strengthen the scientific understanding of the performance-determining processes occurring in the root, soil and aquifer zones of the relevant regions and consider the removal and fate of important water quality parameters such as pathogenic microorganisms and respective indicators, organic substances, nutrients and metals. The consortium studied the three technologies on a total of nine sites {{in different parts of the}} Indian sub-continent. A good understanding of bank filtration performance as a function of operation and design was established. The applicability of technology was extended through an assessment of flood risks and development of flood-proof designs and other measures. A survey of other existing sites broadened the experience base and allowed identification of potential new BF sites and the characteristics of such sites. Special attention was given to the polluted waters (nitrogen species) in Delhi and the adjoining aquifers, representative of the conditions in the Gangetic plain. The specific cost of production was determined to be less than 0. 1 €/m 3, a factor three lower than surface water abstraction followed by conventional treatment. Based on field results and modeling, MAR performance was reliably quantified, in particular for a percolation pond in a hard rock setting and a check dam in alluvial setting. Up to now limited data on MAR influence on quality was available and the project gave new insights, for example with regards to geogenic fluoride contamination, pathogen dieoff, organic <b>pollutant</b> <b>elimination</b> and dilution effects. A catchment with a natural peri-urban wetland was comprehensively described (hydrology, water quality) and modeled which gave new insights in the cleaning capacity and options for improvement of the situation of the local farmers. On the national scale a complete inventory of Indian public NTS for wastewater treatment was performed. 41 structures representing five different technologies (horizontal sub-surface flow constructed wetlands, duckweed ponds, waste stabilization ponds, polishing ponds and Karnal-type constructed wetlands) were analysed on-site. Also pilot constructed wetlands trials were performed and the knowledge gained will facilitate planning and designing of NTS structures for wastewater treatment including post-treatment to enhance potential for recycling and reuse. Current pre- and post-treatments for NTS in India and the critical water quality parameters of concern were determined. The partner knowledge base together with lab and field studies allowed us to derive recommendations for pre- and post-treatment options for different uses. Also, a matrix to select appropriate treatment was prepared based on data on cost and elimination capacity. It can be used by designers and planners for preliminary selection of NTSs and associated pre- and post-treatment systems. Human health risks, economical and institutional viability and social risk acceptance were assessed on selected project sites and recommendations and sustainable business models resulted. One example is NTS for wastewater treatment managed by local communities providing both irrigation water and fodder for cattle and thus allowing an increased income. The project resulted in around 30 articles in scientific journals and the Saph Pani Handbook presenting an overview of the most important findings and striking success stories of the project. Results were disseminated through a project website, newsletters, leaflets for the general public, 4 targeted courses, practitioner meetings and over 40 events, culminating with the Saph Pani final conference with attendance of the Indian Minister of Water Resources, over 100 invited scientists, senior level policy and decisionmakers and presentations also from other current EU-India projects on NTS.
