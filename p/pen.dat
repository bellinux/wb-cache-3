5|$|Jean-Marie Le <b>Pen</b> {{announced}} in September 2008 {{that he would}} retire as FN president in 2010. Le Pen's daughter Marine Le <b>Pen</b> and FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned for the presidency to succeed Le <b>Pen,</b> with Marine's candidacy backed by her father. On 15 January 2011, {{it was announced that}} Marine Le <b>Pen</b> had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN. She sought to transform the FN into a mainstream party by softening its xenophobic image. Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le <b>Pen,</b> and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008). However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats up for election.|$|E

5|$|By the Roman Period of Egypt, the {{traditional}} Egyptian reed <b>pen</b> {{had been replaced}} by the chief writing tool of the Greco-Roman world: a shorter, thicker reed <b>pen</b> with a cut nib. Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek lead-based inks. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian handwriting, as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.|$|E

5|$|For the 2007 presidential {{election}}, Le <b>Pen</b> and Mégret {{agreed to}} join forces. Le <b>Pen</b> came fourth in the election with 11% of the vote, and the party won no seats in the legislative election of the same year. The party's 4.3% support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate, Marine Le <b>Pen</b> in Pas de Calais, reached the runoff (where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent). These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party's financial problems. Le <b>Pen</b> announced {{the sale of the}} FN headquarters in Saint-Cloud, Le Paquebot, and of his personal armoured car. Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008. In the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re-emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12% of the overall vote and 118 seats.|$|E

5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 <b>pen.</b> Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a <b>pen</b> is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden <b>pen,</b> which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a <b>pen,</b> but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's <b>pen</b> to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
