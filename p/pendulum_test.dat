40|$|The {{development}} of mathematical models {{is essential for}} optimizing coal comminution processes such as crushing, grinding and pulverising operations {{in various stages of}} coal preparation. This requires a simple but accurate laboratory technique to determine the comminution characteristics of coal. To achieve this objective, a single particle breakage technique has been developed. A computer monitored twin pendulum apparatus was used to measure the energy available for the breakage of a particle, the comminution energy. The product size distributions from the <b>pendulum</b> <b>tests</b> conducted on a range of closely sized coal particles are described as a one parameter family of curves. This parameter is related to the specific comminution energy (kWh/tonne) measured in the <b>pendulum</b> <b>tests</b> and particle size effects are normalized in this relationship. This shows that coal particles of various sizes break in a similar manner. Further work to apply these coal comminution characteristics to industrial coal breakage processes is in progress...|$|R

50|$|The United Kingdom {{has since}} 1971 had {{well-established}} slip resistance standards {{based on the}} pendulum. This test was developed for pedestrian traction by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in the 1940s and further refined in the UK. It was validated for pedestrian traction in 1971, together with its safety standards, in the UK {{over a period of}} 25 years by 3500 real-world public walking area tests and site accident records. The test is an ASTM standard (E 303), slightly modified for pedestrian traction. The usual safety standard for a level floor is a minimum <b>Pendulum</b> <b>Test</b> Value (PTV) of 36. The pendulum is also the instrument used in the Sustainable Slip Resistance test method, which measures the possible impact of years of use on a potential flooring's slip resistance. The pendulum is also used in the U.S. and elsewhere for determining the slipperiness of roads and airport runways.|$|E
50|$|Typically, about 85 {{percent of}} the loss in slip {{resistance}} after 5000 cycles has already occurred after 500cycles. Depending on the flooring buyer’s situation, the flooring might be considered to have Sustainable Slip Resistance for a level floor if (for example) the wet <b>Pendulum</b> <b>Test</b> Value (PTV) is 35 or higher after abrasion for 500 cycles. The 500-cycle result in the laboratory has been found by in situ pendulum tests to be roughly equivalent to 6-12 months of wear in customer areas at a busy McDonald's Restaurant. The 500-cycle specification was adopted by McDonald’s in Australia in October 2006. Other major property owners such as Aldi, Toyota, Westfield and a major cruise ship company have adopted similar specifications. In the USA, flooring with SSR is available in ceramic tile, natural stone, and resilient products. Abrasive-containing coatings, some transparent, are also available that have SSR.|$|E

40|$|In the {{development}} process of automotive pedestrian protection (PedPro) for upper- and lower leg impact, the failure of polymer components plays an important role. To influence impact kinematics, fractures can either be advantageous or undesirable. Simulation based design is a challenge for material modeling and hence characterization, particularly for failure of polymer components. An application-oriented concept for failure modeling in FEM simulations of polymer components in pedestrian protection is presented. The boundary conditions for polymer failure in PedPro are investigated. Failure models are evaluated and selected by referring to special component tests, scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) of failure areas and simulative analysis of continuum mechanical parameters. The approach of capturing the material’s behavior and consecutive modeling including parametrization is presented as well. Here a polymer blend (PC-PET) is exemplarily characterized in the highly dynamic domain. This is mainly done by using innovative <b>pendulum</b> <b>tests.</b> The parametrization of a modified Bai-Wierzbicki failure approach is performed by a numerical optimization process.

Spasticity of the quadriceps femoris muscle can be quantified using the <b>pendulum</b> <b>test.</b> The measurement properties of pendular kinematics captured using a magnetic tracking system has not been studied among patients who have experienced a stroke. Therefore, this study describes the test-retest reliability and known groups and convergent validity of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>test</b> measures obtained with the Polhemus tracking system. Methods Eight patients with chronic stroke underwent pendulum tests with their affected and unaffected lower limbs, with and without {{the addition of a}} 2. 2 kg cuff weight at the ankle, using the Polhemus magnetic tracking system. Also measured bilaterally were knee resting angles, Ashworth scores (grades 0 – 4) of quadriceps femoris muscles, patellar tendon (knee jerk) reflexes (grades 0 – 4), and isometric knee extension force. Results Three measures obtained from pendular traces of the affected side were reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥. 844).

Main Outcome Measures: Root mean square (RMS) values of muscle activity and goniometric parameters, obtained during the <b>pendulum</b> <b>test</b> and passive knee flexion and extension, and Ashworth scores. - Results: RMS values of bursts of rectus femoris activity were significantly higher in the supine compared with the sitting position (P�. 006).
