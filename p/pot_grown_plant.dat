40|$|Context: In {{order to}} control weeds many {{chemicals}} {{are being used}} which may change the morphological and cytological constitution of plant. Objectives: To study the morphological and cytological effects of herbicides on tetraploid wheat. Materials and Methods: Two herbicides namely, Topstar and Fielder with three different concentrations of each were used along with control in the present study. Seeds of tetraploid wheat were treated for 6 hours with each concentration {{and some of the}} treated seeds were allowed to germinate in the petri dishes, while some were sown in the earthen pot. Morphological study was done for both laboratory and pot grown plants. In case of cytological study, mitotic data was recorded using the root tip cells and meiotic data was collected from inflorescence at pre-mature stage of <b>pot</b> <b>grown</b> <b>plant.</b> Results: In this experiment, data on morphological study such as germination percentage, days required in germination, coleoptile length, root length, plant height, ear length, tiller-number/pot, seed/ear, grain-weight/ear and 100 grain-weight indicated that treatment with Fielder decreased these characters with the increase of doses.

40|$|Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) is a European {{biennial}} herb that is invasive in North America, {{where it}} can impact native plant and microbial populations. In North America, this plant has both escaped European specialist herbivores, and is substantially resistant to North American mustard specialist and generalist herbivores. The powdery mildew fungus, Erysiphe cruciferarum, will infect garlic mustard {{in the field in}} North America, {{where it can}} strongly inhibit growth and reproduction. Here, we show that garlic mustard infected with powdery mildew also becomes a much weaker competitor with Impatiens pallida, a North American annual herb that co-occurs with garlic mustard in the field. In <b>pot</b> <b>grown</b> <b>plants</b> in the greenhouse, garlic mustard suppressed the growth of Impatiens in the absence of powdery mildew infection. In the presence of infection, Impatiens strongly suppressed garlic mustard. In addition, the presence of mycorrhizal inoculum altered the competitive relationships of Impatiens and garlic mustard and affected the response of Impatiens to mildew infection of competing garlic mustard plants. Impatiens plants transplanted near infected garlic mustard in the field grew substantially larger than transplants placed near healthy garlic mustard. This study reveals that powdery mildew infection of garlic mustard should substantially reduce its competitive impact on native plants in the field, and that healthy mycorrhizal populations will modulate the impact of garlic mustard. Along with specialist herbivores, powdery mildew is present in Europe where garlic mustard is native and may contribute to the regulation of its populations, an effect that may eventually be seen in North America...|$|R
40|$|This {{second volume}} {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the direct measurement techniques of evapotranspiration with related applications to the water use optimization in the agricultural practice and to the ecosystems study. The measurements are necessary to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of ET and to refine the modeling tools. Besides the basic concepts, examples of applications of the different measuring techniques at leaf level (porometry), at plant-level (sap-flow, lysimetry) and agro-ecosystem level (Surface Renewal, Eddy Covariance, Multi layer BREB) are illustrated in detail. The agricultural practice requires a careful management of water resources, especially in the areas where water is naturally scarce. The detailed knowledge of the transpiration demands of crops and different cultivars, as well as the testing of new irrigation techniques and schemes, allows the optimization of the water consumptions. Besides some basic concepts, the results of different experimental irrigation techniques in semi-arid areas (e. g. subsurface drip) and optimization of irrigation schemes for different crops in open-field, greenhouse and <b>potted</b> <b>grown</b> <b>plants</b> are presented.

40|$|AbstractPotato is {{the third}} most {{important}} food crop in the world after rice and wheat. Because of its widely distributed cultivation and high yields, it is considered a critical species in terms of food security in face of a growing world population. However, potato is particularly vulnerable to high temperature during various stages of its life cycle. Elevated temperatures strongly suppress tuberization, negatively affect storage and shelf life of tubers and reduce fitness of seed potatoes. Breeding new heat-stress tolerant cultivars is therefore an urgent need for sustainable increases in potato production. To achieve this goal an integrated approach combining physiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics is followed to analyze the impact of elevated temperatures on source-sink relations of potato plants, potato tuber development, starch accumulation and tuber quality and tuber dormancy. First results indicate that heat effects source-sink relations by altered expression of the tuber inducing signal FT, by stimulating shade-avoidance responses of the shoot and by decreasing sink-strength of developing tubers. Sink strength of growing potato tubers is mainly regulated by the activity of sucrose synthase. Measuring sucrose synthase expression and activity of heat grown potato tubers revealed a significant down-regulation of the enzyme {{which is consistent with}} reduced tuber growth. Interestingly, genetic variation in the activity of sucrose synthase exists, potentially enabling selection of potato varieties with heat-tolerant sucrose synthase isoforms. Although FT seems {{to play a major role}} in regulating tuberization, sink-derived and additional source signals are likely to be involved in orchestrating the heat-induced shift in assimilate allocation. This assumption is based on experiments in which soil and air temperatures of <b>pot</b> <b>grown</b> potato <b>plants</b> were independently controlled in growth chambers and transcript as well as sugar and enzyme profiles were recorded. Results of this analysis and their implication to improve heat tolerance of potato plants will be discussed...|$|R

Determined on the basis of synchrony within each flower, the level of pollination by pollen originating from other flowers reached approximately 30 % and did not change throughout the duration of flowering.

To establish the model parameters, an experiment was conducted for sixteen weeks inside a greenhouse with ornamental plants (New Guinea Impatiens) grown in containers on shelves. Well-watered and water restriction conditions were applied. The peat matric potential, radiation, temperature and humidity were continuously recorded, while Rs was measured and transpiration was assessed every half-hour from 8 : 00 am to 8 : 00 pm 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 weeks after planting. The resulting model was first validated against experimental measurements during the twelfth week of the experiment. It displayed good correlations for both the instantaneous data and integrated total transpiration. Different scenarios of irrigation reduction (frequency x volume) were tested and the results indicated real potential for water use reduction. Indeed, by reducing water application by 50 % and by applying one irrigation per day, transpiration was not affecte...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Self-pollination dominates in wheat, {{with a small}} {{level of}} {{out-crossing}} due to flowering asynchrony and male sterility. However, the timing and synchrony {{of male and female}} flowering in wheat is a crucial determinant of seed set and may be an important factor affecting gene flow and resilience to climate change. Here, a methodology is presented for assessing the timing and synchrony of flowering in wheat, Triticum aestivum. Methods From the onset of flowering until the end of anthesis, the anther and stigma activity of each floret was assessed on the first five developing ears in <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> <b>grown</b> under ambient conditions and originating from ?Paragon? or ?Spark-Rialto? backgrounds. At harvest maturity, seed presence, size and weight was recorded for each floret scored. Key Results and Conclusions The synchrony between pollen dehiscence and stigma collapse within a flower was dependent on its relative position in a spike and within a floret. Determined on the basis of synchrony within each flower, the level of pollination by pollen originating from other flowers reached approx. 30 % and did not change throughout the duration of flowering. A modelling exercise parameterized by flowering observations indicated that the temporal and spatial variability of anther activity within and between spikes may influence the relative resilience of wheat to sudden, extreme climatic events which has direct relevance to predicted future climate scenarios in the UK.

40|$|Rhizomania, {{caused by}} the beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV), is a world-wide problem for sugar beet production. Although rhizomania was first detected in sugar beet in the northern Italian Po Valley, wild beet on the Adriatic coast near the Po estuary show no virus infection under natural conditions. Our aim was to exa-mine whether this absence of virus infection is caused by endogenous wild beet resistance or by the saline soil conditions of coastal habitats. Greenhouse experiments were carried out with <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> <b>grown</b> from coastal seed and with a BNYVV-susceptible sugar beet variety as control. The <b>plants</b> were <b>grown</b> in highly BNYVV in-fested soil. To simulate saline conditions, the pots were periodically irrigated with sea salt solutions of two dif-ferent concentrations or with tap water as a control. The BNYVV levels in the plant were measured by ELI-SA. Without salt, a range of tolerances to BNYVV was observed in plants derived from different coastal popu-lations. One population was highly virus resistant, two were more heterogeneous and three populations were highly susceptible. In the presence of salt the data showed a significant reduction {{of the number of}} infec-ted plants. These results indicate that the absence of vi-rus in wild beet populations is mainly due to the saline soil conditions in coastal habitats. This phenomenon will be important for the biosafety assessment of gene flow of BNYVV resistance genes from transgenic sugar beet to wild beet populations in coastal habitats...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePredictive {{models of}} soil-plant-atmosphere water {{transfers}} {{may be helpful}} to better manage water inputs to plants in greenhouses. In particular, Computational Fluid Dynamics appears to be a powerful tool to describe the greenhouse microclimate and plant behavior. Up until now, most models for <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> <b>grown</b> in greenhouses were established for well-watered conditions. In this context, the aim of this work is to develop a specific submodel to simulate the distributed transpiration and microclimate during <b>plants</b> <b>grown</b> in <b>pots</b> inside greenhouses under water restriction conditions. A 2 D transient CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) model was implemented and user-defined functions were adapted to take account of the crop interactions with the climate inside the greenhouse. The crop was considered as a porous medium and specific source terms for transpiration and sensible heat transfers were added. A specific submodel was also implemented to calculate the substrate water content based on the water balance between irrigation and transpiration. Particular care was paid to the modeling of stomatal resistance. In order to obtain the input data and to validate the CFD simulations, an experiment was conducted over 16 weeks inside a greenhouse equipped with New Guinea impatiens ornamental <b>plants</b> <b>grown</b> in containers on shelves. Both well-watered and restriction conditions were analyzed. The results of the CFD simulations showed the ability of the model to correctly predict transpiration, air and leaf temperatures as well as air humidity inside the greenhouse for both water regimes. Different irrigation scenarios were then tested, progressively reducing the water supply by providing a lesser amount of water than the growing media water capacity. The simulations made it possible to assess the model response to different irrigation regimes on plant transpiration, usual growing media water potential and climate distribution inside the greenhouse. The tests also showed that the water supply could be reduced by 20 % without significantly impacting the transpiration rate and, therefore, potential plant growth. The CFD model could thus be useful to test different irrigation scenarios and better manage water inputs...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} is {{an effective}} method to estimate the levels of air pollutant {{and their impact on}} biological receptors. The aim of this work is to test the different capability to accumulate heavy metals of two kind of vegetables, a Spermatophyta and a Tallophyta, The plant species are: Parmelia caperata (L.) Ach. and Parmotrema chinense (Osbeck) Hale & Ahti, two foliose epiphytic lichens, and Nerium oleander L., an urban ornamental shrubs diffusely utilized in parks, gardens and along the roads. The lichen samples with their substrate bark were collected in the Forestal reserve of the Park of Vesuvio (“unpolluted site”); <b>pot</b> <b>grown</b> Nerium oleander <b>plants</b> came from the Botanical garden of the Facoltà of Agraria in Portici (Naples). The samples were exposed in four sites localized in the urban area of Portici, a densely populated town near Naples with very heavy road traffic. The first sampling was carried out after 15 days from exposition, the other 3 sampling were carried out at 1 month intervals. The samples were air-dried in the laboratory, ground to a fine powder, digested in mixed acid solution and analysed by ICP for determination of the total concentration of Fe, Zn, Cu and Pb. Our data suggest that: 1) Starting from the first sampling, the lichen species show a remarkable increase in the measured concentration of all tested pollutants. This confirm previous reports by other authors. The heavy metal concentrations in the last sampling were three to five times higher than the starting values. 2) The leaves of oleander show a lower increase in heavy metals laid down upon their surface; however, during the time of exposition to pollutant, this amount increased proportionally to what are measured in the lichens. Both lichens and leaves, show a direct correspondance between road traffic level in the different sites and heavy metal concentration. Our data confirm the higher capability of the lichens to accumulate pollutants for their morphological and physiological characteristics, but they put forward the possibility to consider oleander as a bioindicator too...|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinct}} {{advantage of}} aeroponics over hydroponics {{is that any}} species of <b>plants</b> can be <b>grown</b> in a true aeroponic system because the micro environment of an aeroponic can be finely controlled. The limitation of hydroponics is that only certain species of plants can survive for so long in water before they become waterlogged. The advantage of aeroponics is that suspended aeroponic plants receive 100% of the available oxygen and carbon dioxide to the roots zone, stems, and leaves, thus accelerating biomass growth and reducing rooting times. NASA {{research has shown that}} aeroponically <b>grown</b> <b>plants</b> have an 80% increase in dry weight biomass (essential minerals) compared to hydroponically <b>grown</b> <b>plants.</b> Aeroponics used 65% less water than hydroponics. NASA also concluded that aeroponically <b>grown</b> <b>plants</b> requires ¼ the nutrient input compared to hydroponics. Unlike hydroponically <b>grown</b> <b>plants,</b> aeroponically <b>grown</b> <b>plants</b> will not suffer transplant shock when transplanted to soil, and offers growers the ability to reduce the spread of disease and pathogens.Aeroponics is also widely used in laboratory studies of plant physiology and plant pathology. Aeroponic techniques have been given special attention from NASA since a mist is easier to handle than a liquid in a zero-gravity environment.|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of the bleeding sap N of Phaseolus vulgaris varied with the inorganic nitrogen source fed to the plant but was not changed by a fourfold difference in external nitrate concentration. Highest sap N concentration and fastest growth were observed in ammonium nitrate <b>grown</b> <b>plants.</b> With nitrate <b>grown</b> <b>plants</b> 60 % of the total sap N was inorganic nitrate-N and 40 % organic-N whereas with ammonium nitrate <b>grown</b> <b>plants</b> nitrate contributed 30 % to the total N and organic-N 70 %.
