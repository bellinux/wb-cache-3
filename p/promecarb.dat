40|$|Different surfactant-modified solid sorbents {{have been}} {{comparatively}} investigated for retention of carbamate pesticides in aqueous solution. Three modified-sorbents, including {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) treated alumina, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) coated silica and CTAB coated zeolite, were created using different surfactant concentrations. The studied carbamate pesticides including oxamyl, methomyl, aldicarb, carbofuran, carbaryl, isoprocarb, methiocarb, <b>promecarb</b> and carbosulfan were analyzed by HPLC/UV. Adsorption of all carbamate pesticides (concentration range between 0. 5 - 5. 0 mg L- 1) onto surfactant-modified sorbents followed linear regressions with the correlation coefficients {{in the range of}} 0. 857 - 0. 995. CTAB-modified zeolite showed high uptake values for carbofuran, carbaryl, methiocarb and carbosulfan. SDS-modified alumina demonstrated high uptake values for carbaryl, isoprocarb, methiocarb, <b>promecarb</b> and carbosulfan. CTAB-modified silica gave high uptake values for methiocarb, <b>promecarb</b> and carbosulfan. Desorption of carbamate pesticides from surfactant-modified sorbents using methanol were better than that obtained from unmodified sorbents. The study clearly proved that the surfactant-modified sorbents are effective for carbamate pesticides extraction...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of salt additive on cloud point extraction (CPE) of isoprocarb and <b>promecarb</b> insecticides is described. Types of salt (Na 2 CO 3, CaCl 2, MgSO 4, Na 2 SO 4, NaHCO 3 and NaCl) and concentra-tions were studied. The extracted target compounds {{were analyzed using}} reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the salts studied, Na 2 CO 3 {{was found to be}} the most effect-ive salt for salting out of both insecticides, resulting in high extrac-tion efficiency (> 95 %) and high enrichment factor of up to 18 compared to extraction without preconcentration. The optimum CPE conditions were 1. 5 % (w/v) Triton X- 114, 3. 0 % (w/v) Na 2 CO 3, and 20 -min equilibration at 458 C. Under the selected conditions, the linear range of 0. 05 to 3. 0 mg/L was found for both analytes. The limits of detection for isoprocarb and <b>promecarb</b> were 10 and 20 mg/L, re-spectively. High intra-day (n 5 9) and inter-day (n 5 33 4 days) pre-cisions with relative standard deviations 80 %, on average) for spiked samples at three levels (0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 50 mg/L) ...|$|E
