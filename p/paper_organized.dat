40|$|Abstract. We use Prolog as a {{flexible}} meta-language to provide ex-ecutable specifications of some fundamental mathematical objects and their transformations. In the process, isomorphisms are unraveled be-tween natural numbers and combinatorial objects (rooted ordered trees representing hereditarily finite sequences and rooted ordered binary trees representing Gödel’s System T types). This paper focuses on an application {{that can be}} seen as an unex-pected “paradigm shift”: we provide recursive definitions showing that the resulting representations are directly usable to perform symbolically arbitrary-length integer computations. Besides the theoretically interesting fact of “breaking the arithmetic/sym-bolic barrier”, the arithmetic operations performed with symbolic objects like trees or types turn out to be genuinely efficient – we derive implemen-tations with asymptotic performance comparable to ordinary bitstring implementations of arbitrary-length integer arithmetic.
