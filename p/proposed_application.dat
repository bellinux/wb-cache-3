2500|$|Yet another <b>proposed</b> <b>application</b> of MNT {{would be}} phased-array optics (PAO). [...] However, {{this appears to}} be a problem {{addressable}} by ordinary nanoscale technology. PAO would use the principle of phased-array millimeter technology but at optical wavelengths. [...] This would permit the duplication of any sort of optical effect but virtually. [...] Users could request holograms, sunrises and sunsets, or floating lasers as the mood strikes. [...] PAO systems were described in BC Crandall's Nanotechnology: [...] Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance in the Brian Wowk article [...] "Phased-Array Optics." ...|$|E
2500|$|One <b>proposed</b> <b>application</b> of MNT is {{so-called}} smart materials. [...] This term {{refers to}} {{any sort of}} material designed and engineered at the nanometer scale for a specific task. It encompasses {{a wide variety of}} possible commercial applications. [...] One example would be materials designed to respond differently to various molecules; such a capability could lead, for example, to artificial drugs which would recognize and render inert specific viruses. [...] Another is the idea of self-healing structures, which would repair small tears in a surface naturally {{in the same way as}} self-sealing tires or human skin.|$|E

In {{regard to}} {{the first of these}} transactions, we readily conceive, that, in the then state of the Council, the Governor-General might be induced to {{temporary}} secrecy respecting the members of the board, not only because he might be apprehensive of opposition to the <b>proposed</b> <b>application</b> of the money, but, perhaps, because doubts might have arisen concerning the propriety of appropriating it to the Company's use on any account; but it does not appear to us that there could be any real necessity for delaying to communicate to us immediate information of the channel by which the money came into his possession, with a complete illustration of the cause or causes of so extraordinary an event.|$|E
6000|$|The Directors {{appear to}} have been deceived by this representation, and in their letter of January, 1782,[18] {{consider}} the money as actually paid into their Treasury. Even under their error concerning the application of the money, they appear rather alarmed than satisfied with the brief apology of the Governor-General. They consider the whole proceeding as extraordinary and mysterious. They, however, do not condemn it with any remarkable asperity; after admitting that he might be induced to a temporary secrecy respecting the members of the board, from a fear of their resisting the <b>proposed</b> <b>application,</b> or any application of this money to the Company's use, yet they write to the Governor-General and Council as follows:--"It does not appear to us that there could be any real necessity for delaying to communicate to us immediate information of the channel by which the money came into Mr. Hastings's possession, with a complete illustration of the cause or causes of so extraordinary an event." [...] And again: [...] "The means proposed of defraying the extra expenses are very extraordinary; and the money, we conceive, must have come into his hands by an unusual channel; and when more complete information comes before us, we shall give our sentiments fully on the transaction." [...] And speaking of this and other moneys under a similar description, they say, [...] "We shall suspend our judgment, without approving it in the least degree, or proceeding to censure our Governor-General for this transaction." [...] The expectations entertained by the Directors of a more complete explanation were natural, and their expression tender and temperate. But the more complete information which they naturally expected they never have to this day received.|$|E
